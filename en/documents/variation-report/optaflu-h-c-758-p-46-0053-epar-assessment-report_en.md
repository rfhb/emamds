## 1. Introduction

On 31 December 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Optaflu, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. It concerns the CSR for study V58P15.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Information on the development program The MAH stated that V58P15 - A Phase III, Observer-Blind, Randomized Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety of Trivalent Subunit Influenza Vaccines, Produced Either in Mammalian Cell Culture (TIVc) or  in  Embryonated  Eggs  (TIV),  in  Children  and  Adolescents  3  to  &lt;  18  Years  of  Age  at  Risk  for Influenza-Related Complications is part of a clinical development program. It should be noted that the Optaflu PIP (EMEA 000124-PIP01-07-M02) is currently on hold (please refer to http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en\\_GB/document\\_library/Other/2013/10/WC500151670.pdf. 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Not applicable. 2.3. Clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction Annual  influenza  epidemics  are  associated  with  substantial  morbidity  and  mortality,  especially  in elderly and in those with underlying diseases. Although in healthy adults clinical influenza infections generally have an uncomplicated course, it may have a substantial economic impact, e.g. due to days lost from work. Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at high risk for serious complications from influenza. The  main  objective  of  influenza  vaccination  in  elderly  is  reducing  the  number  of  deaths  caused  by influenza  infections.  In  younger  populations,  influenza  associated  morbidity  is  more  important  than mortality risk, especially in those at good health. Trivalent influenza vaccines contain an A/H3N2, an A/H1N1 and a B strain component. The selection of the A and B influenza virus strains for the vaccines is based on the annual WHO  and  Committee  for  Human  Medicinal  Products  (CHMP)  strain recommendations. These viruses are the predominant strains most appropriate to the epidemiological situation in each hemisphere. Since their development, inactivated influenza vaccines have been produced in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hen eggs. However, the efficiency of the method is low, requiring one or more eggs for each dose of the vaccine produced. The use of mammalian cell lines eliminates the reliance on the supply of embryonated eggs and generates more flexibility, adequate availability of substrate for virus growth and the possibility of higher virus yields. In addition, the cell culture-derived vaccines do not require  extensive  advance  planning  and  can,  in  principle,  be  vital  in  responding  to  the  threat  of  an emerging pandemic.

The  MAH  has  developed  a  cell-derived,  trivalent,  surface  antigen,  inactivated  influenza  vaccine (Optaflu, referred to as TIVc throughout this document) produced in the mammalian cell line Madin Darby  Canine  Kidney  (MDCK).  Optaflu  is  currently  registered  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for prophylaxis  of  influenza  for  adults,  especially  in  those  who  run  an  increased  risk  of  associated complications and should be used in accordance to official guidance.

The present study is part of the approved EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Optaflu (EMEA000124-PIP01-07-M02;  currently  on  hold  upon  request  of  the  MAH,  until  testing  in  the  pediatric

population can be conducted with the MAH's Quadrivalent cell culture influenza vaccine that is under development).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study V58P15: A Phase III, Observer-Blind, Randomized Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety of Trivalent  Subunit  Influenza  Vaccines,  Produced  Either  in  Mammalian  Cell  Culture  (TIVc)  or  in Embryonated Eggs (TIV), in Children and Adolescents 3 to &lt; 18 Years of Age at Risk for InfluenzaRelated Complications.

Approximately 504 subjects were to be randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of TIVc or TIV according to age and seasonal influenza vaccination status. Assuming that about 10% of the subjects were to be nonevaluable (due to loss of follow-up or protocol deviations, etc.), 450 subjects (300 receiving TIVc and 150 receiving TIV) were to be evaluable for safety. For a sample size of 300 subjects exposed to the TIVc, the probability of observing at least 1 AE will be 95% when the rate of the event is 0.010 (1 in 100), while among the 450 subjects exposed to any of the 2 study vaccines, it will be 99%.

Conducted in 16 centers in 2 countries: 12 sites in Spain and 4 sites in Italy. Study period: 25 October 2013 till 31 July 2014. Description Methods Objective(s) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 1 or 2 intramuscular doses (administered 4 weeks apart) of, either the cell culture-derived influenza vaccine (TIVc) or the egg-derived influenza vaccine (TIV) in children and adolescents 3 to &lt;18 years of age, at risk for influenza-related complications. Study design This  phase  3,  randomized,  observer  blind,  multicenter  study  was  performed  over  a  period  of approximately 6 to 7 months. Approximately 504 children and adolescents (3 to &lt; 18 years of age) at risk for influenza related complications were planned to be enrolled in the study. MDCK TIVc (Lot number 035011C) contained the purified viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), derived from 3 strains (including approximately 15 μg of HA for each strain  [A/Brisbane/10/2010  (H1N1)  virus  antigen,  A/Texas/50/2012  (H3N2)  virus  antigen,  and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 virus  antigen])  as  recommended  by  the  WHO  for  the  2013-2014  influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. Conventional TIV (Lot number IA 132002) contained the purified viral envelope glycoproteins, HA and NA, derived from 3 strains (including approximately 15 μg of HA for each strain [A/California/07/2009 NYMC  X-181  (H1N1)  virus  antigen,  A/Texas/50/2012  NYMC  X-223  (H3N2)  virus  antigen,  and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 wt virus antigen]) as recommended by the WHO for the 2013-2014 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. Study population /Sample size Study population: Individuals were males and females 3 to &lt; 18 years of age at the time of enrollment who were at high risk for influenza-related complications. Children were identified as being at risk for influenza-related complications based on confirmed documented medical history of diseases such as endocrine disorders, chronic  cardiovascular  diseases,  chronic  pulmonary  diseases,  chronic  renal  or  hepatic  diseases, neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, blood disorders, metabolic disorders, weak immune system, children who received long term aspirin therapy or obesity. Sample size: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  sample  size  of  this  study  is  also  based  on  the  PIP  commitment  (in  accordance  with  the EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006  guideline),  to  establish  a  total  safety  database  of  300  at  risk  for influenza related complications subjects, 6 months to &lt; 18 years of age, that received the TIVc. This study  with  subjects  3  to  &lt;  18  years  of  age  was  meant  to  contribute  at  least  150  and  75  subjects exposed to TIVc and TIV respectively.

## Treatments

Eligible subjects were enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either TIVc or TIV, stratified by age (3 to &lt; 9 years of age and 9 to &lt; 18 years of age) and by previous influenza vaccination status ('previously vaccinated' was defined as any child under 9 years of age who had since 2010 received 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine (group 2); children and adolescents 9 to &lt;18 years of age were considered 'previously vaccinated' by default (group 1); 'previously not vaccinated' was defined as any child under 9 years of age who does not meet the conditions for 'previously vaccinated' (group 3)). The full vaccination course consisted of either one 0.5 mL dose (groups 1 and 2) of TIVc or TIV on day 1, or two 0.5 mL doses (group 3) of TIVc or TIV administered 4 weeks apart on days 1 and 29. For each subject in groups 1 and 2, study participation comprised a total of 3 clinic visits, 2 reminder calls,  and  4  safety  calls  through  a  treatment  period  and  a  follow-up  period  (subject ' s  total participation time was approximately 6 months). · Treatment period (day 1 through day 29): two clinic visits and 2 reminder calls. · Follow-up period (day 30 through day 181): one clinic visit and 4 safety calls. For each subject in group 3, study participation comprised a total of 4 clinic visits, 4 reminder calls, and 4 safety calls through a treatment period and a follow-up period (subject ' s  total  participation time was approximately 7 months). · Treatment period (day 1 through day 57): three clinic visits and four reminder calls. · Follow-up period (day 58 through day 209): one clinic visit and four safety calls. All unsolicited AEs were summarized according to medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA, Version 17.0) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within SOC. Outcomes/endpoints The primary endpoint for this study is safety. There are no secondary or other endpoints. The measures for assessing safety and tolerability are as follows: · Proportion of subjects reporting solicited AEs, including local and systemic and other solicited AEs · Proportion of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs · Proportion of subjects reporting SAEs, NOCDs, medically attended AEs, and AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal, collected for the whole study Statistical Methods Evaluation of the safety endpoints was of descriptive nature without prespecified criteria. Results Recruitment/ Number analysed Out of 504 planned, a total of 430 subjects were enrolled (282 subjects in the TIVc and 148 subjects in the TIV group) in this study. Table 9.1-1 provides the planned and actual number of subjects enrolled in the study per age category per seasonal influenza vaccination status. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Four subjects were enrolled in the study but did not receive study vaccination, they were excluded from the safety sets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

415 subjects completed the study (272 from the TIVc group and 143 from the TIV group. Ten subjects from the TIVc and 5 subjects from the TIV group were prematurely withdrawn from the study. The common reasons for  premature  withdrawals  were  withdrawal  of  consent  and  subjects  being  lost  to follow up. No safety related reason was reported.

Table 9.1-1 Number of Subjects Planned and Emrolled as per Vaccine

CHMP's comment: The number of subjects enrolled in the present study was lower than planned (430 enrolled vs 504 planned), due to late availability of vaccine and unforeseen reluctance of subjects to participate in the trial.  It  was  however  enough  to  reach  the  MAH's  goal  to  contribute  at  least  150  and  75  subjects exposed to TIVc and TIV respectively, in order to establish a total safety database of 300 at risk for influenza  related  complications  subjects,  6  months  to  &lt;  18  years  of  age,  that  received  TIVc. Differences in events that occur in 4% or more of the population can be detected with the enrolled sample size. Baseline data Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable in both vaccine groups (TIVc and TIV). The average age of the subjects at study entry in TIVc group was 8.7 ± 4.0 years and 9.0 ± 3.9 years in TIV group. Most of the enrolled subjects were from Spain and were of White origin in both vaccine groups. All subjects enrolled met the entry criteria (Table 11.2-1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of  the  total  430  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study,  426  subjects  (278  subjects  received  TIVc  and  148 subjects received TIV) were exposed to at least 1 study vaccination and were considered for safety analysis.

CHMP's comment: Overall the baseline characteristics of the two vaccine groups were similar. Except for the 3 to &lt; 9 years age group in the TIVc group, where more children were not previously vaccinated (30% vs 19% previously vaccinated). In the TIV group this was more balanced (26% vs 24%). As the number of subjects in the 3 to &lt;9 years, previously vaccinated group (n=54) is still sufficient, this most likely will not  impact the  results of  the  study.  Moreover,  all  safety  data  is  presented  per  age  and  vaccination status subgroup so there is no bias in results due to this difference in vaccination status between the two vaccine groups.

## · Proportion of subjects reporting solicited AEs, including local and systemic and other solicited AEs

<!-- image -->

The percentage of subjects who reported any solicited AE in both the TIVc and TIV group was 73%. Percentages were higher after the first (TIVc: 70% [N = 277], TIV: 72% [N = 146]) than after the second vaccination (TIVc: 59% [N = 83], TIV: 53% [N = 40]) in both vaccine groups (Table 2.5.5-2). Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  by  59%  of  subjects  in  the  TIVc  and  62%  of  subjects  in  the  TIV groups. Percentages of subjects who reported solicited systemic AEs were 46% in the TIVc and 40% in the TIV groups (Table 2.5.5-2). After the first vaccination, the percentages of subjects who reported solicited local AEs were 54% in the TIVc and 61% in the TIV groups and systemic AEs were reported for 42% of subjects in the TIVc and 38% of subjects in the TIV groups. After the second vaccination, the percentages of subjects who reported  solicited  local  AEs  were  49%  and  45%  in  the  TIVc  and  TIV  groups,  respectively.  The percentage of subjects who reported solicited systemic AEs after second vaccination was higher in the TIVc group (35%) than in the TIV group (20%) (Table 2.5.5-2). Analysis of solicited AEs by age group Subjects 3 to &lt; 6 years of age The  most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  AE  in  both  previously  vaccinated  and  previously  not vaccinated subjects 3 to &lt; 6 years of age in both vaccine groups was injection site tenderness. Two subjects, both previously vaccinated and in the TIV group, reported a severe solicited local AE; one subjects reported severe injection site erythema, one subject reported severe injection site induration (Table 12.2.3-1). The most commonly reported solicited systemic AE in both previously vaccinated and previously not vaccinated  subjects  3  to  &lt;  6  years  of  age  in  both  vaccine  groups  after  the  first  vaccination  was irritability, change in eating habits and fever. After the second vaccination subjects in the TIVc and TIV groups  reported  most  commonly  change  in  eating  habits,  sleepiness  and  irritability.  Two  previously vaccinated  subjects,  both  in  the  TIV  group,  and  one  previously  not  vaccinated  subject,  in  the  TIVc group,  reported  a  severe  solicited  systemic  AE;  two  subjects  reported  severe  chills,  one  subject reported severe irritability (Table 12.2.3-4).

## CHMP's comment:

In the previously not vaccinated 3 to &lt; 6 years age subgroup fever rates were 16% in the TIVc group compared to 0% in the TIV group after first vaccination. With second vaccination, the fever rates were 4% and 0% in these vaccine groups. Fever rates were similar between previously vaccinated vaccine groups (15% and 16% in the TIVc and TIV groups respectively). These differences are most likely due to the relatively small sample size.

Subjects 6 to &lt; 9 years of age The  most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  AE  in  both  previously  vaccinated  and  previously  not vaccinated  subjects  in  both  vaccine  groups  was  injection  site  pain.  One  previously  not  vaccinated subject, in the TIVc group, reported a severe solicited local AE; injection site pain after the second vaccination (Table 12.2.3-2). The most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, loss of appetite and fatigue. One subject, previously not vaccinated and in the TIVc group, reported a severe local systemic AE; severe myalgia after the second vaccination (Table 12.2.3-5).

Injection  site  erythema  and  ecchymosis  were  more  common  in  TIV  vaccinated  compared  to  TIVc vaccinated  subjects.  The  latter  group  reported  more  frequently  injection  site  pain.  More  solicited systemic AEs were reported in the TIVc compared with the TIV previously not vaccinated group (51% and 45% after injection 1 and 2 for TIVc vs 22% and 13% for TIV). Differences were most notably in chills, headache and fatigue, but interpretation of these results should be done with caution due to the small sample size.

The most commonly reported solicited local AE in both the TIVc and TIV group was injection site pain (53% and 65% of subjects, respectively). Nine subjects (4 subjects in TIVc group and 5 subjects in TIV group) reported severe solicited local AEs (Table 12.2.3-3).

The most commonly reported solicited systemic AE was headache, followed by myalgia and fatigue. Overall, 15 subjects (11 subjects in TIVc group and 4 subjects in TIV group) reported severe solicited systemic AEs (Table 12.2.3-6).

Overall, the most common solicited local AEs related to discomfort at the vaccination site in all age groups. The majority of the solicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity and they resolved within seven  days.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  body  temperature  of ≥ 40 ° C  in  either  the  TIVc  or  TIV treatment groups. Within the age and vaccination status subgroups, some differences in solicited local and  systemic  AEs  were  observed  between  the  vaccine  groups  but  a  consistent  pattern  was  not observed.

CHMP's comment: Severe injection site induration was more frequently reported by TIV vaccinated subjects compared with TIVc vaccinated subjects (7% vs 1%, respectively). Overall,  subgroup  analyses  by  gender  (male/female)  and  by  race/ethnicity  (white  [not  Hispanic  or Latino]/other)  did  not  show  any  meaningful  differences  in  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs after any vaccination between both vaccine groups.

## · Proportion of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs

Overall,  77%  of  subjects  in  the  TIVc  group  and  75%  of  subjects  in  the  TIV  group  reported  any unsolicited AE. Unsolicited AEs that were assessed as possibly or probably related to the study vaccine were reported by 16 subjects (6%) and 12 subjects (8%) in the TIVc and TIV groups, respectively (Table 2.5.5-4).

CHMP's comment: Although overall the percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs were similar in the TIVc and TIV groups, the percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs was higher in the younger age group (3 to &lt; 9) compared with the older age group (9 to &lt; 18). In both the TIVc and TIV treatment groups, during 28 day follow-up after each vaccination, the most commonly  affected  SOC  was  infections  and  infestations  reported  for  9%  and  16%  of  subjects, respectively, followed by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, general disorders and nervous system disorders (Table 12.2.3-7).

CHMP's comment: Irrespective of the specific vaccine, the percentage of subjects reporting any unsolicited AE was higher in the younger age group (3 to &lt; 9) compared with the older age group (9 to &lt; 18). More subjects in the  TIV  previously  vaccinated  3  to  &lt;9  group  reported  unsolicited  AEs  compared  with  the  TIVc previously  vaccinated  3  to  &lt;9  group  (57%  vs  33%,  respectively),  mostly  due  to  more  reports  of infections and infestations (34% vs 17%). In the gender and race subgroup analysis, no significant differences were observed between TIVc and TIV groups, in percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs after any vaccination. · Proportion of subjects reporting SAEs, NOCDs, medically attended AEs, and AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal, collected for the whole study In total, 16 subjects reported at least one SAE during the study (4% and 3% of subjects in the TIVc and  TIV  group,  respectively).  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  under  SOC  infection  and infestations for both the TIVc and the TIV treatment groups (2% and 1% of subjects, respectively).

SAEs, medically attended AEs, and  NOCD, were reported in similar percentages of subjects in both TIVc and TIV groups (Table 2.5.5-4). No subject was withdrawn from the study because of AEs and none of the reported SAEs was considered as possibly related to the study vaccines. No death was reported  in  any  treatment  group  during  the  study  period.  However,  one  4-year-old  (at  enrollment) white male subject (not previously vaccinated TIVc treatment group) died 2 weeks after his last study visit. The death was assessed as not related to the study vaccine. Overall safety CHMP's comment: Within the age and vaccination status subgroups, some differences in AEs were observed between TIVc and TIV. As no consistent pattern could be observed these differences are most likely due to small sample size and may not be clinically relevant. The safety results are in line with the currently known safety profile of TIVc and no new safety signals were identified.  It  is  agreed  that  the  SAEs  were  considered  not  possibly  or  probably  related  to  the study vaccines. Note: 39 subjects were vaccinated with a study vaccine which was stored with inadequate temperature recording.  For  this  reason,  a  robustness  analysis  was  performed,  excluding  the  39  subjects.  The percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  solicited  and  unsolicited  AEs  in  the  combined  TIVc  and  TIV treatment  groups  without  the  39  subjects  was  comparable  to  the  percentage  that  included  the  39 subjects. Therefore, excluding the subjects who received vaccine that had been inappropriately stored had no effect on the overall analysis for the total group. 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study described the safety and tolerability of one or two doses (administered 4 weeks apart) of TIVc  and  TIV  in  children  and  adolescents  3  to  &lt;  18  years  of  age  at  risk  for  influenza-related complications. Immunogenicity was not assessed in this study.

Overall the TIVc and TIV vaccines were well-tolerated. Most solicited and unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and transient in nature, most resolved within 7 days after vaccination. None of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  AEs  and  none  of  the  reported  SAEs  were considered related to the study vaccines.

Discomfort at the vaccination site was the commonest solicited local AE with few being in the severe category.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  body  temperature  of ≥ 40 ° C  in  either  the  TIVc  or  TIV treatment groups. Within the age and vaccination status subgroups, some differences in solicited local and  systemic  AEs  were  observed  between  the  vaccine  groups,  but  a  consistent  pattern  was  not observed. These differences are most likely due to the relatively small sample size of the study and may not be medically significant.

As also mentioned in the previous Article 46 submission for Optaflu (EMEA/H/C/000758), it is noted that  the  current  SmPC  states  that  no  data  in  the  paediatric  population  is  available.  The  MAH  is requested to provide a proposal for a sentence under the relevant section in 5.1, stating the availability and relevance of the limited data obtained in the paediatric population so far, including both the results from study V58\\_31 in healthy children and the results from the present study in children at risk for influenza-related complications.

Percentages of subjects reporting any unsolicited AE was higher in the younger age group (3 to &lt; 9) compared with the older age group (9 to &lt; 18). The most commonly affected SOC for unsolicited AEs during the 28 days following each vaccination was infections and infestations. More subjects in the TIV previously  vaccinated  3  to  &lt;9  group  reported  unsolicited  AEs  compared  with  the  TIVc  previously vaccinated 3 to &lt;9 group (57% vs 33%, respectively), mostly due to more reports of infections and infestations  (34%  vs  17%).  However,  again  these  differences  are  most  likely  due  to  the  relatively small sample size of the study and may not be medically significant. Of note, the MAH recently also submitted the results of study V58\\_31, evaluating the safety profile of TIVc  (Optaflu)  and  TIVf  (Fluvirin)  in  healthy  children  and  adolescents  ≥4  to  ≤17  years  of  age. Compared to healthy children in study V58\\_31, the percentage of subjects reporting solicited AEs was slightly higher in the present study (73% compared to approximately 65% in V58\\_31). However, the percentage of unsolicited adverse events, SAEs and medically attended AEs reported in the present study  is  approximately  twice  as  high  compared  to  V58\\_31.  This  might  not  be  unexpected,  as  the present  study  enrolled  children  who  were  at  high  risk  for  influenza-related  complications,  including children  with  chronic  diseases,  neurological  and  neurodevelopmental  conditions,  or  weak  immune system. In both studies, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were under SOC infection and infestations.  The  underlying  medical  conditions,  as  well  as  the  treatment  of  these  conditions,  most likely  resulted  in  more  adverse  events  after  immunisation,  as  these  children  in  general  have  an increased risk of infections. Moreover, there is a bias in race between the two studies, as the majority of subjects in V58\\_31 were Asians (65%) whereas the majority of subjects in the present study were whites (89%). This might further complicate the comparison of the results of these studies. Overall, the safety results from study V58P15 in children and adolescents 3 to &lt; 18 years of age at risk for influenza-related complications are in line with the known safety profile of TIVc. 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation Overall conclusion The safety results from study V58P15 in children and adolescents 3 to &lt; 18 years of age at risk for influenza-related complications are in line with the known safety profile of TIVc. As the study did not achieve its enrolment target, only differences in events that occur in 4% or more of the population can be detected. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity and none of the SAEs reported in this  study  was  judged by the investigator as possibly or probably related to the study vaccine. The percentage of unsolicited adverse events, SAEs and medically attended AEs reported in the present study is approximately twice as high as compared to study V58\\_31 in healthy children. No new safety signals were identified. The results from study V58P15 do not impact the positive benefit-risk profile of TIVc. Medicinal product no longer authorised
