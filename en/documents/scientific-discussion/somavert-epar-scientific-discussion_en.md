## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of SOMAVERT.  For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

Pegvisomant, the  active  substance  in  Somavert,  is  a  pegylated  recombinant  analogue  of  the  human growth hormone (GH) which has been genetically engineered to function as a GH receptor antagonist.

Somavert  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  acromegaly  who  have  had  an  inadequate response  to  surgery  and/or  radiation  therapy  and  in  whom  an  appropriate  medical  treatment  with somatostatin analogues did not normalize IGF-I concentrations or was not tolerated.

## The disease

Acromegaly  is  a  rare  debilitating  endocrine  disease  characterised  by  hypersecretion  of  growth hormone (GH), occurring almost exclusively as a result of a benign pituitary adenoma. Most pituitary tumours arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited, occurring from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell which leads to increased cell division and tumour formation. This mutation is not present  at  birth  but  is  acquired  during  life.  The  mutation  occurs  in  a  gene  that  regulates  the transmission of chemical signals with pituitary cells, permanently switching on the signal that tells the cells to divide and secrete GH.

Acromegaly most commonly affects middle-aged adults and can result in serious illness and premature death.  Once recognised, acromegaly is treatable in most patients, but because of its slow and often insidious onset, it frequently is not diagnosed correctly.

Patients  with  acromegaly  have  significantly  increased  morbidity  and  mortality.  The  most  frequent causes of death are cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases, but significant increases in  the  death  rate  of  acromegalic  patients,  due  to  both  lung  infections  and  malignancies,  have  been reported.

Studies have shown that acromegalic patients have a 2.45 -fold increased rate of malignant tumours over non-acromegalic patients. Up to 46% of acromegalic patients have been found to have colonic polyps  which  are  frequently  precursors  of  colon  carcinoma.  Other  complications  of  acromegaly include  acral  enlargement,  disfigurement,  arthropathy,  nerve  entrapment,  hypertension  and  cardiac disease.  Cardiovascular  complications  of  acromegaly,  including  hypertension,  premature  coronary artery  disease,  congestive  heart  failure  and  cardiac  arrhythmia  are  major  causes  of  morbidity  and mortality in acromegaly.  Left ventricular hypertrophy has adverse effects on cardiac function and also contributes to the mortality associated with the disease.

It is generally accepted that the clinical manifestations of acromegaly are mediated through elevations in serum IGF-I concentrations.  The increased incidence of diabetes and glucose intolerance may be a direct effect of GH.  The IGF-I peptide is formed through intracellular transduction when GH bridges GH-specific  cell  membrane  receptors  (receptor  dimerization),  and  circulating  IGF-I  levels  correlate with GH concentration.

In over 90 percent of acromegaly patients, the overproduction of GH is caused by a benign tumour of the  pituitary  gland,  generally  adenoma  that  produces  excess  GH  and,  as  expands,  compresses surrounding brain tissues, such as the optic nerves.  This expansion causes the headaches and visual disturbances that are often symptoms of acromegaly.

In  addition,  compression  of  the  surrounding  normal  pituitary  tissue  can  alter  production  of  other hormones, leading to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and impotence in men.

## Current treatment

The  treatment  of  first  intention  in  acromegaly  remains  surgical  tumor  excision  by  transphenoïdial route.  Radiotherapy  can  be  given  either  as  primary  treatment  or  as  an  adjunct  to  surgery.  Medical treatment  is  intended  for  patients  with  acromegaly  not  adequately  treated  by  surgery,  in  patients  in whom surgery is contraindicated or poses a high-risk, or for those patients waiting for radiotherapy to become effective. The currently available medical therapy is somatostatin analogues (i.e. octreotide, lanreotide, vapreotide) and dopamine agonists. Somatostatin analogues bind to somatostatin receptors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

present on the tumour leading to inhibition of GH secretion and IGF-1 levels reduction. Dopamine agonists  (e.g.  bromocriptine  and  pergolide)  bind  to  pituitary  dopamine  type2  (D2)  receptors  and suppress GH secretion in some patients with acromegaly.

## Pegvisomant action

Treatment with Somavert is a new approach in medical therapy of acromegaly. Due to its molecular design,  pegvisomant  binds  to  growth  hormone  receptors  on  cell  surfaces,  where  it  blocks  growth hormone binding, and thus interferes with intracellular growth hormone signal transduction.

The therapeutic objective of pegvisomant is to normalise IGF-1 serum concentrations (IGF-I levels correlate with disease activity and with GH levels) and to improve the systemic manifestation as well as metabolic disorder (diabetes and glucose intolerance) observed in acromegalic patients. All known GH  effects,  including  any  direct  effects,  are  mediated  via  the  GH  receptor,  which  is  blocked  by pegvisomant.  The  action  of  a  GH  receptor  antagonist  is  independent  of  the  characteristics  of  the pituitary  tumour.  This  is  because it  blocks  the  effect  of  excess  GH  at  a  cellular  level,  reducing  the action of GH rather than inhibiting its secretion. The selectivity of pegvisomant for the GH receptor should  reduce  the  risk  of  adverse  effects  mediated  by  stimulation  or  inhibition  of  other  endocrine systems. Pegvisomant is highly selective for the GH receptor, and does not significantly bind to the prolactin receptor, despite the sequence homogeneity between GH and prolactin.

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

The finished product is presented as a powder and solvent for solution for subcutaneous injection. It is supplied  in  three  strengths:  10,  15,  and  20  mg  pegvisomant  per  vial.  The  lyophilised  powder, presented  in  a  glass  vial,  contains  the  following  excipients:  glycine,  mannitol  (E421),  sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate. Before use, each vial is to be reconstituted with 1 ml water for injections supplied in an 8 ml glass vial. The product does not contain ingredients of animal or human origin.

## Active substance

Pegvisomant  is  a  40-50  kDa  molecular  variant  of  the  human  growth  hormone  (hGH)  consisting  of recombinant  protein  component  and  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG).  The  protein  molecule  (B2036) consists of 191 amino acids with two internal disulphide bonds  obtained by expression in E. coli cells from which it is extracted and purified. The molecule is then further modified by covalent addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules resulting in a pegylated protein (B2036-PEG) with 4 and 5 PEG groups per B2036-PEG molecule. The purpose of pegylation of the protein component is to increase the half-life of the molecules. Pegvisomant has been designed to function as an antagonist of the hGH receptor (HGHR) by substitution of certain amino acids in the backbone of the protein hGH.

## Development genetics and cell bank system

The production process of pegvisomant uses a transformed E. coli 33B6 host strain, comprehensively described in the application, containing an expression cassette coding for the human growth hormone analogue.  After  selection,  one  subclone  was  used  to  establish  the  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB).  The methods used to establish the MCB have been well described and involved standard techniques used in DNA recombinant technology.

Characterisation  studies  of  the  various  cell  banks  were  carried  out  using  classical  tests.  Cell  banks were  found  to  be  free  of  microbial  contamination  and  their  viral  safety  has  been  adequately documented and is not a matter of concern.

The genetic stability has been demonstrated to be adequate for the consistent production of the active substance.

## Production process

The unpegylated protein (B2036) is produced by fermentation, which has been adequately described in the application. The equipment and dedicated facilities as well as cleaning in place and sterilisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

procedures are satisfactorily documented. The composition of the various culture media (including the origin of the various components) used in the fermentation process have been adequately documented. The various relevant parameters recorded during each phase of the bioreactor cell culture process have been  documented  in  detail.  In-process  controls  assure  appropriate  cell  growth  and  the  absence  of microbial contamination. The In-process specifications have defined acceptance criteria.

Cell  harvest  and  the  downstream  purification  process,  consisting  of  a  sequence  of  validated chromatography and ultrafiltration  steps  leading  to the  protein  bulk  solution,  has  been  described  in detail.  The  various  in-process  monitoring  and  control  parameters  have  been  presented  in  detail  for each purification step.

Once the identity and purity of the purified protein have been verified by different chromatography methods, the protein is chemically modified by pegylation (i.e.covalent  attachment  of  PEG molecules), which results in a heterogeneous product. The heterogeneity is reduced as far as possible by an appropriate downstream purification process.

The production process of the active substance, which complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)  requirements  takes  place  at  Diosynth  RTP,  Inc.  (USA).  The  manufacturing  process  of  the active substance has been validated. The various critical steps of the production process, from the cell culture to purification and subsequent pegylation have been identified. Based on the results obtained regarding  the  upstream  (cell  culture)  as  well  as  the  downstream  (purification  and  pegylation) processes, the capacity, robustness and consistency of the production process are satisfactory and lead to an active substance bulk solution with a reproducible good quality.

## Characterisation, routine tests and specifications of the active substance

The  characterisation  of  pegvisomant  has  been  performed  to  highlight  the  heterogeneity  of  the pegylated  protein  and  to  study  the  effect  of  the  pegylation  on  the  protein  structure.  A  number  of analytical tests have been used.

Routine tests are performed on both the pegvisomant intermediate bulk (unpegylated protein) and the pegvisomant formulated bulk (pegylated protein) for which specifications have been set. Results for several lots of the intermediate and formulated bulks have been presented.

The analytical methods and specifications for the release of the pegvisomant intermediate bulk and of the  pegvisomant  formulated  bulk  ensure  consistent  quality  of  pegvisomant  with  respect  to  identity, purity, potency, and safety. The tests selected to be performed on a routine basis are satisfactory; their proposed limits are also considered to be acceptable. The various methods used for quality control of pegvisomant  have  been  described,  justified,  and  validated  for  their  analytical  performances,  and particularly  in  terms  of  accuracy,  precision,  limit  of  quantification,  limit  of  detection,  specificity, linearity/range and robustness. The proposed routine quality control test methods and specifications were selected in order to assess, on a routine basis, the identified key features of the active substance such as the biological activity

Based on the physico-chemical and biological characterisation data provided, it can be concluded that sensitive and quantitative tests have been developed and validated for identity, purity, and potency of the active substance.

## Stability of active substance

Based  on  stability  data  for  5  batches,  an  acceptable  shelf  life  for  the  active  substance  could  be established.

## Other ingredients

The active substance is formulated together with the following excipients: glycine, mannitol (E421), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous,  and sodium  phosphate  monobasic monohydrate. The finished product is presented in glass vials in which nitrogen is used as a head-fill and is supplied with Water for  Injections  (Ph.Eur.)  presented  in  glass  vials  to  be  used  for  administration.  All  excipients  are commonly used in parenteral formulations and comply with specifications as described in European (Ph.Eur.) or USA (USP) pharmacopoeia. Adequate descriptions, specifications and batch analysis for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

all packaging materials used for the bulk active substance or the finished product were provided in the application.

## Product development and finished product

The finished product is formulated as a sterile lyophilised powder in the mannitol/glycine/phosphate system. Overall the formulation of the product is justified and its development has been adequately documented. As the product does not contain preservatives, the reconstituted solution should be used immediately.

## Method of preparation

The manufacturing process, which complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), takes place in a  dedicated  facility  at  Abbott  Laboratories  Inc.  (USA).    The  manufacturing  process  has  been adequately  validated  with  results  on  batches  of  the  finished  product  manufactured  at  the  intended commercial  scale.  The  data  showed  that  the  finished  product  consistently  met  the  proposed specifications  and  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  consistently  reproducible.  A summary of the microbiological aspects of the formulation and filling process has been provided and is adequate. In-process controls to control the manufacturing process are appropriate.

The  manufacturing  process  of  the  water  for  injections,  provided  in  vials,  is  classical  and  has  been described in detail. The manufacturing process, which complies with GMP, takes place in dedicated facilities at Pharmacia N.V./S.A (Belgium).

## Specifications of the finished product

All  test  methods  used  for  routine  testing,  except  those  from  the  European  and  Unites  States Pharmacopoeias, have been validated. Control tests on the finished product will sufficiently guarantee the consistency of the manufacturing process of the finished product.

## Stability of the finished product

Stability  of  the  finished  product  has  been  studied  for  8  batches  of  finished  product.  The  stability protocol  was  designed  to  provide  information  on  the  stability  of  the  finished  product  at  the recommended  storage  temperature  (i.e. ≤ 25°C)  as  well  as  under  accelerated  conditions.  Based  on available results for three months under the recommended storage conditions, a shelf life of ≤ 9 months at ≤ 25°C, protected from light, for the finished product is acceptable. After reconstitution, the product should be used immediately.

## Viral safety

No adventitious viruses or retroviruses were detected in all the tests performed on the cell lines and therefore the established cell banks exhibit a satisfactory level of viral safety.

The manufacturing process is documented to be free from viral contamination. Overall, the viral safety of Somavert has been adequately demonstrated.

## Discussion on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with  existing  guidelines.  The  information  provided  in  the  application  demonstrated  consistent production of pegvisomant achieving a well-defined quality for the active substance and the finished product. The fermentation, down-stream processes, including pegylation, and purification of the active substance  are  adequately  controlled.  Pegvisomant  has  been  well-characterised  using  state-of  the-art methods with regard to its physicochemical characteristics. The manufacturing process of the finished product, which complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), has been described in sufficient detail and product specifications are adequate. In general, methods to control the quality of the product are adequate. The submitted documentation assured viral safety of the finished product. Stability data support a shelf life of 9 months for the finished product.

The quality of Somavert is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC, with the exception of a limited number of points to be addressed as post-approval commitments. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Viral safety and batch-tobatch consistency has been documented and the relevant test will be performed according to the agreed specifications.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Pegvisomant is a molecular variant of the human growth hormone in which a total of nine mutations have been introduced to alter the binding characteristics of the molecule with human growth hormone receptor  (HGHR)  sites  1  and  2.  The  protein  component  of  pegvisomant  (B2036)  has  been  further modified by covalent addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules resulting in a pegylated protein (B2036-PEG).  B2036-PEG  has  been  studied  in  mice,  rabbits  and  monkeys  for  its  pharmacological effects. The binding of B2036-PEG to hepatic GH receptors and to other receptors has been assessed in various species.

## Pharmacodynamics

GH  normally  binds  to  two  specific  sites  on  its  receptor.  Binding  to  site  2  activates  the  cellular signalling mechanism. Pegvisomant binds to HGHR site 1 and blocks site 2, and is able to displace native  GH.  As  a  result,  signal  transduction  is  blocked  and  circulating  concentration  of  insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), the principal mediator of GH action, is decreased.

The ability of pegvisomant to displace radio-labelled growth hormone [ 125 I]-hGH was studied in an in vitro binding  assay  using  microsomal  liver  cell  membranes  of  human,  rat,  mouse,  dog,  rabbit  and rhesus monkey origin. The specific receptor binding in rhesus monkey and rabbit was similar to man. The  binding  of  pegvisomant  blocked  the  physiological  cascade  that  follows  the  GH  receptor activation. The release of IGF-I was prevented from occurring in the rhesus monkey. Other species are not relevant for assessing this pharmacological effect.

Despite  the  enhancement  of  binding  of  hGH  analogues  at  site  2,  there  was  no  change  in  the somatotropin  dependent  proliferation  of  indicator  cells,  or  the  degree  of  activation  of  the  specific Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) activated by GH.

The purpose of direct pegylation of the protein was used to prolong half-life of B2036 and to reduce a potential immunogenicity. B2036-PEG showed decreased binding at the site 2 of the HGHR compared with B2036. Despite the reduced affinity for the receptor, work on the protein had shown increased potency of the pegylated form due to the prolonged circulating half-life 1 .

The most important effect of GH is the synthesis and the release of IGF-I, which is responsible for many of the physiological effects that follow the release of hGH from the pituitary gland. In transgenic mice expressing the gene for the mutated form of GH, the suppression of this mechanism early in life leads  to  dwarfism.  Two  single-dose  studies  in  rhesus  monkeys  with  up  to  1  mg/kg  pegvisomant administered  through  the  intravenous  (IV)  or  subcutaneous  (SC)  routes,  and  one  study  in  rabbits showed a dose related decrease in serum IGF-I. The GH level did not show any major change. These studies  showed  that  pegvisomant  was  a  potent  competitive  antagonist  of  the  binding  of  hGH.  The pharmacological effect was a decrease in circulating IGF-I levels, accompanied by an increase in GH and IGFBP-3 levels.

In vitro studies showed that B2036-PEG did not bind to or activate the human rPRL receptor, nor was it  an  antagonist  at  that  receptor.  B2036-PEG  had  no  specific  activity  at  any  of  a  wide  range  of autocoid, neurokinin and opioid receptors of human origin.

## Safety pharmacology

No  specific  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted.  Effects  on  the  major  physiological systems have been investigated in high dose acute toxicity tests of pegvisomant in the mouse, in repeat dose  tests  in  the  mouse,  rat  and  rhesus  monkey,  and  in  a  single-dose  IV  study  in  the  responsive cynomolgus monkey. Acute toxicity studies did not reveal toxicity on the cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous or gastro-intestinal systems after IV bolus injection of high doses of pegvisomant. In a single-dose IV study in cynomolgus monkeys, no clinical signs and no treatment related changes were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

noted at  ECG examinations. Renal function was not affected. Prolonged studies in rat and  monkey also showed no toxicity to the main functions of the physiological systems. The lack of toxicity was confirmed by clinical studies, after acute and repeated administration of doses up to 1 mg/kg /day.

## Pharmacokinetics

Several  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  with  pegvisomant  in  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit  and monkey. Pegvisomant was assayed by a radioimmunoassay specifically developed and validated for this product, or by radioactivity after [ 125 I] labelling.

Pegvisomant was administered IV only in mouse and monkey, showing a clearance and a volume of distribution higher in the female mouse, 19.3 ml/h/kg and 442 ml/kg respectively, and 2.74 ml/h/kg and 82.2 ml/kg in the male mouse and monkey respectively. Bioavailability of the SC route was 0.450.81  in  these  species.  In  rat,  tissues  containing  the  highest  percentage  of  administered  radioactivity were muscle (3.47%), brown fat (injection site) (2.64%), liver (2.15%) and bone (1.24%). All other tissues each contained less than 1% of the administered dose. Whole body autoradiography confirmed these findings and also demonstrated that radioactivity did not cross the blood-brain barrier.

Elimination  half-life  was  16.7-31.1  h  (mouse,  rat,  monkey).  In  rat,  radioactivity  was  primarily excreted by the renal route with more than 85% of the total radioactivity found in the urine 48 hours after the administration.

## Distribution

[ 125 I]-pegvisomant was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats (3 male, 3 female) by SC injection as a single 3 mg/kg dose. Cmax values for total radioactivity in the serum and blood cellular fraction were reached at 24 hours and then declined slowly. The ratio of radioactivity in the blood cell fraction to serum was 0.898 at 0.5 hours after dose administration and 0.333 at 24 hours. The ratio was relatively constant for the remainder of the study.

The  apparent  maximum  mean  tissue  concentration  of  radioactivity  was  reached  in  all  tissues  at  24 hours with the exception of brown fat (injection site), stomach, and thyroid/parathyroid gland where the maximum was reached at 8, 8 and 72 hours, respectively. The highest radioactivity concentrations were found in brown fat (injection site) &gt; thyroid/parathyroid &gt; ovaries, lungs and kidneys. After 24 hours, the radioactivity concentrations in all tissues except thyroid/parathyroid declined. Mean tissue to serum concentration ratios for all tissues except adrenal gland (0.5 hours), brown fat (0 to 24 hours) and thyroid/parathyroid gland (72 and 168 hours) were less than 1 at all time points, which indicates minimal  distribution of pegvisomant-associated radioactivity into the tissues. Male  rat tissue concentrations were somewhat lower than female tissue concentrations at comparable time points.

Tissues  containing  the  highest  percentage  of  administered  dose  were  muscle  (3.47%),  brown  fat (injection site) (2.64%), liver (2.15%) and bone (1.24%). All other tissues each contained less than 1% of the administered dose.

Whole body autoradiography confirmed the above findings and also demonstrated that radioactivity did not cross the blood-brain barrier.

## Metabolism and Excretion

Specific  metabolism  studies  with  pegvisomant  have  not  been  performed.  In  rat,  radioactivity  was primarily excreted by renal route with more than 85% of total radioactivity found in the urine 48 hours after administration. Faeces accounted for less than 2% of administered radioactivity. On the whole, recovery  of  administered  radioactivity  was  88.3%  and  92.2%  for  males  and  females,  respectively. Available information did not allow to distinguish the clearance by excretion and metabolism in the kidney. However, there was almost no unchanged pegvisomant in the urine in studies in humans and consequently the radioactive material noted in animal studies consisted of degradation products. The renal clearance of pegvisomant was almost nil . The location of the metabolism is still unknown.

## Interactions with other medicinal products or other substances

No interaction studies were performed. GH is known to be a major determinant of hepatic cytochrome P450 activity in rats. One study conducted in a small series of GH deficient subjects, has indicated that GH modulates hepatic CYP450 activity 2 . In vitro data showed that GH may exert this action through

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

upregulation of a specific CYP 3A4, a major drug metabolising CYP in humans 3 . The possibility that pegvisomant may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporin) was addressed. Interactions with cytochrome P450 caused by increased levels of GH are not expected because the goal with pegvisomant therapy is to normalise the disturbed GH/IGF-I system.

## Toxicology

Compliance to GLP was satisfactory.

## Acute and subacute toxicity

Acute toxicity studies in mice using SC or IV administration at doses up to 10 mg/kg did not induce any functional or other toxic effects. In single-dose toxicity studies, the most important findings were scabs at injection site in several animals from each treated group. Alkaline phosphatase reduction was the unique effect in males and females, together with increased basophilia of centrilobular hepatocytes, and of signs of trauma at injection sites.

Repeated dose toxicity studies consisted of two 2-week studies in mouse (SC and IV) and one 4-week study  in  monkey  (SC,  0,  0.1,  0.3,  1,  3  mg/kg  every  other  day).  Alkaline  phosphatase  dose  related reduction and an increase in total protein and calcium were found in one study in mice. No changes in necropsy or in the histological examination were observed. In monkeys, a slight decrease in alkaline phosphatase in all  animals in the two higher dose groups and  minimal trauma at the injection sites were observed.

The  Company  has  presented  a  comparison  of  exposure  across  species.  Exposure  ratios  have  been calculated from data of the toxicokinetic analysis conducted in the 26 week SC study in the rat and in the  26  week  SC  toxicity  study  in  the  rhesus  monkey.  The  exposure  ratios  included  the  maximum clinical dose in patients. Exposure ratios indicated that adequate exposure had been accomplished in the  rat.  Preclinical  data  revealed  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  studies  of  repeated  dose toxicity  in  rat  and  monkey.  However,  exposure  in  monkey  was  not  higher  than  in  patients  at therapeutic dose, and this is reflected in the SPC (see section 5.3., Preclinical safety data ).

## Chronic Toxicity

Two  6-month  chronic  toxicity  studies  were  performed  using  the  SC  route.  In  one  study  in  rats, toxicokinetic  analysis  showed  that  serum  levels  at  all  times  were  dose-related,  indicating  a  lack  of pegvisomant  antibodies,  since  the  specific  assay  was  shown  not  to  be  reliable  in  presence  of  the compound.  The main findings were chronic inflammation at the injection sites, significant decrease in alkaline  phosphatase  in  all  treated  males  and  top  dose  females,  and  vacuolated  macrophages  in different lymph nodes or spleen. The NOAEL after 26 weeks was 10 mg/kg/d SC.

In a second study conducted in monkeys using 0, 0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg (once weekly), the pharmacological activity of pegvisomant was demonstrated in the 1 and 3 mg/kg/week animals, in terms of reduction of IGF-I, reduction of insulin in males treated at the top dose, and unaffected prolactin levels. IGF-I and insulin returned to normal during the recovery period. Decrease in alkaline phosphatase in higher dose males  and  females,  reduction  in  trabecular  bone  were  observed  in  mid-dose  males  and  top-dose animals. No vacuolated macrophages were recorded. The overall NOAEL was 0.3 mg/kg/week and the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/week SC. In this study, pegvisomant was administered weekly for 6 months whereas it is injected daily in humans. Thus, exposure in monkey was not higher than in patients at therapeutic dose. This information is reflected in the SPC (section 5.3).

## Reproduction studies

An  experiment  was  conducted  in  the  rabbit  with  dose  levels  of  0,  1,  3  or  10  mg/kg/d  SC.  No significant effect was observed on dams and foetuses. Maternal GH has been known to influence the foetal growth in rats. A published study describing a small series of cases with acromegaly (including patients  that  had  octreotide  administered  during  only  a  part  of  their  pregnancy,  with  most  having therapy discontinued in the first or second trimester) observed no major side-effects, and birth weights were within the normal range despite discontinuation of therapy 4 . Nevertheless, the SPC warns against administration of pegvisomant to women who are pregnant or are likely to become pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Genotoxicity

The genotoxicity data presented comprised an AMES test and a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes. Both tests were negative and did not raise any genotoxicity concern.

## Carcinogenicity

Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted by the Company.  The results of 4 non-GLP in vitro studies were submitted.

GH is known to produce anabolic and mitogenic effects in  vitro and in  vivo at supra physiological levels. A possible direct growth stimulant effect of GH itself on neoplastic cells has been suggested from in vitro or in vivo studies. These studies have not always distinguished between the actions of GH  itself  and  induced  release  of  IGF-I 5,6 .  Controversy  remains  about  this  action  of  GH.  In  the available  product information for authorised products, GH is contraindicated in patients with active neoplasm. Growth hormone therapy should be discontinued if evidence of tumour growth develops. Also,  in  patients  with  previous  malignant  disease,  special  attention  should  be  given  to  signs  and symptoms of relapse 7 .

Results  of  studies  using  human  cell  lines  suggested  that  the  structure  of  pegvisomant  itself  lacks tumorigenic potential. IGF-I is a strong tumour mitogen. There is limited experimental evidence that enhanced IGF-I concentrations may increase the tumour incidence at certain sites. The goal of B2036PEG therapy is to normalise the GH/IGF-I system. The administration of this GH antagonist produces a  reduction  in  serum  concentrations  of  IGF-I.  This  is  expected  to  reduce  the  risk  of  tumour development in acromegaly patients.

An additional safety concern was related to tumour promoting potential. In the clinical studies 3613, 3613A, 3614 and 3615, there was a rise of GH level in association with a fall of IGF-I level. The negative  feedback  mechanism  in  relation  to  the  decrement  in  plasma  IGF-I  level  can  give  rise  to tumour growth by directly activating growth-stimulatory GH receptors on tumour cells. The CPMP had  indicated  that  if  the  clinical  data  showed  normalisation  of  the  GH/IGF-I  system,  further carcinogenicity studies would not be required. The clinical experience did not show any expansion of the  pituitary  neoplasms  underlying  the  acromegalic  state.  However,  clinical  studies  were  of  limited duration and it could not be ruled out that long-term treatment might cause an increase in GH levels resulting from a feedback mechanism. Such potential increase could be accompanied by growth of the pituitary tumour. The SPC of Somavert adequately reflects this information (see section 4.4, Special warnings  and  special  precautions  for  use ).  All  patients  with  growth  hormone-secreting  tumours should be carefully monitored in order to avoid any progression in tumour size under treatment.

## Local tolerance

A test  was  performed  employing  a  conventional  protocol  in  the  rabbit  SC,  6  times  over  8  days.  A minimal  local  reaction  attributed  to  the  trauma  of  the  injection  procedure  was  observed.  The  local tolerability of pegvisomant was considered acceptable.

## Immunogenicity

Pegvisomant is a polypeptide differing from human GH by the substitution of 9 amino acids. Even after  the  pegylation,  B2036-PEG  remains  potentially  immunogenic.  Several  attempts  were  made during the development of pegvisomant to develop a technique to detect antibodies during repeated dosing.  The  technical  difficulty  was  the  presence  of  relatively  high  concentrations  of  GH  and pegvisomant  molecules  in  the  samples  of  animal  sera,  that  interfered  with  the  assay  for  antipegvisomant antibodies. These inconclusive data suggested that a low titre of probable antibody was detected  in  1  out  of  2monkeys,  two  weeks  after  the  cessation  of  the  treatment.  Although  the immunogenic potential of Somavert is not a matter of particular concern at present, the Company will keep this issue under review, particularly in view of the fact that Somavert is intended for long-term administration.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

The pharmacodynamic studies presented showed that pegvisomant is a potent competitive and specific antagonist of hGH binding in vitro and in vivo .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies  performed  in  rhesus  monkey  have  shown  that  the  blockage  of  GH  receptor  produced  a decrease in IGF-I levels and an increase in GH levels in blood. The interest of the pharmacodynamic studies in animals was limited because of the specificity of B2036-PEG for human growth hormone receptor.

Pre-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated dose toxicity in rat  and  monkey. However, exposure in monkey was not higher then in patients at therapeutic dose. This has been adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 5.3, Preclinical safety data ).

No animal studies on reproduction toxicity were conducted, except for one experiment in the rabbit. The  SPC  includes  appropriate  warnings  against  administration  of  pegvisomant  to  women  who  are pregnant or are likely to become pregnant

No  data  on  carcinogenic  potential  have  been  submitted.  The  lack  of  carcinogenicity  study  was acceptable  as  there  is  sufficient  evidence  of  reduction  of  IGF-I  levels  in  patients  treated  with pegvisomant.

The potential for carcinogenic risk cannot be fully excluded; however, in vitro studies in a number of tumour cell lines identified an inhibitory effect on their growth.

The chronic active inflammation in association with vacuolated macrophages at the injection site, in association with vacuolated macrophages in lymph nodes and in spleen, may well be a non-specific response  to  repeated  injections.  Nevertheless,  it  was  not  possible  to  rule  out  immunogenicity. Although the immunogenic potential of Somavert is not a matter of particular concern at present, the Company will keep this issue under review, particularly in view of the fact that Somavert is intended for long-term administration.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

The  clinical  development  of  B2036-PEG  was  undertaken  in  the  U.  S.  A.  and  Europe.  The  clinical documentation presented include a total of three clinical pharmacology studies and two main clinical trials.

The two main clinical efficacy studies consisted of a phase III and a phase II study. The first was a double-blind,  placebo  controlled  randomised  study  (SEN-3614)  together  with  its  long-term  safety extension (SEN-3615). This trial studied three dose levels of pegvisomant administered once daily for 12 weeks. One double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase II study (SEN-3611) together with its long-term safety extension (SEN-3613) evaluated pegvisomant at two dose levels, once weekly for 6 weeks.

## Clinical Pharmacology

Three Phase I studies were conducted: two in healthy volunteers (SEN-3601 and 3623) and one in patients with acromegaly (SEN-3602).

SEN-3601 was a double-blind study that evaluated the safety and pharmacology of pegvisomant in healthy  volunteers  after  single  SC  administration  at  4  rising  dose  levels.  Patients  were  randomly assigned to one of the four possible dose groups, and to pegvisomant (6 per dose group) or placebo (3 per dose group).

SEN-3623 was a single-dose crossover study in healthy volunteers to assess the bioavailability of a single SC dose of pegvisomant. Twelve subjects were randomly assigned to receive single doses of pegvisomant 20 mg ( ≅ 0.3 mg/kg) SC or 10 mg IV infusion, followed by a cross-over after a 4-week washout period and crossover to receive the opposite treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SEN-3602, was a small study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics of pegvisomant administered as a  single  SC  administration  of  two  dose  levels  (0.3  or  1.0  mg/kg)  in  a  total  of  6  patients  with acromegaly.

The  method  employed  for  quantitative  determination  of  B2036-PEG  in  serum/plasma  was  a radioimmunoassay  developed  and  validated  at  Phoenix  International  Life  Sciences  (St  Laurent, Quebec, Canada). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the method was 4.675 ng/ml with an intra-assay  precision and accuracy of 9.5 % and 102.1% and an inter-assay precision and accuracy of 7.9 % and 102 %, respectively. Cross-reactivity with endogenous compounds (GH) accounted for the apparent  baseline  concentrations  of  pegvisomant  prior  administration.  The  baseline  concentrations were higher in acromegaly patients than in healthy individuals.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic data for pegvisomant were available for 48 healthy volunteers, and 151 patients with acromegaly  (6  had  been  included  in  the  pharmacokinetics  study  SEN-3602  and  145  in  the  clinical studies).

## Single-dose study (SEN-3623)

Following  SC  administration,  pegvisomant  was  absorbed  slowly  with  Tmax  at  49.0  hr  (32.5  %) (arithmetic mean) and a Cmax of 1390 ng / ml (45.3 %) (geometric mean). The fraction absorbed after SC injection (bioavailability) was 56.7 % (48.7% - 64.7 %). The total volume of distribution (VD) was 23.3 L (77.3 %) (SC) and 12.4 L (43.5 %) (IV).

Only a small fraction of unchanged pegvisomant was excreted in the urines (0.0015 after SC dosing versus 0.0041 after IV dosing). Only a small amount of the active substance is recovered in the urine over 96 hours (&lt;0.6%).

Elimination  half-lives  (study  SEN-3623)  for  IV  and  SC  administration  were  similar  and  were approximately 138 hours for all subjects included in the analysis, with a ratio of SC to IV of 1.0028.

The total clearance was very low (study SEN-3623): 1.80 ml/min (29.4 %) for SC administration and 1.03  ml/min  (33.0  %)  for  IV  administration.  There  appeared  to  be  a  difference  between  male  and female subjects in the mean Cmax and AUC values of pegvisomant after SC administration. The large variability  observed  and  the  limited  number  of  subjects  precludes  any  conclusions  based  on  these differences.  A  population  pharmacokinetic  model  presented  based  on  clearance  only  showed  that clearance of pegvisomant did not differ between male and female patients. Mean systemic clearance was estimated to be 28 ml/h for pegvisomant doses of 10 to 20 mg administered SC (study SEN 3614). The clearance was closely related to body weight. Clearance increased by 0.6 ml/h for each kilogram of body weight greater than the average body weight of 94 kg.

## Dose ranging studies (SEN-3601, SEN-3602)

Study  SEN-3601,  recruited  36  male  healthy  volunteers  receiving  pegvisomant  (6  subjects  per  dose group) or placebo (3 subjects per dose group) and SEN-3602 included 6 patients with acromegaly (3 patients  per  group).  Complete  serum  concentrations versus time  profile  of  pegvisomant  were generated up to day 10 after administration in study SEN-3601 and up to Day 21 in study SEN-3602. In  SEN-3601 pegvisomant was slowly absorbed with maximum serum concentration (Cmax) being achieved between 12 and 60 hours post dose (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). The terminal half-life was 74-99 hours.

Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in healthy volunteers and in acromegaly patients with single SC administration of 0.3 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg doses. The half-lives were slightly but not significantly longer in the SEN-3602 study (80-109 hours). Some evidence of non-linearity for Cmax and AUC was suggested by the data on rising doses of pegvisomant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics at steady state

Steady-state  concentrations  were  obtained  in  143  patients  in  the  long-term  extension  studies  (SEN3613A and SEN - 3615) after daily SC administration of various pegvisomant doses (5 to 40 mg). In total,  1440 pegvisomant concentration observations were measured with a mean of 9.9 observations per  patient  (range:  1-29).  Since  pegvisomant  concentrations  were  similar  in  the  two  studies  for  the most commonly used doses (10, 15 and 20 mg), data from the two studies were pooled into a single data  set  for  analysis.  Dose  escalations  were  made  not  more  frequently  than  every  2  weeks  in  both studies. Pegvisomant exhibited dose linear population pharmacokinetics for daily doses of 5 mg to at least 35 mg (9.3 ± 6.3 µ g/mL, 14.3 ± 7.5 µ g/mL and 18.1 ± 10.1 µ g/mL after the 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg dose). Conclusions about pharmacokinetic linearity for doses above 35 mg may be compromised by the small number of patients treated with 40 mg.

The  Company  performed  a  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  at  steady  state  in  acromegalic patients (SEN-3614). The results of this analysis were considered more relevant than those from the single-dose studies in healthy volunteers. There was a tendency for clearance to change with dose but the effect of a covariate accounting for dose-dependent clearance was not statistically significant. In univariate screening, the largest effect was observed for a covariate accounting for clearance changing linearly  with  body  weight.  No  covariate  to  account  for  non-linear  clearance  entered  the  final population pharmacokinetic model. Pegvisomant clearance was not associated with age or gender. As the  two  multiple-dose  studies  (SEN-3613A  and  SEN-3615)  were  also  consistent  with  dose  linear disposition of pegvisomant the Company concluded that pegvisomant exhibited approximately dose linear pharmacokinetics following administration of clinically relevant doses.

## Interaction studies

No interaction studies were performed.

## Pharmacokinetic studies in special populations

No pharmacokinetic study was performed in specific populations such as children, elderly people or subjects with impaired renal function and this has been adequately reflected in the SPC. The Company will provide access to physicians wishing to use Somavert in paediatric patients, access to the postmarketing database  and submit to the CPMP results on those patients captured in the programme.

## Pharmacodynamics

The primary pharmacodynamic objective in the clinical development of B2036-PEG was to document the suppression of IGF-I production as a function of the dose and B2036-PEG plasma concentration. Secondary objectives targeted plasma levels of GH, IGF-BP-3, insulin, TSH, PRL as well as GH and B2036-PEG  antibodies  determination.  The  pharmacodynamic  characteristics  of  B2036-PEG  were mainly evaluated in studies SEN-3601 (healthy volunteers) and SEN-3602 (subjects with acromegaly) and as secondary end points in SEN-3623 study (healthy volunteers).

IGF-I was analysed using two radioimmunoassay, which had been developed and validated by Pharma Bio-Research Laboratories  (study SEN-3601) and by Endocrine Sciences (studies SEN - 3602 and SEN - 3623, SEN - 3614). According to the data provided by the Company a sensitivity of 4.50 ng/ml was observed for Pharma Bio-Research Laboratories method and of 10 ng/ml for Endocrine Sciences method.

From the data provided (study SEN-3601) the effective dose level causing a 49.24% suppression of IGF-I was 1.0 mg/kg obtained at 120 hours after dosing and the maximum effect was not reached. No decrease in serum IGF-I concentrations was observed for doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg. For the doses 0.3 mg/kg, a maximum decrease was reached at 72 hours after dosing (27.7% decrease from baseline). Acromegalic patients (study SEN-3602) showed a similar IGF-I reduction for the doses 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg to that  observed  in  healthy  volunteers . In  the  1.0  mg/kg  group,  a  decrease  from  baseline  of 61.3%, 54.0% and 38.6% was observed on day 3, 7 and 21, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study SEN-3623 (healthy volunteers), a slight increase above baseline was observed initially after either IV or SC administration. This increase reached a maximum at 100 hours, in females (+10.7% and +29.9% after SC and IV administration, respectively) and males (+19.4% and +8.6% after SC and IV  administration,  respectively).  Concentrations  decreased  to  below  pre-treatment  values  by  day  8. IGF-1 concentrations had returned to baseline values) at day 16 for both routes of administration.

A population based pharmacodynamic analysis was undertaken in SEN-3614 study. The mean steadystate  serum  IGF-I  concentration  was  648.15  ng/ml.  The  serum  pegvisomant  concentration  that produced  50%  of  the  maximal  IGF-I  suppression  (C50)  was  15,500  ng/ml.  The  value  of  C50  was independent of patient demographics such as sex, race, body weight and baseline GH concentrations.

A significant  effect  of  opioid  treatment  on  pegvisomant  C50  was  demonstrated  such  that  C50  was approximately twice in the population on opioids therapy (11% of the study population) than in the other individuals (27 400 ng/ml v. 14 000 ng/ml).

Concerning other pharmacodynamic effects studied, the AUCs of GH showed large intra-individual fluctuations.  For  IGF-I/BP-3,  insulin,  prolactin  and  TSH  concentrations  no  consistent  changes  from baseline were observed.

The Cmax of pegvisomant achieved in the 20 mg SC dose group was approximately 50% less than the Cmax achieved in the 10 mg IV dose group (1387 ng / ml vs 4271 ng / ml). This difference did not lead  to  any  distinguishable  effect  on  IGF-I  reduction  (SEN-3623).  Indeed,  in  the  pharmacokinetic population  study  (SEN-3614),  the  mean  serum  trough  concentration  of  pegvisomant  that  produced 50% of  the  maximum  IGF-I  suppression  (IC50)  was  estimated  to  be  15,500  ng/ml.  This  was  well above the Cmax levels of ~4,270 ng/ml observed after the 10 mg IV dose in study SEN-3623.

## B2036-PEG antibodies

Human GH as well as the B2036-PEG antibodies were evaluated in the SEN 3626 study. Human GH antibodies were  detected  at  B2036-PEG concentrations  of  2000  ng/ml  and  more and  at  human  GH concentrations  of  80  ng/ml  or  more.  GH  antibodies  were  analysed  at  baseline  and  on  day  16.  No positive antibody was found for any subject at either of these time points.

## Cholesterol metabolism

Exogenous  administration  of  GH  has  been  shown  to  increase  the  expression  of  the  LDL  receptor, which  is  manifested  as  better  cholesterol  catabolism 8 .  The  observed  effects  of  GH  on  LDL,  total cholesterol  and  apo  B,  the  apolipoprotein  component  of  LDL,  are  generally  thought  to  result  from increased LDL and apo B clearance. A possible impact of Somavert on cholesterol metabolism has been explored. In  studies  SEN-3613 and SEN-3613A, total LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels were obtained  in  36  patients  treated  with  pegvisomant  for  a  mean  duration  of  22.5  months.  Total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol increased by 9 and 7 % compared to baseline, respectively, and HDL cholesterol increased by 18.4 %. In another study in 20 patients with active acromegaly treated with pegvisomant for a mean of 10 months, normalisation of serum IGF-I resulted in an increase in total cholesterol (5.0 to 5.7 mmol/L), increase in LDL cholesterol (3.0 to 3.7 mmol/L), and increase in apo B  (110  to  127  mg/L),  restoring  the  distribution  of  values  to  that  of  the  general  population. Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were unaffected by treatment, but apoA1, the major apolipoprotein component of HDL, was increased (153 to 166 mg/L). Lipoprotein (a) was reduced (342 to 235 mg/L). A  decrease  in  serum  insulin,  glucose  /  insulin  ratio  and,  in  some  cases,  fasting  glucose  has  been demonstrated in other studies with pegvisomant (SEN-3613A, 3615, SEN-3614).

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

The pharmacokinetic profile of SC administration of Somavert is characterised by:

-  slow absorption (Tmax: 49.02 h ± 32.4%) and slow distribution (half-life: 138 hours);
-  an absolute bioavailability of 56.7%;
-  a clearance influenced by weight and concomitant administration of opiates

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  a  similar  pharmacokinetic profile after single SC Somavert administration in healthy volunteers and in patients with acromegaly;
-  a non-linearity for Cmax and AUC (increase more than dose proportional) observed after a single administration  study  in  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  a  dose  linear  increase  observed  at  steady state (population pharmacokinetic).

Although  the  analysis  of  covariance  showed  no  statistically  significant  effects  for  baseline  GH, pharmacodynamic data suggested that higher baseline GH levels could be related to lower efficacy or to require higher doses of pegvisomant. To evaluate the effect of baseline GH levels on pegvisomant response, a retrospective analysis was conducted for patients in the SEN-3615 study (N=109). Patients were stratified  into  two  groups:  low  baseline  GH  level  (&lt;5  ng/ml)  and  high  baseline  GH  level  (&gt;5 ng/ml).  The  endpoints  for  this  analysis  were  percentage  of  patients  with  a  normal  serum  IGF-I concentration  at  final  visit  and  percent  change  in  serum  IGF-I  concentration  from  baseline  to  final visit.  These  two  endpoints  showed  comparable  results,  regardless  of  baseline  GH  level  (46.0%  vs. 50.0% and 95.0% vs. 89.6% for the low and high GH baseline groups, respectively). The mean daily dose required to achieve these responses, however, was slightly higher in the high baseline GH group compared to the low baseline GH group (15.5 mg vs. 12.4 mg, respectively). These results indicated that  the  IGF-I  response  to  pegvisomant  dosing  is  not  altered  by  baseline  GH  status,  but  a  slightly higher dose is required to achieve optimal therapy in patients with higher baseline GH levels.

The proposed treatment regimen is an 80 mg loading dose followed by daily administration of 10 mg and has been adequately justified.

The use of the 80 mg loading dose aims at reaching therapeutic pegvisomant concentrations faster, and to elicit a relatively rapid reduction in IGF-I concentrations.

Pegvisomant metabolism is expected to involve normal protein catabolism through peptide cleavage in  the  liver  and  other  organs.  It  is  generally  recognized  that  proteins  are  not  substrates  of  CYP450. Although a slight modification in the structure of the molecule (Lys pegylation modifies and removes two peptides from the tryptic map), it is expected that this should not result in a significant alteration from the  natural  metabolic  pathways  for  human  growth  hormone.  The  fate  and  disposition  of  PEG moieties is well described in the literature. Lastly, acromegaly is not associated with specific hepatic and  renal  complications,  and  therefore,  the  disease  is  not  expected  to  impact  on  pegvisomant metabolism.  Indeed,  pegvisomant  clearance  was  observed  to  be  similar  in  healthy  subjects  and acromegaly patients. As sufficient understanding on the metabolism of proteins can be gathered from the literature the absence of data from studies performed by the Company is acceptable and is in line with the current regulations.

A population PK-PD analysis was conducted on study SEN-3614. Although dose was included after the initial screen for possible covariates, it was found unnecessary to include any parameters, such as dose, in the final population PK model to account for non-linear clearance. Only one covariate, body weight, resulted in a statistically significant effect on systemic clearance and was retained in the final pharmacokinetic model where the typical clearance value increased by 0.6 ml/h for each kilogram of body weight greater than the average body weight of 94 kg. The additional pharmacokinetic data from multiple  dose  studies  (SEN-3613  and  SEN-3615)  confirmed  the  linear  disposition  of  pegvisomant. Thus, it was concluded that linearity is observed at steady-state following administration of clinically relevant doses (10, 15 and 20 mg).

Justifications  were  provided  to  support  the  higher  dose  treatment  recommendation.  In  the  original MAA data, a total of 29 patients were exposed to doses of  &gt; 25 mg/day with 15 of these patients receiving &gt; 30 mg/day.  Within this subset, 10 patients required greater than 20 mg Somavert per day to normalize their IGF-I during Study SEN-3615. Normalization of the IGF-I was achieved in 8 of 108 evaluable patients at a maximum dose of 30 mg/day.  None of these patients experienced significant adverse events and these did not differ by dose.  Based on these data, a maximum daily dose of 30 mg/day was recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical Efficacy

From the available pharmacokinetic, once weekly dosing schedule was chosen for clinical trials. The selected doses were 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg as those which were effective for IGF-I levels reduction. In  clinical  trials,  these  doses  were  simplified  trial  to  30  mg  and  80  mg  and  were  administered  in  2 trials: SEN-3611, a double-blind, placebo-controlled and SEN-3613 an open extension of SEN-3611.

## Main clinical studies

The primary efficacy endpoint for all studies was percent suppression in IGF-I concentrations from baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoints varied across studies, and included the proportion of patients with normalized IGF-I concentrations and other measures of the GH-IGF axis, such as free IGF-I, IGF BP-3, acid labile submit (ALS). The severity of individual signs and symptoms was evaluated on a scale from 0 to 14. Other secondary endpoints were ring size (standard European jeweller's rings), and quality of life.

## Selection criteria

The selection criteria used in the clinical trials were designed so as to recruit male and postmenopausal or surgically sterile females aged 18 years or more with diagnosis of acromegaly and presenting IGF-I value  as ≥ 30 % above the upper limit of normal range for the SEN-3614 study and as ≥ 50 % for the SEN- 3611 study. The main exclusion criteria were prior treatment with any long-acting somatostatin analogue within 3 months, with any somatostatin analogue within 2 weeks and with any dopamine agonists within 5 weeks of screening visit. Patients with presence of other conditions that could result in  elevated  GH and/or IGF-I concentrations (e.g., severe hepatic or renal disease, anorexia nervosa, Laron's  syndrome,  treatment  with  levodopa,  narcotic  analgesic,  or  heroin  abuse)  were  also  not eligible.

## SEN-3611 and follow-up (3613 and 3613A)

Study SEN-3611 was a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II dose ranging study. Patients were allocated to 3 different treatment groups (placebo, pegvisomant 30 mg, and pegvisomant 80 mg). The  treatment  was  administered  once  weekly  during  6  weeks.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was percent  suppression  of  IGF-I  concentrations  compared  to  baseline  values  (at  randomisation).  The secondary endpoints were acromegaly severity score, and ring size.

Subjects that completed SEN-3611 successfully were offered to continue in an open-label extension study  (SEN-3613).  The  dose  regimen  in  SEN-3613  was  once  weekly,  SC  injection  of  30  mg  of pegvisomant at the beginning of the study with every two weeks dose adjustment by 10 mg increments up to  80  mg  during  12  weeks  and  then  every two  months. The dose level adjustment depended on investigator's assessment taking into account multiple variables such as: study medication tolerability, IGF-I concentration, sign and symptom of acromegaly, ring size. Descriptive statistics were produced for IGF-I concentrations, IGF-I normalisation, GH and IGFBP-3, signs and symptoms of acromegaly, and  ring  size.  The  extension  study  was  later  amended,  with  dosing  changed  from  weekly  to  daily (SEN-3613A).

In  SEN-3613A,  pegvisomant  was  administered  in  all  subjects  as  80  mg  bolus  loading  dose  at  the beginning of the study followed by a daily SC administration of 10 mg of pegvisomant. Then, dose adjustment was performed in 5 mg increments, up to 40 mg occurred every two weeks and was again based on the investigator's assessment. Descriptive statistics were produced for IGF-I concentrations, signs and symptoms of acromegaly, and ring size.

## SEN-3614 and follow-up (SEN-3615)

SEN-3614 study was a double-blind placebo-controlled, phase III study. Patients were randomised to 4 treatment groups (placebo, pegvisomant 10, 15, or 20 mg ). Patients were stratified at randomisation according to IGF-I level (1.3-2.0 vs. &gt; 2.0 × age-adjusted UNL). A sample size of 25 patients/group was calculated to detect a 20% difference in IGF-I levels, with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The study duration was 12 weeks. At the first visit each patient received the bolus loading dose of  either  80  mg  of  pegvisomant  or  placebo,  followed  by  a  daily  self  administration  of  randomly attributed treatment. The main study objective was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the 10

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 20 mg/day doses and to test an intermediary dose of 15 mg/day. The primary efficacy endpoint was  percent  suppression  in  IGF-I  concentrations  at  week  12,  compared  to  baseline.  Secondary endpoints included incidence of normalisation of IGF-I, reduction in acid labile subunits and free IGFI,  IGFBP-3, GH, acromegaly signs and symptoms (9-point scales for soft-tissue swelling, arthralgia, headache, perspiration and fatigue), ring size of the non-dominant hand ring finger (standard European jeweller's  rings),  and  quality  of  life.  Antibody  development  was  also  assessed.  The  study  has  been completed.

SEN-3615 was an open-label follow-up of SEN-3614 study, including also new patients. At the first study visit all subjects received in a blinded  manner a bolus loading dose either of placebo (those who were  treated  with  active  substance  in  SEN  3614)    or  of  80  mg  of  active  substance  (those  who previously  received  placebo).  The  loading  dose  was  followed  in  an  open-label  manner  by  a  self administration  of  10  mg/day  of  active  substance.  A  dose  adjustment  was  possible  after  the  first  8 weeks of treatment and was made by 5 mg/day increments up (max to 30 mg/day) or down (min to 5 mg/day). Doses of up to 20 mg were to be administered in a single injection and greater than 20 mg via two injections. The dose adjustment was based on the normalisation of IGF-I concentration (within the normal range for age-adjusted controls). The main study objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent suppression in IGF-I concentrations from baseline of study SEN 3614. Secondary endpoints included normalisation of IGF-I, reduction in acid labile subunits, IGFBP-3, and free IGF-I, acromegaly severity score, and ring size. The study is still ongoing, and interim results have been provided for a 6-months study period (cut-off date 31 May 2000).

## Analysis

Main efficacy analyses included only randomised patients with at least one post-treatment assessment. Efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  an  analysis  of  variance  model  (ANOVA)  with  step-down hierarchical procedure testing to account multiple comparisons. Primary comparisons were performed between each of the 3 pegvisomant treatments groups (10, 15 and 20 mg) and placebo after 12 weeks of therapy. Additionally the covariates such as baseline IGF-I concentration, IGF-I study entry strata, baseline GH concentration, gender and baseline body weight were added in the statistical analyses for efficacy. Furthermore for the subjects taking somatostatin analogue or dopamine agonist therapy prior to participating in the study, comparative analyses were conducted between treatment groups.

## Results

## SEN-3611 and follow-up (3613, 3613A)

Forty-six patients were included in study 3611, and allocated to 3 groups. 15 patients were assigned to the  placebo  group.  Sixteen  and  15  patients  were  assigned  to  the  30  and  80  mg  of  pegvisomant, respectively.  In  total,  31  patients  started  pegvisomant  treatment,  and  duration  of  exposure  to pegvisomant between 0.14 to 34.3 weeks with a mean of duration 23 weeks.

All 46 subjects were included in the main efficacy analysis; 44 patients completed protocol treatment whereas 2 dropped from the study (protocol violation and voluntary patient decision). IGF-I values at baseline were comparable between groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, the mean percent change from baseline in IGF-I concentrations observed for the 30 mg group was -15.7 ± 4.8. The change observed for  the  80  mg  group  was -31.3% ± 6.7.  No  significant  change  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group ( -0.4% ± 4.8%).  The  observed  difference  between  two  doses  was  not  statistically  significant.  The differences  observed  between  placebo  and  either  of  the  two  doses  were  statistically  significant (ANOVA p=0.0426 for 30 mg group and p=0.0008 for 80 mg group). Of 46 analysed patients, only 7 normalized  their  IGF-I  levels:  one  in  the  placebo  group,  two  (12.5%)  in  the  30  mg  group  and  4 (26.7%)  in  the  80  mg  group.  In  the  treated  patients  the  effect  was  obtained  after  2-3  weeks  of treatment. For secondary endpoints, at 6 weeks, the mean percent changes observed for placebo for free  IGF-I  and  IGF-I/BP-3  were  lower  than  those  observed  for  the  80  mg  group  (p=0.068  and  p= 0.050, respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed for signs and symptoms of acromegaly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  total,  36  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  study  SEN-3613.  This  included  34/44  patients  that  had completed  SEN-3611.  Of  the  remaining  10/44  patients,  4  did  not  enrol,  due  to  voluntary  decision, whilst 6 delayed participation (one for incurring haematuria, 5 because of lack of supply of medicinal product). The patient that had voluntarily dropped out before completion of SEN-3611 and one patient that had not previously been enrolled onto SEN-3611 were also included (in violation of the protocol). After inclusion into SEN-3613, 4 patients dropped out from the study, 2 of whom because of lack of efficacy (headache, and lack of response for IGF-I, respectively). No formal efficacy analyses were performed, although promising results were noted in terms of mean IGF-I concentrations over time.

Results from SEN-3611 and SEN-3613 had shown only a small proportion of patients with normalized IGF-I levels. A new dose regimen was proposed to be tested in SEN-3613A study a daily dose of 10 mg/day allowing  for  dose  increase  up  to  40  mg  and  following  an  80  mg  loading  dose.  In  total  38 patients were included in study SEN-3613A. The 32/36 patients that completed SEN-3613 continued onto the amended SEN-3613A, together with the 6 patients that had delayed participation following completion  of  SEN-3611.  Treatment  was  still  ongoing  for  7/38  patients,  at  the  cut-off  date  for  the study  report  submitted  (31  May  2000).  No  formal  efficacy  analyses  were  performed.  Mean  IGF-I levels  for  the  32  patients  who  continued  directly  from  SEN-3613  decreased  from  900  prior  to pegvisomant treatment to 445, and 275 ng/ml, at the end of SEN-3613, and after switching to daily dosing  in  SEN-3613A,  respectively.  Normalisation  of  IGF-I  concentrations  had  been  observed  in 37/38  subjects  in  the  course  of  study  SEN-3613A,  and  35  (92%)  patients  had  normal  IGF-I concentrations at the time of data cut off. The effect was more frequently observed with the 10 mg/day dose. The weighted average dose at which IGF-I first normalized was 14.4 mg/day. No improvement was observed with the new regimen for secondary efficacy end points such as mean score for total signs and symptoms of acromegaly, and ring size, for patients who had participated in both studies (SEN-3613 and SEN-3613 A)

## SEN-3614 and follow-up (SEN-3615)

A total of 112 patients were entered into study SEN-3614 and 108 completed protocol treatment. The study was conducted in 16 centres in the EU and U. S. A. Four subjects withdrew prematurely, two in the  placebo  arm  (protocol  violation  and  lack  of  efficacy,  respectively),  and  two  in  the  15  mg/day group (lack of efficacy, and transaminase increase, respectively). One patient was withdrawn 5 days after treatment start, and before the first efficacy assessment, because review of baseline MRI revealed a large pituitary adenoma requiring prompt surgical referral. This patient was excluded from the main efficacy analysis. The number of patients included in efficacy analyses was 111 (with 31, 26, 26, and 28 patients entered into the placebo, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d pegvisomant arm, respectively).

Patient  characteristics  were  comparable  across  treatment  arms  in  terms  of  age,  gender,  duration  of acromegaly, and previous treatments. Baseline IGF-I levels were also similar, i.e. ,  670 ± 52, 627 ± 49, 649 ± 58, and 732 ± 39 ng/ml for placebo, and 10, 15, and 20 mg/day groups, respectively. In the main efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint, IGF-I values for all pegvisomant groups were statistically significantly  different  from  placebo  at  all  post-baseline  visits,  and  was  dose-related  (Table  3).  The reduction in IGF-I was significantly greater with pegvisomant 20 mg than 10 mg at all visits, and the 15  mg  dose  was  significantly  better  than  10  mg  from  week  8  onward.  Pegvisomant  20  mg  was significantly better than the 15 mg dose at weeks 4 and 12.

A subgroup analysis of 49 subjects receiving somatostatin analogues prior to study entry compared IGF-I values at 12 weeks with those measured during patient selection, when patients remained on their prior therapy. A decrease at 12 weeks of 39% and 32 % in IGF-I was observed in the 15 mg/day and 20mg/day groups, respectively.

The proportion of patients whose IGF-I concentrations became normal was significantly higher in all pegvisomant groups as compared to placebo at each visit. A summary of week-12 results is presented in Table 4.

At week 12 a decrease from baseline was observed for the severity score of all individual signs and symptoms of acromegaly in all three Somavert groups, with the largest decrease in the 20 mg/d group, compared to baseline. Conversely, an increase was observed in the placebo group. All three Somavert groups had statistically significant improvements in total signs and symptoms score compared with the placebo group. A dose - response was observed in the change in ring size (Table 5).

Dose-dependent, statistically significant reductions in concentrations of free IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and ALS (the  acid-labile  subunit  of  the  free  IGF)  were  observed  at  all  post-baseline  evaluations  in  patients treated with pegvisomant. The mean serum concentrations for each of these measures at baseline and the change from baseline at week 12 are summarised in table 6.

About 50% of the patients recruited had received radiotherapy prior to entry into the study. A retrospective  analysis  of  SEN-3614  study  was  conducted  to  study  the  impact  of  prior

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

radiotherapy on IGF-I response. Results showed  that IGF-I response was generally comparable regardless of history of previous radiotherapy, or duration of radiotherapy.

## Patient follow-up

SEN-3615 followed SEN 3614 and included a total of 109 patients at the cut-off date (31 May 2000). These included 102/108 patients that had completed SEN-3614, whilst 6 patients did not continue onto the follow-up study (due to either inconvenience or delay in IRB approval). Additionally, one patient that had dropped-out from SEN-3614 entered the follow-up study, together with 6 new patients (these were admitted by protocol, at the discretion of the sponsor). At the cut-off date, the mean exposure for daily dosing was 41.6 weeks (range 1 day - 80 weeks).

Mean IGF-I levels decreased from 567 ng/ml (SEM ± 37) at the start of SEN-3615 to 349 ng/ml ( ± 18) at the cut-off date, having been 718 ng/ml ( ± 31) at the start of SEN-3614. This represents a reduction of  47.8%  from  the  start  of  SEN-3614.  IGF-I  levels  became  normal  in  92.6  %  of  the  patients.  This percentage was slightly lower than reported in SEN-3613A, possibly because some patients were still in the dose-titration phase at the time of clinical data cut-off. One subject developed a transient GH antibody titre of 1:1024, which fell to 1:128, despite an increase in the dose of pegvisomant from 15 to 25 mg/day. His IGF-I level became normal on the 25 mg dose and remained normal throughout the remainder of the trial. GH increased from 9.7 ng/ml ( ± 1.65) at baseline to 19.0 ng/ml ( ± 2.72) at the cut-off date. As was observed in other studies, there were no clinically significant changes in pituitary remnant volume as measured by MRI with the exception of one patient

## Comparison with somatostatin analogues

The Company  presented a comparison between study SEN-3614  and published results for somatostatin analogues. The literature review presented pooled results from 27 published studies that reported percent IGF-I normalization using somatostatin analogues. The severity of acromegaly of the published series was similar to that of patients in the clinical studies with Somavert. Normalisation of IGF-I  ranged  from  22-74%.  These  values  were  compared  with  the  results  from  the  pegvisomant studies (97%-SEN3613A and 92.6 %-SEN 3615). The differences were claimed by the Company to be due to the different mechanisms of action of these two classes of active substances (dependency of somatostatin analogues upon the presence of somatostatin receptors in the tumour tissue and the GH receptor in normal tissues, e.g. liver as a target receptor for Somavert). Cardiovascular (bradycardia, arrhythmia), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, flatulence) and endocrinological (hypothyroidism  and  hyperglycaemia)  adverse  events  were  frequently  observed  with  somatostatin analogues and less commonly in the clinical trials with Somavert. Elevation in serum aminotransferases was more frequently observed with Somavert and elevations in liver function tests were observed for both types of agents.

The Company also presented a subgroup analysis of 49 patients previously treated by somatostatin analogues in SEN-3614. In this subgroup, a total of 19 patients had normalised IGF-I levels at the time

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of selection while still undergoing previous treatment. After 12-week treatment by pegvisomant 15, and 20 mg/day, 9/11 (81.8%), and 12/14 (85.7%) had normalized IGF-I levels, against percentages with somatostatin analogues observed at screening of 3/12 (25%), and 7/14 (50%), for the two doses, respectively. In the 10 mg/day group, 4/9 (44.4%) had normalised IGF-I levels at the time of selection, but only 2/9 (22.2%) had normalized their IGF-I levels after the 12-week treatment by pegvisomant 10 mg/day.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No specific studies have been performed in special populations, such as children, patients with renal or hepatic impairment .

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

The  proposed  dosing  schedule  of  10  to  30  mg  once  daily  is  based  on  data  from  SEN-3614,  SEN3613A, and SEN-3615. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled study SEN-3614, daily doses of 10 to 20  mg  resulted  in  significant  reductions  of  mean  serum  IGF-I  concentration  and  significant percentages of patients whose IGF-I concentrations were normalized. The 80 mg loading dose is based on  results  from  study  SEN-3614,  which  included  this  loading  dose  regimen  and  demonstrated reductions of serum IGF-I concentrations within 2 weeks of treatment initiation.

The  efficacy  of  a  daily  pegvisomant  therapy  of  10-30  mg,  following  a  80  mg  bolus  dose  was demonstrated compared to placebo in the phase III SEN-3614 study. The proportion of subjects with normalized IGF-I concentrations was significantly greater for each of pegvisomant doses at each time point compared to placebo.

No comparative clinical trial was carried out versus a reference medicinal product and the submitted documentation did not allow to conclude on the respective efficacy of Somavert versus somatostatin analogues. This is reflected in the approved indication. From a pharmacodynamic point of view, the mechanisms of action of somatostatin analogues and pegvisomant appear complementary (decrease of secretion + blocking the binding to receptors) and on this basis the Company has committed to explore the benefit of combination treatment using somatostatin analogues with pegvisomant by conducting a post-authorisation  clinical  study.  Combination  therapy  is  at  present  not  recommended  and  this  is appropriately reflected in the approved indication.

## Clinical Safety

## Patient exposure

In  total  260  different  patients  were  enrolled  into  one  or  more  of  the  clinical  trials  with pegvisomant.  These  were  48  healthy  volunteers,  167  acromegalic  patients,  and  45  diabetic subjects. The primary population considered in the analysis of clinical safety consisted of the 167 individual acromegalic patients recruited into one or more of the clinical trials (6, 43, 1, 111, and 6 new patients recruited into SEN3602, 3611, 3613, 3614, and 3615, respectively). Of  the  167  patients,  7  received  placebo  only,  40  received  placebo  initially  and  started pegvisomant  at  some  later  point,  and  120  received  pegvisomant  initially.  Thus,  for  the primary analysis of safety, two groups were considered: cases having received pegvisomant at any time  (n=160),  and  cases  having  received  placebo  at  any  time  (n=47),  with  40  patients being considered in both groups, depending on the different treatment considered.

The  main  demographic  characteristics  of  these  two  groups  are  shown  in  Table  7.  There  were  no pregnant,  lactating,  postmenopausal,  or  surgically  sterile  female  patients.  All  the  patients  were  18 years  of  age  or  older  with  a  diagnosis  of  acromegaly  and  an  IGF-I  value  30%  (or  50%)  or  greater above the upper limit of normal at screening.

Exposure to pegvisomant is summarised in Table 8. Of the 260 different subjects enrolled in all Somavert trials, 241 received active substance. Among them, 52 received 30 and 40 mg per week and 152 received 5 to 40. One patient treated with 80 mg per day took an accidental overdose of 80 mg per day, and is discussed separately.

## Adverse events

Adverse event (AE) occurrence was determined by non-specific questioning at the assessments visits. Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms (TESS) were defined as any AE that occurred on or after the start of study treatment administration or a pre-existing AE that changed in severity or relationship while on therapy.

The  overall  incidence  of  TESS  reported  by  at  least  5%  of  all  subjects  (48  healthy  volunteers,  167 acromegalic patients, and 45 patients with diabetes) was similar in the pegvisomant (78%) and in the placebo  (68%)  groups  with  a  maximum  treatment  duration  for  each  group  of  34.6  and  3  months respectively.

There were 23 AEs that occurred ≥ 5% more commonly in patients on pegvisomant compared with placebo. The most likely explanation for the difference between the groups is the longer duration of observation in the pegvisomant group (up to 34.6 months versus 3 months).

The majority of AEs were mild in severity. Fifty out of the 167 acromegalic patients were reported to have  a  total  of  73  SAEs  with  an  overall  incidence  of  TESS  of  85%  for  pegvisomant  and  70%  for placebo. The only AE that was graded severe in ≥ 5% of patients was headache, which is a common symptom of acromegaly. Severe headache was reported in 7% of patients on pegvisomant but also 4% on placebo.

The majority of AEs were judged as not related, or remotely related to study treatment with either pegvisomant or placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Common AEs considered more often related (possibly, probably, or definitely) were injection site  reaction  (10%  related  versus  1%  not  related  in  the  pegvisomant  group  and  4%  related versus 0% not related in the placebo group); dizziness (2% related versus 8% not related in the  pegvisomant  group  and  4%  related  versus  0%  not  related  in  the  placebo  group)  and sweating (2% related versus 5% not related in the pegvisomant group and 9% related versus 0% not related in placebo).

Differences between groups were observed in the body as a whole (65% pegvisomant group vs 39% placebo group). Within this term, Individual symptoms included infection (23% vs 3%), flu syndrome (15% vs 2%), accidental injury (16% vs 3%), injection site reaction (12% vs 3%), nervous, metabolic and nutritional disorders systems.

Most of the reported TESS were considered mild in severity in both groups and not or remotely related to study medication (42.3% in the pegvisomant group against 74.6% in the placebo group). Among those considered as more often related to study medication were injection site reaction, dizziness and sweating.

Within the most commonly used doses of 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day, there was evidence of  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  diarrhoea,  nausea,  flatulence,  and  somnolence.    The number of subjects treated with 5 mg, 35 mg, and 40 mg was considered too small for a meaningful comparison  with  other  doses.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  infection  (reported  by  17%, 13%, and 13% of subjects receiving 10, 15, and 20 mg pegvisomant daily, respectively) and headache (reported by 18% of subjects receiving 20 mg of pegvisomant daily).

## Deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs)

Six deaths were  reported during the pegvisomant  clinical program. None  was  attributed to pegvisomant.

A total of 81 SAEs were reported by 55 subjects including 41 pegvisomant subjects (who experienced 59 events), 3 placebo subjects and 11 subjects who were not receiving any study medication. Of the 59 SAEs reported by pegvisomant treated subjects, 50 were considered not related or remotely related to treatment while 9 events in 6 subjects were considered as possibly or probably related to pegvisomant therapy.  Among  SAEs  considered  as  possibly  related  to  pegvisomant  therapy  there  were  :  acute vertigo (Meniere's syndrome) and overdose with active substance (administration of 80 mg/day dose during  7  days  leading  to  fatigue  and  dry  mouth)  both  occurred  with  a  regimen  of  80  mg/  week  of active  substance.  The  remaining  seven  SAEs  which  occurred  with  20  mg/day  dose  regimen  were: hospitalisation  for  panic  attacks,  chest  pain  and  blocked  artery,  artery  occlusion,  hypoglycaemia, intermittent angina with exertion, myocardial infarction.

Three cases of cancer were discovered during trials. One case of prostate carcinoma was observed in the  placebo  group  in  SEN-3614.  Two  cases  (pancreatic  carcinoma  and  colon  carcinoma)  were observed in the group treated with pegvisomant 10 mg/day in SEN-3613A study. One further case of gastric carcinoma was observed after the data cut off.

## Withdrawals

Eleven out acromegalic patients were withdrawn prematurely primarily due to AEs or death. The events that led to premature discontinuation in acromegaly patients were: death attributed to  myocardial  infarction,  elevated  liver  function  tests,  lipohypertrophy,  severe  headache, limbs  oedema,  cerebrovascular  accident,  pancreatic  cancer,  weight  gain  and  the  case  of gastric carcinoma reported after the data cut-off date.

## Laboratory examinations

## Liver function tests

Elevations of ALT and AST &gt;1.9 times the upper limit of normal (Table 11) and minimal changes in lipids  metabolism  (Table 12) were observed for a small percentage of the 235 and the 59 subjects treated  with  pegvisomant  or  placebo,  respectively,  for  whom  laboratory  data  were  available.  ALT elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 5 patients.  Two patients were withdrawn due to significantly increased AST and ALT levels (compared to normal). One was withdrawn from SEN 3614 study, after 8 weeks of 15 mg/day pegvisomant treatment and the other from SEN-3613A, after 4 weeks of 10 mg/day pegvisomant treatment. Regarding ALT, no difference in the incidence of abnormal value in subjects treated with weekly (5.8%) and daily (6.4%) doses of pegvisomant was observed. Regarding AST, one subject (2%) had abnormal value at weekly regimen compared to 6 subjects (3.3%) on daily dosing. There was no relationship between medication dose and change in mean ALT and AST concentrations. Time to first ALT and AST elevation was observed from 4 to 21 weeks of pegvisomant intake, mostly between 4 and 8 weeks.

## Lipid profile

Exogenous administration of GH is known to upregulate LDL receptors and lead to increased LDL clearance,  and  an  improved  lipid  profile  with  a  better  cholesterol  catabolism 8 .  GH  also  has diabetogenic effects, inducing insulin resistance with lowering of HDL and increases of triglycerides. As expected, pegvisomant tended to increase both LDL and HDL cholesterol. Total cholesterol values (normal limit0-5.14 mmol/l) increased slightly in all treated patients from 5.1 mol/l to 5.3 mmol/l at 12 weeks. Triglicerides remained stable at a mean value of 1.8 mmol/l. No increase was observed for the placebo-treated  patients.  In  the  SEN-3614  study,  a  slight  dose-relation  is  observed  with  cholesterol (Table 12). Lipid analysis results including all subjects treated with pegvisomant (healthy volunteers, acromegaly patients and diabetic patients) were also provided. Overall, a slight increase at 12 weeks compared  to  baseline  was  observed  for  total  cholesterol  (5.11  against  5.18  mmol/l),  for  HDLCholesterol  (1.10  against  1.17  mmol/l).  A  slight  decrease  was  observed  for  LDL  Cholesterol  (3.21 against 3.16 mmol/l) and triglicerides (1.74 against 1.7 mmol/l). In all treated acromegalic patients, an increase of triglycerides was observed (1.59 at baseline against 1.78 mmol/l at end-point). A decrease of total triglycerides was observed in the diabetic population (2.59 at baseline against 1.92 mmol/l at 12 weeks). This might be due to possibly decreased insulin resistance associated with GH antagonism.

## Neutralising antibodies

It was not technically feasible to measure anti-pegvisomant antibodies from the serum of pegvisomant treated patients.

Among 154 patients tested for the presence of anti-GH antibodies, 27 (16.9%) had at least one positive sample with elevated titre. No relationship was found between the development of these isolated lowtitre anti-GH antibodies and treatment duration or study dose medication. No antibodies were detected in  any  subjects  taking  placebo.  Currently  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  relationship  between  anti-GH antibodies  and  a  decrease  in  efficacy  or  an  increase  in  adverse  events  frequency.    As  with  any recombinant  protein,  the  clinical  significance  of  developed  antibodies  is  unknown  and  therefore should be monitored.

## Pituitary Tumour Size/MRI Results

In  order  to  assess  whether  pegvisomant  had  any  effects  on  tumour  size,  MRIs  were  analysed  at baseline, every 6 months and at the final visit in 5 studies (SEN-3611, 3613, 3613A, 3614 and 3615). Results  for  changes  in  tumour  volume  by  prior  tumour  therapy  were  presented  (prior  treatment included  surgery  alone,  radiation  alone,  and  the  combination  of  surgery  and  radiation).  Overall, subjects  who  received  pegvisomant  had  no  significant  change  in  tumour  volume  from  baseline  to endpoint (mean of 11.5 months between baseline and final MRI) compared with a slight decrease of 0.22 cc  in  the  placebo  group  (mean  of  2.5 months  between  MRIs).  However,  in  the  subgroup  of patients with surgery alone as prior treatment an increase of 0.10 cc was observed in the pegvisomant group, whereas a decrease of 30 cc was observed in the placebo group.This was probably due to two patients  in  the  pegvisomant  group  who  required  treatment  due  to  progression  in  tumour  size  (from 2.93 cm 3 to 5.41 cm 3 in one case and from 5.53 cm 3 to 8.71 cm 3 in the second one). Both had large, globular  tumours  with  impingement  on  the  optic  chiasm  at  baseline.  A  single  patient  experienced growth from 5.53 cm 3 to  8.71  cm 3 during  intermittent  pegvisomant treatment, and was treated with radiotherapy. The second (3613A-401) had an increase in tumour volume from 2.93 cm 3 to 5.41 cm 3 over a period of 31 months on intermittent pegvisomant and octreotide treatment.

## Elevations in Serum GH Concentrations

SEN-3614  results  showed  that  serum  GH  concentrations  increased  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  in patients  treated  by  pegvisomant.  Serum  GH  concentrations  were  also  observed  to  increase  in  the follow-up studies (SEN 3613 and SEN 3613-A). The mean serum GH concentrations stabilised once serum IGF-I concentrations became normal. The rise occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Thereafter GH levels remained stable.

## Insulin sensitivity

Data  from  SEN  -3611  and  SEN  -3613A  studies  in  patients  with  acromegaly  showed  a  decrease  in fasting insulin from 22.62 ± 3.40 at the beginning of SEN -3611 study to 13.08 ± 2.01 at data cut off, without any changes in glucose levels, suggesting a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity.

In  the  SEN-3631  study,  pegvisomant  was  assessed  in  13  subjects  with  type  1  diabetes  and  in  12 subjects with type 2 diabetes. Mean fasting plasma glucose decreased from 11.6 mmol/L at baseline to 9.2 mmol/L at Week 12 (21% decrease); mean HbA1c decreased from 8.54% at baseline to 7.82% at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Week  12  for the composite group (decrease of 0.72). Four non-serious adverse events of hypoglycaemia were reported.

A warning regarding the hypoglycaemic risk in diabetic patients treated either by insulin or by oral hypoglycaemic agents is mentioned in the SPC (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5).

## Vital signs

No meaningful changes were noted in vital signs or anthropometrical parameters. Pegvisomant had no clinically  significant  effect  on  these  safety  parameters.  No  meaningful  changes  were  produced  in ECG.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

Given the short follow-up, there is presently no evidence that treatment with pegvisomant results in pituitary  tumour  growth  or  regression.  Tumour  size,  should,  however,  be  monitored  periodically during treatment with Somavert. Long-term follow-up on tumour size will be provided by the planned post-market  database.  Taking  into  account  that  somatostatin  analogues  reduce  tumour  size  in  a substantial  proportion  of  patients,  Somavert  was  considered  inferior  to  somatostatin  analogues  in terms  of  tumour  control.  In  order  to  clarify  the  precise  impact  of  Somavert  on  tumour  growth,  the Company have committed to conduct a long-term  study  of  tumour  volume  in  patients  treated  with Somavert as part of their post-authoriation obligations.Serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase should be monitored at four to six week intervals for the first six months of treatment with Somavert, or at the occurrence of any signs suggestive of hepatitis. A warning and recommendations on monitoring of liver enzymes has been included in the SPC (see section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use ). A warning regarding the hypoglycaemic risk in diabetic patients treated either by insulin or by oral hypoglycaemic agents is mentioned in the SPC (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5). The clinical significance of the detected serum anti-GH antibodies is unknown. Given that Somavert is intended for long-term administration, correct assessment of the immunogenicity of pegvisomant remains important and will be further explored by the Company.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

Except  for  a  limited  number  of  points,  which  can  be  addressed  as  part  of  post-authorisation commitments, the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the  conditions  defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Viral  safety  and  batch-to-batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be performed according to the agreed specifications.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

The pharmacodynamic studies presented showed that pegvisomant is a potent competitive and specific antagonist of hGH binding in vitro and in vivo .

Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated dose toxicity in rat and monkey.  However, due to the marked pharmacological response in monkey, systemic exposures higher than those achieved in patients at therapeutic doses have not been studied.

## Clinical efficacy

The  effectiveness  of  a  daily  Somavert  therapy  of  10-30  mg,  following  a  80  mg  bolus  dose  was demonstrated as compared to placebo in the phase III SEN-3614 study. The percentage of subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  normalized  IGF-I  concentrations  was  significantly  greater  for  each  of  Somavert  doses  at  each time point compared to placebo.

There was evidence of a relationship between the dose of Somavert and the percentage of subjects with normalized IGF-I concentrations. The 20 mg dose was statistically superior to the 10 mg dose from week 4 onward. The 15 mg dose is statistically superior to the 10 mg dose from 8 week onward. However, there was no difference between 15 and 20 mg.

The analysis of covariance showed no statistically significant effects for baseline IGF-I, entry strata, baseline GH or gender. Baseline body weight was a statistically significant covariate in the pairwise treatment comparisons.

No comparative clinical trial was carried out versus a reference medicinal product and the submitted documentation did not allow to conclude on the respective efficacy of Somavert versus somatostatin analogues. This is reflected in the approved indication. From a pharmacodynamic point of view, the mechanisms of action of somatostatin analogues and pegvisomant appear complementary (decrease of secretion + blocking the binding to receptors) and on this basis the Company has committed to explore the benefit of combination treatment using somatostatin analogues with pegvisomant by conducting a post-authorisation  clinical  study.  Combination  therapy  is  at  present  not  recommended  and  this  is appropriately reflected in the approved indication.

## Clinical safety

The safety concerns are specifically related to pituitary tumour size and the presented data do not indicate that treatment with Somavert reduces tumour size. Appropriate text regarding the need to monitor tumour growth has been included in the SPC (see section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use). Furthermore, the Company has committed to a long-term post marketing surveillance on pituitary tumour growth.

## Benefit/risk assessment

No comparative trial was conducted with a reference medicinal product, i.e somatostatin analogues. Due  to  the  lack  of  prospective  clinical  efficacy  data  comparing  pegvisomant  to  somatostatin analogues, it was not possible to conclude on the respective efficacy of Somavert versus somatostatin analogues. The safety concerns are specifically related to pituitary tumour size and based on presented data, treatment by Somavert does not reduce tumour size. Therefore, the use of Somavert is limited to the  treatment  of  patients  with  acromegaly  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to  surgery  and/or radiation therapy and in whom an appropriate medical treatment with Somatostatin analogues did not normalize IGF-I concentrations or was not tolerated.

The benefit/risk of Somavert is considered positive and in order to address remaining issues, which are not at present a matter of concern, the Company has committed to quality, safety and efficacy followup measure agreed with the CPMP.

## Recommendation

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Somavert in the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate  response  to  surgery  and/or  radiation  therapy  and  in  whom  an  appropriate  medical treatment with somatostatin analogues did not normalize IGF-I concentrations or was not tolerated was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
