## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen Biologics B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 11 July 2012 an application for a variation.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Simponi              | golimumab                             | See Annex A      |

## The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Type                                                                        |    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| C.1.6 a               | Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II |

The MAH applied for a new indication for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance.

The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0106/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0106/2012 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

TNF α is considered a key inflammatory mediator that exhibits a wide variety of functional activities. Abnormally high levels of TNF α have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several immunemediated diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Binding of TNF α by an anti-TNF α antibody prevents the target from binding to cell surface TNF α receptors and consequently prevents downstream signalling cascades and the deleterious effects of inappropriate or excessive TNF α expression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  EU,  Simponi  is  available  as  a  50  mg  Solution  for  injection  in  prefilled  Pen  and  Solution  for injection in prefilled syringe and is to be administered subcutaneously. The approved indications are:

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for:

-  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe,  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adults  when  the  response  to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has been inadequate.

- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with MTX.

Simponi, in combination with MTX, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

## Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)

Simponi, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic  arthritis  in  adult  patients  when  the  response  to  previous  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic drug  (DMARD)  therapy  has  been  inadequate.  Simponi  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  rate  of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to improve physical function.

## Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

Simponi  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  severe,  active  ankylosing  spondylitis  in  adults  who  have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

This Type II variation application has been submitted to seek approval of a new therapeutic indication for golimumab i.e. 'treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies'.

The application is based on the results of one induction study C0524T17 and of one maintenance study, C0524T18. A long-term extension of study C0524T18 is ongoing through week 228.

A second induction study, study C0524T16, was stopped due to lack of efficacy of single IV induction doses as compared with SC induction in study C0524T17. Efficacy results from this study are not used for support of the UC indication, although PK and safety data from the study is presented.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

On 20th June 2013, the MAH informed the CHMP about misconduct at one study site (site 7407). The CHMP therefore asked the MAH to submit results from all analyses of importance for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Simponi in the new indication, comparing the initial study population and the population where these subjects were omitted. Further to this assessment the MAH excluded efficacy data from 10 of 771 patients in the original primary analysis population of the induction study and from 7 of 463 the original primary analysis population of the maintenance study. The new analyses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

show that the overall effects of removing the data from this site affect the key efficacy outcomes by 01%. The CHMP therefore concluded that data from the new analyses do not change the conclusions on the efficacy results.

The MAH performed additional source data monitoring at seventeen (17) high-enrolling sites in order to assess if further audits were necessary. These sites were chosen based on a risk-assessment algorithm developed by the MAH. The monitoring visits included a thorough assessment of source data for all key efficacy outcomes including a review of the Mayo diary cards, Mayo score calculation, and endoscopy reports at each site. No further cases of misconduct or data integrity issues were identified. Therefore, additional audits were not considered necessary.

At CHMP's request The MAH also confirmed that previously identified non-compliance issues related to the Simponi UC program, including misconduct, were thoroughly investigated and described in the CSRs submitted with this application. The types of observations found at site 7407 were not observed at any other sites in the program.

The studies and results are described below. The data was also used to perform a population PK analysis.

In addition, four phase I studies (CNTO148NAP1001, C0524T23, C0524T15 and C0524T14) in healthy volunteers and RA patients are referred to.

## Introduction

The doses for the clinical studies in UC were chosen based on clinical data of infliximab and knowledge about the relative potency of infliximab and golimumab, since the use of infliximab is already established in UC.

## Phase 2/3 studies in UC

## · Analytical methods

Serum golimumab concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA), in two versions, a bead-based method on a BioVeris platform in C0524T23 and C0524T15, and a plate-based method on a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform in C0524T14, CNTO148NAP1001, C0524T16, C0524T17, and C0524T18. The BioVeris assay has been assessed previously. The MSD method has shown comparable results to the BioVeris assay, when analysing incurred study samples and controls using the ECLIA (MSD) assay, 54 of the 60 samples were within ± 30% of the corresponding BioVeris ECLIA results.

## · Pharmacokinetic data analysis

A population PK analysis was performed to characterize the PK of golimumab and evaluate the influences of subject demographic characteristics and other intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the disposition of golimumab in subjects with UC.

## · Study design

C0524T16 was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, dose-ranging (Part 1), dose-confirming (Part 2), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of IV induction regimens of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or placebo were administered at Week 0. At study termination, a total of 291 subjects had been randomized to treatment, 214 subjects to golimumab (62, 75, and 77 subjects to the 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively) and 77 subjects to placebo. Serum samples for the measurement of golimumab concentrations were drawn before and 1 hour after a single golimumab infusion was administered at Week 0. Samples were also collected at Weeks 2, 4, and 6. An additional sample was collected 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent for subjects who terminated the study and did not continue into the maintenance study (C0524T18).

C0524T17 was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, dose-ranging (Part 1), dose-confirming (Part 2), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of SC induction regimens of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 100 mg and 50 mg, 200 mg and 100 mg or 400 mg and 200 mg or placebo were administered at Week 0 and Week 2 respectively. A total of 1,065 subjects were randomized to treatment, 734 subjects to golimumab (72, 331, and 331 subjects to 100 mg and 50 mg, 200 mg and 100 mg, and 400 mg and 200 mg,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively) and 331 subjects to placebo. Serum samples for the measurement of golimumab concentrations were collected before drug administration at Weeks 0 and 2. Samples were also collected at Weeks 4 and 6. An additional sample was collected 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent for subjects who terminated the study and did not continue into the maintenance study (C0524T18).

C0524T18 was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of golimumab maintenance therapy, administered subcutaneously, in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Doses of 50 mg, 100 mg or placebo were administered every 4 weeks through Week 52. A total of 464 subjects were randomized to treatment, 308 subjects to golimumab (154, and 154 subjects to 50 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and 156 subjects to placebo. Subjects who achieved clinical response with golimumab in an induction study (i.e., randomized subjects) but who subsequently lost clinical response at any time during C0524T18 were eligible for a single dose adjustment through Week 52. Serum samples for the measurement of golimumab concentrations were collected prior to study agent administration at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36 and 44. Additional samples were also collected at a visit between Weeks 16 and 24 and at Weeks 30 and 54.

## · Study results

## Study C0524T16

In this study, golimumab was administered intravenously at three different dose levels (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg). It was prematurely stopped because of better results from the SC induction study (C0524T17), but included 291 subjects. Serum PK samples were collected at each scheduled visit through week 6.

Figure 1 Median serum golimumab concentration over 6 weeks after a single IV dose of Simponi 1 (n=63), 2 (n=74) and 4m (n=76) mg/kg.

<!-- image -->

The median serum golimumab levels at 6 weeks were 0.16, 0.56 and 1.40 µg/ml after single dose IV administration of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. 27% of the patients receiving 1 mg/ml, 11% receiving 2 mg/kg and none in the high dose group had undetectable levels (&lt;0.03905 μ g/ml) at week 6. None of the patients were positive for golimumab antibodies.

## Study C0524T17

In this study, golimumab was administered SC on week 0 and week 2 at three different dose levels (100 mg + 50 mg, 200 mg + 100 mg, 400 mg + 200 mg). Serum PK samples were collected at each scheduled visit through week 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The median serum golimumab levels at 6 weeks were 0.78, 1.78 and 4.01 μ g/ml after 2 SC doses of 100+50, 200+100 and 400+200 mg, respectively. Very few patients had undetectable levels (&lt;0.03905 μ g/ml) at week 6 (3.4%, 0.3%, and 0.4%). Of the 721 patients, 3 were positive for golimumab antibodies.

## Study C0524T18

Steady state was judged to be reached at week 8 (14 weeks from start of induction) and the steady state level was approximately dose proportional (at week 8-44, median drug concentration was 0.690.83 μ g/ml in the 50 mg dose group and 1.33-1.58 μ g/ml in the 100 mg group). Median plasma levels for randomized subjects who had received the 200 + 100 mg SC induction are shown in Figure 3.

<!-- image -->

At Week 8 of C0524T18, median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations in subjects who were randomized to placebo from the SC golimumab induction treatment groups were either low (0.39 μg/mL in the 400 mg → 200 mg and 0.08 μg/mL 200 mg → 100 mg groups) or below the limit of quantification (golimumab 100 mg → 50 mg group). In subjects who were randomized to golimumab 100 mg, the median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations at Week 8 were 1.54 μg/mL, 1.60 μg/mL, and 1.14 μg/mL for subjects receiving golimumab SC induction at 400 mg → 200 mg, 200 mg → 100 mg, or 100 mg → 50 mg, respectively. In subjects who were randomized to golimumab 50 mg, the median pre-administration serum golimumab concentrations at Week 8 were 1.01 μg/mL, 0.85μg/mL, and 0.60 μg/mL for subjects receiving golimumab SC induction at 400 mg → 200 mg, 200 mg → 100 mg, or 100 mg → 50 mg, respectively. In general, steady state was reached approximately 8 weeks after maintenance doses were initiated (i.e., 14 weeks after the start of induction treatment) in randomized subjects from the SC induction treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of Immunomodulator Use on Serum Golimumab Concentration

Of the 308 subjects in C0524T18 randomized to golimumab, 30.8% (95 subjects) were receiving immunomodulators at Week 0 of induction (30.2% receiving 6-MP or AZA and 0.6% receiving MTX), and 69.2% (213 subjects) were not receiving immunomodulators (C0524T18 54-week CSR\\Tab2).

Median serum golimumab concentrations for randomized subjects receiving golimumab 100 mg were comparable irrespective of baseline immunomodulator use status while median serum golimumab concentrations were slightly but consistently higher across all time points in subjects receiving golimumab 50 mg in combination with immunomodulators compared to those in subjects receiving golimumab 50 mg without immunomodulator use.

## Pharmacokinetics in target population (popPK analysis of data from subjects with UC)

Serum golimumab concentration-time data was analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methods (NONMEM with FOCE-I). The objectives of the analysis were to quantify population PK model parameters including typical values and random variability and identify covariates which significantly influence golimumab pharmacokinetics in subjects with UC.

The analysis was conducted with data from two induction studies ( C0524T16 and C0524T17 ) and one maintenance study ( C0524T18 ) in subjects with UC. A total of 11,280 serum golimumab concentrations from 1,227 UC subjects were included in the population PK analysis. There were ten outlier samples excluded from the analysis. In the population PK dataset, serum golimumab concentrations below limit of quantification (BLQ) were replaced with half of the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). For this population PK analysis, the first post dose BLQ data within a dosing interval was included in the analysis, while BLQ data in a sample prior to the first administration of the drug along with trailing BLQ data were excluded from the final PopPK data set. Thus, all available BLQ data were not included in the calculation of % BLQ. Of the 11,280 serum golimumab concentration samples in the final population PK analysis dataset, 590 samples (5.2%) were BLQ. These samples were associated with the first BLQ samples within a dosing interval and were set to half of the LLOQ value for the population PK analysis; however, trailing BLQ samples (n= 572) were excluded from the analysis data set.

All significant covariates identified in previous population PK analyses of golimumab including:

- body weight,
- C-reactive protein (CRP),
- antibody to golimumab status,
- smoking status,
- subject's sex

were assessed for influence on the PK variability of golimumab. In addition, the following covariates were assessed:

- body surface area,
- lean body mass,
- age,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- albumin,
- white blood cell count,
- estimated creatinine clearance,
- hepatic enzymes,
- Mayo score,
- disease duration,
- race (Caucasians versus non-Caucasians, Japanese versus non- Japanese),
- concomitant use of immunomodulators (azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine/ or methotrexate, AZA/6-MP or MTX).

In general, baseline values of the covariates were used in modeling with the exception of antibody to golimumab status or where otherwise specified. Continuous covariates were normalized to the approximate median or selected reference value of the respective covariate as determined from the dataset. Categorical covariates were entered into the model using index variables (0 or 1) and as a fractional change relative to the reference group (usually assigned a 0). Empirical Bayesian estimates (EBEs) were generated from the estimation step in NONMEM. An exploratory graphical evaluation of covariate- parameter relationships was performed. The shrinkages of PK parameters were taken into consideration while assessing plots based on EBEs. A trend between a covariate and a PK parameter led to direct assessment in NONMEM. Final covariate model selection was conducted using a stepwise backward elimination procedure starting with the 'full' covariate model. If the effects of two covariates were highly correlated (r&gt;0.7), it was not considered appropriate to incorporate both covariates on the same parameter in the full model. In such a case, the variable with the highest significance (i.e., largest decrease in objective function value (OFV) from the base model), or better clinical utility was used. In the event that highly correlated covariates were identified for different model parameters (e.g. body weight on CL and body surface area on V2), only one of the correlated covariates was included on the different model parameters.

General goodness-of-fit of the final PK model was evaluated by examining a variety of diagnostic and summary graphics. Model stability was tested through the evaluation of the condition number. The covariance step was implemented with each NONMEM run and standard errors for parameter estimates, along with correlations between parameters, were evaluated. A nonparametric bootstrap approach was used to compute confidence intervals for the PK parameters.

## Supporting phase 1 studies

The applicant is also referring to four phase I studies with rich PK sampling.

CNTO148NAP1001 (completed April 2011) was comparing a single SC dose of golimumab (200 or 400 mg) in male Caucasian (n=24) and Japanese (n=25) subjects. Similar mean AUC and half life were observed in the two ethnic groups. The mean AUC inf in Caucasians was 246 ug.day/ml after the 200 mg dose and 535 ug.day/ml after the 400 mg dose, thus golimumab appeared dose-proportional in this range.

Study C0524T23 was previously submitted and assessed the PK profile, tolerability and safety of golimumab single SC dose of 50 and 100 mg, and has been assessed previously. The mean AUC inf in Caucasians was 48 ug.day/ml after a 50 mg dose and 129 ug.day/ml after a 100 mg dose, suggesting approximately dose proportionality.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study C0524T15 was assessing the absolute bioavailability of SC administration of golimumab in healthy subjects, and has been assessed previously as part of the initial MAA.

Study C0524T14 was assessing the multiple dose PK of golimumab in RA patients after IV and SC administration, and has been assessed previously as part of variation II10 (approved in July 2010).

The study CNTO148NAP1001 and C0524T23 together were used to claim dose proportionality between 50 and 400 mg golimumab SC.

The PK parameters in healthy subjects after rich sampling in study C0524T15 was used to compare golimumab PK in healthy subjects to that in UC patients. In the population PK analysis of data from UC patients, golimumab Cl was estimated to be 0.544 L/day in a 70 kg subject. This value is similar to the Cl of 0.480 L/day for a 70 kg subject determined in study C0524T15. The half lives were also similar between the studies - 10.5 compared with 10.9 days. The MAH is also referring to PK data from RA patients (study C0524T14), where Cl/70 kg was estimated to be 0.535 L/day and half life 13 H and 11 days, with and without concomitant administration of methotrexate.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder involving the large intestines and the rectum. The diseases is characterised by episodes of increased stool frequency and bloody diarrhoea. TNF-α is considered a key inflammatory mediator that exhibits a wide variety of functional activities and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC.

## Mechanism of action

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that forms high affinity, stable complexes with both the soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-α, which prevents the binding of TNF-α to its receptors. There are no new data related to pharmacodynamics in this application.

## Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

For treated subjects in the phase III maintenance study C0524T18 who were randomized to receive golimumab, the proportions of subjects in clinical response through Week 54 and the proportions of subjects in clinical remission at both Week 30 and Week 54 were summarized by golimumab concentration quartile at Week 54.

The proportion of subjects in clinical response through Week 54 was greatest among subjects in the highest concentration quartile (≥4.13 µg/mL; Figure 4). The proportion of subjects in clinical response through Week 54 was higher in subjects with golimumab concentration of ≥2.51 to &lt;4.13 µg/mL compared with the proportions of subjects with serum golimumab concentrations of ≥1.63 to &lt;2.51 µg/mL and &lt;1.63 µg/mL.

The non-randomized non-responder group had approximately half the median drug levels before receiving the first maintenance dose compared with the randomized responders (1.31 compared with 2.28-2.50 μ g/ml).

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

In study C0524T16 the mean concentration at week 6 was slightly lower than expected assuming dose proportionality. This could be due to limitations in the assay of golimumab and/or non-linear PK due to target mediated drug disposition (which is expected for an IgG-based antibody). Proportionality in exposure is approximately 1 µg/mL. In study C0524T17, dose proportionality was seen for all the doses based on median serum concentrations. In study C0524T18, with the proposed regimen, steady state golimumab levels were reached before week 14 after start of induction and the steady state levels were proportional between the 50 and 100 mg/4 weeks dose group.

The choice of nonlinear mixed effects modeling for the analysis of the data is appropriate. The calculation of the fraction of concentration measurements below limit of quantification (BLQ) was made after exclusion of pre-dose and 'trailing' BLQ data. However, the MAH stated that 'trailing' BLQ data amounted to n=572 which, together with the BLQ data in the final PopPK data set, would sum up to ~10% of the data. There was a high frequency of BLQ values at week 6 in the 1 mg/kg dose group in study C0524T16 as well as signs of non-proportional relation between doses with respect to median concentration at week 6. This should be viewed from the perspective of target mediated drug disposition which would lead to non-linear PK. Due to the relatively large number of BLQ values in the information rich part of the plasma concentration time profile, non-linear disposition may be obscured. The MAH does not seem to have explored this possibility during the structural model building phase. However, due to limitations of the bioassay, the low concentrations of golimumab may be subject to bias and detection of the potential non-linearity in PK difficult to perform.

The method for covariate modeling which consisted of inclusion based on graphical exploration and significance testing in NONMEM followed by backward deletion from the tentative 'full' model is sensitive to shrinkage which was reported to range from 17.7% for ETA2 (CL) to 44.7% for ETA1 (V2). However, a large number of covariates were included in direct significance testing in NONMEM which means that in practice a forward inclusion-backward deletion method was performed, at least for covariate effects on golimumab clearance. This partly mitigates the negative impact of shrinkage on this analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from the two phase I studies indicate approximate dose proportionality of golimumab in the dose range 50-400 mg, but in line with what was observed in study C0524T16, slightly lower AUC than expected assuming dose proportionality was observed for the lowest dose. This could be due to limitations in the bioassay and/or target mediated drug disposition, which is expected for an IgG-based antibody. The data provided suggest similar PK (Cl as well as half life) in UC patients compared with RA patients and healthy subjects.

The MAH has provided an analysis of golimumab dose linearity/proportionality in UC patients based on observed plasma concentration vs. time data. Looking at the IV data, there are some signs of disproportional increase in concentration in the range from 1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg for IV administration (at Week 6 after start of administration). For the SC data there is a similar trend at week 6 after start of administration, albeit more subtle. The MAH speculated that this may be due to target mediated drug disposition as expected for a monoclonal antibody. Looking at the totality of data and taking the rather limited deviation from proportionality into account it is fair to conclude that pharmacokinetics of golimumab is approximately dose-proportional following SC administration over a dose range of 50 mg to 400 mg.

Following induction doses of 200 mg and 100 mg golimumab at week 0 and 2, respectively, and maintenance doses of 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks thereafter to patients with UC, serum golimumab concentrations reached steady state approximately 14 weeks after the start of therapy. Treatment with 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab subcutaneous every 4 weeks during maintenance resulted in a mean steady-state trough serum concentration of approximately 0.9 ± 0.5 µ g/ml and 1.8 ± 1.1 µ g/ml, respectively. In UC patients treated with 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks, concomitant use of immunomodulators did not have a substantial effect on steady-state trough levels of golimumab.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Since golimumab is an IgG-based antibody directed towards TNF-alpha, target mediated drug disposition is expected. The data provided from both from healthy subjects and UC patients suggested a slightly more than dose-proportional increase in golimumab exposure. The PK in patients with UC does not seem to differ substantially from that in patients with RA and healthy subjects. This is an expected result, golimumab being an antibody and the parenteral administration should make the uptake independent of gastrointestinal disease.

The proposed dose regimen with a higher initial dose followed by a second dose after 2 weeks before starting the maintenance monthly dosing seems reasonable from a pharmacokinetic perspective, reaching therapeutic plasma levels rapidly.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

The assessment of efficacy in the sought indication was based on the randomised Phase II/III induction study C0524T17 and 54-week data of the phase III maintenance study C0524T18. An extension of study C0524T18 is ongoing. The study extension began at Week 54 and is to continue through Week 228.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

Induction study C0524T17 was divided in two parts: part 1 was a phase II dose-ranging portion and part 2 was a phase III dose-confirming portion. In the part 1 of the respective study, several doses were evaluated for continuation in part 2. On completion of part 1 data were analysed and the doses for part 2 were chosen.

## Study C0524T17

The subcutaneous (SC) induction doses were based on results of infliximab studies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), predictions of previous and ongoing studies of golimumab and from preclinical studies.

## The three evaluated doses were:

- 100 mg at Week 0 and 50 mg at Week 2 (100 mg → 50 mg)
- 200 mg at Week 0 and 100 mg at Week 2 (200 mg → 100 mg)
- 400 mg at Week 0 and 200 mg at Week 2 (400 mg → 200 mg)

For continuation into part 2, the 200 mg → 100 mg and 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab SC dosage regimens were selected. The decision was based on PK, efficacy, exposure-response and the safety profile. Both doses were concluded to be effective and safe in the induction of clinical response.

## 2.4.2. Main studies

The assessment of efficacy in the sought indication was based on the randomised Phase II/III induction study C0524T17 and the phase III maintenance study C0524T18.

Study C0524T17: A Phase 2/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Induction Therapy, Administered Subcutaneously, in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (PURSUIT-Induction).

## Methods

The two parts of the study, part 1 dose-finding and part 2 dose-confirming, were randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled and of parallel-group designs. There was no break in enrolment between Part 1 and Part 2. In part 1 of the study 169 patients were randomized at Week 0. Part 2 of the study began when the 170 th  patient was randomized and 896 patients were randomized at Week 0 in Part 2.

At week 6, patients were evaluated for clinical response. At this visit all patients, regardless of the part of the study into which they were enrolled, were eligible to enrol in the golimumab maintenance study (C0524T18). Patients not entering the golimumab maintenance study were evaluated for safety 16 weeks following their last administration of study agent.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion criteria:

Subjects had to be men or women 18 years of age or older with moderately to severely active UC as defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12 inclusive at baseline (Week 0), including an endoscopic subscore of ≥2. Subjects must have had a biopsy result consistent with the diagnosis of UC and must have been ambulatory (i.e., not at imminent risk of colectomy). Subjects must have demonstrated an inadequate response to or have failed to tolerate oral 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), or oral corticosteroids, or the immunomodulators azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6 MP), or have demonstrated corticosteroid dependence (i.e., an inability to successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of the symptoms of UC).

## Main exclusion criteria

Subjects were not to be enrolled into the study if they were at imminent risk of colectomy. Subjects with UC limited to the rectum only or &lt;20 cm of the colon, a stoma, a fistula, an obstruction, or adenomatous colonic polyps that were not removed were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects with a history of latent or active granulomatous infection (including TB), a predisposition to infections, or a history of or increased potential for malignancy were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects with a diagnosis or history of congestive heart failure, lymphoproliferative disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or demyelinating disease were ineligible for entry into the study. Subjects with prior exposure to biologic anti-TNF agents were ineligible for entry into the study.

## Treatments

Patients in part 1 were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following dose regimens:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- placebo at Week 0 and placebo at Week 2 (placebo)
- golimumab 100 mg at Week 0 and 50 mg at Week 2 (100 mg → 50 mg)
- golimumab 200 mg at Week 0 and 100 mg at Week 2 (200 mg → 100 mg)
- golimumab 400 mg at Week 0 and 200 mg at Week 2 (400 mg → 200 mg)

While the data from Part 1 were being evaluated, newly enrolled subjects in Part 2 were equally randomised to the same SC doses of golimumab or placebo as in Part 1. After the interim analysis, the selected doses were the 200 mg → 100 mg and 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab SC dose regimens for continued development in Part 2. Newly enrolled patients in Part 2 were thereafter equally randomized to 200 mg → 100 mg or 400 mg → 200 mg golimumab or placebo.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of part 1 of the study were to evaluate dose response and to select a SC induction regimen for golimumab.

Objectives of the second part were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab in inducing clinical response.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 6 defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by ≥30% and ≥3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.

The major secondary endpoints evaluated at week 6 were:

- Clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore &gt;1)
- Mucosal healing (endoscopy subscore 0 or 1)
- Change from baseline in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score (a ≥20 point improvement was considered to be consistent with response)

## Sample size

It was estimated that 176 patients in total would provide ≥80% probability of detecting a doseresponse relationship in part 1 of the study.

The sample size for Part 2 was based on the consideration of statistical power and the objective to provide the target study population to be evaluated in the golimumab maintenance study C0524T18.

Since no data were available for golimumab in the treatment of UC, estimates used for the sample size calculation were obtained from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies of infliximab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC.

Due to the termination of the C0524T16 study the sample size of part 2 of study C0524T17 was increased to provide a sufficient number of subjects to enrol in and adequately power study C0524T18.

## Randomisation

An IVRS was used to randomly assign subjects to study treatment and dispense study agent. In Part 1, subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1 of 3 dose regimens of golimumab (100 mg → 50 mg, 200 mg → 100 mg, or 400 mg → 200 mg at Week 0 and 2, respectively) using an adaptive randomization procedure, with investigative site as the stratification variable. The randomization

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

method was a minimization procedure with a biased-coin assignment. In Part 2, eligible subjects were allocated to a treatment regimen using a permuted block randomization.

## Blinding (masking)

There were no visual differences in appearance between the syringes of placebo and golimumab. The designated pharmacists or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel who dispensed the study agent and independent drug monitors were unblinded to study agent. The subjects, site monitors, principal investigator and all the investigator site staff were blinded to study agent assignment. To protect the integrity of the study and the golimumab maintenance study C0524T18, treatment assignment blinding was maintained for investigative sites, site monitors and subjects participating in this study until the Week 54 analyses for the maintenance study were completed. Sponsor personnel were unblinded to treatment assignment for this study in 2 stages. At the first database lock, the data for subjects in Part 1 were unblinded and released to a limited number of sponsor personnel for analysis; the data for all subjects in Part 2 remained blinded at this time. At the second database lock, the data for all subjects was unblinded and released to a limited number of sponsor personnel for analysis.

## Statistical methods

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were summarized for all randomized subjects. Chisquare tests or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi square tests, as appropriate, were used to compare the proportions of subjects achieving selected endpoints (e.g., clinical remission). In cases of rare events, Fisher's exact test was used for treatment comparisons.

Continuous response parameters were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an ANOVA on the van der Waerden normal scores, as appropriate. All statistical testing was performed at the α = 0.05 (2-sided) level unless otherwise specified.

## Control of Type I error

In the C0524T17 study, after all patients in Part 1 had either completed the Week 6 visit or had terminated the study prior to Week 6, an analysis of the Part 1 data was performed to select induction doses for continued development in Part 2 of the study. No patients from Part 2 were unblinded at the time of the Part 1 database lock and the patients in Part 1 were not included in the primary analysis population, which was based on patients randomized in Part 2 after the dose selection.

In addition, due to the stopping of the C0524T16 induction study, which together with the C0524T17 induction study was to provide the required number of patients to power the maintenance study C0524T18, the number of patients in the C0524T17 study was increased. No data from patients in the primary analysis population in C0524T17 were used to determine the increase in sample size.

Since no comparisons (blinded or unblinded) of the C0524T17 data for the primary analysis population were performed prior to the final database lock, no adjustments were made to the overall Type 1 error rate (α = 0.05, 2-sided) for the primary and major secondary endpoint analyses in the C0524T17 study.

## Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data

Patients with missing observations, unless otherwise specified, the last observation was carried forward for continuous endpoints with the exception of the Mayo and partial Mayo scores, where the last available Mayo subscores were carried forward. Patients with missing data were considered as not achieving the respective endpoints for dichotomous endpoints.

RE311:[P\\_DC\\_22\\_3\\_C\\_DD],08DEC201016:32

There were 16 (1.5 %) patients that terminated the study drug between weeks 0 and 6. Six of the 16 patients completed the safety visit 16 weeks after the drug administration. Major reasons for terminating the study drug was AEs (placebo n=3, golimumab n=4) and lack of efficacy (n=2).

A total of 50 patients terminated study participation. Thirty-five (3.3%; including 1 patient who was randomized but never treated) terminated prior to week 6, and 15 (1.4%) terminated between week 6 and week 16.

## Recruitment

The study was initiated on 18 July 2007 and completed on 29 November 2010.

## Conduct of the study

There were two amendments to the protocol

Amendment 1: 08 May 2008

Amendment 2: 20 August 2009

There were 3 major changes in the first amendment that concerned:

- change to a permuted block randomization
- inclusion of corticosteroid dependant patients
- inclusion of patients refractory to or intolerant of oral 5-ASA only in order to permit for evaluation of early intervention with an anti-TNF-α agent

Major changes in the second amendment concerned:

- increase of numbers of patients in part 2 to compensate for early termination of study C0524T16
- primary analysis population was changed to include only patients that randomized to part 2 after dose selection

## Baseline data

The baseline data are summarised in table 4 (see study C0524T18).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Numbers analysed

The primary analysis population was composed of patients randomized in Part 2 after the dose selection. Data from two sites (data from 13 randomized patients) were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses due to misconduct. The following pre-specified analysis populations were also evaluated for selected, pre-specified efficacy endpoints:

- Subjects randomized in Part 1
- Subjects randomized in Part 2
- Subjects randomized in Part 2 before the dose selection
- First 450 subjects randomized in Part 2 after the dose selection
- All randomized subjects (Part 1 and Part 2 combined)

Therefore the primary analysis population consisted of 761 subjects.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

Figure 7. Proportions of patients in clinical response at Week 6 in C0524T17; randomized patients in Part 2 after the dose selection

<!-- image -->

The result of the primary analysis was generally consistent in subgroups (demographic, UC disease, baseline medication), in sensitivity analysis regarding missing data and exclusion of patients and in the pre-specified efficacy populations with one exception; for patients randomized in part 2 before the dose selection the effect of golimumab was not evident due to a high placebo response rate (50%).

Study C0524T18: A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Maintenance Therapy, Administered Subcutaneously, in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (PURSUIT-Maintenance).

## Methods

The Study, C0524T18, was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of SC administration of golimumab in maintaining clinical response. Patients in clinical response to golimumab in one of the induction studies, C0524T16 or C0524T17 were invited to participate. Patients who were not in clinical response to golimumab or placebo in the induction studies were also eligible to enrol in this study but were not included in the key efficacy analyses. They were included in the safety and PK analyses only.

Patients were to be discontinued from the study drug if there was no improvement of their disease activity by week 16. For patients that lost response through week 52 the following applied:

- Placebo: Received golimumab 100 mg q4w
- Golimumab 50 mg: Re-randomized to receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg q4w
- Golimumab 100 mg:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Prior to the implementation of Protocol Amendment 3, patients were re-randomized to receive golimumab 100 mg or 200 mg q4w.
2. After the implementation of Protocol Amendment 3, patients only received golimumab 100 mg q4w. Patients who had been re-randomized to 200 mg q4w prior to implementation of Protocol Amendment 3 had their dose decreased to 100 mg q4w.

Patients on immunomodulators and oral 5-ASA at baseline should remain on the same dose regimen throughout week 54. Patients in clinical response receiving oral corticosteroids were to begin tapering the daily dose at baseline.

Patients were assessed for UC disease activity using the Mayo score at week 30 and 54 and by partial Mayo score every 4 weeks. At week 54, patients were evaluated for efficacy and safety. Patients that had successfully completed treatment (through week 52) were eligible to participate in a study extension. Patients who discontinued study agent but continued to participate in the study or did not enter the study extension were followed for 16 weeks after the last administration of study agent. Patients that discontinued prior to week 54 were followed for 54 weeks after the week 0 visit for information related to colectomy.

## Study participants

The study population was adult patients with moderately to severely active UC (i.e., a Mayo score of 6 to 12, inclusive, at baseline [Week 0 of an induction study], including an endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2) who had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate oral 5-ASAs, or oral corticosteroids, or the immunomodulators AZA or 6-MP, or had demonstrated corticosteroid dependence (i.e., an inability to successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of the symptoms of UC). All patients were naive to anti-TNF therapy.

Maintenance therapy was evaluated in patients who were in clinical response to golimumab at Week 6 in either of the induction studies, C0524T16 or C0524T17.

## Main inclusion criteria:

- Prior to the screening endoscopy or the earliest entry in the Mayo diary card was to be used to calculate the baseline Mayo score, whichever of these 2 events came first, the following conditions must be met:

a. If receiving 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, must have been receiving it for at least 12 weeks. The class of agent (6-MP/AZA versus MTX) prescribed may not have changed during those 12 weeks, and the dose must be stable for at least 4 weeks.

b. If 6-MP, AZA, or MTX have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 4 weeks.

c. If receiving oral 5-ASA compounds or oral corticosteroids (including budesonide), the dose must have been stable for at least 2 weeks.

d. If oral 5-ASA compounds or oral corticosteroids (including budesonide) have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 2 weeks.

e. The following medications/therapies must have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks:

- rectal corticosteroids (ie, corticosteroids [including budesonide] administered to the rectum or sigmoid colon via foam or enema or suppository)
- rectal 5-ASA compounds (ie, 5-ASAs administered to the rectum or sigmoid colon via foam or enema or suppository)
- parenteral corticosteroids
- total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- pentoxifylline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- thalidomide or related agents
- antibiotics for the treatment of UC (ie, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or rifaximin)

f. 6-thioguanine (6-TG) must have been discontinued for at least 4 weeks.

- Must have results from a biopsy collected at the screening endoscopy procedure or have a previous biopsy result obtained within the last year that is consistent with the diagnosis of UC.

- All subjects ≥45 years of age must either have had a colonoscopy to assess for the presence of adenomatous polyps within 5 years of the first administration of study agent or a colonoscopy to assess for the presence of adenomatous polyps at the screening visit. The adenomatous polyps must be removed prior to the first administration of study agent.

All the cases of colon polyps reported in the UC trials were confirmed to be inflammatory and with no dysplasia.

## Main exclusion criteria

1. Have severe extensive colitis as evidenced by:

- Investigator judgment that the subject is likely to require a colectomy within 12 weeks of baseline.

or

- Symptom complex at screening or baseline visits that includes at least 4 of the following:
- 1) diarrhoea with ≥6 bowel movements/day with macroscopic blood in stool
- 2) focal severe or rebound abdominal tenderness
- 3) persistent fever (≥37.5°C)
- 4) tachycardia (&gt;90 beats/minute)
- 5) anemia (hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL)
2. Have UC limited to the rectum only or to &lt;20 cm of the colon.
3. Presence of a stoma.

4. Presence or history of a fistula.

5. Require, or required within the 2 months prior to screening, surgery for active gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, or intra-abdominal or pancreatic abscess requiring surgical drainage, or other conditions possibly confounding the evaluation of benefit from study agent treatment.

6. Presence of symptomatic colonic or small bowel obstruction, confirmed by objective radiographic or endoscopic evidence of a stricture with resulting obstruction (dilation of the colon or small bowel proximal to the stricture on barium radiograph or an inability to traverse the stricture at endoscopy).

7. History of extensive colonic resection (e.g., less than 30 cm of colon remaining) that would prevent adequate evaluation of the effect of study agent on clinical disease activity.

8. History of colonic mucosal dysplasia. For subjects with a pathology finding of 'indefinite dysplasia with reactive atypia,' the investigator should discuss the case with the medical monitor to determine eligibility.

9. Presence on screening endoscopy of adenomatous colonic polyps, if not removed prior to study entry, or history of adenomatous colonic polyps that were not removed.

## Treatments

Patients in clinical response were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at week 0 to receive one of the following regimens:

- placebo
- golimumab 50 mg
- golimumab 100 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

every 4 weeks (q4w) through week 52.

## Objectives

The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of golimumab in maintaining clinical response.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was clinical response (continuous) through week 54. Clinical response is defined as a decrease from Week 0 of C0524T16 or C0524T17 in the Mayo score by ≥ 30% and ≥ 3 points, with either a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1). Subjects who lost clinical response at any time prior to Week 54 were considered not to be in clinical response for the primary endpoint analysis.

The major secondary endpoints were:

- Clinical remission (defined as a Mayo score ≤ 2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1) at both week 30 and 54
- Mucosal healing (defined as endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1) at both week 30 and 54
- Clinical remission at both week 30 and 54 among subjects who were in clinical remission at week 0 of the maintenance study
- Clinical remission and not receiving corticosteroids at week 54 among subjects who were receiving corticosteroids at week 0 of the maintenance study

## Sample size

The number of patients enrolled was dependant on the number who entered the study from the induction studies C0524T16 and C0524T17. The number of patients in the primary analysis population depended on the number of patients in clinical response to golimumab in the induction studies who consented to participate in this maintenance study. In order to ensure that there would be enough patients from the induction studies to meet the required number of patients for the primary analysis population of this study, at a designated time point near the completion of planned enrolment of C0524T17, the IVRS system projected, based on the available data and a predefined algorithm, whether or not the target number of patients for the primary analysis population of this study would be reached, and, if not, how many more patients from C0524T17 would need to be enrolled to reach the target. If the information provided by the IVRS vendor indicated that more patients would have been needed in this study, the sponsor may have increased the number of patients in C0524T17. Only data from this study (C0524T18) that was included in this calculation was the number of patients who had already entered the target population in this study. These data were only available to the IVRS vendor

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and no sponsor personnel had access. No comparisons (blinded or unblinded) of the C0524T18 data were performed prior to the Week 54 database lock.

## Randomisation

An interactive voice response system (IVRS) was used to assign patients to study treatment and dispense study agent. Patients in clinical response to golimumab at Week 6 in C0524T16 or C0524T17 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 to one of three treatment groups (placebo, golimumab 50 mg, or golimumab 100 mg) using an adaptive randomization procedure.

Stratification was performed for investigative site, clinical remission status at Week 0 (yes or no), week 0 corticosteroid use (yes or no) and mode and dose of induction dose.

## Blinding (masking)

There were no visual differences in appearance between the syringes of placebo and golimumab. The designated pharmacists, or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel who dispensed the study agent, and independent drug monitors were unblinded to study agent. The patients, site monitors, principal investigator, and all the investigator site staff were blinded to study agent assignment.

Sponsor personnel remained blinded to treatment assignments until after the week 54 database lock. The study blind was maintained for the investigative sites, site monitors, and patients until the week 54 analyses were completed.

## Statistical methods

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were summarized for all randomized subjects. Chisquare tests or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] chi square tests, as appropriate, were used to compare the proportions of subjects achieving selected endpoints (e.g., clinical remission). In cases of rare events, Fisher's exact test was used for treatment comparisons.

Continuous response parameters were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an ANOVA on the van der Waerden normal scores, as appropriate. All statistical testing was performed at the α = 0.05 (2-sided) level unless otherwise specified.

## Control of Type I error

No comparisons of the C0524T18 data were performed prior to the Week 54 database lock for C0524T18, and therefore no adjustments to the overall Type 1 error rate were necessary for C0524T18.

## Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data

Patients with missing observations, unless otherwise specified, the last observation was carried forward for continuous endpoints with the exception of the Mayo and partial Mayo scores, where the last available Mayo subscores were carried forward. Patients with missing data were considered as not achieving the respective endpoints for dichotomous endpoints.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 251 study centres. The study was initiated on 28 September 2007 and completed on 24 October 2011.

## Conduct of the study

There were 3 amendments to the protocol

There were 2 major changes in the first amendment:

- prohibition of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) as a concomitant medication for safety reasons
- addition of the induction dose factor as a stratum variable in the analysis of the primary endpoint

Amendment 2 concerned the following major changes:

- clarification of the re-randomization procedure on loss of clinical response where eligible patients received either the original dose or the double original dose
- patients with insufficient data (Mayo score) at week 30 or 54 should be considered not to be in clinical response for the primary endpoint analysis
- addition of the process for gauging the enrolment of subjects into the primary analysis population. A process was added to determine whether the number of subjects in C0524T17 should be increased to ensure the required number of subjects for the primary analysis population for this study.

The purpose of amendment 3 was to stop dose adjustment to golimumab 200 mg q4w after reports of lymphoproliferative cancers in subjects with long standing RA.

## Numbers analysed

The primary analysis population is subjects randomized at Week 0 of this maintenance study (i.e., subjects in clinical response to golimumab induction at Week 0 of this maintenance study as determined by the IVRS), excluding those from 3 sites(sites 6706, 7257 and 7407). Therefore, there were 456 subjects in the primary analysis population.

In the target population, 37 % (172) patients had a dose adjustment. Dose adjustment due to loss of clinical response was the most common treatment failure criteria. The rate in the placebo group was 49% followed by 34% and 28% in the 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively.

Of patients in the 50 mg group that had a dose adjustment and that were re-randomized to receive the same dose, 37% (n=10) were in clinical response at week 54. The corresponding figure for patients that were randomized to receive 100 mg was 28% (n=7). Increasing the dose to 100 mg at dose adjustment did not impact clinical response or partial Mayo score. Corresponding efficacy analyses for patient in the 100 mg group who had a dose adjustment have not been performed.

The result of the primary analysis was generally consistent in subgroups (demographic, UC disease, baseline medication) and in the pre-specified sensitivity analysis regarding missing data and exclusion of patients.

the 50 mg group (-10.00) while there were no change in the placebo group. At week 54 doses were similar in the 100 mg and the placebo group while there was still a decrease in the 50 mg group.

The proportions of subjects who were not receiving concomitant corticosteroids at Week 54 were greater in the 100 mg group (32.9%) and significantly greater in the 50 mg group (41.0%) compared with the placebo group (21.8%; p = 0.028).

The proportions of subjects who maintained clinical response through Week 54 and were not receiving concomitant corticosteroids at Week 54 were greater in the 100 mg group (30.5%) and significantly greater in the 50 mg group (38.5%) compared with the placebo group (20.7%; p = 0.026).

Numbers of UC related hospitalizations were low across all treatment groups.

The rate of colectomies through week 54, were 1.3% (n=2), 2.6% (n=4) and 1.9% (n=3) in the 100 mg, 50 mg and placebo groups, respectively.

Approximately 35% of the patients in the primary analysis population were in clinical remission at week 0. The study was not powered to detect a difference between the active and placebo treatment for this endpoint.

Median CRP concentrations, faecal lactoferrin and calprotectin were lower in the 100 mg group than for patients in the placebo group and 50 mg groups at weeks 30 and 54.

## Ancillary analyses

The time to first loss of clinical response through Week 54 is presented in Figure 10. The time to loss of clinical response was significantly longer in the 100 mg and 50 mg groups compared with the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The median time to loss of clinical response was greater than 54 weeks in the 100 mg and 50 mg groups (i.e., more than half of the subjects had not met the criteria for loss of clinical response by Week 54) and 27 weeks in the placebo group.

## Supportive studies

Study C0524T16: A Phase 2/3 Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Golimumab Induction Therapy, Administered Intravenously, in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis.

An interim analysis to determine the optimal IV induction doses of golimumab was conducted after all subjects in Part 1 either completed the Week 6 visit or terminated study participation prior to Week 6.

Following the subsequent dose response analysis for the golimumab SC induction study C0524T17 and a review of the totality of the data from both induction studies, it was recommended that the C0524T16 study is stopped and enrolment into the study is terminated. It was concluded that single IV administration of golimumab in subjects with moderately to severely active UC did not lead to significant improvement in disease activity.

The study was terminated after 291 patients had been randomized and there were 115 also randomized in part 2. Patients already enrolled in the study were followed per the protocol and were invited to enter the 1-year golimumab maintenance study C0524T18.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy of golimumab for induction and maintenance treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis has been evaluated. Patients received induction therapies that were evaluated after 6 weeks. Two induction studies were initiated with similar design but with different dosage regimen and mode of administration (IV/SC). The study using a single IV dose of golimumab was prematurely stopped since the SC induction therapy was found to have a more favourable effect on efficacy. The SC regimens that were studied further included two doses of the study drug at weeks 0 and 2, 200 mg/100 mg or 400 mg/200mg.

Patients in clinical response in the induction studies were eligible to continue into the maintenance study. The maintenance study was of double-blind placebo-controlled design and the effect of golimumab therapy, 50 mg and 100 mg every 4 weeks, was evaluated after 52 weeks.

All patients included in the studies had experienced inadequate response to conventional therapy with corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP)/azathioprine (AZA), or 5-ASA or were intolerant to or had medical contraindications for such therapies. All patients were further TNF-α naïve. According to the MAH the reason for inclusion of patients being refractory to 5-ASA only was to permit for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of early intervention with an anti-TNF-α agent. Further, it was pre-specified in the protocol that the inclusion should be limited to 10%. The MAH has presented data showing that there were 19% and 17% of patients that were refractory to 5-ASA only in the induction and maintenance studies, respectively. Excluding these patients from the efficacy analyses did not have any major impact on the results.

In general, the design and the conduct of the studies seemed appropriate. However the primary efficacy endpoint for both the induction and maintenance studies was clinical response. This is not in accordance with current guidelines where induction and maintenance of remission is considered the primary efficacy parameter to be used. Patients were recruited from the induction studies for the maintenance study and were consequently in clinical response and not in remission at baseline. However, data from the subgroup of patients that were in remission at baseline of the maintenance study were also presented (third ranked secondary endpoint). Overall, the observed difference

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between placebo and active treatment was slightly larger for this group (patients in clinical remission at week 0 who maintained remission also at weeks 30 and 54). For patients in clinical response at Week 0, the difference in clinical remission at both week 30 and 54 was 8% and 12% for patients receiving 50 mg and 100 mg compared to placebo. Thus, the data from this subgroup are sufficiently supporting of efficacy.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Following induction treatment, the observed difference between golimumab and placebo in inducing clinical response was 22% and 25% for the 200 mg/100 mg and 400 mg/200 mg doses, respectively. Corresponding figures for the induction of clinical remission were 11% and 12%.

For the maintenance treatment the observed difference between active and placebo treatment for maintaining response was 16 % for the 50 mg dose and 19 % for the 100 mg. The difference between active and placebo treatment for patients in remission both at week 30 and 54 was 8 % and 12 % for the low and high dose, respectively. Corresponding data from the subgroup of patients that were in remission at baseline of the maintenance study (n=163) and maintained remission through week 54 were 12 % and 16 %. Thus, data from this subgroup further support the efficacy.

Of all randomized patients in the maintenance study 28 % discontinued the study, the major reasons being lack of efficacy (placebo 12 %, 50 and 100 mg groups, 11 and 14 %, respectively) and AEs.

The MAH proposed not to make any recommendations as regards discontinuation of therapy in patients who have responded to treatment since patients in clinical response to anti-TNF therapy are expected to have ongoing benefit from continued treatment. It is accepted that there are at present no data available to support a recommendation and the decision to continue therapy is left at the discretion of the treating specialist. Nevertheless, collection of data from clinical practice regarding treatment interruption is important and the MAH will collect additional data regarding this point in the ongoing long-term extension of the C0524T18 trial and the proposed Nordic National Register Database Study and the Spanish Registry (as detailed in the RMP).

The available data suggested that clinical response is achieved within 12 to 14 weeks of treatment (after 4 doses). Continued therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit within this time period.

The initially proposed dosing for patients with UC was golimumab 200 mg SC week 0, followed by 100 mg at week 2, then 100 mg every 4 weeks, thereafter. For the already approved indications the maintenance dose is 50 mg every month. The dose may be increased to 100 mg in patients &gt;100 kg. For the approved indications the therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit after receiving 3 to 4 additional doses of 100 mg.

The difference between the two induction doses evaluated in part 2 of study C0524T17 was modest. The MAH's proposal to recommend the lower dose is therefore supported.

Concerning the proposed dose for maintenance treatment, 100 mg every 4 week, the clinical relevance of the difference between the two doses on efficacy and the rational for the proposed dosing is less clear. The differences between the doses were limited in spite of twice as high serum golimumab concentrations for the higher dose. Similar proportions of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy across all treatment groups further questions the rational from an efficacy point of view. In response to the question regarding the clinical relevance of the difference in efficacy between the two dosing regimens 50 mg and 100 mg, the MAH pointed out that although the response rates induced by both doses were clinically and statistically significant at week 54, maintenance of remission at weeks 30 and 54 was only statistically significant for the higher dose as compared with placebo. However, although

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

statistically significant, the clinical relevance of a difference in remission rate between the doses of 5 % for maintained remission was questioned by the CHMP. Furthermore, in clinical guidelines it is stated that the goal of maintenance therapy in UC is to maintain steroid-free remission. Although a difference between doses of 5% is not considered clinically relevant, in this comparison the lower dose was more effective than the higher dose (steroid-free remission at week 54; placebo 18%, low dose 28% and high dose 23%). Further, in the low dose groups there were 34% of patients that required a dose adjustment as compared to 28% in the high dose group. Corresponding figures for patients experiencing flares were 52% in the low dose group and 45% in the high dose group. Again the differences between the groups are modest (7-8%) and the importance and clinical relevance of these differences is unclear.

Concerning colectomies through week 54, the numbers of patients were limited in all treatment groups, 3, 4 and 2 respectively, in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg groups.

To support the use of the higher 100 mg dose, exposure-response relations have been further analysed. According to the MAH there is a positive correlation between exposure and key efficacy endpoints. The CHMP considered that the reporting of the modeling was very rudimentary and made secondary review difficult to perform. Even though a positive correlation between exposure and response is likely, the model needs to be further developed and thoroughly qualified before it can be used for the purpose of prediction. In response the MAH has presented further data that support the use of the 100 mg dose for patients &gt;80 kg. The difference between the low and high dose groups for these patients is approximately 11-12% for the presented efficacy endpoints. The Applicant further proposed that patients &lt;80 kg in clinical response who do not achieve clinical remission might benefit from a dose increase. However, supportive data are based on a too limited number of patients to make any firm conclusions. Thus, this proposal was not agreed by the CHMP.

Those patients on 50 mg who lost response, were re-randomised to 50 or 100 mg q4w. Following rerandomisation, there was no difference in response rate (37% vs. 28%, although numbers were small), suggesting that there is no point in increasing the dose in a patient who loses response.

Data from the maintenance study implies that for patients in the 50 mg group that lost response, a dose increase did not affect the outcome at week 54.

To conclude, presented data support an additional benefit of the 100 mg dose in patients &gt;80 kg while for patients &lt;80 kg there seems to be no major difference in clinical response/remission between the doses.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the induction and maintenance studies for treatment of patients with moderate to severe UC with golimumab show a statistically significant effect on the primary efficacy endpoint that was supported with the result of major secondary endpoints, including remission. This overall dataset is accepted for the efficacy demonstration. The observed differences between active and placebo treatment are considered to be clinically relevant for patients with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy. Based on the available data the 50 mg q4w dose is the recommended maintenance dose for patients with body weight less than 80 kg whereas patients &gt;80 kg would benefit from a higher dose i.e. 100 mg q4w.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

Data from the induction studies C0524T16 and C0524T17 and from the maintenance study C0524T18 contributed to the safety evaluation.

The safety presentations include:

- Summary of the safety data from the three individual UC studies.
- Pooled safety data from the three UC studies from Week 0 of induction through Week 54 of maintenance for patients randomized in C0524T18 for a total of 60 weeks of follow-up.
- Data pooled from the UC studies and other disease populations in which golimumab has been studied (events of special interest and malignancies)

Events of special interest include sepsis, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), opportunistic infections, cellulitis, demyelination, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness-like and anaphylactic reactions, and hepatobiliary events.

## Study C0524T17

Two populations were evaluated for safety; all treated patients (parts 1 and 2 combined) and treated patients after dose selection in part 2. 734 patients received at least one dose of golimumab.

## Study C0524T18

Three populations were evaluated, randomized patients (the target population), non-randomized patients and all treated patients through week 54. The data presentations focus on the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups. There were only 14 patients that received the 200 mg dose. There were 1075 patients receiving active treatment;

- 741 (69 %) were exposed for at least 6 months
- 536 (50 %) were exposed for at least one year

## Data from other indications

Data from studies in other disease populations involve 3935 patients and 7534 patient-years of followup, and have been assessed within previous applications.

## Patient exposure

The dose regimens and number of subjects evaluated in each of the UC studies are presented in Table 9.

For the Phase 2b and Phase 3 SC studies of RA, PsA, and AS studies, a total of 2363 subjects were treated with at least 1 dose of golimumab and had a total of 5714 subject-years of followup.

Long-term exposure for the 50 mg and 100 mg golimumab doses for the Phase 3 SC studies of RA, PsA, and AS are provided in Table 10.

RE309:[S\\_AB\\_236\\_A\\_AA], 23NOV2011 10:17

The system organ class with the highest reported number of AEs were Gastrointestinal disorders and Infections and infestations.

Treatment-emergent AEs of severe intensity were reported by 8.3%, 10.4% and 14.3% in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Colitis ulcerative was the most commonly reported severe AE.

For randomized patients the proportion of reasonable related events were 28%, 25% and 36% in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately 75% of non-randomized patients reported one or more treatment related AEs. The highest proportion of AEs was Gastrointestinal disorders.

## Pooled safety data from the three UC studies

For patients who received golimumab in C0524T16 and C0524T17 and who were randomized in C0524T18, the proportions of patients with an AE from Week 0 of induction until week 54 of the maintenance study was 74%, 78%, and 79% in the placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg maintenance treatment groups, respectively, with average weeks of follow-up of 38.8, 50.4, and 52.4, respectively.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Study C0524T16

The proportions of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs) were 2.6 % in the placebo group and 3.8 % in golimumab groups. Flares of UC were the only SAE that was reported from more than one patient (4 golimumab treated patients).

There were no deaths during the study period.

## Study C0524T17

The proportions of patients that reported SAEs were 6% (n=20) in the placebo group and 3% (n=20) in the golimumab groups. The most commonly reported events were colitis ulcerative followed by anaemia, dehydration and erythema nodosum. The numbers of patients with events that were considered to be reasonably related through week 6 were 12, 10 in the placebo group and 2 in the golimumab groups.

Serious infections were reported from 1.8% and 0.5% in the placebo and golimumab groups, respectively (through week 6). Serious infection that was reported from &gt;1 patient was pneumonia.

There were two reports of opportunistic infections through week 6 (candidiasis and CMV infection) and 2 reports after week 6 (CMV infections).

Injection-site reactions were reported from 1.5% of placebo-treated and 3.4% of actively-treated patients. The most common reactions in the actively treated groups were injection-site erythema and pruritus.

Malignancies were reported for 2 patients, carcinoma in situ and colon cancer that were identified in biopsies from one patient prior to the randomization and thyroid cancer was reported for one patient.

Esactedfrem:RE509:SAE$65F1.23FE8201210:47

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One report of a demyelinating disorder occurred after completion of the induction study. The SAE was reported while the patient was treated with placebo in study C0524T18 on day 160. The patient was treated with antibiotics and was asymptomatic and the lesion was resolving at a neurologic follow-up a year later.

One patient died during the induction period due to an SAE of ischiorectal abscess, two weeks after the second golimumab dose. The patient suffered from severe ischiorectal abscess and was hospitalized. Due to the severity of the disease, there was necrosis of the rectum leading to an external fistula that was surgically treated. Subsequently perforations of the colon, requiring colectomy and ileostomy developed. Following the second surgery, peritonitis and sepsis developed that led to multisystem organ failure and approximately 10 weeks after the last dose of golimumab, the patient died.

## Study C0524T18

For randomized patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups, SAEs were reported in 7.7%, 8.4% and 14.3%, respectively. The corresponding figures after taking into account the time of follow-up were 12.6, 10.4 and 17.1 SAEs per hundred patient-years. Colitis ulcerative was the most commonly reported SAE. For non-randomized patients approximately 15% reported SAEs and in this group were UC flares most commonly reported also.

Among randomized patients the SOC with the most frequently reported AE considered to be reasonably related was Infections and infestations.

Serious infections were reported from 1.9%, 3.2% and 3.2% of patients in the placebo and golimumab 50 and 100 mg groups, respectively (randomized patients). Serious infection that was reported from &gt;1 patient was appendicitis. Among non-randomized patients, the proportion was 2.2% 3.7% in patients receiving active treatment and no SAE was reported in the placebo group. SAEs reported from &gt; 1 patient were disseminated TB and UC.

There were 4 cases of tuberculosis (TB) reported through week 54. The patients were male, two from India and two from Poland. None of the patients had signs or symptoms of TB at baseline. However, one patient had a positive QFT-TB test result and received prophylactic treatment for latent TB on entering the induction study. Chest x-rays were read as normal in 3 of 4 patients, one patients was reported as having an abnormal result with no suspicion of TB. Two patients discontinued the study agent and one patient was treated and continued in the study. The patient with the positive QFT-TB test result received isoniazid treatment (and was compliant) but died at day 206 of disseminated TB.

There were also 4 cases of opportunistic infections through week 54 (CMV infection (n=2), candidiasis and brain abscess).

For randomized patients through week 54, there were reports of injection-site reactions in 1.9 % of patients in the placebo and 50 mg golimumab group and 7% in the 100 mg group. There were no severe and serious events reported.

One non-serious AE of Type IV hypersensitivity reaction was reported for one patient in the golimumab 100 mg group.

There were four reports of malignancies. Two patients were diagnosed after placebo induction dosing and before receiving active treatment. The remaining two cases concerned one patient with lung adenocarcinoma (patient had COPD and had been a smoker for 40 years) and one patient with breast cancer.

There were three deaths during the maintenance period. One randomized patient, died from cardiac failure on day 335. The patient had a history of thrombosis. Two non-randomized patients died of septic shock and disseminated TB on days 364 and 206, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Four additional patients died during the long-term extension period (gallbladder adenocarcinoma, biventricular heart dysfunction, sepsis, heart failure and pneumonia).

Data pooled from the UC studies and other disease populations

The incidence (per 100 subject-years of follow-up) of events of special interest (i.e., sepsis, pneumonia, TB, opportunistic infections, cellulitis, demyelination, CHF, hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness and anaphylactic reactions) were generally similar between all treated subjects in the UC studies and that of all disease populations in which golimumab has been studied as in table 14:

Among all golimumab treated UC patients, the rate of malignancies was 0.46 (CI: 0.15, 1.08) per 100 patient-years of follow-up. The corresponding figure across other disease populations is 1.06 (CI: 0.86, 1.30).

In summary,

- When SAEs in C0524T18 were analysed as randomized, the overall proportions of SAEs were similar across treatment groups. In addition, in the randomized population, the proportions of subjects with colectomy were low (i.e., 1.9%, 2.6%, and 1.3% in the placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg groups, respectively; C0524T18 54-Week CSR\\Sec6.5.5.2). These analyses based on safety data assessed according to the randomized treatment groups did not identify differences in the safety of subjects in the 50 mg versus the 100 mg groups, suggesting that the safety of 50 mg and 100 mg dose regimens is comparable.
- Among all treated subjects in C0524T18, the higher proportions of subjects with SAEs in the 100 mg group were primarily attributable to the increased rate of colitis ulcerative. This was not unexpected due to the high proportion of nonresponders in this population. When SAEs of colitis ulcerative are excluded from the analysis of all treated subjects, the safety between the 50 mg and the 100 mg dose regimens was comparable.
- No Exposure-Response (E-R) relationship was observed for SAEs or serious infections with increased golimumab exposure.
- The risks of SAEs, events of special interest, and malignancies (with the exception of TB, opportunistic infection, demyelination, and lymphoma) were similar between the 50 mg dose regimen and 100 mg dose regimen across all Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies. Higher incidences

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of TB, opportunistic infection, demyelination, and lymphoma were observed with the 100 mg dose regimen across all indications; these are known risks with anti-TNF agents. The current SmPC describes the greater incidence with the 100 mg dose regimen compared with the 50 mg dose regimen.

- An analysis of the discontinuation of study agent due to an AE through Week 52, in which discontinuation of study agent due to an AE were included in the subjects' original randomized groups, showed a higher proportion of subjects discontinuing study agent in the placebo group than in either the 100 mg group or the 50 mg group.
- No new safety signals were observed with the 100 mg maintenance dose regimen in the UC population.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Markedly abnormal post-baseline values with regard to decrease in lymphocytes were reported for 12% of golimumab and 18% of placebo treated patients in study C0524T17. Similar findings were identified in 36%, 25% and 22% of patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups of study C0524T18.

In study C0524T18 there were 3 patients with transient decreases of neutrophils &lt;1.0 x 10 3  cells /µL.

## Chemistry

Elevated potassium values were reported from 8 patients being actively treated.

ALT and AST values ≥3 x ULN were uncommon both for placebo (n=3) and golimumab treated (n=2) patients in study C0524T17. In study C0524T18 there were 3 patients with concurrent elevations in ALT and total bilirubin (&gt;2 x ULN).

## Safety in special populations

The safety of golimumab was evaluated regarding the rates of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent and infections in the Phase 3 UC studies in subpopulations based on demographics (i.e., sex, race, age, and weight) and baseline disease characteristics (i.e. disease severity, disease duration, and extent of disease). In general there were no differences between the subgroups. However, for age, although the number of patients ≥65 was limited, n=51 (4%) in comparison with patients &lt;65 (n=1182, 96%), the rate of AEs, SAEs, or serious infection were higher in the older population. In patients ≥65 the rates were 86%, 29% and 6% and in the younger 78%, 15% and 4%, respectively.

## Immunological events

In study C0524T17 there were 3 patients that had positive tests for antibodies to golimumab.

Among treated patients that were negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at baseline, 11 were positive for ANA antibodies (using a titre ≥1:160) at week 6 (4 patients that had received golimumab and 7 placebo).

There were no patients that were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies between baseline and at their last evaluation through week 6.

In study C0524T18, a total of 20 (4.4%) of 455 randomized patients with appropriate samples for antibodies to golimumab were positive at week 54, 11 of 155 (7.1%) subjects in the placebo group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(these subjects had received golimumab induction treatment), 4 of 152 (2.6%) subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 5 of 148 (3.4%) subjects in the golimumab 100 mg group. Among the subjects who were positive for antibodies to golimumab, the majority (16/20) had titers under 1:640.

The corresponding figures for all treated patients (randomized and non-randomized patients were, of 1103 appropriate samples, 32 (2.9%) were positive, 21 of 32 had titers under 1:640.

There were 6 (2.7%) patients in the placebo group, 6 (4.3%) and 31 (3.8%) in the golimumab 50 mg and golimumab 100 mg groups, that were positive for ANA antibodies between baseline and week 54.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In study C0524T17, 4 patients in the placebo and 3 in the active groups discontinued due to AES during the induction period. Five (5) of these patients discontinued due to an SAE (viral infection, erythema nodosum and rash, colitis ulcerative (n=2), carcinoma in situ and colon cancer (identified in biopsies prior to randomization)).

Of randomized patients in the placebo, 50 mg and 100 mg golimumab groups in study C0524T18, 6%, 5% and 9%, discontinued due to AEs. The discontinuation was due to UC flares in 2%, 4% and 4% of patients in these groups, respectively. Corresponding figures taking into account time of follow-up were 10.4, 6.2 and 10.4 per hundred patient-years.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

The most commonly reported events were flares of UC followed by nasopharyngitis and headache. Worsening of UC was the most common adverse event and was also the dominating reason for discontinuations.

There were no major differences between the two active treatment groups in numbers of AEs. However, the rate of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs was higher in the 100 mg group than in the 50 mg group. Among patients receiving the 50 mg dose there were 8.4% that had SAEs and 5% discontinued due to AEs. Corresponding figures for patients on 100 mg were 14.3% and 9%.

The proposed treatment for UC involved higher dosing regimen than for the already approved indications. However, there are safety data from other disease populations including about one thousand patients being exposed to golimumab (100 mg) for at least one year and 760 for at least 96 weeks. Thus, although long-term safety data is sparse in the UC indication, there are safety data available for the higher dose from clinical trials in other patient populations. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the higher maintenance dose should be restricted to patients &gt;80 kg.

Important potential risks for the UC population are colon dysplasia/colon cancer and hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma (HSTCL). The MAH agreed to add wording on the potential risk for HSTCL and colon carcinoma/dysplasia in Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use of the SmPC. HSTCL has also been added as a class-effect adverse drug reaction in Section 4.8. Colon carcinoma/dysplasia and HSTCL have been added as important potential risks for golimumab in the RMP.

Safety data from patients above the age of 65 have been presented. Overall it seems  elderly patients have a similar incidence of AEs and SAEs as younger patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious risks. No new safety issues were revealed in the UC clinical trials. There seems to be a dose related increase in SAEs.

Adequate risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures. Safety data from studies in the UC programme indicate d that the safety profile in the treatment of ulcerative disease is similar to that for other approved indications. There were no new safety concerns identified.

The treatment of UC is a new indication for golimumab, and long-term benefits and risks of golimumab treatment in UC are currently unknown. Potential risks of treatment of UC with biologic agents, including anti-TNFα agents, as well as conventional therapy, include colorectal dysplasia, colorectal cancers, and HSTCL. The rate at which subjects with UC have colectomies is also an important factor.

The CHMP requested the MAH to collect disease-based UC registry data as an additional pharmacovigilance activity to assess the long-term safety of golimumab in adult subjects with UC. The Nordic National Register Database Study is proposed as a registry for these purposes. A feasibility assessment will be conducted to determine whether the data from the Spanish Registry would also be useful in this regard. These measures are described in the updated RMP.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

- The MAH should submit the protocol for the Ulcerative Colitis Registry within the Nordic National Registry Database for review by December 2013.

- The MAH should provide the timelines of the feasibility assessment for utilising the Registry in Spain as an additional source of information for collection of long term safety data in patients with ulcerative colitis by October 2013.

## 2.5.4. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

## 2.6.1. PRAC advice

The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan.

## PRAC Advice

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 8.5 the PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for golimumab (Simponi) in the treatment of: moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA) or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies is acceptable provided that the MAH submits the protocol for the Ulcerative Colitis Registry within the Nordic National Registries Database for review within 6 months of the CHMP Opinion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH is also requested to provide the timelines of the feasibility assessment for utilising the Registry in Spain as an additional source of information for collection of long term safety data in patients with ulcerative colitis.

An updated RMP should be submitted before the CHMP Opinion with the available milestones for these studies.

This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC noted the proposal outlines by the MAH for the two different registry options in UC (the Nordic National Register Database Study and the Registry in Spain.

The PRAC considered that both of these databases would be able to generate the required data including comparisons of Simponi with biologic, as well as non-biologic treatments, and possible switches between different treatments.

The PRAC recommended that the proposal for the protocol for the Nordic registry should be submitted within 6 months of the CHMP opinion.

The PRAC also requested that the time lines for the feasibility assessment for using the Spanish registry should also be outlined in a revised RMP which should be submitted .

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Variation EMEA/H/C/992/WS0312/0041 submitted to add Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma in the Simponi EU SmPC was approved on 22 November 2012. The MAH committed as part of this variation to add melanoma as an identified risk and MCC as potential risk to the RMP of Simponi with the next RMP update. This update was made a part of the RMP approved with the II/39 variation. Following this update of the RMP, the MAH has taken the opportunity to update the information regarding the educational material in Annex II. This is agreed by the CHMP.

Furthermore, minor editorial changes have been introduced to the labelling.

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Golimumab has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) since 1 st  October 2009.

The efficacy of golimumab for induction and maintenance treatment has been evaluated in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis. The patients had active disease despite adequate treatment with 6-MP, AZA, corticosteroids, and/or 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) compounds, or were intolerant to or had medical contraindications for conventional therapy.

The effect of golimumab for induction of response was evaluated after 6 weeks. Two induction studies with similar design but with different modes of administration (SC and IV) were initiated. The study using a single IV dose was prematurely stopped due to a more favourable effect of the SC induction therapy. The SC administration included two doses of the study drug at weeks 0 and 2 (200 mg/100 mg or 400 mg/200mg). For the primary efficacy endpoint clinical response, (decrease of Mayo score ≥30% and ≥3 points with decreased rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or subscore of 0 or 1), the observed difference between golimumab and placebo was 21% and 25% for the 200 mg/100 mg and 400 mg/200 mg doses, respectively. Corresponding figures for the highest ranked secondary endpoint, induction of clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 with no subscore &gt;1), were 11% and 12%.

Patients in clinical response from the induction studies were invited to continue into the maintenance study. The maintenance study was of double-blind placebo-controlled design and the effect of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

golimumab therapy, 50 mg and 100 mg every 4 weeks, for 52 weeks was evaluated. The observed difference between active and placebo treatment for maintaining clinical response was 16% for the 50 mg dose and 19% for the 100 mg. The difference between active and placebo treatment for patients in remission both at week 30 and 54 was 8% and 12% for the low and high dose, respectively.

The results of the induction and maintenance studies for treatment of patients with moderate to severe UC with golimumab showed a statistically significant effect on the primary efficacy endpoint that was supported with the result of major secondary endpoints. The observed differences between active and placebo treatment are considered to be clinically relevant for patients with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy. Furthermore, the magnitude of effect of golimumab for induction and maintenance treatment in the UC population is similar to that of other TNF-α inhibitors.

Data has been presented showing that there were 19% and 17% of patients that were refractory to 5ASA only in the induction and maintenance study, respectively. The rational for the inclusion of this population, that is generally not considered for anti TNF-α therapy, was to explore the effect of early intervention. Excluding these patients from the efficacy analyses did not have any major impact on the results.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The MAH has discussed the need for recommendations as regards discontinuation of therapy in patients who have responded to treatment. The MAH stated that patients in clinical response to antiTNF therapy are expected to have ongoing benefit from continued treatment. It is accepted that there are at present no data available to support a recommendation and the decision to continue therapy is left at the discretion of the treating specialist. Nevertheless, collection of data from clinical practice regarding treatment interruption is important and the MAH will collect additional data regarding this point the ongoing long-term extension of the C0524T18 trial and the proposed Nordic National Register Database Study and the Spanish Registry (as detailed in the RMP).

## Risks Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious risks, including infections and potential risks of lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies, congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. Adequate risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures.

Safety data from studies in the UC programme indicated that the safety profile in the treatment of ulcerative disease seems to be similar to that for other approved indications. There were no new safety concerns identified. The most commonly reported events were flares of UC followed by nasopharyngitis and headache. Worsening of UC was the most common adverse event and was also the dominating reason for discontinuation. The SmPC contains recommendations to stop treatment in subjects who do not respond within a defined time frame.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Long-term safety data from the UC indication is sparse, in particular for the proposed maintenance dose 100 mg, which also is higher than what has previously been approved for other indications. Data from other disease populations have been presented, which include safety data from one thousand

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients being exposed to golimumab (100 mg) for at least one year and 760 for at least 96 weeks. The presented safety experience from other indications gives a sign of numerically higher rates of events of special interest with the 100 mg dose than with the 50 mg dose.

Although overall no new safety signals have been identified in the presented studies, follow-up on the limited long-term safety is of importance. In response to a question regarding a registry, the MAH has submitted outlines for two registry options addressing the use of golimumab in the treatment of active moderate to severe UC in adult patients(as detailed in the RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The observed differences in efficacy between placebo and active treatment show that there is an effect of golimumab in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The demonstrated effect is considered to be of clinical relevance for patients that have previously failed conventional therapies.

Treatment with golimumab and also alternatives for ulcerative colitis is associated with potentially serious adverse events. Main concerns regarding treatment with golimumab are the increased risk of infections and potential risks of lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies, congestive heart failure and demyelinating disorders. A special concern in young adults with ulcerative colitis for treatment with TNF-α inhibitors, is the potential risk of developing hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL). These risks have been addressed in the updated RMP and the PI.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance of golimumab use in ulcerative colitis is positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The results show statistically significant effects of golimumab in inducing and maintaining response/remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The observed differences between active and placebo treatment are considered to be of clinical relevance for patients who have experienced inadequate response to conventional therapies.

Considering the potentially serious safety profile of golimumab it has been agreed that the higher maintenance dose should be restricted to patients &gt;80 kg. Data has been presented supporting a gain in efficacy with the 100 mg dose for those patients compared with the 50 mg q4w dose

The MAH has updated the Product Information and has accepted the CHMP comments. An updated RMP has been submitted in accordance with the PRAC's recommendations.
