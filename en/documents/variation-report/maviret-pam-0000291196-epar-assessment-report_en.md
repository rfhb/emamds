## 1. Introduction

On 30 July 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Maviret, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Study  P19-620  was  conducted  based  on  the  GPSP  Ordinance  (Good  Post-marketing  Study  Practice; Ministerial Ordinance No. 171 of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare dated December 20, 2004).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Maviret is currently marketed and approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and children aged 3 years and older.

The MAH stated that Study P19-620 is part of the clinical development program, generating additional effectiveness and safety data in daily practice in paediatric and adolescent patients infected with HCV in Japan.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

Two pharmaceutical formulations of Maviret exist:

- 100 mg glecaprevir and 40 mg pibrentasvir. film-coated tablets for adults, adolescents aged 12 years and older, or children weighing at least 45 kg
- 50 mg glecaprevir and 20 mg pibrentasvir. coated granules in sachets for children aged 3 years to less than 12 years and weighing 12 kg to less than 45 kg

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for Study P19-620 entitled 'Real World Evidence of the Safety and Clinical Practice Use of Maviret in Pediatric and Adolescents Patients Infected with Chronic Hepatitis C virus (All case survey)'.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study P19-620

## Description

Study P19-620 was a prospective, central registration, multi-center observational study in pediatric ( ≥ 3 to &lt; 12 years) and adolescent ( ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years) patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving Maviret.

Study period: 27 November 2020 to 26 September 2024

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 Study design

<!-- image -->

The prescription of a treatment regimen was in accordance with local label, was made independently from this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the patient the opportunity to participate in this study.

This study focused on collecting real-world data. Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures and diagnostic methods were followed in physicians ' routine clinical practice.

## Methods

## Study participants

Patients with chronic HCV infection treated with Maviret in daily practice, who were ≥ 3 to &lt; 18 years of age at start of Maviret treatment.

## Treatments

The dosage and administration followed the dosage and administration described in the package insert.

## Objectives and endpoints

Research  question :  What  is  the  safety  of  Maviret  in  pediatric  and  adolescent  patients  with  chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in a real world setting across clinical practice patient populations in Japan?

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Maviret in pediatric and adolescent patients infected with HCV in daily practice as mandated by the Japanese regulatory authority.

- The primary objective : To describe the safety of Maviret in overall and subpopulations of interest.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Secondary objectives : To describe in routine clinical practice the effectiveness of Maviret overall and by subpopulations of interest (e.g. HCV genotype, prior treatment experience, absence of cirrhosis/ presence of cirrhosis.) as evidenced by SVR12, to describe the percentage of patients achieving  SVR  at  4,  8,  and  24  weeks  after  the  last  actual  dose  of  Maviret,  to  describe  the percentage of patients with on-treatment virologic failure (non-response, breakthrough), and to describe the percentage of patients with after-treatment virologic failure (relapse).

## Endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

The number and percentage of patients with ADRs in overall and subpopulations of interest. (Events were coded and tabulated by MedDRA SOC and PT). If any patients who developed ' HBV reactivation ' and ' Hepatic  dysfunction  and  Jaundice ' were  observed,  the  seriousness,  onset,  etc.  were  also analyzed.

## Secondary Endpoint

1. The percentage of patients achieving SVR12 in effectiveness population and subpopulations of interest.
2. The percentage of patients achieving SVR at 4, 8 and 24 weeks after the last actual dose of Maviret in effectiveness population and effectiveness population in accordance with approved local label.
3. The percentage of patients with on-treatment virologic failure (non-response, breakthrough).
4. The percentage of patients with after-treatment virologic failure (relapse).

## Statistical Methods

Descriptive and exploratory statistical methods were used to analyze the data of the study.

All  baseline and disease characteristics were summarized for the safety population and effectiveness population stratified by the analysis groups based on HCV genotype/subtype and cirrhosis status, which are relevant for scheduled treatment duration (8 or 12 weeks).

Subgroup analysis by formulation (tablet or sachet) and age (pediatric group who are ≥ 3 to &lt; 12 years old and adolescent group who are ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years old) was also executed.

ADRs or SAEs are described in the table with number, rate and 95% CI. SVR12 is described in the table with number, rate and 95% CI. The percentage of patients achieving SVR12 is described with the 95% CI using Wilson ' s score method.

Further details of analysis populations were specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All safety variables were summarized for patients in the safety population using descriptive statistical methods stratified by the scheduled treatment duration.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 103 subjects with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled into this observational study in Japan.

## Recruitment

## 2.3.2.1. Efficacy results

Of the 92 patients included in the efficacy analysis (patients for which efficacy was evaluable), the SVR12 rate and treatment response are shown in Table 7. A total of 91 patients (98.91%) achieved SVR12, while  1  patient  (1.09%)  experienced  a  relapse  within  12  weeks  after  the  end  of  treatment.  The percentage of patients confirmed HCV-RNA negative at the final observation was also 98.91%.

Details for the patient who observed relapse are as follows:

(A male patient, age 5-10 years old with genotype 2a chronic hepatitis C. This patient had no prior experience with hepatitis C treatment and did not have liver cirrhosis. After initiating treatment, the patient adhered to the regimen by taking 4 paediatric sachets of Maviret once daily for 56 days, as outlined in the package insert.

Detected HCV-RNA levels exceeding 1.2 log IU/mL at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the end of treatment (no measurement at 8 weeks after the end of treatment).

HCV drug resistance mutation testing was not conducted before the commencement of drug administration; post-treatment testing confirmed \"no mutations.\"

## Rapporteur's comment :

No new relevant efficacy data is identified in these study results. Most of important efficacy results have already been discussed within the type II variation II12 (extension of indication in adolescents) and in the line extension X33G (extension of indication in paediatric patients aged &gt; 3years to &lt; 12 years).

## 2.3.2.2. Safety results

Among the 103 patients in the safety analysis set, AEs were observed in 12 patients, all of whom were in the ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years (adolescent) subgroup. Among the patients with AEs, one patient had a treatment history of chronic hepatitis C with IFN treatment. Notably, all 16 of the observed AEs were non-serious. The incidence of AEs is shown in Table 8 and Table 9 below .

1)Totalnumberofdaysofadministrationofthisdrugforallsubjects/365

A total of 11 nonserious ADRs occurred in the adolescent group (ages ≥ 12 to ˂ 18 years). These included 4 events of pruritus, 2 events of nausea, and 1 event each of abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, renal disorder, malaise, and weight decreased.

MAH Conclusions: The results from P19-620 support the safety and effectiveness of Maviret for pediatric and adolescent patients with HCV in a real world setting in Japan. The safety results are consistent with the current safety profile as described in the product label and no changes to the label were required based on the results of this study. The benefit-risk of Maviret is unchanged, and no update to the Summary of Product Characteristics is being proposed as a result of these data.

## Assessor's comment :

Among the 103 participants for safety data, 9 patients (all in the ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years subgroup ) reported adverse  reactions  (ADRs)  for  a  total  of  11  ADRs.  All  ADRs  were  non-serious  and  are  resolved  or recovering. After review of these adverse reactions, they were either consistent with the current known safety profile of Maviret and/or does not raise new safety concerns.

The mainly ADRs reported were nausea and pruritus (already listed in Maviret product information).

There was also:

- One adverse reaction of hyperbilirubinaemia (a 12-18 year-old, male), this ADR is already listed in the Maviret product information
- One adverse reaction of Weigh decreased (a 12-18 -year-old male), a transient weight loss of up to 4.4  kg  was  observed,  occurring  on  Day  41  and  resolved  during  the  treatment  administration.  The reporting physician commented that 'during Maviret administration, the patient's body weight decreased by about 3 kg without any cause other than Maviret, and quickly increased thereafter,' and determined that there was a causal relationship between Maviret and 'Weight decreased'. However, this single nonserious event quickly resolved without changes regarding the administration of Maviret (there was no modification/discontinuation, the treatment was completed), and also there is a missing information regarding the patient weight at the start of the treatment (the reference weight was measured 24 days before the start of treatment but not on the day of treatment). Thus, no major safety issue is identified.
-  One adverse reaction of renal disorder (a 12-18 year-old, female) with elevation of creatinine, an increase up to 0.82 mg/dL (usual values between 0.3 and 0.6 mg/dL) on Day 36 and recovered on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

day  123  after  onset.  This  single  non-serious  event  resolved  without  changes  in  the  treatment administration due to ADR, the treatment was completed. No new safety concern is identified.

The MAH concluded that the safety results are consistent with the current safety profile as described in the product label and no changes to the label were required based on the results of this study which is endorsed.

Overall, the CHMP rapporteur endorses that the safety data provided are consistent with the known safety profile of Maviret and/or do not raise new relevant safety concerns. Also, to note, the safety profile of the paediatric population will continue to be assessed and discussed in the next PSUR, as requested by the PRAC rapporteur in the last Maviret PSUSA procedure (PSUSA/00010620/202207)

## 2.3.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

No new relevant efficacy data is identified in these study results.

The safety results are consistent with the known current safety profile of Maviret and/or does not raise new relevant safety concerns.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall concluson and recommendation

The MAH submitted a final report for Study P19-620, a prospective, central registration, multi-center observational study in patients ≥ 3 to &lt; 18 years of age with chronic hepatitis C receiving the Maviret regimen under GPSP Ordinance to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Maviret in daily practice in Japan.

Following the results from P19-620 study no new relevant efficacy data is identified and no new safety concern is raised.

The benefit-risk balance of Maviret remains unchanged.
