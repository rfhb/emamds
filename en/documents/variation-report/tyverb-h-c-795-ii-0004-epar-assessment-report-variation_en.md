## 1 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Lapatinib (Tyverb) is an orally-administered, small molecule, reversible inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine  kinase  domains  of  Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptor  (EGFR)  and  of  Human  Epidermal Receptor Type 2 (HER2) or ErbB2. Lapatinib is a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors. Members of this class of molecules have been shown to bind to the ATP binding site of protein  kinases  and  compete  with  the  ATP  substrate.  This  blocks  receptor  phosphorylation  and activation, preventing subsequent downstream signalling events. The rationale for lapatinib use as an anticancer entity is that the blockade of the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB1 or ErbB2 is expected to block the transforming activity that results from overexpression of these receptors.

In  June  2008,  lapatinib  was  granted  a  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  in  the  EU  for combination with capecitabine in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress ErbB2 (HER2). Patients should have progressive disease following prior therapy which must include anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.

The  recommended  dosage  for  the  approved  indication  is  1250  mg  lapatinib  daily,  continuously,  in combination with capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/day taken in 2 doses 12 hours apart on days 1-14 in a 21-day cycle.

In  this  application,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  initially  proposed  to  extend  the indication as follows:

'Tyverb in combination with an aromatase inhibitor is indicated for the treatment of patients with  hormone  receptor-positive  metastatic  breast  cancer  which  overexpresses  the  ErbB2 (HER2) receptor.'

The MAH proposed to amend SPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 accordingly. Minor editorial changes were also made to the SPC. Consequently, the MAH also applied for an additional pack-size of  84  tablets  reflecting  the  proposed  daily  dose  for  this  indication.  SPC  section  6.5,  labelling  and section  6  of  the  PL  have  been  updated  in  this  respect.  Furthermore,  the  Package  Leaflet  has  been updated in line with the SPC revisions. Annex II has been revised to reflect the latest approved RMP version.

This variation application for lapatinib is based on the results from two clinical studies, one pivotal Phase III study and a supportive Phase I study, in both the medicinal product was combined with an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole.

The daily dose of lapatinib for the proposed new indication in combination with an aromatase inhibitor is 1500 mg (i.e., six 250 mg tablets), in contrast to the currently authorised indication of lapatinib (in combination with capecitabine) for which it is 1250 mg. There are currently three approved aromatase inhibitors, letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane, which work by inhibiting oestrogen biosynthesis.

In addition, the dosing schedule proposed for the new indication (i.e., six 250 mg tablets/day) initially warranted from the MAH point of view the introduction of two new pack sizes (containing 84 and 168 tablets  in  total),  which  will  provide  patients  with  exactly  14-days  and  28-days  supply,  respectively. The  respective  changes  related  to  this  additional  pack  size  were  part  of  this  Type  II  variation application. However, during the procedure the MAH revised this request for only an additional pack size of 84 tablets. Consequently regarding the additional pack size a change to SPC section 6.5 was suggested and initially a new separate Patient Information leaflet (PIL) for the Tyverb plus aromatase inhibitor indication has been proposed by the MAH for inclusion in the pack.

During the Type II variation procedure the MAH revised its initial position and decided not to pursue with separate package  leaflets for lapatinib (5 tablets/day) /  with  capecitabine and  lapatinib (6 tablets/day) / with an aromatase inhibitor.

Requests for Supplementary Information were adopted during the July 2009 and October 2009 CHMP meetings.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.2 Quality aspects

The dosing schedule proposed for the new indication (i.e., six 250 mg tablets/day) warranted in view of the MAH the introduction of two new pack sizes (containing 84 and 168 tablets in total), which will provide  patients  with  exactly  14-days  and  28-days  supply,  respectively.  However,  during  the procedure the MAH revised this request for only an additional pack size of 84 tablets.

No  new  quality  data  were  provided  in  this  variation  application.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative formula remains the same. The container/closure contact materials and the size of the blister pockets remain unchanged, and only the number of blister pockets/strip has increased. Therefore, the MAH considered that the existing ongoing stability data support the approved drug substance retest date and drug product shelf life, and that no additional stability data are required.

Section 6.5 of the SPC as well as the Labelling has been updated to include the new pack size.

In general, the CHMP agreed to the MAH's request to introduce only one new pack size of 84 tablets and considered the proposed changes to the Product Information acceptable.

## 1.3 Nonclinical aspects

With this application, the MAH has submitted a nonclinical Overview discussing the rationale for the new indication and relevant issues on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology mainly based on  data  from  the  original  marketing  authorisation  application.  One  new  pharmacology  study (non-GLP) and a recently completed in vitro haemolytic potential study (conducted according to GLP) have been included in the submission and are discussed below.

Nonclinical studies with the combination of lapatinib with aromatase inhibitors were not conducted.

## 1.3.1 Pharmacology

The pharmacological rationale for the combined use of lapatinib with aromatase inhibitors is based on the observation that, in addition to its ability to down-regulate the AKT pathway and up-regulate the FOXO3A subpathway, which correlates with its efficacy, lapatinib induces ESR1 and PGR expression in  breast  cancer  cell  lines  which  express  moderate  basal  levels  of  these  receptors.  This  effect highlights  a  receptor  cross-talk,  where  the  AKT  pathway  would  be  down  regulating  the  hormonerelated  pathways.  By  down-regulating  the  AKT  pathway,  the  hormone-related  pathways  would therefore  be  expected  to  be  up-regulated  as  a  result  of  lapatinib  action,  resulting  in  increased sensitivity  to  anti-hormonal  therapy.  Genes  involved  in  cell  cycle  control,  glycolysis  and  fatty  acid metabolism are also differentially affected by lapatinib.

## Primary Pharmacology supportive of the new indication

The study 'Delineation of Molecular Mechanisms of sensitivity to GW572016F in Breast Cancer Cell Lines using Global Gene Expression Profiles' intended to provide the proof of concept related to the proposed  combined  therapy  of  lapatinib  with  letrozole,  by  studying  the  cascade  components  of lapatinib mechanism of action, including the effect of lapatinib on the expression of estrogen (ER) and progestagen  (PGR)  receptors  in  human  breast  cancer  cell  lines  responsive  and  low  responsive  to lapatinib.

Phosphoprotein  and  microarray  analyses  were  used  to  carry  out  targeted  pathway  studies  of phosphorylation  and  gene  expression  changes  in  human  breast  cancer  cell  lines  in  the  presence  or absence of GW572016F.

Studies  were  performed  in  four  breast  cancer  cell  lines,  BT474  and  SKBr3,  which  are  lapatinib responsive, and MDA-MB-468 and T47D, which are lapatinib non-responsive.

## Results

## Responsive cell lines, BT474 and SKBr3

These cells constitutively over-express ErbB2 and demonstrated an IC50 for lapatinib of 25 or 32 nM, respectively. ErB2 over-expression was demonstrated in the cell lines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Both cell  lines  exhibited  strong  differential  effects  on  multiple  genes  in  the  AKT  pathway. After  12  h  exposure  to  1.0 μ M  lapatinib,  AKT1,  MAPK9,  HSPCA,  RAK1  and  CCND1 transcripts  were  down-regulated  7  to  25-fold  in  responsive  BT474  and  SKBr3  cells.  In  the figure below, is illustrated the effect obtained on AKT1 expression, in all cell lines used. Only in ErB2 expressing cells the AKT1 was up-regulated by lapatinib.

-  Phosphorylated  Akt  and  Akt-mediated  phosphorylation  of  FOXO3A  also  decreased  in responsive breast cancer cell lines exposed to lapatinib.
-  Gene expression profiling also  revealed  that  lapatinib  stimulates  expression  of  the  estrogen and progesterone receptors and modulates expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism.

## Nonresponsive cell lines MDA-MB-468 and T47D

-  These cells express a low basal level of ErbB2 and demonstrate IC50 values in the μ M range.
-  In  contrast  to  the  observed  in  responsive  cells,  lapatinib  weakly  down-regulated  the  AKT pathway (less than 5-fold down-regulation of most genes in the pathway).
-  In  BT474  and  T47D  cells,  which  express  moderate  basal  levels  of  the  estrogen  and progesterone receptors, 1.0 μ M lapatinib induced expression 7- to 11-fold.

## Discussion

The CHMP commented that the study results are not totally consentaneous with the theory developed by  the  MAH  as  a  basis  of  the  association  of  lapatinib  with  letrozole  or  other  aromatase  inhibitor. Indeed, while in BT474 cells, both oestrogen and progestagen receptors showed increased expression as a consequence of lapatinib treatment, in SKBr3 cells, which are also ErB2 expressing cells, only a modest increase in oestrogen receptor was observed without change in progestagen receptor. On the other  hand,  in  T47D  cells,  which  express  a  low  basal  level  of  ErB2,  and  are  low  responders  to lapatinib, considerable over-expression of both receptors was induced by lapatinib. Therefore, if these in  vitro results  can  be  applied  to  the  i n  vivo situation,  it  would  be  expected  that  while  in  a  tumour based  on  BT474-like  cells  it  would  make  sense  to  associate  lapatinib  with  aromatase  inhibitor treatments,  such  might  not  be  the  case  for  a  tumour  based  on  SKBr3-like  cells.  In  addition,  while lapatinib  would  not  seem  appropriate  to  treat  a  T47D-like  cell  based  tumour,  it  still  was  able  to promote a high expression of oestrogen and progestagen receptors. A lack of understanding on the mechanism for these 'inconsistencies' has been recognised by the MAH.

In the response to the RSI, the MAH has provided an adequate clarification. A stimulatory effect on ER and PGF is dependent on a basal expression of these genes, and may be observed also in cell lines with a low expression of ERbB2 and a low response to lapatinib. It is agreed that a benefit from the combination  of  lapatinib  and  letrozole  is  only  clearly  to  be  expected  in  ErbB2-positive  hormonereceptor positive breast cancer.

## 1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics

No new data on pharmacokinetics have been submitted with this variation application. The nonclinical Overview  presented  a  discussion  of  the  potential  for  drug  interactions  between  lapatinib  and  the approved aromatase inhibitors. The analysis performed by the MAH suggested that there may be a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between lapatinib and the aromatase inhibitors addressed, including letrozole. For further evaluation please refer to the section clinical pharmacology.

## 1.3.3 Toxicology

Lapatinib and the three currently approved aromatase inhibitors, letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane,  have  been  well  studied  individually  both  clinically  and  toxicologically.  No  nonclinical studies  were  conducted  with  the  combination  of  lapatinib  with  any  of  the  marketed  aromatase inhibitors. The principal findings in repeat dose toxicity studies with lapatinib and aromatase inhibitors

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

are attributed to exaggerated pharmacology. These include epithelial effects with lapatinib, and effects on the adrenals and reproductive organs (atrophy and/or hyperplasia) with aromatase inhibitors. The effects on reproductive organs are probably due to inhibition of estrogen synthesis due to aromatase inhibition and the resulting lack of negative feedback on the pituitary.

Hepatic  and  renal  effects  have  been  seen  with  both  lapatinib  and  some  aromatase  inhibitors.  The hepatotoxicity  of lapatinib has  been  raised  already  from  the  clinical  use.  The  hepatocellular hypertrophy seen in rats with aromatase inhibitors is most probably a result of enzyme induction and the renal tubular changes may relate to interference with steroid synthesis. Hepatic and renal function will need to be routinely monitored in the clinic, and therefore no additional nonclinical studies are considered necessary to investigate possible interactions with the combination(s).

The impurity specifications for the drug product and drug substance have not altered since the initial application for lapatinib. However, the indicated maximum dose of the compound has increased from 1250  mg  to  1500  mg.  As  such,  a  re-assessment  of  the  impurity  profile  has  been  undertaken.  All specified impurities remain qualified. 4-(3-fluorobenzyloxy)-3-chloroaniline (GW397339), a starting material  in  the  synthesis  of  lapatinib,  has  been  shown  to  be  genotoxic  both in  vitro and in  vivo . GW397339 is  present  in  lapatinib  drug  substance  at  levels  resulting  in  exposures  greater  than  the current guideline Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) for genotoxic impurities (1.5  g/day/person).  At  the  current  specification  limit  for  this  impurity  (  0.0004%),  the  increased recommended lapatinib dose of 1500 mg/day would result in a maximum daily GW397339 dose of 6  g/day; 0.12 µg/kg to a 50 kg patient.

## In vitro haemolytic potential in Rat, Dog and Human Peripheral Blood

The study was conducted as a support of intravenous administration of different solutions of lapatinib. Rat, dog and human blood were tested to evaluate the potential for haemolysis.

Lapatinib showed no potential for haemolysis in dog and human blood. Mild haemolysis was seen in rat  blood,  but  only  when  administered  with  30%  (w/v)  captisol  in  25  mM  citrate,  approximately pH 5.0.  This  vehicle  also  demonstrated  haemolysis  in  the  absence  of  lapatinib.  Therefore,  lapatinib itself demonstrated no haemolytic potential in any species tested. In all species studied, treatment of blood samples with the positive control material saponin and water induced substantial haemolysis.

Mild haemolysis was evident in rat blood for formulations of lapatinib up to 1.0mg/mL in 30% (w/v) Captisol in 25mM Citrate, approximately pH 5.0 (up to 9.7%) and with the vehicle alone (13.3%). The test was therefore deemed positive for this vehicle in rats.

Minimal  or  no  haemolysis  was  evident  in  human  blood  for  formulations  of  lapatinib  of  up  to 1.0 mg/mL in 30% (w/v) Captisol in 25mM Citrate, approximately pH 5.0, or in rat, dog or human blood  for  formulations  of  GW572016  in  10%  (w/v)  aqueous  Captisol  at  1  mg/mL  or  with  either vehicle alone. The test was therefore deemed negative in dogs and humans for all formulations and vehicles tested, and in rats for formulations of lapatinib in 10% (w/v) aqueous Captisol or with the vehicle  alone.  The  test  was  deemed  positive  in  rats  for  all  formulations  in  30%  (w/v)  Captisol  in 25mM Citrate approximately pH 5.0 (up to 9.7%) and with the vehicle alone (13.3%).

## 1.3.4 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Lapatinib  250  mg  tablets  were  approved  in  EU  for  use  in  combination  with  capecitabine  for  the treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumours  overexpress  HER2 (ErbB2).  Patients  should  have  progressive  disease  following  prior  therapy  which  must  include anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting.

The MAH proposed with the current submission to extend the indication of lapatinib tablets 250 mg to include its use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive  metastatic  breast  cancer  which  overexpresses  the  HER2  (ErbB2)  receptor.  The incidence  of  patients  with  hormone  receptor-positive  breast  cancer  whose  tumours  overexpress  the HER2 (ErbB2) receptor is significantly higher than the incidence of the currently approved indication. Thus, the proposed new indication represents a significant increase in the extent of lapatinib use and a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further assessment of the environmental risk posed by its use is therefore required according to the CHMP ERA guidance [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00].

A full Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) undertaken for lapatinib was previously submitted and reviewed  as  a  part  of  the  original  marketing  authorisation  application.  The  original  ERA  has  been reviewed  and  as  a  consequence  of  this  assessment  the  MAH  has  agreed  to  perform  a  number  of additional studies: OECD305: Bioconcentration study, OECD305: Bioconcentration study, OECD210: Early  life  stage  test  on  fish,  OECD  216:  Nitrogen  transformation  test,  OECD  307:  Aerobic  and anaerobic  transformation  in  soil,  OECD  308:  Aerobic  and  anaerobic  transformation  in  aquatic sediment systems, OECD208: Terrestrial plants growth test, OECD 218: Sediment water chironomus riparius toxicity test, ISO 11267: Collembola, reproduction test. These data have been included into a new ERA, which was submitted in response to the Follow-Up Measure FUM005 in May 2009. This FUM has been assessed and the CHMP considered the FUM to be fulfilled. In the assessment of this FUM the CHMP concluded that the ERA is supporting also this new proposed indication.

## 1.3.5 Conclusion on Nonclinical Aspects

The main nonclinical aspects of lapatinib have been previously evaluated in the context of the original marketing  authorisation  application,  including  post  approval  studies  submitted.  Only  two  ( in  vitro ) additional studies were submitted as a support of the current extension of indication, one pharmacology study and one toxicology study. The pharmacology study has been intended to provide the plausibility for the proposed combined use of lapatinib with aromatase inhibitors. While the impact of lapatinib on different cellular cascades involved in cell division could be shown (e.g. AKT, FOX3) as  up-regulation  or-down  regulation,  with  different  profile  in  ErB2  expressing  and  low  expressing cells, a lower consistency was observed in relation to the effect on oestrogen and progestagen receptor expression. Indeed, a relevant induction of both receptors expression could be observed only in one of the two human breast cancer cell lines responsive to lapatinib (high ErB2 expression) while it was also observed in one of the two poor lapatinib responsive cell lines (low ErB2 expression). In the response to  the  RSI,  the  MAH  provided  an  adequate  clarification.  A  stimulatory  effect  on  ER  and  PGF  is dependent on a basal expression of these genes, and may be observed also in cell lines with a low expression of ErbB2 and a low response to lapatinib. It is agreed that a benefit from the combination of lapatinib and letrozole is only clearly to be expected in ErbB2-positive hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.

The potential  for  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  lapatinib  and  aromatase  inhibitors  has  been identified as low. Nonclinical studies were not conducted to address this potential and it is expected that further information will be generated in the clinical setting.

One additional toxicology study addressing the haemolytic profile of different lapatinib solutions to be used  intravenously  was  also  submitted.  No  relevant  concern  was  raised  from  the  outcome  with  the different solutions in relation to human blood.

The previously reported toxicology package for lapatinib is acceptable for this new indication and the higher dose. The absence of combination pharmacology or toxicology studies with the combination of lapatinib and aromatase inhibitor is sufficiently justified. For the genotoxic impurity GW397339 it was stated in the CHMP AR for the first indication that the level above TTC was acceptable, but that this may not be the case if lapatinib is developed for a  more benign indication. For the indication now applied  for,  exceeding  TTC  remains  acceptable.  The  potential  for  toxicological  interactions  of lapatinib  and  aromatase  inhibitors  was  not  studied.  In  view  of  the  existing  clinical  experience  with both components, potential interactions will be addressed in the clinical setting and nonclinical studies are  not  considered  needed.  This  applies  also  to  the  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  by  both  types  of medicinal products which will demand clinical monitoring.

In conclusion, no additional nonclinical studies are considered necessary to be conducted as a support of  the  combined  use  of  lapatinib  with  aromatase  inhibitors  in  the  indication  proposed,  and,  from  a nonclinical perspective, there are no objections to the use of the proposed combination.

## 1.4 Clinical aspects

The MAH stated that the clinical trials submitted in the application were conducted according to GCP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  clinical  program  supporting  the  present  application  conforms  to  the  conditions  previewed  in CPMP/EWP/2330/99 for applications with one pivotal trial.

The basis for this application is the clinical study EGF30008 and supportive data are provided from a Phase I dose-finding study of letrozole plus lapatinib (EGF10030).

## 1.4.1 Clinical pharmacology

There  were  no  new  pharmacokinetic  studies  provided  with  the  current  application,  but  the  MAH discussed  potential  interactions  between  lapatinib  and  aromatase  inhibitors  based  on  previously submitted studies and literature data.

Lapatinib  is  eliminated  mainly  through  metabolism  by  CYP3A4/5  with  a  minor  contribution  from CYP2C19  and  CYP2C8.  The  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketokonazole  increased  lapatinib  AUC  by 3.6-fold.

In in  vitro studies  with  lapatinib,  the  most  significant  CYP  inhibition  observed  was  with  CYP2C8 (Ki = 0.6  M)  and  CYP3A4  (Ki  =  4  M).  Clinically,  lapatinib  has  a  weak  interaction  with  the CYP2C8 substrate paclitaxel (23% increase in paclitaxel AUC) and a moderate interaction with the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate oral midazolam (45% increase in midazolam AUC) .Therefore, the extent of an interaction through lapatinib inhibiting CYP metabolism of AIs would not be expected to exceed the clinical interaction with midazolam.

Lapatinib is an inhibitor of the transporters organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The role of these transporters in the disposition of aromatase inhibitors has not been reported.

## Letrozole

The pharmacokinetic interaction between lapatinib and letrozole was evaluated in a sub-study of the EGF  100030  dose-escalation  study.  The  interaction  sub-study  has  already  been  discussed  in  the assessment report for the renewal procedure EMEA/H/C/795/R/02.

In  this  study,  once  the  optimally  tolerated  regimen  (OTR)  for  the  combination  of  lapatinib  and letrozole had been determined, 19 additional subjects were enrolled to profile the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib  alone,  letrozole  alone,  and  lapatinib  in  combination  with  letrozole  at  the  OTR  doses,  i.e. 1500 mg lapatinib and 2.5 mg letrozole. Although the number of subjects was relatively small, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study  design  appears  appropriate.  Letrozole  and  lapatinib,  respectively,  was  dosed  to  steady  state before their effect on the other substance was evaluated. There were no statistically significant effects of either letrozole on lapatinib or of lapatinib on letrozole in this study. The AUC ratio (90% CI) for letrozole was 0.94 (0.79-1.11) and for lapatinib 0.84 (0.63-1.13). The MAH's conclusion that there is no  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  letrozole  and  lapatinib  at  the  intended combination dosage is endorsed.

## Anastrozole

Anastrozole has been reported to moderately inhibit CYP3A4 (Ki = 10  M) and CYP2C8 in  vitro . However, the clinical concentration of anastrozole (0.3  M) is approximately 30-fold lower than the inhibitory  potency  and  unlikely  to  cause  a  significant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  through  either CYP3A4 or CYP2C8.

Anastrozole is eliminated mainly by hepatic metabolism, partly via glucuronidation. Approximately 10% of the total clearance of anastrozole occurs by renal elimination. Lapatinib does not inhibit UGT metabolism, therefore the clearance of anastrozole through glucuronidation should remain unaffected. The effect lapatinib would have on the N-dealkylation and hydroxylation pathways are unknown since the specific enzymes involved in that pathway have not been reported. The role that the transporters OATP1B1, Pgp and BCRP may have in the disposition of anastrozole has not been reported.

## Examestane

Exemestane does not inhibit any of the major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) in vitro and is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib through CYP inhibition.

Exemestane is highly lipophilic and absorption or distribution is not limited by permeability, which suggests  an  interaction  through  transporters  may  be  limited.  Exemestane  is  eliminated  mainly  by hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4  and  aldoketoreductases. Clinically, ketoconazole shows no significant effect on exemestane pharmacokinetics, and consequently the effect lapatinib would have on this pathway of elimination should be negligible. The effect of lapatinib on aldoketoreductases has not been characterised.

## Conclusion

The MAH has carefully discussed the risk for pharmacokinetic interactions between lapatinib and the currently approved aromatase inhibitors based on their respective in vitro interaction potential and the elimination pathways. The lack of interaction with letrozole has been confirmed in a clinical study. Based on the elimination pathways and the lack of reports on significant impact of transporters in the disposition  of  anastrozole,  there  is  no  obvious  reason  to  expect  a  pharmacokinetic  interaction  with anastrozole or examestane.

## 1.4.2 Clinical Efficacy

## 1.4.2.1 Pivotal study EGF 30008

The pivotal study EGF 30008 was initially planned to evaluate the combination letrozole/lapatinib vs. letrozole  in  a  hormone  receptor  positive  (HR+)  postmenopausal  breast  cancer  population  with metastatic  breast  cancer.  Due  to  external  data  on  lapatinib's  mode  of  action  and  efficacy,  i.e.  that lapatinib mainly exerted its effect in HER2 positive patients, the population was expanded to ensure the size of this subpopulation. The recruitment of HER2 positive subjects was stable throughout the study.

Study  EGF30008  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  multicentre, Phase III study comparing lapatinib and letrozole versus letrozole in subjects with estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This trial was conducted at  212  sites  in  29 countries  in  5  regions  (North  America,  Latin  America,  Western  Europe,  Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific) including 12 EU member countries, and enrolled 1286 subjects. The majority of the patients (57%) were recruited from Western and Eastern Europe.

## Methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The inclusion criteria defined a typical population of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer,  in  good  performance  status  and  good  cardiac  condition,  without  age  restriction.  The  main inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study participants are listed below:

Main inclusion criteria:

- -Post-menopausal women.
- -Invasive breast cancer with Stage IV disease (locally advanced was allowed  until amendment 3)
- -Measurable or non-measurable disease per RECIST.
- -ER positive and/or PgR positive tumours (any assay; primary or secondary tumours)
- -Subjects  had  archived  tumour  tissue  available  to  compare  tumour  response  with  intra-tumoural expression of EGFR and HER2.
- -Adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor was allowed; however, must have ended more than 1 year prior start of study therapy.
- -Adjuvant  therapy  with  trastuzumab  was  allowed;  however,  must  have  ended  more  than  1  year prior (&gt;12 months) to the start of study therapy.
- -Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) (or multi-gated acquisition [MUGA] scan.
- -Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1.

Main exclusion criteria:

- -Received prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or anti-EGFR/HER2 therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.
- -Bisphosphonate therapy for  bone  metastases  was  allowed;  however,  treatment  must  have  been initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy.

## Treatment

The  treatment  groups  in  this  study  were  either  2.5  mg  letrozole  and  1500  mg  lapatinib  or  2.5  mg letrozole  and  placebo  on  a  daily  basis.  Lapatinib/placebo  was  provided  by  the  MAH  and  letrozole from  commercial  stock  and  reimbursed  by  MAH  except  in  the  US  and  partly  in  Russia  where  the MAH provided letrozole.

One  dose  reduction  and  dose  delay  for  up  to  14  days  was  allowed  in  the  lapatinib  arm.  No  dose reductions and only 3 days delay were allowed for letrozole.

## Objectives

The study was initially planned to include 760 patients in order to compare letrozole and lapatinib to letrozole  and  placebo  in  the  ITT  population.  During  the  study,  external  data  emerged  that  lapatinib mainly exerted its effect in HER2 positive population. According to amendment 3 the population was then  expanded  to  1280  patients  (October  2005).  In  amendment  4  (October  2007,  after  subject recruitment ended) the populations of interest were decided to be the ITT population and the HER2 positive population. Furthermore from this amendment the HER2-positive population was the primary population  of  interest.  The  planned  analyses  were  included  in  the  RAP , dated  30  May  2008.  The blinding was kept until 10 October 2008.

The primary objective was to evaluate and compare PFS (as assessed by the investigator) in subjects with  HER2-positive  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer.  The  secondary  objectives  (all  based  on investigator assessment apart from OS) were as follows:

- -To evaluate and compare PFS in the ITT population.
- -To evaluate and compare the two treatment groups with respect to the following:
- -Overall survival (OS)
- -Overall response rate (ORR) [complete response (CR) and partial response(PR)]
- -Clinical  benefit  response  rate  (CBR)  (confirmed  CR  or  PR  or  stable  disease  (SD)  for  at  least 6 months)
- -Time to response
- -Duration of response
- -Time to progression (TTP)
- -Incidence of brain metastases

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -To  determine  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  toxicities  associated  with  oral  lapatinib  when administered with letrozole.
- -To evaluate and compare the two treatment groups with respect to change in quality of life (QOL) status, the change of QOL relative to baseline, and quality adjusted survival.
- -To compare and correlate tumour response rates following lapatinib and letrozole therapy, with respect  to  baseline  and  on  treatment  serum  concentrations  of  EGFR  and  HER2.  Potentially, proteomic analysis was to be performed to detect other shed tumour proteins and identify changes in the protein profile, which correlate to treatment response and AEs.
- -To  characterize  the  subject  population  by  determination  of  intra-tumoural  expression  levels  of relevant  biomarkers  from  archived  tumour  tissue  such  as  EGFR,  HER2,  and  potentially  other biomarkers that are downstream of EGFR or HER2 receptors.
- -To compare and characterize the subject population who convert to HER2 status (using the serum HER2 collections every 4 weeks of serum data). To specifically look at the time to conversion and the relationship to disease progression.
- -The PGx research objective investigated the relationship between genetic variants in candidate genes in the host and the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib and/or the relationship between genetic variants  in  select  candidate  genes  in  the  host  and  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  lapatinib.  The results of the PGx assessments will be reported separately.

## Comparator and experimental combination:

The choice of comparator by the MAH was based on in vitro data suggesting that letrozole was a more potent inhibitor of oestrogen in tissues. The Phase I study EGF10030 showed, as expected, that there was no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between lapatinib and letrozole, and that full therapeutic doses of both agents could be administered. As such, subjects in both treatment groups of EGF30008 received the accepted standard of care, which is letrozole 2.5 mg administered orally daily.

Therefore, eligible subjects were randomised to receive once daily oral treatment with either letrozole 2.5 mg plus placebo (visually matching lapatinib tablets), or letrozole 2.5 mg plus lapatinib 1500 mg until disease progression or withdrawal from therapy (e.g., due to unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent). Randomization (1:1) was stratified by site of disease (bone only versus soft tissue/visceral disease/other) and time since discontinuation of prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (  6 months or none versus &lt;6 months).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Physical examination, lab-tests, assessment of AEs (NCI-CTC 3.0) and serum ErbB1 and HER2 were done at screening and every 4 weeks. ECG was done at base-line. Echocardiogram or MUGA was followed  every  8  weeks.  Tumour  measurements,  which  at  screening  included  chest  and  abdominal CT/MRI and bone scan and, if clinically indicated, pelvic and head CT/MRI, were performed. Positive CT/MRI  scans  were  followed  every  12  weeks  and  bone  scans,  if  positive,  every  6  months.  QoL (FACT B) was followed every 12 weeks. After 108 weeks all assessments were done every 12 weeks except tumour measurements which were done every 6 months.

There were specific criteria for evaluating cardiac toxicity and hepatic toxicity (from amendment 5, May 2008).

## Sample size

The  initial  sample  size  760  was  based  on  assumptions  that  median  time  to  progression  would  be 10 and 13 months in the letrozole and letrozole/lapatinib arms, respectively. With a one-sided type I error  of  2,5%,  there  was  a  90%  chance  to  detect  the  40%  increase  in  median  TTP  and  5%  loss  to follow up. With protocol amendment 3 it was decided to expand the population to ensure statistical power for the HER2 positive subgroup. The assumptions for the HER2 positive subgroup was a 10 vs. 15 months TTP for letrozole/ letrozole and lapatinib, respectively. With a one-sided type I error of 2.5%, there was a 80% chance to detect the 55% increase in median TTP and 5% loss to follow up. Altogether 218 HER2 subjects were needed in the study. About 20% of the subjects in the study were HER2 positive.

## Randomisation and blinding

The study was double-blind, the blinding was kept from enrolment until 10 October 2008. An IVR system called  RAMOS (Registration and Medication Ordering System) was used to randomise and register subject activity. Randomisation was stratified according to

-  Site of disease: Soft tissue/ visceral disease (could have bone metastases as well) or bone only
-  Interval from discontinuation of adjuvant endocrine therapy &gt; 6 months /&lt; 6 months

## Summary of Key protocol amendments

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis was PFS assessed by investigators in the HER2 positive population (randomised patients  with  HER2  positive  tumours).  PFS  was  defined  as  time  from  randomisation  to  disease progression  or  death,  whichever  occurred  first.  The  secondary  endpoint  was  PFS  assessed  by investigators in the ITT population. A closed hierarchical testing was done with PFS in the HER 2 positive population as the first endpoint to be tested. A supportive analysis was based on assessments from the IRB.

In  amendment 4 the  TTP  was  changed  to  PFS,  however  the  majority  of  deaths  were  breast  cancer related, only 11 patients in the ITT population died from other cause than cancer. The primary efficacy population was changed to HER2 positive.

An independent, blinded review of all radiological scans as a supportive analysis was performed by an IRC, and the results used as a confirmatory analysis of the primary efficacy measure of investigatorevaluated PFS. The IRC reviewed all scans and, for subjects with skin lesions, all photographs. The IRC were not given information of symptomatic assessments of PD.

Nevertheless,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  clinical  assessment  of  symptomatic  progression  was  also possible  by  the  protocol,  more  prone  to  bias  and,  in  principle,  not  verifiable  by  the  IRC.  Although clinically  and  ethically  correct,  that  possibility  obligates  great  caution  in  ensuring  a  rigorous parallelism  (in  time  and  means)  of  assessment  of  tumoural  targets  between  arms,  in  order  to  avoid bias.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A hierarchical closed testing procedure with HER2 positive population was being tested first at α = 0.05  level  followed  by  secondary  endpoint  if  the  analysis  for  the  HER2  positive  population  was significant. There were no adjustments for multiplicity for secondary end-points

The comparisons were between treatment groups: letrozole/placebo vs. letrozole/lapatinib.

A  stratified  log-rank  test  was  used  with  stratification  as  by  Site  of  disease  and ≥ 6  months  from discontinuation of adjuvant endocrine therapy. As HER2 status was not known at randomisation the stratification factors in the ITT population was not applied in this population. Cox regression analysis was  used  with  pre-specified  base-line  prognostic  factors  (Stage  of  disease,  Site  of  disease,  prior adjuvant  chemo ≥ 6  months,  prior  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy, ≥ 6  months,  HR  status  (categorical), ECOG,  Age,  disease  free  interval,  number  of  metastatic  sites,  EGFR  at  baseline,  Serum  HER2  at baseline, Serum HER2 converter post baseline). However 'serum HER 2 converter post baseline' was not a baseline prognostic factor per se as it is influenced by treatment.

No interim analysis was performed.

The analyses were performed in three populations: HER2 positive, ITT and HER2 negative.

## Results

The figure below presents the participant flow chart for the study.

Regarding censoring the following rules applied:

- -If not progressed, last radiological scan assessed by investigator was used.
- -If new therapy started without evidence of documented disease progression PFS was censored at the  date  of  the  last  radiological  assessment  that  is  no  later  than  14  days  following  the  date  of initiation of therapy.
- -If initiation of therapy + 14 day window was prior to progression or death and the therapy start and progression or death was between the first and last of multiple scans, PFS was censored at the first scan date of the previous assessment.
- -Subjects with no scans were censored at randomisation.

## Conduct of the study

26  patients  were  excluded  from  the  PP  population  due  to  major  protocol  violations,  the  most commonly reported was not receiving study treatment and not having metastatic lesions.

One site with 6 patients was closed due to GCP issues, the patients were kept in the ITT population, but not in the PP population.

## Baseline characteristics

All patients were female. Median age in the HER2 positive population was 60.0 (44-87), in the HER 2 negative population 63.0 (31-94). In the ITT population median age was 63.0 (31-95). The vast majority (94.5%)  had  metastatic  disease  only  12  patients  in  total  had  locally  advanced  disease.  There  were  no significant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  medical  condition  at  baseline  was hypertension, 38% in the ITT population.

## Adjuvant therapy

In the ITT population 60% had received adjuvant therapy. HER 2 patients had received both endocrine and  chemotherapy  to  a  somewhat  higher  extent  than  other  populations.  The  most  common  hormone therapy  was  tamoxifen  which  was  used  in  &gt;  95%  in  all  populations.  Only  few  patients  had  received aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab. The most common chemotherapy was anthracyclin based.

Relatively  many  patients  (almost  half  of  them)  were  endocrine  treatment  naive.  About  one-third  was treatment naïve; however 19% were initially diagnosed with metastatic disease. Currently more patients receive adjuvant aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab than at study start.

## Hormone receptors

A positive status of ER and PR was most common in all populations followed by ER positive/PR negative.

## Other current medical conditions:

In the HER2-positive population, the percentage of subjects with current medical conditions was similar between the two treatment groups. The majority of the current medical conditions were Grade 1 or Grade 2 only. At study entry, the most common current medical condition was hypertension (occurring in 32% of subjects  overall,  grade  III  3%  in  letrozole  plus  placebo  group  and  &lt;1%  in  letrozole  plus  lapatinib), followed by back pain, arthralgia, depression, and fatigue (each  occurring in 11% of all subjects). The only Grade 4 current medical condition reported at baseline was obesity (1 subject in the letrozole plus placebo group).

In  the  letrozole/lapatinib  group  26%  compared  to  35%  in  the  letrozole/  placebo  group  had  a  single metastatic site.

## Previous medications and concurrent medications

In  the  HER2-positive  population, up  to  56%  of  subjects  had  received  prior  chemotherapy  or  endocrine therapy.  Only 2  subjects  (1  subject  in  each  treatment  group)  had  previously  received  trastuzumab.  The most  common  chemotherapy  regimen  was  anthracyclin  based,  however  probably  contained  as  well cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  HER2-positive  population,  of  the  subjects  who  received  prior  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy, approximately 64% and 60% received tamoxifen in the letrozole plus placebo and letrozole plus lapatinib groups,  respectively,  and  approximately  21%  and  17%  of  subjects  in  the  letrozole  plus  placebo  and letrozole  plus  lapatinib  groups,  respectively,  received  tamoxifen  citrate.  Only  2  patients  in  the  HER2 positive population had received treatment with aromatase inhibitors.

There  were  more  patients  in  the  HER-2  positive  group  that  had  discontinued  prior  endocrine  adjuvant treatment &lt; 6 months compared to the ITT population.

Main characteristics of the patients were well balanced between treatment arms in the HER2 population. However, a high serum HER2 (ECD) rate at baseline ( ≥ 15 ng/mL) was more frequent in the letrozol plus placebo arm than in the letrozole plus lapatinib arm.

Also, more patients in the letrozole plus lapatinib arm (55%) than in the letrozole plus placebo (47%) arm had  received  previous  chemotherapy;  this  imbalance  was  almost  entirely  due  to  an  imbalance  in  the number  of  patients  having  received  CMF  adjuvant  treatment  (4%  vs.  10%).  However,  the  distribution between categories of time from discontinuation of chemotherapy is well balanced.

Site of disease and ≥ 6 months interval from discontinuation of endocrine therapy) were basically similar between  treatment  arms  in  all  populations.  In  the  HER  2  positive  population  more  patients  had discontinued endocrine therapy &lt; 6 months before study start compared to the other populations.

## Missing HER2 status

115 patients had missing HER2 status, the main reason was insufficient tumour material provided. The HER2  missing  subjects  were  slightly  more  common  in  Western  and  Eastern  Europe.  In  general  this population was similar to the other populations, however time since diagnosis was longer compared to the ITT population and there were fewer ductal carcinomas.

a. Estimate of the treatment HR based on the log-rank test, &lt;1 indicates a lower risk with letrozole 2.5 mg + lapatinib 1500 mg compared with letrozole 2.5 mg + placebo.

- b. p-value from stratified log-rank test, stratifying for site of disease and time since prior adjuvant endocrine therapy at screening.

In  the  HER2-postive  population  of  EGF30008,  there  were  24  patients  with  symptomatic  progression. There was an imbalance between arms, 15 in the letrozole + placebo arm and 9 in the letrozole + lapatinib arm.  Excluding  these  patients  with  symptomatic  progression,  the  HR  was  0.76  (95%  CI:  0.55,  1.04; stratified log rank p=0.075), which was not statistically significant.

The  median  is  at  the  largest  difference  in  the  curve.  After  about  70  weeks  the  curves  converge.  As expected in this selected HER2 positive population the PFS is shorter compared to first-line treatment in other studies with aromatase inhibitors.

The analysis of IRC-evaluated PFS in the HER2-positive population also confirmed the primary analysis, demonstrating  the  internal  consistency  of  the  results  in  this  study.  There  was  a  statistically  significant improvement  in  median  PFS  in  subjects  receiving  letrozole  plus  lapatinib  (60  weeks)  compared  with subjects receiving letrozole plus placebo (35.4 weeks) (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96, p=0.022).

As  a  consequence  of  censoring,  the  PFS  assessed  by  IRC  was  longer  as  compared  to  the  investigator assessments.

There  was  a  discrepancy  between  the  investigator  and  IRC  assessed  PFS  regarding  the  HER2  positive population. Overall concordance is 63% when using a 7 day window. The differences were primarily due to progression being determined by the investigator and censoring of IRC review due to initiation of new anti-cancer therapy by investigator.

As  PFS  is  liable  to  bias  a  clarification  was  provided  regarding  radiologically  versus  symptomatically assessed patients which showed that it is admissible that the difference in PFS is maintained.

b. p-valuefrom exact test that common oddsratioequals1.

Note: Including bone scans' indicates that the assessment of CR or PR required confirmation using bone scans, regardless of thepresence of bone disease at baseline.

Overall Response Rate/Complete Response/Partial Response : The data were consistent with the analysis of subjects with measurable disease only. There were only few patients with CR and PRs. Patients aged &gt; 65 years had a higher response rate in both treatment arms, 16.2% and 36.6% respectively.

The IRC evaluated ORR also showed an improved ORR in favour of letrozole/placebo of 27.0% (19.0, 36.3) compared to 9.3 % (4.5, 16.4).

Time to response: 11/16 and 23/31 in the letrozole/placebo and letrozole/lapatinib group respectively had responded by the first assessment (12 weeks).

Duration of response: Duration of response was longer in the letrozole/ placebo group compared to the letrozole/laptinib group (84.4 vs. 47.4 weeks, investigator assessment).

A possible explanation to this finding could be that patients that respond to endocrine treatment only have a more indolent disease.

Brain metastases: There were no differences with regards to brain metastases, however only 3 patients in total in the HER 2 positive population had brain metastases.

Quality of Life :  In  the  HER2-positive population, results for the analyses of OQL change from baseline were similar in the groups with generally stable QOL on all measures for subjects who stayed in the study. In general, mean QOL scores for both treatment groups were higher than their respective baseline values during  follow  up.  At  the  concluding  visit,  MIDs  occurred  in  both  treatment  groups.  None  of  the differences between treatment groups were statistically significant. However, the scales, FACT-B; FACTG and TOI may not capture all relevant side effects.

Biomarkers: In  the  HER2  positive  population  49%  in  the  letrozole/placebo  arm  vs.  32%  in  the letrozole/lapatinib group had with HER2 ECD &gt; 15 ng/mL. In the HER2 positive as well as the HER2 negative group patients with HER2 ECD &gt; 15 ng/mL had shorter PFS irrespective of treatment. In the HER2 positive  group  subjects  with  HER2  ECD  &gt;  15  ng/mL  letrozole/placebo  group  had  significantly shorter PFS compared to the letrozole/lapatinib group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sub group analyses:

When analysing age groups &lt;65 and &gt;65 there were no differences seen in the HER2 positive population on PFS; ORR was higher in the group aged &gt;65 years. With regards to OS survival in the HER2 positive population in subjects aged &lt;65 years there was a survival of 147.9 weeks in the letrozole/placebo group and  118.7  weeks  in  the  letrozole/lapatinib  group.  However,  the  data  was  not  mature.  In  the  group  of subjects aged &gt;65 years the median OS was 93.6 weeks in the letrozole/placebo group and data could not be calculated in the letrozole and lapatinib group.

In patients with FISH/ICH2+ or FISH borderline there was no difference in PFS.

With regards to hormone receptors a Cox proportional Hazard Modelling with ER and PR as continuous variables  was  performed.  For  the  primary  endpoint  (PFS  as  assessed  by  investigators)  ER  (continuous) had no statistically significant impact on PFS (HR 0.997, p=0.2298). However, when analysed by IRC ER had a statistically significant improvement in PFS HR 0.993, p=0.0266, which translates into a reduction in HR of 0.07 of every 10% increment in ER. The same pattern is seen for PR.

In the category 0&lt;5 where lapatinib would be expected to have the largest relative add-on effect the hazard ratio is very close to 1. However the groups were too small to draw any conclusions.

New information provided on effect in different HR cut-off categories (&lt;10%, &gt;10%, 10-50%, &gt;50%) did show consistent results with regards to the hazard ratio.

## 1.4.2.2 Supportive study EGF10030

EGF10030 was a Phase I, open-label study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GW572016 in combination with letrozole (Femara) in subjects with advanced breast cancer or other solid tumours.

This  study  was  conducted  in  three  phases  which  included  three  cohorts  of  subjects;  a  dose  escalation cohort  (Cohort  1)  to  determine  the  optimally  tolerated  dose  (OTR),  an  expansion  cohort  (Cohort  2)  to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the OTR, and a PK cohort (Cohort 3) to assess the potential for a drug-drug interaction when these two drugs are used in combination.

## Methods

The  study  was  a  phase  1  open  label  to  determine  OTR  and  PK.  Safety  was  followed  by  vital  signs, laboratory  parameters,  MUGA  and  ECG  for  cardiac  safety.  Adverse  events  were  collected  using  NCICTC version 3, RECIST criteria were used to assess response when applicable.

39 patients with mainly hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (n=18) and ovarian cancer (n=16) were enrolled. Mean age was 56.1 (31-73) and all subjects were female and white.

12 subjects were included in the optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) dose finding cohort (Cohort 1), seven subjects in the OTR expansion cohort (Cohort 2), and 20 subjects in the PK cohort (Cohort 3). The OTR expansion added patients at OTR to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination.

The dose of lapatinib was escalated in three subjects/dose level in Cohort 1 starting at a lapatinib dose of 1250 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. The letrozole dose remained at 2.5 mg at all dose levels.

The doses for  lapatinib  were  chosen  from  the  range  administered  in  EGF  10003  where  doses  of  up  to 1800 mg once daily were administered without DLT during the first treatment cycle. The dose of letrozole (2.5 mg once a day) was based on the approved dosage.

## Results

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was considered a Grade 2 diarrhoea two days after starting lapatinib in one of 8 patients in the 1500 mg cohort.

A total of 5 patients experienced DLTs 4 diarrhoeas 1 grade 1 and 3 grade 3 and one grade 3 rash.

With respect to the efficacy results, two patients achieved PR (one breast cancer, one endometrial cancer), 20 subjects had stable disease, and twelve subjects had progressive disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding  safety  four  subjects  had  a  LVEF  decrease  of  greater  than  or  equal  to  20%  relative  to  their baseline assessment. One of these subjects had an LVEF decrease of &gt; 20%.

The most commonly reported AEs were: diarrhoea, rash, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. Twentyone subjects had Grade 3 AEs and two subjects had Grade 4 AEs, all in the 1500 mg lapatinib plus 2.5 mg letrozole  treatment  group.  One  patient  died  due  to  Grade  4  respiratory  failure,  this  was  not  considered related by the investigator.

The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of lapatinib.

## 1.4.2.3 Overall Conclusion on Clinical Efficacy

The  application  targets  all  postmenopausal,  HR+/HER2+  patients  in  first  line  treatment  for  metastatic disease. This group of patients may in fact be treated with chemotherapy instead of hormone therapy. The combination of chemotherapy with trastuzumab is even recommended for patients with good performance status,  visceral  disease,  or  rapidly  progressing  tumours  (Prat,  2008),  like  the  majority  of  the  patients included  in  trial  EGF  30008.  Therefore,  the  evidence  supporting  this  application  may  be  considered  to respect just one of the possible ways of treating the target population of patients.

For the HER2 population a statistically significant prolongation in PFS was seen by investigator assessed evaluations. In the letrozole/placebo group the median PFS was 13.0 weeks (12.0, 23.7) compared to 35.4 weeks  (24.1, 39.4) in the lapatinib/letrozole group  which  is considered a clinically  meaningful improvement. HR was 0.71 (0.53, 0.96) p=0.019 in favour of the letrozole/laptinib arm. Cox regression analysis  showed  a  HR  0.65  (0.47,  0.89)  p=  0.008.  The  majority  of  the  responses  were  seen  within  12 weeks of treatment. The duration of response was 47.7 weeks in the letrozole/lapatinib arm compared to 84.4 weeks in the letrozole/placebo arm. This could tentatively be explained by a more indolent course in tumours responding to single endocrine treatment.

However, as the primary endpoint of PFS is liable to bias, the assessment of the exact magnitude of the efficacy of the combination required a clarification of the distribution of radiologically versus symptomatically assessed patients. The MAH provided data demonstrating that:

- -the  loss  of  significance  of  the  difference  in  PFS  when  patients  with  symptomatic  progression  are excluded from the analysis must be due to a loss of power:
- -even in the worst scenario ( symptomatic progressions in the control arm being considered to occur at the  next  fixed  assessment  date  and  those  in  the  experimental  arm  being  considered  to  occur  at  the preceding fixed assessment date), the difference in PFS keeps its statistical significance.

Therefore, it is admissible that, despite the imbalance between the two arms in the numbers of patients with symptomatic progression, the difference in PFS favouring the lapatinib arm is maintained. Furthermore, analyses of hormone receptors showed a slight tendency in IRC evaluated PFS towards better effect in patients with higher levels of hormone receptors; however the effect seems to be fairly consistent in all groups. New analyses with regards to different levels of HR cut-off showed consistent results.

There was no significant difference in OS but the data were not considered mature for the analysis of this endpoint. The overall response rate was 27.9 vs. 14.8% respectively in favour of letrozole/lapatinib. The submission of a mature data set has been requested by the CHMP as a Follow-up Measure.

The combination of trastuzumab and an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer is currently approved. To accurately determine the clinical benefit a randomised comparison of the regimens would be needed. However, as the study EGF 30008 had ended subject recruitment before trastuzumab was approved for this indication, this was not feasible at that time. There  are  no  direct  comparisons  available  to  explore  the  difference  between  lapatinib  and  trastuzumab concomitant with antihormonal treatment. While not primarily designed to give a direct comparison of lapatinib or trastuzumab in combination with endocrine therapy, study EGF106708 ('ALTTO') is testing lapatinib and trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting in patients with early breast cancer. Approximately half of the planned 8000 patients to be enrolled are expected to have hormone receptor (HR)-positive primary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tumours, and therefore to be receiving a concurrent anti-hormonal agent while receiving the investigational targeted therapies (trastuzumab or lapatinib or a sequence of trastuzumab then lapatinib or trastuzumab + lapatinib). It is further estimated that 50% to 75% (approximately 3000 women) of these women with HR-positive tumours will be postmenopausal and hence most likely taking an AI. Results from this  study  are  anticipated  in  2012  and  the  MAH  committed  to  provide  these  data  as  a  Follow-up Measure.

In  addition,  the  MAH  is  currently  planning  to  undertake  further  clinical  trials  in  patients  who  have received at least adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab for their breast cancer. The design of such trials is currently under consideration within the company. One study may have a randomised, controlled design and be performed in a patient population essentially identical to that of EGF30008 with the exception that subjects must have received prior treatment with trastuzumab. The reference arm for this trial could be trastuzumab + AI, and therefore also address a previous question from the CHMP that a direct comparison of trastuzumab + AI with Tyverb + AI had not been done. The primary and key secondary endpoints of this study may be the same as in EGF30008.

A second, separate study under consideration by the MAH is an uncontrolled trial of Tyverb + AI in the patient  population  described  above.  This  trial  may  deliver  clinical  data  in  a  quicker  timeframe  to  a controlled study.

The CHMP requested the MAH to present the protocol and timelines of the planned studies as Follow-up commitments.

## Clinical studies in special populations- Paediatric data

A  class  waiver  decision  on  the  conditions  granted  for  products  intended  for  the  treatment  of  breast carcinoma was issued by the EMEA on 14 July 2008 (EMEA/360425/2008, P/47/2008).

The  PDCO  confirmed  that  this  waiver  applies  to  lapatinib  on  20  May  2008  (EMEA/242695/2008, EMEA/6/2008).

## 1.4.3 Clinical Safety

This section reviews the safety profile of lapatinib administered in combination with letrozole to subjects with  hormone-receptor  positive  advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer.  The  review  includes  safety  data from subjects receiving at least one dose of study treatment in the pivotal study EGF30008 (N=1278) and the supporting dose-finding study EGF10030 (N=39).

Since the supporting Phase I study included subjects with various tumour types, data from the two trials were not integrated.

## 1.4.3.1 Pivotal study EGF 30008

## Patient exposure

In the pivotal study 1286 patients were enrolled, the safety population comprised all patients who have received at least 1 dose of medication which was 1278, 624 patients with letrozole/placebo and 654 with letrozole/lapatinib. 6 patients in the placebo and 2 patients in the lapatinib group did not receive treatment. Furthermore 14 subjects in the letrozole /placebo group received lapatinib.

Nine subjects were randomised to letrozole/lapatinib, but received letrozole+placebo during the treatment period. However, they received at least 1 dose of lapatinib and were included in the lapatinib group for safety. As a conservative approach, these 9 subjects were included in the letrozole+lapatinib arm of the Safety  Population,  and  any  adverse  events  that  these  subjects  experienced  were  attributed  to  the letrozole+lapatinib arm.

The  mean  duration  of  treatment  was  about  55  weeks  both  for  lapatinib  and  letrozole.  Treatment compliance was &gt;80% for the majority of patients in both treatment groups.

A Summary of exposure to lapatinib and letrozole (safety population) is presented in the table below.

b. Note the numbers of subjects with AEs leading topermanent discontinuation of study treatment presented in this table are different from those presented inTable 9.This is because theprimary reason for discontinuation from treatmentwasnot listed asAEonthecasereportformforsomesubjects.

C. Included rash,diarrhea,nail changes,hepatotoxicity,LVEFdecreases,and pulmonaryevents (AEs thought o be associated with EGFR and HER2 inhibition)(seeSection8.6.3)

The  majority  of  AEs  were  grade  1-2  in  both  groups.  The  most  common  AEs  (see  table  below)  were gastrointestinal  and  skin  related.  Diarrhoea  was  3  times  more  common  in  the  letrozole/lapatinib  group compared  to the letrozole/placebo group. Also rash was about 3 times more frequent in the letrozole/lapatinib group compare to letrozole/placebo group. Of the events, 84% in the letrozole/lapatinib vs. 55% in the letrozole/placebo arm were classified as treatment related. Also for treatment related AEs gastrointestinal and skin events dominated. There were only minor differences in AEs between &lt;65 and &gt;65  years  old  and  &lt;75  and  &gt;75  years  old.  Peripheral  edema  and  urinary  tract  infections  were  more

common  in  older  age  groups  and  hot  flushes  were  reported  more  commonly  among  the  younger  age groups.

Other AEs with &gt;10% in the lapatinib/letrozole arm were atralgia 31% (vs. letrozole/placebo 21%), back pain 16% (vs. 16%), headache 14% (vs. 13%), cough 12% (vs. 14%), hot flush 11% (vs. 15%) and pain in extremity 10% (vs. 12%).

## AEs leading to discontinuation

In the letrozole/laptinib group 12% had any dose reduction and 18 % had dose delays. There were more AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug in the letrozole/laptainib arm. Diarrhoea was most common reason in the letrozole/lapatinib arm, in the letrozole/placebo arm the most common events were ejection fraction decreased/left ventricular dysfunction. However 'ejection fraction decreased' was more common  in  the  letrozole/lapatinib  arm  in  total.  In  the  age  group  &gt;65 years  slightly  more  patients discontinued due to treatment 20% and 8% for letrozole/laptinib and letrozole/placebo respectively.

The most common AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of investigational medicinal products are shown in the table below.

- C. See the Study EGF30008 CSR (Section 8.3) for subjects that were included in this category.

There were more SAEs in the letrozole/lapatinib group compared to letrozole/placebo, 144 (22%) and 94 (15%), respectively. The most common events were decreased ejection fraction and diarrhoea.

Of the SAEs 8% vs. 4% in letrozole/laptinib and letrozole/placebo respectively were considered treatment related.  Infections  were  noted  in  17  (12%)  compared  to  6  (6  %)  subjects  in  the  letrozole/laptinib  and letrozole/placebo arm respectively.

Age did not have a large impact on the frequency or distribution of SAEs.

Sourcedata:Table8.21.

a. A subject could have more than1SAE leading to deathi.e.,although there are8subjects with fatal events in each treatment group, there are more events listed because subjects had more than 1 reported event that attributed to the fatality.

b. This includes 3 subjects who were not listed in the fatal AE category in Table 61; 2 subjects with progression of diseaseand1subjectwhowasinvolved inacarcrash.

## Laboratory findings

Of haematology findings neutropenia was the  most  common and occurred in grade 3 and 4 in 4% for letrozole/placebo and 2% for letrozole/lapatinib.

The most common chemistry grade 3 or 4 events were AST/ALT changes which occurred in 6 and 5% respectively in the letrozole/lapatinib and 2 and 1% respectively in the letrozole placebo group.

## 1.4.3.2 Supportive study EGF10030

The AE profile of letrozole plus lapatinib in trial  EGF 10030 was generally similar to that seen in the pivotal study and consistent with lapatinib clinical experience.

Eighteen of the 39 enrolled subjects had breast cancer. Most subjects (95%) experienced at least one AE and  in  87%,  the  event  was  treatment-related.  The  most  common  treatment-related  toxicities  were diarrhoea (77%), rash (62%), nausea (46%), and fatigue (26%), but most AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2, and reversible.

Two subjects discontinued investigational product each due to a single AE; Grade 4 respiratory failure and Grade 3 rash.

Treatment  related  SAEs  were  low,  with  2  subjects  reporting  Grade  3  anaemia,  Grade  3  diarrhoea  and Grade 2 nausea.

One  subject  died  during  the  follow-up  period  from  serious  Grade  4  respiratory  failure  that  was  not treatment related.

## 1.4.3.3 Adverse events of interest

The following categories of AEs have been analysed as AEs of special interest as these are known to be associated with inhibition of either ErbB2 or ErbB1 based on the MAH's prior clinical experience:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -diarrhoea (due to inhibition of ErbB1)
- -rash (due to inhibition of ErbB1)
- -hepatobiliary events (attributed to inhibition of tyrosine kinase)
- -cardiac events (due to inhibition of ErbB2)
- -pulmonary events (due to inhibition of ErbB1)
- -nail disorder

Source data:Table8.14

a.s SeeSection5.6.3.2fortheMedDRApreferred termsincluded.

Diarrhoea : Sixty-four % in the letrozole/lapatinib arm had an event of diarrhoea. No action was taken in the  majority  of  the  events  (90%  in  the  letrozole/placebo  and  85%  in  the  letrozole/lapatinib  arm).  The median time to onset was 14.0 days in the letrozole/lapatinib group and 58.5 days in the letrozole/placebo group. The median duration was 24 days and 8 days respectively. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea was reported in 14% of the letrozole/lapatinib group.

Rash: The  analysis  of  rash  as  an  event  of  special  interest  included  the  following  preferred  terms: dermatitis  acneiform,  eczema,  exfoliative  rash,  photosensitivity  reaction,  rash,  rash  erythematous,  rash generalised, rash macular, rash maculopapular, rash papular, rash pruritic, rash pustular, and skin ulcer.

In study EGF30008 in the letrozole/lapatinib group 328 patients experienced rash. Of these 89% of the events resolved. Medication was needed in 35% of the subjects. The median time to onset was 2.86 weeks and the duration 51 days.

In Study EGF10030, 36 rash events were reported for 25 subjects (64%); 3 (75%) subjects who received letrozole  2.5 mg  plus  lapatinib  1250  mg  and  22 (65%) subjects  who  received  letrozole  2.5  mg  plus lapatinib 1500 mg. Most rash events reported were considered to be treatment-related by the investigator and  most  were  Grade  1  or  Grade 2  in  toxicity.  No  SAEs  of  rash  were  reported  during  the  study.  One subject  who  received  letrozole  2.5 mg  plus  lapatinib  1500  mg  had  a  Grade  3  AE  of  rash  that  led  to discontinuation of investigational product; the event later resolved with sequelae.

Hepatotoxicity: In study EGF30008, the incidence of hepatobiliary AEs was higher in the letrozole/lapatinib group (15% vs. 8%); however, the frequencies of hepatic SAEs were similar between the treatment groups (2%  vs. 4%). There was  one death due to a liver related SAE  in  the letrozole/lapatinib group.

In  Study EGF10030,  five  treatment-related  Grade  1  hepatic  AEs  occurred  in  3 subjects  (9%);  all  the events resolved without dose modification.

Cardiac events: The most common cardiac events were palpitations, left ventricular dysfunction, atrial fibrillation,  tachycardia  and  cardiac  failure.  Cardiac  events  of  specific  interest  were  cardiac  failure, decreased ejection fraction, left ventricular dysfunction and ventricular dysfunction. In study EGF30008, in the letrozole/laptinib group 32 patients (5%) had 39 events reported. In the letrozole/placebo group 15 subjects (2%) had 16 events reported.

In Study EGF10030, 1 subject (who received letrozole 2.5 mg plus lapatinib 1250 mg) had an event of decreased ejection fraction during the study (70% at screening to 48% [31% decline] on Study Day 51).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This Grade 2 event was reported as an AE and was considered to be treatment-related by the investigator. The event resolved without dose modification. An additional 3 subjects had a  20% decrease in LVEF relative to their pre-treatment values but the LVEF measurement was not below 50%.

Pulmonary events: One patient in each treatment group experienced pneumonitis. Two additional subjects in the letrozole/laptinib group had AEs suggestive of pneumonitis.

Nail  disorder: Nail  disorders  were  reported  for  11  %  in  the  letrozole/laptinib  and  &lt;1%  in  the letrozole/placebo group.

## 1.4.3.4 Overall conclusion on Safety

In the pivotal study, there were more subjects who had side-effects in the letrozole/lapatinib group (96%) than in the letrozole/placebo group (86%). The majority of side effects were grade 1-2. The most common side  effects  were  diarrhoea  and  rash  that  occurred  in  64%  and  45  %  in  the  subjects  treated  with letrozole/laptinib.  The  majority  of  the  adverse  effects,  84%  were  classified  as  treatment  related  in  the letrozole/laptinib group. Although most events were grade 1-2 they can impact patients well-being as an example grade 2 diarrhoea is described as 'increase of 4-6 stools/ day or nocturnal stools'.

Adverse  events  of  interest  were  except  diarrhoea  and  rash,  hepatobiliary  events,  cardiotoxicity  and pulmonary  events.  Cardiac  events  were  recorded  in  the  letrozole/placebo  group  in  15  subjects  (2%) reported. In the letrozole/laptinib group 32 patients (5%) had 39 events reported.

Hepatobiliary events were more common in the letrozole/laptinib arm and recorded in 15% of the patients.

One patient in each treatment arm was diagnosed with pneumonitis, and further two cases in the lapatinib arm were suggestive of pneumonitis.

The number of SAEs were higher in the letrozole/lapatinib group compared to the letrozole/placebo group, 144 (22%) and 94 (15%), respectively. The most common serious adverse events were decreased ejection fraction and diarrhoea.

Of the SAEs 8% vs. 4% in letrozole/laptinib and letrozole/placebo respectively were considered treatment related.

Fatal SAEs occurred in 8 patients in each treatment group.

There were no different safety signals in older age groups. In general the safety profile is consistent with the known safety profiles of letrozole and lapatinib.

## 1.4.4 Risk Management plan

Hepatobiliary events, decreased LVEF, pneumonitis/ILD, diarrhoea, rash and interactions with other drugs are important identified risks. Cardiac, hepatobiliary, and pulmonary events are matters of concern due to the potential seriousness, warranting risk-management measures to allow the detection of a pre-existent deficit predisposing to adverse events (such as in the case of cardiac toxicity) or early diagnosis of toxicity manifestations. QTc changes and food effect on bioavailability are potential risks.

Additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  proposed  for  the  following  safety  concerns:  Hepatobiliary events, decreased LVEF, diarrhoea and rash, in form of core risk management information.

The RMP has been updated as requested during the assessment. The updated RMP version 8 follows the template for EU-risk management plan and all relevant areas have been covered. Interactions with other drugs  were  added  as  an  important  potential  risk.  The  section  for  Pharmacological  Class  Effects  was updated.  Key  elements  from  Core  risk  management  information  were  added  into  the  revised  proposed SPC and PIL. In addition, the following responses have been submitted: Data from epidemiological and pharmacogenetic  studies concerning  hepatobiliary events have  been  submitted  and  results of an epidemiology study concerning pneumonitis/ILD were shown. A study to evaluate the effect of lapatinib on  QT/QTc  interval  was  proposed  by  the  MAH.  Data  on  cardiac  and  hepatobiliary  events  in  elderly patients  was  shown.  In  the  SPC,  more  safety  information  was  added  concerning  the  following  topics:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased LVEF, pneumonitis/ILD, study results and additional information concerning possible impact on QT interval.

Four  epidemiology  studies  and  three  pharmacogenetic  studies  have  been  undertaken  to  date  regarding hepatobiliary toxicities, and these studies were summarised by the MAH. Timelines for the epidemiology studies  were  provided.  The  pharmacogenetic  studies  revealed  strong  genetic  associations  for  a  Class  II MHC  locus  (centred  on  HLA-DQA1*0201)  with  ALT  elevation,  and  the  Gilbert´s  syndrome  variant UGT1A1*28 with TBL elevation.

In rats, growth retardation was observed in pups which were exposed to lapatinib via breast milk. Breast-feeding must be discontinued in women who are receiving therapy with Tyverb.''

## 1.5 Overall Conclusion and Benefit-Risk Assessment

## Benefit:

In patients with HER 2 positive metastatic disease the treatment of choice is generally chemotherapy in combination treatments that target HER 2. However not all patients are candidates for chemotherapy. In postmenopausal  women  with  hormone  receptor  and  HER  2  positive  metastatic  breast  cancer  the combination of letrozole and lapatinib has shown a modest increase in PFS compared to letrozole/placebo. The Hazard Ratio (HR) was 0.71 (0.53, 0.96), p= 0.019. The median PFS in the letrozole/lapatinib group was 35.4 weeks compared to 13.0 weeks. This could however be an overestimation a, estimated from HR it should be rather 5-10 weeks. The effect can be acceptable from a clinical point of view.

## Uncertainties:

Breast  cancer  treatment  has  changed  from  study  start  and  substantially  more  patients  are  receiving aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment. A concern is how the new treatment standard would affect  the  results  of  the  studied  combination.  In  the  study  only  very  few  patients  have  received previous adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitors or trastuzumab which are current treatment standard for many patients in the proposed population. Data provided to support the effect of the lapatinib/aromatase  inhibitor  combination  after  progression  on  trastuzumab  are  only  data  from  other settings and not regarding the combination.

As pointed out by the MAH, use of sequential endocrine/aromatase inhibitor treatment is in many cases endorsed  and  as  aromatase  inhibitors  are  widely  used  a  clinical  interpretation  of  the  registration  study without clear information in the indication could be that addition of lapatinib to an aromatase inhibitor after progression was studied which is misleading.

Furthermore the population failed on trastuzumab and aromatase inhibitors could be a different population both  with  regards  to  prognosis  and  with  regards  to  receptor  status  and  other  biologic  markers  than  the population studied where the majority of patients had failed on tamoxifen or were endocrine naive. Data were provided which showed a consistency in Hazard Ratios in different HR levels.

The pivotal trial provided evidence for the superiority of efficacy in terms of PFS of lapatinib+letrozole against letrozole alone, but the application targeted all the postmenopausal, HR+/HER2+ patients in first line  treatment  for  metastatic  disease.  However,  the  combination  of  chemotherapy  with  trastuzumab  is generally recommended for patients with good performance status, visceral disease, or rapidly progressing tumours  (Prat,  2008).  In  the  study  the  majority  of  patients  received  chemotherapy  on  progression. Therefore, the evidence supporting this application may be considered to respect just one of the possible ways of treating the target population of patients. There are no direct data to compare lapatinib+letrozole against combination chemotherapy with trastuzumab.

The combination of trastuzumab and an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with  metastatic  breast  cancer  whose  tumours  overexpress  HER2  is  currently  approved.  To  accurately determine the clinical benefit of lapatinib in this context comparisons of lapatinib vs. trastuzumab, each in combination  with  an  aromatase  inhibitor  are  needed.  Data  provided  refer  to  phase  II-III  studies investigating  the  effect  of  lapatinib  in  combination  with  antihormonal  treatment  in  neodadjuvant  and metastatic  setting.  No  studies  in  either  setting  were  comparing  the  effect  of  lapatinib  and  letrozole  in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.

The MAH is now planning for further clinical trials in the endocrine setting with patients pretreated with trastuzumab.

The  endpoint  PFS  is  liable  to  bias,  the  assessment  of  the  exact  magnitude  of  the  efficacy  of  the combination required a clarification of radiologically versus symptomatically assessed patients. Data and sensitivity  analyses  showed  that  it  is  admissible  that  despite  the  imbalance  between  the  numbers  of patients with symptomatic progression, the difference is maintained.

No statistically significant difference was seen in the OS, but the data are immature and results may be further diluted after prolonged follow up and use of next-line therapies. Even though currently available survival data are considered reassuring, an update is asked for.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk:

The combination of letrozole/lapatinib revealed no new safety signals of importance compared to what was known previously. However the high frequency of grade 1-2 diarrhoea and rash is clearly a concern from a tolerability perspective.

The most common serious adverse events were decreased ejection fraction and diarrhoea; however, the event rates were sufficiently low to be seen as acceptable in the context of treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Nevertheless,  cardiac,  hepatobiliary,  and  pulmonary  events,  although  relatively  rare,  are  matters  of concern  due  to  the  potential  seriousness,  warranting  continuous  monitoring  and  risk-management measures to allow the detection of a pre-existent deficit predisposing to premature adverse events (case of the cardiac toxicity), or the early diagnosis of toxicity manifestations.

No  different  safety  signals  were  revealed  in  older  patients,  which  is  reassuring  with  regards  to  the population intended.

## Balance:

A  modest  to  moderate  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  prolongation  has  been  shown.  In  individual  patients tolerability problems led to discontinuation of therapy. The difference in adverse drug reactions associated with  the  combination  consisted  mainly  in  drug  reactions  of  mild  or  moderate  severity  and  is  not considered  to  outweigh  the  benefits  observed.  In  conclusion,  the  benefit  -  risk  ratio  is  considered favourable.

## 1.6 Product Information

Taking into account the documentation submitted and the assessment of the data as discussed above, the CHMP agreed to extend the indication in SPC section 4.1 as follows:

'Tyverb is indicated for the treatment of patients with breast cancer, whose tumours overexpress HER2 (ErbB2);

-  in combination with capecitabine for patients with advanced or metastatic disease with progression following prior therapy, which must have included anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting (see section 5.1).
-  in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive metastatic disease, not currently intended for chemotherapy.  The patients in the registration study were not previously treated with trastuzumab or an aromatase inhibitor (See section 5.1).'

SPC  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.3,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  have  been  revised  as  a  consequence  of  the  extension  of indication. Furthermore, SPC section 6.5, labelling and section 6 of the PL have been updated to reflect the additional pack-size of 84 tablets as applied by the MAH. Minor editorial changes were also made to the SPC. In addition, the Package Leaflet has been updated in line with the SPC revisions. Annex II has been revised to reflect the latest approved RMP version.  Please refer to Annex 1 for the complete revised Product Information

The CHMP considered the request from the MAH acceptable to not pursue the initially proposed separate package leaflets for the two indications taking into account the MAH proposed changes to SPC section 4.1, PL section 1 as well as the proposed restructuring in PL section 3. These revisions should guide the potential  user  to  more  easily  identify  the  relevant  prescribed  dose  by  stressing  the  relevant  type  of combination  therapy  (keeping  the  same  type  of  terminology  structure)  as  in  section  1  of  the  PL.  The CHMP considered all this information vital to eliminate possible confusion for the user of the leaflet and yet to be medically correct.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, during the assessment the MAH mentioned plans to introduce bottle packaging for Tyberb in the second half of 2010 with a future variation application. The committee pointed out that in view of the agreed combined leaflet it should be considered by the MAH that the bottle size would suit both dosing regimens.

## User consultation

The Package Leaflet (PL) for Tyverb in combination with capecitabine is based on the current approved PL, which has proven readability in October 2006 during the review of the initial marketing authorisation application, thus the MAH is of the opinion that readability testing is not warranted.

The changes made to the PL due to product specific information are indeed limited. Since the main issues of the package leaflet have already been tested, the CHMP agreed with the MAH that no new user testing is considered necessary.

## Braille

In  accordance  with  Article  56a  of  Directive  2001/  83/  EC,  the  name  of  the  medicinal  product  will  be expressed in Braille on the secondary packaging.

For the present variation the invented name in Braille will be included on the outer boxes. The outer boxes contain the invented name in the different strengths, which is acceptable.

The following information appears in the submitted Product Information, annex IIIA:

## tyverb 250 mg

This information appears with dots on the proposed mock-ups as submitted with this application and the location of the Braille dots could be acceptable.

## 2 CONCLUSION

On 18 February 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.
