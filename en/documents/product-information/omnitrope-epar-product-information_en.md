## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Infants, children and adolescents

- -Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency, GHD).
- -Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome.
- -Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency.
- -Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) &lt; -2.5 and parental adjusted height SDS &lt; -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a birth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up growth (height velocity (HV) SDS &lt; 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later.
- -Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing.

## Adults

- -Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.
- -Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple hormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should undergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency.
- -Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should be re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary to a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS &lt; -2 off growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of profound GHD.

All other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders.

## Posology

## Paediatric population

The posology and administration schedule should be individualised.

Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients Generally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended. Even higher doses have been used.

Where childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full somatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal peak bone mass defined as a T score &gt; -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic objectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below.

Prader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients Generally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses.

## Growth disturbance due to Turner syndrome

A dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended.

## Growth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency

A dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m 2 body surface area per day) is recommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be needed after six months of treatment (see section 4.4).

Growth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA) A dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m 2  body surface area per day) is usually recommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if height velocity is &lt; 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is &gt; 14 years (girls) or &gt; 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates.

## Growth hormone deficient adult patients

In patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to restart is 0.2 - 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.

In adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.

In both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS from the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment should be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not exceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose titration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a good clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen replacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production decreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced.

## Special populations

## Elderly

In patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be slowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day.

## Method of administration

The injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy.

For instructions for use and handling see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours must be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth.

Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated with somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2).

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypoadrenalism

Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin treatment (see section 4.5).

## Use with oral oestrogen therapy

If a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be increased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if a woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be reduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5).

## Insulin sensitivity

Somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may require adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.

## Thyroid function

Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone levels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically may develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid function should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard replacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be closely monitored

## Neoplasms

In growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay attention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms.

## Slipped capital femoral epiphysis

In patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with somatropin should be examined clinically.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benign intracranial hypertension

In case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary.

## Leukaemia

Leukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.

## Antibodies

A small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is low and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in any patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.

## Pancreatitis

Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated patients who develop abdominal pain, especially in children.

## Scoliosis

Scoliosis  is  known  to  be  more  frequent  in  some  of  the  patient  groups  treated  with  somatropin.  In addition, rapid growth in any child can cause progression of scoliosis. Somatropin has not been shown to  increase  the  incidence  or  severity  of  scoliosis.  Signs  of  scoliosis  should  be  monitored  during treatment.

## Acute critical illness

The effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving 522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients treated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. Based on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved.

In all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with somatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved.

## Elderly patients

Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions.

## Prader-Willi syndrome

In patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients with PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding a weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified respiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk.

Before initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed.

If during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child should be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the respiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.

Sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected.

If during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed.

All patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively.

All patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone treatment.

Experience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited.

## Small for gestational age

In short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment.

In SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. familial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not be administered.

In SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment.

Experience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not recommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited.

Some of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth hormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached.

## Chronic renal insufficiency

In chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution of therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of therapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of acidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation.

To date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are available.

Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection contains benzyl alcohol: This medicine contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Intravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in neonates ('gasping syndrome'). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.

Advise the parents or legal guardian to not use more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old) without a physician or pharmacist permission.

Advise pregnant or breast feeding patients that large amounts of benzyl alcohol can be build up in their body and may cause sides effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

Advise patients who have a liver or kidney disease that large amounts of benzyl alcohol can be build up in their body and may cause sides effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

## Sodium content

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth.

Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see section 4.4).

In women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4).

Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

There have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding women. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women.

## Fertility

Fertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Omnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8

## Undesirable effects

## a. Summary of the safety profile

Patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When treatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. Adverse reactions related to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema and arthralgia are very common; musculoskeletal stiffness, myalgia and paraesthesia are common.

In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

The incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and possibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency.

Omnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with their formation, see section 4.4.

## b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ‡ Clinical significance is unknown

† Reported in growth hormone deficient children treated with somatropin, but the incidence appears to be similar to that in children without growth hormone deficiency.

## c. Description of selected adverse reactions

## Reduced serum cortisol levels

Somatropin has been reported to reduce serum cortisol levels, possibly by affecting carrier proteins or by increased hepatic clearance. The clinical relevance of these findings may be limited. Nevertheless, corticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of therapy.

## Prader-Willi syndrome

In the post-marketing experience rare cases of sudden death have been reported in patients affected by Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin, although no causal relationship has been demonstrated.

## Leukaemia

Cases of leukaemia (rare or very rare) have been reported in growth hormone deficient children treated with somatropin and included in the post-marketing experience. However, there is no evidence of an increased risk of leukaemia without predisposition factors, such as radiation to the brain or head.

## Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease have been reported in children treated with GH. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs more frequently in case of endocrine disorders and Legg-Calvé-Perthes is more frequent in case of short stature. But it is unknown if these 2 pathologies are more frequent or not while treated with somatropin. Their diagnosis should be considered in a child with a discomfort or pain in the hip or knee.

## Other adverse drug reactions

Other adverse drug reactions may be considered somatropin class effects, such as possible hyperglycaemia caused by decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased free thyroxin level and benign intra-cranial hypertension.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms:

Acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia.

Long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human growth hormone excess.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: H01AC01.

Omnitrope is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency https://www.ema.europa.eu

## Mechanism of action

Somatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by mobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition to enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum concentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been demonstrated.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Lipid metabolism

Somatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and lipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in reduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be observed.

## Carbohydrate metabolism

Somatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with hypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin.

## Water and mineral metabolism

Growth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are rapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, potassium and phosphorus.

## Bone metabolism

Somatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and density at weight-bearing sites.

## Physical capacity

Muscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with somatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight per day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were continuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of treatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body weight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous catch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Post-marketing study experience:

An international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open and multicenter, voluntary category 3 PASS designed to record the safety and effectiveness data of 7359 pediatric patients treated with Omnitrope in various indications was conducted by Sandoz between 2006 and 2020 in 11 European countries, in North America, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.

The main pediatric indications were: GHD (57.9%), SGA (26.6%), TS (4.9%), ISS (3.3%), PWS (3.2%) and CRI (1.0%). Most patients were naïve of previous rhGH treatment (86.0%). Across all indications, the most frequent AEs with a suspected causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment in patients were headache (1.6%), injection site pain (1.1%), injection site hematoma (1.1%) and arthralgia (0.6%), assessed in 7359 pediatric patients (SAF). The majority of AEs assessed as related to Omnitrope treatment were expected based on the SmPC and as known for this type of class of molecule (GH). The intensity of most AEs was mild or moderate.

The effectiveness results, assessed in 6589 pediatric patients (EFF consisting of 5671 naïve, 915 rhGH pretreated and 3 patients with missing pre-treatment information), show that Omnitrope treatment was effective and resulted in a substantial catch-up growth which are consistent with those reported in observational studies of other approved rhGH medicines: the median H SDS increased effectively from -2.64 at baseline to -1.97 after 1 year and to -0.98 after 5 years of treatment in naïve patients, and a median H SDS increased from -1.49 to -1.21 after 1 year and to -0.98 after 5 years of Omnitrope treatment in pre-treated patients. 1628/6589 (24.7%) patients of the EFF reached final height according to physician's opinion (naïve: 1289/5671, 22.7%); rhGH pretreated: 338/915, 36.9%). Median (range) final H SDS in naïve patients -1.51 (-9.3 to 2.7) and -1.43 (-8.7 to 2.1) in pre-treated patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients.

A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 72 ± 28 µg/l and 4.0 ± 2.0 hours, respectively.

A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 74 ± 22 µg/l and 3.9 ± 1.2 hours, respectively.

## Elimination

The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone deficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml, Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. The observed difference is likely due to slow absorption from the injection site following subcutaneous administration.

## Special populations

The absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following subcutaneous administration.

Information about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in different races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or incomplete.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant effects have been observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity no clinically relevant effects have been observed.

With somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of chromosome aberrations have been negative.

An increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken from patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the radiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.

In another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the lymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Infants, children and adolescents

- -Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency, GHD).
- -Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome.
- -Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency.
- -Growth disturbance (current height standard deviation score (SDS) &lt; -2.5 and parental adjusted height SDS &lt; -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), with a birth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-up growth (height velocity (HV) SDS &lt; 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later.
- -Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing.

## Adults

- -Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.
- -Adult onset: Patients who have severe growth hormone deficiency associated with multiple hormone deficiencies as a result of known hypothalamic or pituitary pathology, and who have at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin. These patients should

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

undergo an appropriate dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency.

- -Childhood onset: Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients with childhood onset GHD should be re-evaluated for growth hormone secretory capacity after completion of longitudinal growth. In patients with a high likelihood for persistent GHD, i.e. a congenital cause or GHD secondary to a hypothalamic-pituitary disease or insult, an insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS &lt; -2 off growth hormone treatment for at least 4 weeks should be considered sufficient evidence of profound GHD.

All other patients will require IGF-I assay and one growth hormone stimulation test.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders.

## Posology

## Paediatric population

The posology and administration schedule should be individualised.

Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone in paediatric patients Generally a dose of 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7 - 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended. Even higher doses have been used.

Where childhood onset GHD persists into adolescence, treatment should be continued to achieve full somatic development (e.g. body composition, bone mass). For monitoring, the attainment of a normal peak bone mass defined as a T score &gt; -1 (i.e. standardized to average adult peak bone mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry taking into account sex and ethnicity) is one of the therapeutic objectives during the transition period. For guidance on dosing see adult section below.

Prader-Willi syndrome, for improvement of growth and body composition in paediatric patients Generally a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded. Treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses.

## Growth disturbance due to Turner syndrome

A dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2 body surface area per day is recommended.

## Growth disturbance in chronic renal insufficiency

A dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg/kg body weight per day (1.4 mg/m 2 body surface area per day) is recommended. Higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low. A dose correction can be needed after six months of treatment (see section 4.4).

## Growth disturbance in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA)

A dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m 2  body surface area per day) is usually recommended until final height is reached (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below + 1. Treatment should be discontinued if height velocity is &lt; 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is &gt; 14 years (girls) or &gt; 16 years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates.

## Growth hormone deficient adult patients

In patients who continue growth hormone therapy after childhood GHD, the recommended dose to restart is 0.2 - 0.5 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased or decreased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.

In adults with adult-onset GHD, therapy should start with a low dose, 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day. The dose should be gradually increased according to individual patient requirements as determined by the IGF-I concentration.

In both cases treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) concentrations within 2 SDS from the age corrected mean. Patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment should be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal, not exceeding the 2 SDS. Clinical response and side effects may also be used as guidance for dose titration. It is recognized that there are patients with GHD who do not normalize IGF-I levels despite a good clinical response, and thus do not require dose escalation. The maintenance dose rarely exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen replacement are under-treated while men are over-treated. The accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months. As normal physiological growth hormone production decreases with age, dose requirements may be reduced.

## Special populations

## Elderly

In patients above 60 years, therapy should start with a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 mg per day and should be slowly increased according to individual patient requirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose in these patients seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day.

## Method of administration

The injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy.

For instructions for use and handling see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours must be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth.

Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated with somatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2).

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypoadrenalism

Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. In patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin treatment (see section 4.5).

## Use with oral oestrogen therapy

If a woman taking somatropin begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be increased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age-appropriate range. Conversely, if a woman on somatropin discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of somatropin may need to be reduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5).

## Insulin sensitivity

Somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may require adjustment after somatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or additional risk factors for diabetes should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.

## Thyroid function

Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Whereas the peripheral thyroid hormone levels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects, hypothyroidism theoretically may develop in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. Consequently monitoring of thyroid function should therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard replacement therapy, the potential effect of growth hormone treatment on thyroid function must be closely monitored

## Neoplasms

In growth hormone deficiency, secondary to treatment of malignant disease, it is recommended to pay attention to signs of relapse of the malignancy. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumours, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms.

## Slipped capital femoral epiphysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients limping during treatment with somatropin should be examined clinically.

## Benign intracranial hypertension

In case of severe or recurrent headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone treatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary.

## Leukaemia

Leukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficiency patients, some of whom have been treated with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that leukaemia incidence is increased in growth hormone recipients without predisposition factors.

## Antibodies

A small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to Omnitrope. Omnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies is low and there is no effect on growth rate. Testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in any patient with otherwise unexplained lack of response.

## Pancreatitis

Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-treated patients who develop abdominal pain, especially in children.

## Scoliosis

Scoliosis  is  known  to  be  more  frequent  in  some  of  the  patient  groups  treated  with  somatropin.  In addition, rapid growth in any child can cause progression of scoliosis. Somatropin has not been shown to  increase  the  incidence  or  severity  of  scoliosis.  Signs  of  scoliosis  should  be  monitored  during treatment.

## Acute critical illness

The effects of somatropin on recovery were studied in two placebo controlled trials involving 522 critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure. Mortality was higher in patients treated with 5.3 or 8 mg somatropin daily compared to patients receiving placebo, 42% vs. 19%. Based on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin. As there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients, the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved.

In all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with somatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved.

## Elderly patients

Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of Omnitrope, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions.

## Prader-Willi syndrome

In patients with PWS, treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been reports of fatalities associated with the use of growth hormone in paediatric patients with PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity (those patients exceeding a weight/height of 200%), history of respiratory impairment or sleep apnoea or unidentified respiratory infection. Patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk.

Before initiation of treatment with somatropin patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea or respiratory infections should be assessed.

If during the evaluation of upper airway obstruction, pathological findings are observed, the child should be referred to an Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for treatment and resolution of the respiratory disorder prior to initiating growth hormone treatment.

Sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry, and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected.

If during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring), treatment should be interrupted, and a new ENT assessment performed.

All patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected.Patients should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively.

All patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during growth hormone treatment.

Experience with prolonged treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited.

## Small for gestational age

In short children/adolescents born SGA, other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment.

In SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter. In patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus (e.g. familial history of diabetes, obesity, severe insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans) oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) should be performed. If overt diabetes occurs, growth hormone should not be administered.

In SGA children/adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter. If on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed +2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status, the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment.

Experience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited. It is therefore not recommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty. Experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited.

Some of the height gain obtained with treating short children/adolescents born SGA with growth hormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached.

## Chronic renal insufficiency

In chronic renal insufficiency, renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution of therapy. To verify growth disturbance, growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of therapy. During this period, conservative treatment for renal insufficiency (which includes control of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acidosis, hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment.

The treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation.

To date, no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are available.

Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection contains benzyl alcohol: This medicine contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Intravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in neonates ('gasping syndrome'). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.

Advise the parents or legal guardian to not use more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old) without a physician or pharmacist permission.

Advise pregnant or breast feeding patients that large amounts of benzyl alcohol can be build up in their body and may cause sides effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

Advise patients who have a liver or kidney disease that large amounts of benzyl alcohol can be build up in their body and may cause sides effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

## Sodium content

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of Omnitrope. Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth.

Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see section 4.4).

In women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4).

Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and ciclosporin) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown.

Also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Somatropin is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

There have been no clinical studies conducted with somatropin containing products in breast-feeding women. It is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk, but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely. Therefore caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women.

## Fertility

Fertility studies with Omnitrope have not been performed.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Omnitrope has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## a. Summary of the safety profile

Patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit. When treatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected. Adverse reactions related to fluid retention, such as peripheral oedema and arthralgia are very common; musculoskeletal stiffness, myalgia and paraesthesia are common.

In general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate, arise within the first months of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction.

The incidence of these adverse reactions is related to the administered dose, the age of patients, and possibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency.

Omnitrope has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1% of the patients. The binding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with their formation, see section 4.4.

## b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 shows the adverse reactions ranked under headings of System Organ Class and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) for each of the indicated conditions.

administered dose, the age of the patients, and possibly inversely related to the age of the patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency.

**Adverse drug reaction (ADR) identified post-marketing.

$ Transient injection site reactions in children have been reported.

‡ Clinical significance is unknown

† Reported in growth hormone deficient children treated with somatropin, but the incidence appears to be similar to that in children without growth hormone deficiency.

## c. Description of selected adverse reactions

## Reduced serum cortisol levels

Somatropin has been reported to reduce serum cortisol levels, possibly by affecting carrier proteins or by increased hepatic clearance. The clinical relevance of these findings may be limited. Nevertheless, corticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of therapy.

## Prader-Willi syndrome

In the post-marketing experience rare cases of sudden death have been reported in patients affected by Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin, although no causal relationship has been demonstrated.

## Leukaemia

Cases of leukaemia (rare or very rare) have been reported in growth hormone deficient children treated with somatropin and included in the post-marketing experience. However, there is no evidence of an increased risk of leukaemia without predisposition factors, such as radiation to the brain or head.

## Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease have been reported in children treated with GH. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs more frequently in case of endocrine disorders and Legg-Calvé-Perthes is more frequent in case of short stature. But it is unknown if these 2 pathologies are more frequent or not while treated with somatropin. Their diagnosis should be considered in a child with a discomfort or pain in the hip or knee.

## Other adverse drug reactions

Other adverse drug reactions may be considered somatropin class effects, such as possible hyperglycaemia caused by decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased free thyroxin level and benign intra-cranial hypertension.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia.

Long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human growth hormone excess.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: H01AC01.

Omnitrope is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency https://www.ema.europa.eu

## Mechanism of action

Somatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. In children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone, somatropin stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate. In adults as well as in children, somatropin maintains a normal body composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth, and by mobilisation of body fat. Visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin. In addition to enhanced lipolysis, somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores. Serum concentrations of IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I) and IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3) are increased by somatropin. In addition, the following actions have been demonstrated.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Lipid metabolism

Somatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors, and affects the profile of serum lipids and lipoproteins. In general, administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in reduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B. A reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be observed.

## Carbohydrate metabolism

Somatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged. Children with hypopituitarism may experience fasting hypoglycaemia. This condition is reversed by somatropin.

## Water and mineral metabolism

Growth hormone deficiency is associated with decreased plasma and extracellular volumes. Both are rapidly increased after treatment with somatropin. Somatropin induces the retention of sodium, potassium and phosphorus.

## Bone metabolism

Somatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone. Long-term administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients with osteopenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and density at weight-bearing sites.

## Physical capacity

Muscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with somatropin. Somatropin also increases cardiac output, but the mechanism has yet to be clarified. A decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In clinical trials in short children/adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg/kg body weight per day have been used for treatment until final height is reached. In 56 patients who were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

continuously treated and have reached (near) final height, the mean change from height at start of treatment was +1.90 SDS (0.033 mg/kg body weight per day) and +2.19 SDS (0.067 mg/kg body weight per day). Literature data from untreated SGA children/adolescents without early spontaneous catch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS.

## Post-marketing study experience:

An international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open and multicenter, voluntary category 3 PASS designed to record the safety and effectiveness data of 7359 pediatric patients treated with Omnitrope in various indications was conducted by Sandoz between 2006 and 2020 in 11 European countries, in North America, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.

The main pediatric indications were: GHD (57.9%), SGA (26.6%), TS (4.9%), ISS (3.3%), PWS (3.2%) and CRI (1.0%). Most patients were naïve of previous rhGH treatment (86.0%). Across all indications, the most frequent AEs with a suspected causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment in patients were headache (1.6%), injection site pain (1.1%), injection site hematoma (1.1%) and arthralgia (0.6%), assessed in 7359 pediatric patients (SAF). The majority of AEs assessed as related to Omnitrope treatment were expected based on the SmPC and as known for this type of class of molecule (GH). The intensity of most AEs was mild or moderate.

The effectiveness results, assessed in 6589 pediatric patients (EFF consisting of 5671 naïve, 915 rhGH pretreated and 3 patients with missing pre-treatment information), show that Omnitrope treatment was effective and resulted in a substantial catch-up growth which are consistent with those reported in observational studies of other approved rhGH medicines: the median H SDS increased effectively from -2.64 at baseline to -1.97 after 1 year and to -0.98 after 5 years of treatment in naïve patients, and a median H SDS increased from -1.49 to -1.21 after 1 year and to -0.98 after 5 years of Omnitrope treatment in pre-treated patients. 1628/6589 (24.7%) patients of the EFF reached final height according to physician's opinion (naïve: 1289/5671, 22.7%); rhGH pretreated: 338/915, 36.9%). Median (range) final H SDS in naïve patients -1.51 (-9.3 to 2.7) and -1.43 (-8.7 to 2.1) in pre-treated patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80% in both healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients.

A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 72 ± 28 µg/l and 4.0 ± 2.0 hours, respectively.

A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 74 ± 22 µg/l and 3.9 ± 1.2 hours, respectively.

A subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 15 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 52 ± 19 µg/l and 3.7 ± 1.2 hours, respectively.

## Elimination

The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone deficient adults is about 0.4 hours. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml, Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a half-life of 3 hours is achieved. However, after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 15 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, a halflife of 2.76 hours is achieved. The observed difference is likely due to slow absorption from the injection site following subcutaneous administration.

## Special populations

The absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following subcutaneous administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Information about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations, in different races and in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or incomplete.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance, no clinically relevant effects have been observed.

In other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity, local tolerance and reproduction toxicity no clinically relevant effects have been observed.

With somatropins, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of chromosome aberrations have been negative.

An increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken from patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the radiomimetic drug bleomycin. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.

In another study with somatropin, no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the lymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope
3. How to use Omnitrope
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Omnitrope
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for

Omnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure as natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your fat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from human or animal tissue.

## In children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances:

- If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone.
- If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect growth - your doctor will have told you if you have this.
- If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function normally, this can affect growth.
- If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not been able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later.
- If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you grow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your excessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve.

## In adults Omnitrope is used to

- treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life or it can continue from childhood.

If you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your growth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone deficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment.

You should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope

## Do not use Omnitrope

- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of Omnitrope.
- and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope.
- and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already stopped growing (closed epiphyses).
- if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone.

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor before using Omnitrope.

- If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor regularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose.
- If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar level during therapy with somatropin.
- If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with somatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change the dose of your medicines to treat diabetes.
- After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone replacement.
- If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your thyroid hormone dose.
- If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it.
- If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you should inform your doctor.
- If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour (cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer.
- If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor.
- Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects.
- Omnitrope may cause an inflammation of the pancreas, which causes severe pain in the abdomen and back. Contact your doctor if you or your child develops stomach ache after taking Omnitrope.
- An increase in sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may progress in any child during rapid growth. During treatment with somatropin, your doctor will check you (or your child) for signs of scoliosis.

## Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency

- Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting somatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment should be stopped at kidney transplantation.

## Children with Prader-Willi syndrome

- Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight.
- Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your breathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with somatropin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway obstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to examine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin.
- During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity.
- During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the infection.

## Children born small or too light at birth

- If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor for specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine.
- Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing.
- Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and every year during treatment.

## Other medicines and Omnitrope

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

In particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following medicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines:

- medicine to treat diabetes,
- thyroid hormones,
- medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),
- ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation),
- oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,
- synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).

Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

You should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast -feeding. This is because benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'.

Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: This medicine contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 'gasping syndrome') in young children.

Do not give to your newborn baby (up to 4 weeks old), unless recommended by your doctor.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Because of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature babies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.

Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist.

## 3. How to use Omnitrope

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth hormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised dose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body surface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m 2 ), as well as your treatment schedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor.

## The recommended dose is for:

## Children with growth hormone deficiency:

0.025-0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7-1.0 mg/m 2  body surface area per day. Higher doses can be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be continued until completion of physical development.

## Children with Turner syndrome:

0.045-0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2  body surface area per day.

## Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency:

0.045-0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2  body surface area per day. Higher doses may be necessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of treatment.

## Children with Prader-Willi syndrome:

0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should not exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after puberty.

## Children born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance:

0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue treatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are not responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing.

## Adults with growth hormone deficiency:

If you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2-0.5 mg per day. This dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as clinical response and side effects.

If your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15-0.3 mg per day. This dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response and side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should start with a dose of 0.1-0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual requirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Injecting Omnitrope

Inject your growth hormone at about the same time every day. Bedtime is a good time because it is easy to remember. It is also natural to have a higher level of growth hormone at night.

Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml is intended for multiple use. It should only be administered with the Omnitrope Pen 5, an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection.

Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml is intended for multiple use. It should only be administered with the Omnitrope Pen 10, an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 10 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection.

Omnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use. This means that it is injected through a short injection needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin. Most people do their injections into their thigh or their bottom. Do your injection in the place you have been shown by your doctor. Fatty tissue of the skin can shrink at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place for your injection each time. This gives your skin and the area under your skin time to recover from one injection before it gets another one in the same place.

Your doctor should have already shown you how to use Omnitrope. Always inject Omnitrope exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## How to inject Omnitrope

The following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope yourself. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor will show you how to inject Omnitrope. Do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements for the injection.

- -Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin.
- -Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless.
- -Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy (local reduction of fatty tissue under the skin).

## Preparation

Collect necessary items before you begin:

- -a cartridge with Omnitrope solution for injection.
- -the Omnitrope Pen , an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope  solution for injection (not supplied in the pack; see Instructions for Use provided with the Omnitrope Pen).
- -a pen needle for subcutaneous injection (not supplied in the pack).
- -2 cleansing swabs (not supplied in the pack).

Wash your hands before you continue with the next steps.

## Injecting Omnitrope

- -With a cleansing swab, disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge.
- -The contents must be clear and colourless.
- -Insert the cartridge into the pen for injection. Follow the Instructions for Use of the pen injector. To setup the pen dial the dose.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Select the site of injection. The best sites for injection are tissues with a layer of fat between skin and muscle, such as the thigh or belly (except the navel or waistline).
- -Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and that you change the places where you inject, as you have been taught.
- -Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol swab. Wait for the area to dry.
- -Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught you.

## After injecting

- -After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site.
- -Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap, and discard the needle. This will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen.
- -Leave the cartridge in the pen, put the cap on the pen, and store it in the refrigerator.
- -
- The solution should be clear after removal from the refrigerator.

Do not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles.

## If you use more Omnitrope than you should

If you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your blood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or 'not yourself', and you might faint.

## If you forget to use Omnitrope

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone regularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a note of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up.

## If you stop using Omnitrope

Ask for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Formation of antibodies to the injected growth hormone but these do not seem to stop the growth hormone from working.

The skin around the injection area can get uneven or lumpy, but this should not happen if you inject in a different place each time.

There have been rare cases of sudden death in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, no link has been made between these cases and treatment with Omnitrope.

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease may be considered by your doctor if discomfort or pain in the hip or knee is experienced whilst being treated with Omnitrope.

Other possible side effects related to your treatment with growth hormone may include the following:

You (or your child) may experience a high blood sugar or reduced levels of thyroid hormone. This can be tested by your doctor and if necessary your doctor will prescribe the adequate treatment. Rarely, an inflammation of the pancreas has been reported in patients treated with growth hormone.

## Reporting of side effects

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope
3. How to use Omnitrope
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Omnitrope
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Omnitrope is and what it is used for

Omnitrope is a recombinant human growth hormone (also called somatropin). It has the same structure as natural human growth hormone which is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your fat and muscle tissues to develop in the right amounts. It is recombinant meaning it is not made from human or animal tissue.

## In children Omnitrope is used to treat the following growth disturbances:

- If you are not growing properly and you do not have enough of your own growth hormone.
- If you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder in girls that can affect growth - your doctor will have told you if you have this.
- If you have chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency. As kidneys lose their ability to function normally, this can affect growth.
- If you were small or too light at birth. Growth hormone can help you grow taller if you have not been able to catch up or maintain normal growth by 4 years of age or later.
- If you have Prader-Willi syndrome (a chromosomal disorder). Growth hormone will help you grow taller if you are still growing, and will also improve your body composition. Your excessive fat will decrease and your reduced muscle mass will improve.

## In adults Omnitrope is used to

- treat persons with pronounced growth hormone deficiency. This can start during either adult life or it can continue from childhood.

If you have been treated with Omnitrope for growth hormone deficiency during childhood, your growth hormone status will be retested after completion of growth. If severe growth hormone deficiency is confirmed, your doctor will propose continuation of Omnitrope treatment.

You should only be given this medicine by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment and who has confirmed your diagnosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you use Omnitrope

## Do not use Omnitrope

- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of Omnitrope.
- and tell your doctor if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tumours must be inactive and you must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before you start your treatment with Omnitrope.
- and tell your doctor if Omnitrope has been prescribed to stimulate growth but you have already stopped growing (closed epiphyses).
- if you are seriously ill (for example, complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions). If you are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that you use growth hormone.

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor before using Omnitrope.

- If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids, you should consult your doctor regularly, as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose.
- If you are at risk of developing diabetes, your doctor will need to monitor your blood sugar level during therapy with somatropin.
- If you have diabetes, you should closely monitor your blood sugar level during treatment with somatropin and discuss the results with your doctor to determine whether you need to change the dose of your medicines to treat diabetes.
- After starting somatropin treatment some patients may need to start thyroid hormone replacement.
- If you are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones it may become necessary to adjust your thyroid hormone dose.
- If you have raised intracranial pressure (which causes symptoms, such as strong headache, visual disturbances or vomiting) you should inform your doctor about it.
- If you walk with a limp or if you start to limp during your growth hormone treatment, you should inform your doctor.
- If you are receiving somatropin for growth hormone deficiency following a previous tumour (cancer), you should be examined regularly for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer.
- If you experience worsening abdominal pain you should inform your doctor.
- Experience in patients above 80 years is limited. Elderly persons may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop side effects.
- Omnitrope may cause an inflammation of the pancreas, which causes severe pain in the abdomen and back. Contact your doctor if you or your child develops stomach ache after taking Omnitrope.
- An increase in sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may progress in any child during rapid growth. During treatment with somatropin, your doctor will check you (or your child) for signs of scoliosis.

## Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency

- Your doctor should examine your kidney function and your growth rate before starting somatropin. Medical treatment for your kidney should be continued. Somatropin treatment should be stopped at kidney transplantation.

## Children with Prader-Willi syndrome

- Your doctor will give you diet restrictions to follow to control your weight.
- Your doctor will assess you for signs of upper airway obstruction, sleep apnoea (where your breathing is interrupted during sleep), or respiratory infection before you start treatment with somatropin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- During treatment with somatropin, tell your doctor if you show signs of upper airway obstruction (including starting to snore or worsening of snoring), your doctor will need to examine you and may interrupt treatment with somatropin.
- During treatment, your doctor will check you for signs of scoliosis, a type of spinal deformity.
- During treatment, if you develop a lung infection, tell your doctor so that he can treat the infection.

## Children born small or too light at birth

- If you were too small or too light at birth and are aged between 9 and 12 years, ask your doctor for specific advice relating to puberty and treatment with this medicine.
- Treatment should be continued until you have stopped growing.
- Your doctor will check your blood sugar and insulin levels before the start of treatment and every year during treatment.

## Other medicines and Omnitrope

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

In particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following medicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Omnitrope or of the other medicines:

- medicine to treat diabetes,
- thyroid hormones,
- medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants),
- ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune system after transplantation),
- oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones,
- synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids).

Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of somatropin.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

You should not use Omnitrope if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast -feeding. This is because benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium- free'.

Omnitrope 5 mg/1.5 ml solution for injection: This medicine contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol in each ml. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called 'gasping syndrome') in young children.

Do not give to your newborn baby (up to 4 weeks old), unless recommended by your doctor.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called 'metabolic acidosis').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Because of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature babies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old.

Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist.

## 3. How to use Omnitrope

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The dose depends on your size, the condition for which you are being treated and how well growth hormone works for you. Everyone is different. Your doctor will advise you about your individualised dose of Omnitrope in milligrams (mg) from either your body weight in kilograms (kg) or your body surface area calculated from your height and weight in square metres (m 2 ), as well as your treatment schedule. Do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor.

## The recommended dose is for:

## Children with growth hormone deficiency:

0.025-0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 0.7-1.0 mg/m 2  body surface area per day. Higher doses can be used. When growth hormone deficiency continues into adolescence, Omnitrope should be continued until completion of physical development.

## Children with Turner syndrome:

0.045-0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2  body surface area per day.

## Children with chronic renal (kidney) insufficiency:

0.045-0.050 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg/m 2  body surface area per day. Higher doses may be necessary if the rate of growth is too low. Dosage adjustment may be necessary after 6 months of treatment.

## Children with Prader-Willi syndrome:

0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day. The daily dosage should not exceed 2.7 mg. Treatment should not be used in children who have almost stopped growing after puberty.

## Children born smaller or lighter than expected and with growth disturbance:

0.035 mg/kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg/m 2 body surface area per day. It is important to continue treatment until final height is reached. Treatment should be discontinued after the first year if you are not responding or if you have reached your final height and stopped growing.

## Adults with growth hormone deficiency:

If you continue Omnitrope after treatment during childhood you should start with 0.2-0.5 mg per day. This dosage should be gradually increased or decreased according to blood test results as well as clinical response and side effects.

If your growth hormone deficiency starts during adult life you should start with 0.15-0.3 mg per day. This dosage should be gradually increased according to blood test results as well as clinical response and side effects. The daily maintenance dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg per day. Women may require higher doses than men. Dosage should be monitored every 6 months. Persons above 60 years should start with a dose of 0.1-0.2 mg per day which should be slowly increased according to individual requirements. The minimum effective dose should be used. The maintenance dose seldom exceeds 0.5 mg per day. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and that you change the places where you inject, as you have been taught.
- -Before you make an injection, clean your skin well with an alcohol swab. Wait for the area to dry.
- -Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught you.

## After injecting

- -After injection, press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site.
- -Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap, and discard the needle. This will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen.
- -Leave the cartridge in the pen, put the cap on the pen, and store it in the refrigerator.
- -The solution should be clear after removal from the refrigerator.

Do not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles.

## If you use more Omnitrope than you should

If you inject much more than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Your blood sugar level could fall too low and later rise too high. You might feel shaky, sweaty, sleepy or 'not yourself', and you might faint.

## If you forget to use Omnitrope

Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. It is best to use your growth hormone regularly. If you forget to use a dose, have your next injection at the usual time the next day. Keep a note of any missed injections and tell your doctor at your next check-up.

## If you stop using Omnitrope

Ask for advice from your doctor before you stop using Omnitrope.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.
