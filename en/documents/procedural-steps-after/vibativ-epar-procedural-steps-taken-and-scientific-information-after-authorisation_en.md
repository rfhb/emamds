Exposure to telavancin increases with increase in BMI; for each 10-unit increase in BMI, it is estimated that plasma exposure will increase by up to 25%. Obese patients (defined as those with BMI >30 kg/m2) should receive telavancin at the reduced dose of 7.5 mg/kg once every 24 hours. |

| II/0002     | To update the SmPC section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) and 4.8 ( Undesirable effects) with hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. The Package Leaflet (PL) was proposed to be updated in accordance. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                                                                                                                                       | 19/04/2012 | 08/02/2013 | SmPC and PL | Astellas The current approved SmPC of Vibativ already lists a number of manifestations of allergic type and infusion reactions that are highly likely to represent drug related reactions, including red man syndrome like reactions, including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus or rash. However, there is biologic plausibility for anaphylaxis and cross reactivity to vancomycin to occur after exposure to telavancin. Based on the cumulative review of the cases related to hypersensitivity reaction (inclusive anaphylaxis) and the literature review on anaphylaxis with other antibacterial agents, including glycopeptides, it is agreed to add 'hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis' to the SmPC. The PL is updated accordingly. The benefit-risk balance of Vibativ mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion remains unchanged. longer authorised |
