## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on Venous Thromboembolism from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) and Venous Thromboembolism is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (Vaxzevria) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
