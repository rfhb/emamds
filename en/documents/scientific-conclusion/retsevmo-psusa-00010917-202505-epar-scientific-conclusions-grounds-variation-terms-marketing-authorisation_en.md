## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for selpercatinib, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) from the literature, including a close temporal relationship in 1 case from literature, and a diagnosis based on clinical picture together with histopathological findings, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between selpercatinib and Stevens-Johnson syndrome is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing selpercatinib should be amended accordingly

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for selpercatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing selpercatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
