## Title:

'A Multi-center, Open-label, Randomized Study to Evaluate the Long Term Effectiveness of Levetiracetam as Monotherapy in Comparison with Oxcarbazepine in Subjects With Newly or Recently Diagnosed Partial Epilepsy'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy on treatmentfailurerateinsubjectswithnewlydiagnosedpartial onsetseizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures, compared with oxcarbazepine (OXC) monotherapy, over 50 weeks from the first dose of study medication and to demonstrate that monotherapy with LEV (1000 to 3000mg/day) was noninferior to monotherapy with OXC (900 to2400mg/day).

Thesecondaryobjectiveswere:

- To evaluate the efficacy of LEVmonotherapy on timetofirst seizureinsubjectswithnewly diagnosed partial onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures compared with OXCmonotherapy
- To evaluate the efficacy of LEVmonotherapy on 24-weekseizurefreedom ratefor 24consecutiveweeksduringtheTreatmentPeriodatanytimeand48-weekseizurefreedom rateduringtheTreatmentPeriod
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEV monotherapy in subjects with newly diagnosed partial onsetseizureswith orwithoutsecondarilygeneralized seizurescomparedwith OXC monotherapy

## Study design

Methodology: After the1-weekScreeningPeriod, subjectswererandomized to the LEV or OXC treatmentgroup in a 1:1 ratio.During theTreatment Period, if the seizureswere not controlled, the dose of LEVwastitrated upto3000mg/day and the dose of OXC was titrated up to 2400mg/day at the investigator's discretion based on the subject's response of seizure control and tolerability.

If an intolerable adverse event (AE) related to study medication occurred, after up-titration to the first dose level (LEV 1000mg/day or OXC 900mg/day), a single step dose down-titration (limited to1 time)waspermitted.This casewas evaluated as a treatment failure,but the subjects were not discontinued from the study if the subjects? seizures were well controlled with the down-titrateddose.

IfsubjectsdiscontinuedthestudyduringtheTreatmentPeriod,anEarlyDiscontinuationVisit occurred.Subjectswho discontinued prematurely,or completed the study and chosenot to continuereceivingcommercial LEVor OXC,weregradually tapered off studymedication (Down-titration Period). A faster or slower taper was permitted if medically necessary. The followingweretherecommendationsfordown-titration:

- LEV: Decreased by 1000mg/day every 2 weeks from thelast dose the subject was on, down tozero
- OXC: Decreased by 600mg/day weekly from the last dose the subject was on, down to zero

Subjects who chose not to continue receiving commercial LEV or OXC after study termination should have returned for aSafety Follow-up(SFU) Visit approximately 2 weeks after their last administration ofstudymedication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects who chose to continue receiving commercial LEV or OXC after the completion of this study were not required to taper study medication or return for an SFU Visit.

## Study population /Sample size

Number ofsubjects (planned and analyzed):It wasplanned that 352subjects would be enrolledinthestudy andrandomized in a 1:1 ratiotoLEVorOXC.A totalof353subjectswere randomized in N01367, 175 subjects to the LEV treatment group and 178 subjects to the OXCtreatmentgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment

Oral tablets of LEV (250mg and 500mg), as the test product and oral tablets of OXC (150mg and 300mg), as the reference product were used in this study.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy: The primary efficacy variable was the treatment failure rate, defined as the percentage ofsubjectswhodroppedoutduetotreatmentfailure atthemaximumtolerateddose(MTD),after 50weeks from the first dose of studymedication.

Treatmentfailurewasdefined asmeeting atleast1ofthefollowingtreatmentfailurecriteria:

- Lackofefficacy;theoccurrenceofaseizure at theMTD
- NeedfortheadditionofanotherAED
- TheoccurrenceofanintolerableAErelated tostudymedication

The secondary efficacy variables were:

- Timetothefirstseizure,defined asthetimefromthefirstdoseofmedicationtothe occurrenceofthefirstseizureduringtheTreatmentPeriod
- 24-week seizure freedom (rate), defined as the number and percentage of subjects who achieved seizurefreedomfor 24consecutiveweeks atanytime duringtheTreatmentPeriod
- 48-week seizure freedom (rate), defined as the number and percentage of subjects who achievedseizurefreedomduringtheTreatmentPeriod

The exploratory variableswere:

- Change of theQOLIE-31-PscorefromBaseline through the end of theTreatmentPeriod
- ChangeoftheESSscorefromBaselinethroughtheendoftheTreatmentPeriod

Safety:The safetyvariableswere:

- Numberandpercentageofsubjectswithtreatment-emergentadverseevents(TEAEs),severe TEAEs,drug-relatedTEAEs,andseriousTEAEsreportedduringthewholestudyperiod
- TimefromrandomizationtodrugdiscontinuationduetoAEs
- Discontinuation(rate)duetoanAE:thenumber andpercentageofsubjectswhodroppedout duetoAEsafter thefirst doseofstudymedication

## Statistical Methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Statistical methods:In general, summaries were presented by treatment group (LEV,OXC) and for all subjects (ie, across both treatment groups), where applicable. For categorical parameters, thenumberandpercentageofsubjectsineachcategorywerepresented.Forcontinuous parameters, descriptive statistics included number of subjects,mean, standard deviation,median, minimum,andmaximum.

Asthefirstdoseofstudymedicationwastakenafterrandomizationandrandomizationoccurred afterthe assessmentsatVisit 2,dataobtainedatthisvisitwereusedasBaselinedata.Incaseof missingdataatVisit2,thelastdatacollectedbeforeadministrationofthefirstdoseofstudy medicationwereused.

PresentationoftheprimaryefficacydatawasbasedonthePerProtocolSet(PPs).Presentation ofsecondaryefficacydatawasbasedontheFullAnalysisSet(FAS).Presentationofdisposition datawasbased on the Enrolled Set and the Randomized Set.Demographics and other baseline characteristicswerepresented for the SafetySet(SS).Safety and exposure data were presented for the Ss. For the sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the FAs, the secondary efficacy analyses were repeated for the subjects who completed the study, and the safety analyseswererepeatedfor the subjectswho completed thestudy.

The primary analysis of this study aimed to demonstrate that LEV was noninferior to OXC with respect to the treatment failure rate in thePPs.Thenoninferiority margin was 15%. The null hypothesis:

```
Ho: PLev > Poxc + 0.15
```

wasstatisticallytestedagainstthealternativehypothesis:

```
H: PLev ≤poxc + 0.15
```

where pLev denoted the treatment failure rate in the LEV group and poxc denoted the treatment failure rate in the OXC group.

If LEVwasdemonstrated tobenoninferior to OXCin thePPS,an exploratory analysiswastobe

The null hypothesis:

Ho: pLEv ≥Poxc wasstatisticallytested againstthe alternativehypothesis:

```
H: pLEv <poxc
```

Theprimary analysis wasrepeatedfor theFAS and thePerProtocol Set 2(PPS2;ie,subjects in theFASwithout anyimportantprotocol deviationsthatmayhaveinfluenced thevalidityof the data,including subjectswho discontinued the studybeforeWeek50for anyreason other than treatment failure).

Time to treatment failure was analyzed using log-rank methodology.

## Results

## Subject disposition

Overall, a total of 353 subjects were randomized in N01367 (175 subjects to LEV and 178 subjects to OXC) and 243 subjects (68.8%) completed the study. Of the 110 subjects (31.2%) who discontinued from the study, the most common reasons for discontinuation were consent withdrawn (40 subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[11.3%]) and AEs (31 subjects [8.8%]). Subjects in each treatment group discontinued from the study at a similar incidence; however, slightly higher percentages of subjects in the OXC group discontinued due to consent withdrawn and AEs compared with the LEV group (14.0% and 11.2% vs 8.6% and 6.3%, respectively).

## Paediatric subjects

A total of 14 subjects were &lt;18 years old at study entry (8 subjects were 17 years old; 6 were 16 years old). Eight of these subjects were female; 6 were male. Eight subjects were randomized to LEV and 6 to OXC.

In the LEV group, 2 subjects discontinued due to withdrawal of consent, 1 subject discontinued due to a protocol violation, and 1 subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy; the other 4 subjects who received LEV completed the study. In the OXC group, 1 subject discontinued due to withdrawal of consent, 1 subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and 1 subject discontinued due to AE; the other 3 subjects in the OXC group completed the study.

## Efficacy results

## Theefficacyresultsaresummarized asfollows:

- For the PPS, 15 subjects (12.7%) in the LEV group were considered treatment failures compared with 30 subjects (23.4%) in the OXC group. The absolute difference in the treatment failureratesof LEVvs OXCwas -10.7%(95%confidenceinterval [CI]: -20.2%, -1.2%). The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI (-1.2%) did not exceed the selectednoninferioritymargin of+15%for absolute treatmentfailureratedifferencevs OXC,indicatingthattreatmentwithLEVwasnoninferiortotreatmentwith OXCinthis study. Since LEV was demonstrated to be noninferior to OXC in the PPS, an exploratory analysiswasperformedtodeterminewhetherLEVwassuperiortoOXCinthePPS.Because theupperlimitof the2-sided95%CI(-1.2%)fortheabsolutedifferenceintreatmentfailure ratesofLEVvsOXCwaslessthanzero,itmaybeconcluded thatLEVwassuperiortoOXC for treatment failure rate in thePPs.Similar supportive results were observed for thePPs2.
- Analysisof theFASalsoshowed thatLEVwasnoninferiortoOXC,butdidnotshow superiority of LEV over OXC as the upper limit was greater than zero (absolute difference in treatment failure rates of LEV vs OXC: -7.1% [95% CI: -14.6%, 0.3%]).
- For the analysisoftimetotreatmentfailureintheFAS,thehazardratioof LEVvsOXCwas 0.6 (95% C1: 0.3, 1.0), indicating a 40% reduction in hazard of treatment failure for subjects in the LEV group compared with subjects in the OXC group (log-rank test p-value=0.0658).

- FortheanalysisoftimetofirstseizureduringtheTreatmentPeriodin theFAS,thehazard ratio of LEV vs OXC was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9,1.7: 1og-rank p-value=0.1643). For subjects in the LEV group, the median time to first seizure was 7.556 months; for subjects in the OXC group, the median time to first seizure was not estimable since &lt;50% of the subjects hadaseizure.
- Similar percentages of subjects in the LEV and OXC groups were 24-weeks seizure free during the study (53.8% and 58.5%,respectively). A slightly lower percentage of subjects in the LEV group (34.7%) was 48-weeks seizure free during the study, compared with subjects in the OXC group (40.9%). The absolute difference between the LEV vs OXC treatment groups for 24-weeks seizure freedom was -4.7% (95% CI: -15.2%, 5.8%; 2-proportion Z-test p=0.3775) and for 48-weeks seizure freedom rate was -6.3% (95% CI: -16.5%, 4.0%; 2-proportionZ-testp=0.2317).
- Subjects in the LEV and OXC treatment groups had moderate improvements in the QOLIE-31-P subscales of energy, mood, daily activities, cognition, and overall quality of life:large improvementwas observedforbothgroupsin thesubscaleofseizureworry.The differences in the mean change fromBaselinefor the LEV group vs the OXC groupwere small for the subscales of energy, mood, daily activities, cognition, seizure worry, and overall quality of life. Subjects in the LEV group showed slightly greater improvements from Baseline vs subjects in the OXC group for the subscales of energy (Visit 9 and Last Visit), mood (Visit 9),and cognition (Visit 9 and Last Visit). Of note, change fromBaseline for the total score could only be calculated for a few subjects due to the fact that only newly diagnosed subjectswere included in the study.

## Safety results

Thesafetyresultsare summarized asfollows:

- The mean durations of exposure to study medication were similar between the LEV and OXC treatment groups (279.19 and 273.21 days, respectively). The mean daily dose of LEV and OXC overall was 1170.23 and 996.91mg/day, respectively.
- During the study, a total of 344 TEAEs were reported by 117 subjects (67.6%) in the LEV group, and a total of 407 TEAEs were reported by 130 subjects (74.7%) in the OXC group. The incidence of serious TEAEs and severe TEAEs was similar between the LEVand OXCtreatmentgroups.DiscontinuationsduetoTEAEs.TEAEsrequiringdose

- Treatment-emergent AEs were most commonly reported in the system organ class(SOC) of Nervous system disorders by subjects in the LEV and OXC treatment groups. By preferred term (PT), the most common TEAEs in the LEV and OXC treatment groups were dizziness, headache, and somnolence. The incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups withtheexception of dizziness,headache,andrash,whichwerereportedwithlower incidence by subjects in the LEV group compared with subjects in the OXC group.
- ThemajorityofTEAEsweremildormoderateinintensityandwerereportedatasimilar incidence in the LEV and OXC treatment groups. During the study, 6 subjects (3.5%) in the LEV group reported a total of 7 severe TEAEs, and 8 subjects (4.6%) in the OXC group reported a total of 13 severeTEAEs.All of the severeTEAEswerereported by only 1 subject in either treatment group, with the exceptions of cardiac arrest and headache that were each reported by 2 subjects, both in the OXC treatment group.
- Fifty-three subjects (30.6%) in the LEV group and 67 subjects (38.5%) in the OXC group reported ADRs during the study. Treatment-emergent ADRs were most frequently reported in the SOC of Nervous system disorders by subjects in the LEV and OXC treatment groups. AdversediugreactionswerereportedatasimilarincidenceintheotherSOCsfortheLEV and OXC treatment groups with the exceptions of Psychiatric disorders (6.9% and 1.1%, respectively) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2.9% and 9.2%, respectively). By PT, the ADRs most commonly reported by subjects in the LEV and OXC treatment groups were dizziness and somnolence. The incidence of ADRs by PT was similar between the LEV and OXC treatmentgroupswith the exceptionsof dizziness andrash thatwerelower in the LEV group compared with the OXC group.

## Paediatric subjects

Eight of the 14 subjects &lt;18 years old (4 subjects in the OXC group and 4 subjects in the LEV group) had TEAEs. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, not related to study medication, and resolved.

There were no deaths or SAEs in subjects aged &lt;18 years. One subject (Subject 010-03452) in the OXC group discontinued due to an AE of rash; no subjects in the LEV group discontinued due to an AE. A full narrative for this subject is provided in Section 12 of the N01367 CSR.

## Conclusion

- LEV monotherapy treatment at doses from 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day was noninferior to OXC monotherapy at doses from 900mg/day to 2400mg/day with respect to long-term effectiveness in Korean subjects aged ≥ 16 years recently diagnosed with partial onset seizures.
- The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns were identified in this study.

## 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

Results from N01367 show that LEV monotherapy treatment at doses from 1000mg/day to 3000mg/day was noninferior to OXC monotherapy at doses from 900mg/day to 2400mg/day with respect to long-term effectiveness in Korean subjects aged ≥ 16 years recently diagnosed with partial onset seizures.

The evaluation of the safety data demonstrated that LEV was well tolerated. No new safety concerns were identified in this study.
