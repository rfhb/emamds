## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Ketoconazole  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme.  Pharmacokinetics  of  medicines  that  are substrates of CYP3A4 can be affected when administered concomitantly with ketoconazole, potentially leading to clinically significant serious ADRs and/or the need for dose adjustment of these medicinal products. The PRAC considers that, in view of the available data the interaction of ketoconazole with crizotinib,  ibrutinib  and  the  direct-acting  antiviral  (DAAV)  combination  of  ombitasvir-paritaprevirritonavir  should  be  added  to  the  product  information.  A  contraindication  with  the  direct-acting antiviral  (DAAV)  combination  of  ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir  should  also  be  included  in  the product information.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing ketoconazole were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
