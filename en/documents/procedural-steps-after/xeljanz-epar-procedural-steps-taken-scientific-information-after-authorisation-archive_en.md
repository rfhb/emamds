| A20/0048            | Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the European Commission requested on 28 January 2022 the opinion of the European Medicines Agency further to the safety issues on MACE, VTE, serious infections, malignancy and mortality for all JAK inhibitors used in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. The CHMP was requested to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Cibinqo, Jyseleca, Olumiant, Rinvoq and Xeljanz and to give its recommendation whether the marketing authorisation of this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. As the request results from the evaluation of data resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the CHMP opinion was adopted on the basis of a recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk | 23/01/2023   | 10/03/2023   | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Please refer to the assessment report: Xeljanz (tofacitinib) EMEA/H-A20/1517/C/004214/0048 |

This is based on the final results from study A3921133 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a post-authorisation safety study conducted to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib 5mg and 10 mg compared to TNFi in adults' subjects aged ≥50 years with moderately or severely active RA and with at least 1 additional CV risk factor. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 21.1 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the Outer carton (section 4 for oral solution) to include a total volume of 240 mL as requested following the completion of the procedure EMEA/H/C/004214/X/0024/G.

Tofacitinib should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for fractures such as elderly patients, female patients and patients with corticosteroid use, regardless of indication and dosage. Section 4.8 Viral reactivation In a large (N=4,362) randomised post-authorisation safety study in patients with RA who were 50 years or older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, an increase in herpes zoster events was observed in patients treated with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. The incidence rates (95% CI) for herpes zoster for tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors were 3.75 (3.22, 4.34), 3.94 (3.38, 4.57), and 1.18 (0.90, 1.52) patients with events per 100 patient- years, respectively. Laboratory tests […]ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3x ULN were observed in 6.01%, 6.54% and 3.77% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors respectively. AST elevations greater than or equal to 3x ULN were observed in 3.21%, 4.57% and 2.38% of patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitors respectively. […]changes in lipid parameters from baseline through 24 months are summarised below: • Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 13.80%, 17.04%, and 5.50% in patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, and TNF inhibitor,   |

| II/0046 | Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC in order to update safety information on reproductive and developmental toxicity based on final study results from An Oral (Gavage) Juvenile Toxicity Study of CP- 690,550 in Sprague Dawley Rats (MEA 022) listed as a cat 3 study in the RMP. The RMP version 26.1 has also been updated. In addition, MAH is also taking this opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

Tofacitinib had no effects on male fertility, sperm motility or sperm concentration. Tofacitinib was secreted in milk of lactating rats at concentrations approximately 2-fold those in serum from 1 to 8 hours postdose. In studies conducted in juvenile rats and monkeys, there were no tofacitinib-related effects on bone development in males or females, at exposures similar to those achieved at approved doses in humans. |

The MAH reopened the signal 'all-cause mortality' after completion of the clinical study A3921133. However, based on the information provided (a short summary of MAH's assessment of their reopened signal) no final conclusions can be drawn by the PRAC on the signal of all-cause mortality as not all data of the completed study have been provided. The PRAC does not support the MAH's conclusion that the signal of all-cause mortality can be refuted. The final study report was expected to be submitted for assessment in August 2021, however the MAH did not submit this yet and therefore has classified the A3921133 study as on-going for the purposes of this renewal. Complete data on the final study results are necessary for proper assessment. With submission of the final study report, KM curves for all-cause mortality, CV death and death associated with infections should be also provided. Further, a tabulated list of individual causes of death (e.g. CV mortality should be further specified) should be also provided as well as assessment of possible risk factors for death. The final study report of study A3921133 is awaited and once available, the results will then be further assessed. No further action within the scope of the renewal is required.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority   | cardiovascular risk factor, a dose dependent increased risk for VTE was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. In the post hoc exploratory analysis within this study, in patients with known VTE risk factors, occurrences of subsequent VTEs were observed more frequently in tofacitinib-treated patients that, at 12 months treatment, had D-dimer level ≥2× ULN versus those with D-dimer level <2× ULN; this was not evident in TNF inhibitor treated patients. Interpretation is limited by the low number of VTE events and restricted D dimer test availability (only assessed at Baseline, Month 12, and at the end of the study). In patients who did not have a VTE during the study, mean D-dimer levels were significantly reduced at Month 12 relative to Baseline across all treatment arms. However, D-dimer levels ≥2× ULN at Month 12 were observed in approximately 30% of patients without subsequent VTE events, indicating limited specificity of D Dimer testing in this study. Therefore, for patients with RA with known risk factors for VTE, it is recommended to consider testing D-dimer levels after approximately 12 months of treatment. If D-dimer test result is ≥ 2× ULN and confirm that clinical benefits outweigh risks prior to a decision on treatment continuation with tofacitinib. Information on VTE in the Guide for Healthcare professional, and prescriber treatment maintenance checklist have also been updated in addition to the prescribing information to include information regarding testing D-dimer levels after approximately 12 months of treatment in patients with RA with known risk factors for VTE. This is reflected in annex IID of the product   |

As expected, tofacitinib 10 mg BID (\"bis in die\" twice a day) dose showed worse safety profile than to the 5 mg BID dose. Mortality rate was low and no death event was judged by the investigator to be associated with tofacitinib. Tofacitinib's safety profile in PsA subjects was consistent with that of RA subjects, with slightly lower rates in the PsA dataset possibly related to shorter tofacitinib exposure in this setting. Overall, no new safety signals were observed. Tofacitinib's safety profile is adequately reflected and risks can be mitigated or managed as described in the SmPC and RMP. Data support long term 5 mg BID tofacitinib use for PsA treatment in adult subjects and are appropriately reflected in the current version of the SmPC.   |

| A20/0017   | Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the European Commission requested on 15 May 2019 the opinion of the European Medicines Agency further to a potential increased risk of pulmonary embolism and overall mortality associated with the use of Xeljanz. The CHMP was requested to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Xeljanz and to give its recommendation whether the marketing authorisation of this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. As the request results from the evaluation of data resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the CHMP opinion should be adopted on the basis of a recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee.   | 14/11/2019   | 31/01/2020   | SmPC, Annex II and PL            | Please refer to the assessment report: Xeljanz - EMEA/H/A-20/1485/C/4214/0017   |
