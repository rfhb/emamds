## 1. RECOMMENDATION

The CHMP endorsed the MAH's conclusions. No further action was required.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic consisting of the S-enantiomer of α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide. The tablet formulation of the drug has been approved in Europe since 2000 and has since then been joined by oral solution, injection, and extended release (XR) tablet formulations.

Approved indications in the EU consist of:

Monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Adjunctive therapy in:

- treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalization  in  adults, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy, except for the IV formulation which is limited to patients from 4 years of age and older.
- treatment  of  myoclonic  seizures  in  adults  and  adolescents  from  12  years  of  age  with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.
- treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy.

Prior  to  US  FDA  approval  of  Keppra  injection,  UCB  committed  to  conduct  a  post-approval  study  to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of the IV formulation of LEV in children aged 1  month  to  &lt;4  years  and  in  children  aged  4  to  16  years.  The  study  discussed  here  concerns  the former.

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

This trial was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of the LEV IV 15-minute infusion in children (1 month to &lt;4 years old) with epilepsy (except status epilepticus).

Subjects  were  hospitalized  and  had  received  LEV  oral  solution  at  a  stable,  twice-daily  (bid)  dose regimen for at least 5 days prior to the first LEV IV infusion and had presented with medical conditions that required temporary IV administration of LEV, or required LEV IV treatment for a short period of time prior to considering continuing AED treatment with LEV oral solution. A screening period of 1 to 7 days was used during which the subject's eligibility was confirmed.

The planned evaluation period for a subject consisted of a minimum of 1 complete set of PK sampling over a maximum of 4 days while the subject was inpatient and receiving a LEV IV 15-minute infusion every 12 hours. The first IV infusion was to be administered 12 hours after the final oral dose of LEV.

IV dosing, equivalent to oral dosing or calculated on age and weight, was as follows:

- ≥1 month to &lt;6 months age: 7mg/kg bid to 21mg/kg bid
- ≥6 months to &lt;4 years: 10mg/kg bid to 30mg/kg bid

The LEV IV dose had to be stable during the PK sampling period no wash out period was foreseen, and when necessary for the safety of the subject or when the investigator deemed it appropriate, the LEV IV  dose  could  be  modified  once  the  PK  samples  were  taken.  In  case  an  infant  was  preterm,  the corrected gestational age had to be used when calculating the dose.

Plasma samples were taken for LEV determination on Day 1 (optionally on Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4) at the following time points around the morning infusion:

- 3 to 10 minutes after the start of infusion
- 15 minutes (at the end of the LEV IV infusion)
- Between 40 and 60 minutes post infusion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Between 5 and 8 hours post infusion

A Final Visit was scheduled between 1 and 2 weeks following the final LEV IV infusion.

A schematic representation of the schedule is given below:

a  End of Treatment exams were performed in the morning of the last infusion day.

b  When deemed necessary, Screening, Baseline (Day 0), and first IV infusion (Day 1) may have occurred on the same day. All Screening procedures and results of examinations must have been available to allow verification of subject's eligibility.

c D4 stands for Day 4 or last infusion day.

d  Inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed at Screening and re-assessed at Baseline to ensure that subjects met the required criteria before starting any LEV IV infusion.

e  Vital signs included measurements of blood pressure and heart rate.

f  Height was measured only at Screening.

g  Results of the 12-lead ECG and the blood laboratory tests performed at Screening should have been available at Baseline to confirm that the subject met all required criteria before starting any LEV IV infusion.

h  The ECG should have been performed on the day of the first infusion (Day 0 or Day 1 as applicable), prior to any procedure needed to set the infusion. If the ECG at Screening was performed less than 2 days prior to the first infusion and was normal, the ECG at Day 0 or Day1 should not be repeated.

i  Safety blood laboratory tests included hematology and biochemistry.

j  For subjects who need to start LEV IV infusion in the afternoon/evening of Day 0, collection of blood samples for PK assessments started the following morning with the second IV infusion (Day 1). The following blood samples for PK assessments were optional: those taken on Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4, with the following morning IV infusion.

k  Subjects should have been hospitalized for the duration of the LEV IV treatment. Admission to the hospital should have taken place at least the day prior to the start of the first LEV IV infusion. However, when necessary for the wellbeing of the subject or when investigator deemed it appropriate, the hospitalization could have started on the same day as the first IV infusion. Discharge occurred as soon as the investigator deemed it appropriate (ie, the subject is in good medical condition).

l First LEV IV infusion preferably should have taken place in the morning. If needed, LEV IV infusions could have been started the afternoon of Day 0.

In  total  6  protocol  amendments  were  made  of  which  the  most  important  resulting  changes  were exclusion of subjects being treated with Vigabatrin in Germany, revision of the age categories to have more balanced age groups and the requirement that at least one third of the subjects should be in the high-dose range

## 4. OBJECTIVES

## Primary

Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the LEV IV 15-minute infusion administered every 12 hours, either  as  adjunctive  treatment  or  monotherapy  in  children  (1  month  to  &lt;4  years  old)  with  epilepsy (except status epilepticus), either after switching from the equivalent LEV oral dose administration or as a new antiepileptic treatment.

## Secondary

Assessment  of  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  the  LEV  IV  15-minute  infusion  administered  every  12 hours in children with epilepsy in the age range of 1 month to &lt;4 years.

## 6. POPULATION

As per the FDA request it was planned to include 18 subjects in the trial whom had to complete the PK assessments. They should have 4 post-dose PK samples over 1 infusion day available or alternatively at  least  5  PK  samples  in  case  of  LEV  IV  treatment  lasted  more  than  1  day.  The  approximate distribution throughout the age brackets was planned as follows:

- -6 subjects: ≥1 month to &lt;6 months
- -6 subjects: ≥6 months to &lt;2 years
- -6 subjects: ≥2 years to &lt;4 years

One half of the subjects were to be exposed to at least 3 consecutive IV doses and at least one third of the subjects had to receive a high-dose range (≥28mg/kg/day for subjects ≥1 month to &lt;6 months and ≥40mg/kg/day for subjects ≥6 month to &lt;4 years).

## 7. STATISTICAL METHODS

Categorical  data  were  summarized  using  frequency  tables, while  descriptive  statistics  were  used  for continuous data. Plasma concentrations were described by way of calculation of both geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation.

With  regards  to  safety  analysis  the  adverse  events,  physical  abnormalities,  the  indication  of  the medications, medical history, and medical procedures were coded according to the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Unresolved

## 8. POPULATION RESULTS

In total 19 persons out of 23 volunteers were enrolled in the study. 6 in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group, 6 in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group, and 7 in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. Of these 19, sixteen completed the study. All subjects who completed the study received study drug according to the protocol

ITT=intent-to-treat; PK=pharmacokinetic a All subjects received at least 1 IV infusion.

Overall, 17 subjects (90%) had at least 1 important protocol deviation: 5 (83%) in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months years group, 5 (83%) in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group and 7 (100%) in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. The most frequent important protocol deviation was procedure noncompliance (16 subjects, 94% overall). Within this category, the most frequent deviations were deviation in timing of vital signs (12 subjects overall) and deviation in timing of PK sampling (6 subjects overall). None of these important deviations had an impact on the safety or PK results however.

Study population demographic breakdown is given in table 3. Differences among age groups in weight, height, and BMI were noted, but were also expected.

## 9. SAFETY RESULTS

## ITT population analysis

During the trial 6 subjects (32%) received high-dose LEV IV: 1 subject (17%) in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group, 3 subjects (50%) in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group and 2 subjects (29%) in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. In general, the number of IV doses received ranged from 1 to 6, and the duration of exposure ranged from 1 to 4 days. Twelve subjects received 3 or more consecutive doses of LEV IV.

There  was  only  one  case  of  a  pretreatment  AE  in  the  whole  ITT  population,  which  concerned  a moderate, non-serious case of candidemia.

Table 4 below gives an overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events.

As can be seen, a higher percentage of subjects in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group had drug-related TEAEs, but no severe TEAEs occurred in this group.

There was one SAE which was considered drug related and this occurred in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. Three deaths were reported: 2 subjects in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group and 1 subject in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. The onset of these events in 2 of the subjects occurred within 30 days of the final IV infusion, and none of the 3 subjects were taking study drug at the time of death.

In total of 33 TEAEs were reported for 12 subjects (63%). Treatment-emergent adverse events were most frequently of the general disorders and administration site conditions (5 subjects;  26%) SOC, followed by cardiac disorders and nervous system disorders (each 4 subjects; 21%).

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  was  pyrexia  (3  subjects;  16%),  followed  by  bradycardia, pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension (each 2 subjects; 11%). One TEAE was related to the IV infusion site (puncture site pain). No trend in the incidence of TEAEs by age group was identified.

The 33 TEAEs occurred in 5 high-dose category subjects (83%) and in 7 subjects (54%) in the lowdose category. In the former, the most frequently reported TEAE was pyrexia. In the latter category, the most frequently reported were bradycardia and pneumonia.

When stratified according to previous LEV (non-)use, 6 subjects with and 6 without prior use suffered from  TEAEs.  For  the  former  the  most  common  one  was  pyrexia,  while  bradycardia  and  pneumonia occurred the most frequent in the latter group.

Three of the TEAEs which occurred could be categorized as severe. Pneumonia, abdominal sepsis, and metabolic acidosis occurred in 1 subject in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group, respiratory failure in 1 subject in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group and cardiac arrest and metabolic acidosis in 1 subject in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group.

Four drug-related TEAEs manifested in three subjects. 2 subjects (33%) in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group experienced EEG AE + hypotension and solomnolence. reported for 1 subject (14%) in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. ECG QT prolonged was reported for 1 subject (14%) in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group.

During the study three deaths were reported: 2 subjects in the ≥1 month to &lt;6 months group and 1 subject in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group. In the former age group one subject died of pneumonia, abdominal sepsis, bradycardia, and metabolic acidosis, and the other due to respiratory failure. The subject in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group died of cardiac arrest and metabolic acidosis. All three had significant  co-morbidities.  All  these  events  were  considered  not  related  to  study  medication,  as  the onset of these events in 2 of the subjects occurred within 30 days of the final IV infusion, and none of the 3 subjects were taking study drug at the time of death.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was one more incident of SAE in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group, were a subject had an SAE of moderate QT interval prolonged. The event resolved and was considered possibly related to study drug.

One subject (17%) in the ≥6 months to &lt;2 years group had a moderate AE of relative activation of the EEG (verbatim term) which led to discontinuation of study drug. The event was considered possibly related to study drug.

## Laboratory Analysis

Mean values for all hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were within normal limits at each measured time point, and no AEs were linked to these laboratory findings.

The majority of subjects had normal ECG findings at Baseline; approximately half of the subjects (47%) had a normal ECG at End of Treatment/Early Discontinuation.

There were no clinically relevant findings other than those already mentioned in laboratory analyses, vital sign measurements, ECG measurements, or physical examinations

## 10. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY RESULTS

The applicant claims that observed LEV plasma concentrations were in the expected range, but that details of the PK analysis will be provided in a separate population PK report.

## 11. DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LEV IV 15-minute infusion  administered  every 12 hours, either as adjunctive treatment or monotherapy in children (1 month to &lt;4 years) with epilepsy (except status epilepticus), either after switching from the equivalent LEV oral dose administration or as a new antiepileptic treatment.

This was an inpatient study, with majority of subjects being hospitalized for reasons related to seizures. Other subjects were temporarily unable to take oral LEV for medical reasons or hospitalized for surgery.

Overall, a total of 33 TEAEs were reported for 12 subjects. Treatment-emergent adverse events were most frequently reported general disorders and administration site conditions SOC, followed by cardiac disorders and nervous system disorders.

The  most  frequently  reported  preferred  term  was  pyrexia,  followed  by  bradycardia,  pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension (each 11% of subjects overall). One subject in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group had puncture site pain.

No trend in the incidence of TEAEs by age group, dose category, or previous LEV could be identified.

Three deaths were reported. The onset of these events in 2 of the subjects occurred within 30 days of the final IV infusion, and none of the 3 subjects were taking study drug at the time of death and had severe co morbidities.

Apart from these three there was only one more subject with an STEAE. The patient resided in the ≥2 years to &lt;4 years group and suffered an SAE of moderate QT interval prolonged. The event resolved and  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  drug.  Finally,  one  subject discontinued prematurely from the study due to an AE.

There  were  no  clinically  relevant  findings  in  laboratory  analyses,  vital  sign  measurements,  ECG measurements, or physical examinations.

The observed LEV plasma concentrations were in the expected range, but a full PK analysis report will follow later.

## Conclusion

Overall, analysis of the data showed that the LEV IV 15-minute infusion administered every 12 hours is a safe alternative and was well tolerated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures in infants and children 1 month to &lt;4 years with epilepsy when the oral administration is temporarily not feasible.

Nevertheless,  even  thought  the  data  presented  in  the  Clinical  Study  Report  may  be  considered  to support the use of Keppra IV in children aged 1 month to &lt;4 years old. However, the CHMP considered that  these  results,  whilst  promising,  report  only  safety  experience  in  just  18  patients  and  are  thus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insufficient  to  warrant  an  extension  of  Keppra  IV  into  a  younger  patient  population.  Therefore,  the CHMP did not request any change to the approved Product Information for Keppra.

## 12. COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES (MS)

One of the MS did not agree with the conclusion that: LEV IV 15-minute infusion administered every 12 hours is a safe alternative and was well tolerated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures in infants and children 1 month to &lt;4 years with epilepsy when the oral administration is temporarily not feasible.

It is accepted that the babies and infants were likely to have been seriously ill with multiple treatment; however a closer scrutiny of the safety data is warranted as follows:

It is not clear from the assessment report whether for example levetiracetam could have contributed to the 3 deaths:

- Were post-mortems performed?
- What were the findings?
- Was the levetiracetam well tolerated whilst they were on it?
- Were the ECGs of these infants/babies normal whilst on leviracetum?
- Were their LFTs normal?
- What events led to their demise?
- The QT prolongation does not appear to have been previously a problem with levetiracetum but there appears to be a positive challenge and dechallenge. Was this infant on any other medication that could have explained this? How many babies and infants had baseline and on treatment ECGs? What happened to their QT intervals?
- Generally how do the observed AEs relate to the AEs observed in adults and how to the AEs noted in children in studies with the oral formulations? Further data regarding this should be provided by the MAH.

## Committee's view:

Please find below the narrative summaries of the three deaths that occurred:

- One subject experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) of cardiac arrest and metabolic acidosis 8 days after study drug initiation, but no longer taking the study drug at time of SAE onset.

She had a previous medical history consisting of:

- o Glycogen storage disease type I, 2006-ongoing
- o Sickle cell trait, 2006-ongoing
- o Gastrostomy tube insertion, 2007-ongoing

When  the  subject  arrived  at  the  hospital  she  was  hypothermic,  bradycardiac,  hypotensive  with shallow breathing, and she rapidly progressed into cardiopulmonary arrest with heart rate in the 30s. Chest X-ray revealed a bilateral airspace consolidation with air bronchograms consistent with pulmonary  edema.  Abdominal  ultrasound  showed  mild  ascites  of  unknown  etiology  and  an abnormal thickened and collapsed gallbladder wall with pericholecystic fluid (gallstone-free). The spleen was fairly small.  An infection or inflammatory etiology could however not be concluded.

Laboratory culture tests indicated a moderate amount of white blood cells and rare Gram positive cocci. A respiratory culture grew normal colonizing flora of Corynebacterium, while a blood culture did  not  reveal  any  growth.  Lab  values  denoted  a  severe  lactic  bicarbonate  refractory  acidosis, which worsened the complete heart block experienced by the subject.

Video electroencephalograph was abnormal with little activity. No seizures were apparent and the subject was considered to have organ failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

She  received  norephinephrine,  potassium  chloride,  liothyronine,  and  levothyroxine  sodium  for cardiovascular  support;  sodium  bicarbonate  for  the  treatment  of  metabolic  acidosis;  calcium gluconate,  dopamine,  epinephrine,  vasopressin,  and  atropine  for  resuscitation,  morphine  for  the management  of  pain  and  hydrocortisone  for  the  treatment  of  multiorgan  failure.  Despite  the intervention the subject died due to the events of cardiac arrest and metabolic acidosis two days after onset of the SAE.

The  subject's  electrocardiogram  evaluation  at  study  entry  and  at  the  end  of  study  treatment showed an abnormal  profile,  as  at  both  times  she  showed  signs  of  sinus  tachycardia.  She  also discontinued from the study prematurely, but the reason for this is unknown.

At the time of SAE onset she was taking oral commercial levetiracetam 1400mg/day, midazolam 0.75mg (frequency not known) and allopurinol.

- One  subject  experienced  pyrexia,  pneumonia  and  convulsions  in  the  post-treatment  period,  15 days after drug initiation. Twenty days later he experienced another episode of pneumonia, which was in turn followed 7 days later by an event of abdominal sepsis. A further five days later, at 47 days after study drug initiation, the patient experienced mild bradycardia followed by a metabolic acidosis  one  day  later,  for  which  he  was  administered  cefotaxime,  metronidazole,  furosemide, buprenorphine, insulin, midazolam, and bicarbonate. The same day the subject the event led to cardioresperatory arrest and death.

This patient's prior medical history was as follows:

- o Sepsis neonatal, Sep 2009-Oct 2009
- o Neurological infection, Sep 2009-Nov 2009
- o Quadriparesis, Sep 2009-ongoing
- o Anaemia, Oct 2009
- o Encephalitis, Oct 2009-Nov 2009
- o Cerebral atrophy (cortical cerebral atrophy), Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Hypoxia, Unknown

The patient was taking phenobarbital 25mg/day, oral LEV 200mg/day, cefotaxime, iron, ranitidine and cispraside.

He had been diagnosed with right ventricular hypertrophy at study screening, end of treatment and 8 days after EOT.

The events of pneumonia (second event), abdominal sepsis, bradycardia and metabolic acidosis were considered fatal.

- One subject was a patient with an extensive medical history at the time of death:
- o Premature labour, Aug 2009
- o Respiratory failure, Aug 2009-Sep 2009
- o Aspiration bronchial (bronchoaspiration), Sep 2009
- o Atelectasis, Sep 2009
- o Cardiac arrest, Sep 2009
- o Inhalation therapy, Sep 2009-ongoing
- o Parenteral nutrition, Sep 2009-ongoing
- o Cardiac arrest, Oct 2009
- o Cardiac arrest, Oct 2009
- o Pneumonia, Oct 2009
- o Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Oct 2009
- o Whole blood transfusion, Oct 2009

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Whole blood transfusion, Oct 2009
- o Cerebral atrophy, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Gastro esophageal reflux disease, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Hypotonia, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Nervous system disorder (mesencefalic necrosis), Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Pyramidal tract syndrome, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Thalamic infarction, Oct 2009-ongoing
- o Sepsis, Nov 2009
- o Aspiration bronchial (intermitent bronchoaspiration), Nov 2009-ongoing
- o Dysphagia, Nov 2009-ongoing
- o Visual disturbance, Nov 2009-ongoing
- o Asphyxia, Unknown

He experienced a mild event of pneumonia in the post-treatment period, 16 days after study drug administration. Thirteen days later he had a respiratory failure with fatal outcome.

At the time of the pneumonia event the subject was admitted to the ER due to acute respiratory failure caused by bronchoaspiration with a consolidation in the apical region of the right lung. The patient was given vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ceftriaxone, and dicloxacillin as treatment. He took LEV via gastrostomy for 11 days (9 days 100 mg/day, 2 days 64 mg/day). The subject was discharged with an aspirator device 10 days after this admittal.

Two days later he was admitted to the ER with respiratory failure and tonic seizures, where he received diazepam 2mg/day, midazolam 2μg/day, and phenytoin (dose unknown). In the afternoon his condition worsened and he developed cardiorespiratory arrest and died. The cause of death was respiratory failure.

Like  the  previous  subject  he  had  been  diagnosed  with  right  ventricular  hypertrophy  at  study screening and at end of treatment.

Concomitant drugs at the time of the SAEs of pneumonia and respiratory failure included valproic acid 45mg/day and chloramphenicol.

Based on the data there was no causal effect to be found between study drug and pneumonia/respiratory failure.

Thus,  based  on  the  data  provided,  the  MAH's  view  that  the  deaths  that  occurred  are  likely  not causally connected to the administration of IV LEV, is not endorsed.

The data on concomitant medical conditions and drug use at the time of death is too confounded to properly investigate the role of IV LEV in the subjects' demise. But, based on the timing of the events it seems unlikely that IV LEV contributed to their fatal condition. Furthermore, the patients' extensive comorbidities seem to indicate that it is far more likely that their deaths are affiliated to their poor prior health conditions than to a specific problem with IV LEV itself.

Concerning the ECG readings, there was only one subject which exhibited a shift from a normal ECG  reading  at  baseline  to  an  abnormal  one  at  end  of  treatment.  This  subject  exhibited  a prolongation of the QT interval approximately 1 hour post IV LEV administration. The child was in sinus rhythm at 95bpm. An ECG performed 3 days later showed the QT interval had returned to the Baseline value. His prior medical history consisted of Reflux oesophagitis (Jan 2006-Aug 2006), Phimosis (Aug 2006), Food allergy (2006-ongoing), Neurodermatitis (2006-ongoing) and Gastrointestinal infection (Feb 2009). The only concomitant drug he took at the time of SAE onset was oxcarbazepine 480mg/day.

It  was  considered possible that the QT prolongation was causally linked to the study drug. It is agreed that there might perhaps be a causal connection given the temporal association of study drug administration and the SAE onset. Also, there is no indication in the data available that this event would probably have been caused by another medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nevertheless,  given  that  this  was  the  only  subject  to  display  a  worsening  of  their  ECG  reading during the study window and combined with the fact that cardiologic issues are known already to have rarely occurred during LEV treatment, this single event is not believed to be a cause for alarm.

There  is  no  necessity  of  a  comparison  of  the  observed  AEs  to  the  AEs  observed  in  adults  and  in children noted in studies with the oral formulations. Given the extremely small patient population in this study, this would likely only lead to nice-to-know but clinically not very meaningful results.

## Conclusion

Overall, the CHMP agree with the MAH's conclusions. None of the data suggested that the use of LEV IV in epileptic infants and children aged 1 month to &lt;4 years, to temporarily offset unfeasibility of the oral administration, was a cause for concern.

Although  three  deaths  occurred,  the  timing  and  presence  of  existing  serious  co-morbidities  were considerd by the Committee to make it seem doubtful that the mortalities were due to LEV IV use. One more SAE and one discontinuation also occurred, and these were assessed to be possibly drug related.

However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the fact that this study only included 18 patients makes it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from the data presented. Therefore the outcomes can only be seen as informative rather than conclusive. This is also fully recognised by the MAH and no changes to the SmPC are proposed.
