## Introduction

Adefovir  dipivoxil  is  an  oral  prodrug  of  adefovir,  a  phosphonate  nucleotide  analogue  of  adenosine monophosphate which is an inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in vitro and in vivo .

Hepsera  (adefovir  dipivoxil)  10  mg  tablets  in  a  once  daily  regimen  is  currently  approved  for  the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT) levels  and  histological evidence of active liver inflammation and fibrosis, or decompensated liver disease.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the therapeutic indication for Hepsera to include adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with compensated liver disease, evidence of active viral replication and persistently elevated serum ALT levels. The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection in children is generally characterised by a more benign disease as compared to adults, with only some children having an active disease that might require an early treatment introduction. The  risk  of  developing  chronic  HBV  infection  ranges  from  90%  in  newborn  of  HbeAg  positive mothers,  to  20-30%  in  infants  and  children  infected  during  the  first  5  years  of  life,  to  6-10%  in children infected after 6 years of age. Long-term follow-up studies in children have shown that more than 80% seroconverted from HBeAg to anti-HBe before reaching adulthood. In spite of a more benign course of the disease in comparison to adult, the long-term complications of chronic HBV (i.e. cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma - HCC) have also been found in children, although infrequently. Furthermore, patients with ongoing viral replication that acquired chronic HBV early in life are at highest risk for development of progressive liver disease, cirrhosis and HCC. Despite well established guidelines for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) in adult patients, there is less consensus on when to start treatment in paediatric patients. Initiating treatment in children should be carefully weighed to avoid promoting an early introduction of treatment in the paediatric population  that  could  lead  to  the  exhaustion  of  therapy  in  this  population  through  the  risk  of emergence of resistance. At present, no antiviral medicinal product has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the paediatric population. In support of this type II variation to extend the therapeutic indication to adolescent, a main efficacy and safety  study  (GS-US-103-518),  two  bioequivalence  studies  for  the  investigational  adefovir  oral suspension formulations (formulation A study GS-02-515; and formulation B study GS-02-536) and a dose finding pharmacokinetic study (GS-02-517, formulation A) were submitted. Data from these studies concern all paediatric age groups and not only the applied age range of 12 to &lt;18 years. All submitted studies have previously been assessed by the CHMP in the setting of Hepsera follow-up measures. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Clinical aspects

The  clinical  paediatric  development  program  for  adefovir  dipivoxil  included  three  completed pharmacology studies and an ongoing paediatric efficacy and safety study. During the development program, two investigational oral suspension formulations of adefovir were evaluated, A and B (only different in taste).

-  Main  study: GS-US-103-518 ,  initial  48  week  efficacy  and  safety  data  of  this  double  blind placebo  controlled  study  in  chronic  hepatitis  B  paediatric  patients  aged  2  -  17 years old using oral suspension B and the 10 mg tablet formulation. The openlabel phase of this study is currently ongoing;

 Supportive studies: GS-02-515 , bioequivalence of adefovir dipivoxil oral suspension A with the marketed 10 mg tablet; GS-02-517 ,  a  pharmacokinetic study using oral suspension A to identify the adefovir dipivoxil doses to evaluate the efficacy and safety in chronic hepatitis B paediatric patients (in study GS-US-103-518); GS-02-536 ,  bioequivalence of adefovir dipivoxil oral suspension B with the marketed 10 mg tablet; Clinical pharmacology Pharmacokinetics Bioequivalence studies Studies GS-02-515 and GS-02-536 These studies were phase I, open-label, randomised, crossover studies in which healthy adult subjects were to receive a single 10 mg (5 ml) dose of adefovir dipivoxil suspension formulation A (study GS02-515) or adefovir dipivoxil suspension formulation B (study GS-02-536), and in a separate study period, a single 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil tablet. There was a 7-day washout period. Twenty-four subjects enrolled in study -515 and 22 completed the study. In study -536 twenty were enrolled, and 17 completed the study. In  both  studies,  the  90%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  for  the  geometric  mean  ratios  of  the  oral suspension formulations/tablet AUCinf, AUC0-last, and Cmax were within the range of 80% to 125%, demonstrating that both adefovir dipivoxil suspension formulation A and formulation B and the tablet formulation were bioequivalent. No safety concerns arose from these studies. Dose selection study Study GS-02-517 This was a multicentre, phase I-II, open-label study to determine a dosage regimen for each paediatric group (2-17 years) that would produce adefovir plasma exposures similar to that of adults receiving the approved dose of 10 mg once daily (in study GS-00-472). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Two  different  doses  were  assessed  in  the  2-6  years  and  7-11  years  age  groups,  one  dose  of 0.14 mg/kg  and  one  dose  of  0.3  mg/kg  with  a  7-day  washout  period.  Subjects  12-17  years  of  age received a single dose of 10 mg oral suspension formulation.

## Population

Children  and  adolescents  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  compensated  liver  disease,  HbeAg  positive, aged  2  to  17  years  old,  with  serum  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  DNA ≥ 105  copies/ml,  and  creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min.

Forty-seven  patients  were  enrolled,  2  discontinued  before  receiving  study  medication.  Data  of 45 patients were analysed (12 aged 2-6 years, 18 aged 7-11 years and 15 aged 12-17 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetic results

The adefovir exposure from the 10 mg dose in adolescents 12 - 17 years of age was similar to those observed  in  adults.  In  adolescents,  mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf  were  respectively  22.8  ng/ml  and 237.3 ng.hr/ml compared to 18.4 ng/ml and 220.3 ng.hr/ml in adult patients with chronic hepatitis B (study GS-00-472).

In the age range 2-6 years and 7-11 years, the AUCo-t, AUCo-inf and Cmax mean values following a 0.14 mg/kg dose of adefovir dipivoxil were much lower (40  to 60 %) than in the targeted adult values.

In the age range 2-6 years, the AUCo-t, AUCo-inf mean values following a 0.3 mg/kg dose of adefovir dipivoxil were comparable to adults whereas the mean Cmax was 46 % higher than the adult values.

In the 7-11 years of age group, AUCo-t, AUCo-inf mean values were approximately 25 % higher than the adult exposure values and Cmax mean values are 80% higher than the adult values.

The  selected  doses  for  study  GS-US-103-518  were  well  documented  and  bioequivalence  between tablets and oral suspension formulations was shown in studies GS-02-515 and GS-02-536.

Based  on  these  results,  the  following  dosing  recommendations  for  adefovir  dipivoxil  in  paediatric patients were agreed:  patients aged 12-17 years old: 10 mg/day;  patients aged 2 to 6 years old: 0.3 mg/kg (up to 10mg/day );  patients  aged  7  to  11  years  old:  0.25  mg/kg  (the  0.3  mg/kg  resulted  in  a  Cmax  and AUC0-∞ higher  than  those  achieved  in  adults.  Assuming  linear  pharmacokinetics,  a dose of 0.25 mg/kg appeared to provide a Cmax and AUC0-∞ closer to the adult target dose - Cmax 25.74 ng/ml, AUC0-∞ 227.74 ng.hr/ml). Main study' pharmacokinetics Study GS-US-103-518 This  was  a  phase  III,  efficacy  and  safety  study  in  paediatric  subjects  with  CHB.  Subjects  were randomised to adefovir dipivoxil or placebo (2:1 ratio), with stratification by age at the first dose (2 -6, 7 -11,  12 -17  years,  inclusive)  and  by  CHB  treatment  history  (prior  treatment,  no  prior  treatment). Formulation and daily dose were based on age and weight (daily dose not to exceed 10 mg). Pharmacokinetic results Adefovir pharmacokinetic parameters from paediatric patients (GS-US-103-0518) and adult patients (GS-00-472) are summarised hereafter: Although  a  slight  increase  in  AUC  and  Cmax  was  observed  for  the  older  children,  adefovir  plasma exposure was similar among the three paediatric age groups. Discussion and conclusion on pharmacokinetics Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  adefovir  dipivoxil  dosing  regimens  used  in  paediatric  patients  in  study  GS-US-103-518  were adequate from a pharmacokinetic point of view. Adefovir plasma concentrations were comparable in the  three  paediatric  age  groups,  and  each  age  group  achieved  the  target  adefovir  concentrations reported in adult CHB patients.

These  studies  were  however,  of  secondary  importance  since  the  MAH  requested  to  extend  the indication to children above 12 years of age for which the already approved 10 mg tablet formulation is adequate.

## Clinical efficacy

## Study GS-US-103-518

This  was  a  phase  III,  multicentre  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adefovir  dipivoxil (ADV) in HbeAg positive treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced children and adolescents with compensated  liver  disease  following  48  weeks  of  treatment.  The  open-label  phase  of  this  study  is currently ongoing. The two study treatment periods are:

-  Weeks 0-48: randomised (2:1 ratio), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group; randomisation stratified by age at the first dose of study treatment (2 to &lt; 7 years; ≥ 7 to &lt; 12 years; ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years) and prior treatment for CHB (prior treatment; no prior treatment).
-  Weeks 49-240: open-label for all placebo treated subjects not exhibiting HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion  at  week  44  and  for  all  others  ADV  treated  patients  who  were  eligible  to continued treatment for up an additional 192 weeks.

Population Treatment- naïve and treatment-experienced paediatric subjects (age 2 &lt; 18 years) with evidence of active disease, HbsAg positive for at least 6 months and HbeAg positive, with serum HBV DNA ≥ 10 5 copies/ml. Serum ALT levels ≥ 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) at both initial and confirmatory screening visits, compensated liver disease, and creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min. Patients were to be seronegative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Hepatitis D Virus (HDV). Subjects  from  the  pharmacokinetic  study  GS-02-517  (see  3.2.1),  were  allowed  to  be  enrolled regardless of screening ALT or serum HBV DNA levels. All other entry criteria were to be met. Patients with prior treatment with antiviral agents demonstrating anti-HBV activity within 6 months prior to the initial screening visit were not enrolled. The CHMP noted that the inclusion criteria did not meet the definition of active, rapidly progressive CHB (persistently elevated plasma ALT levels &gt; 3 ULN for ≥ 12 months). This population may not be representative  of  a  population  with  active,  progressive  disease  for  which  treatment  should  be considered in clinical practice. Objectives The primary objective  was  to  investigate  efficacy  of  ADV  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  B (CHB) in children and adolescents (age 2 to &lt; 18 years) compared to placebo following 48 weeks of treatment. Initially the primary efficacy endpoint was the 'proportion of subjects with serum HBV DNA&lt;LLQ (lower limit of quantification) and ALT normalisation' and then changed to the proportion of subjects with serum HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml and normal ALT at week 48. The LLQ of the HBV DNA assay  was  29  IU/ml  (equivalent  to  169  copies/ml).  This  change  favours  the  achievement  of  the endpoint and may not allow a direct comparison with study results in adults. The  CHMP had expressed the need to have a combined primary efficacy  criterion  to  include  HBe seroconversion  (appearance  of  HBeAb)  given  the  high  rate  of  spontaneous  seroconversion,  (aprox 15% per year),  in  the  paediatric  population.  The  MAH  considered  that  the  inclusion  of  HBeAg seroconversion would significantly increased the sample size, and decided to keep seroconversion as a secondary criterion. A combined analysis of HbeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml and normal ALT at week 48 was however presented within the results. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The secondary objectives were:

· to investigate the safety of ADV for the treatment of CHB in children and adolescents (age 2 to &lt; 18 years) compared to placebo at 48 weeks;

·  to  evaluate  the  proportion  of  children  and  adolescents  who  experience  HBeAg  and  HBsAg seroconversion following 48 weeks;

- to evaluate the development of conserved site mutations associated with resistance to ADV;
- to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADV in children and adolescents for up to 5 years.

## Statistics

The  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  described  in  the  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (finalised before unblinding the study) was a comparison of the treatment groups using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference between the groups (as well as between groups with data stratified by age group and  by  previous  treatment  for  hepatitis  B).  However,  another  statistical  method  was  chosen  after unblinding the results. The MAH explained that due to the small number of responders in the placebo group, it was determined that a statistical exact test would be more appropriate in the evaluation of treatment  group  differences.  The  results  analised  by  both  methods  and  discussion  on  the  relevant differences in the results if any, were not provided.

A summary of the disposition of patients is present in the below table: Demographic and baseline characteristics There were no statistically  significant  differences  between  the  ADV  and  placebo  groups  as  regards demographic or baseline characteristics. Subjects  in  the  7-11  years  group  and  in  the  12-17  years  group  had  similar  baseline  characteristics: baseline  median  HBV  DNA  around  8.8  log10  copies/ml  and  median  ALT  levels  around  2.3  ULN. Genotype A was the most common genotype in these age groups. The same proportion of subjects in each of these age groups were HBV therapy experienced-patients (aprox 70 %). No data were available on the degree of necroinflammation in these children since a systematic biopsy was not required in the study. In the targeted age group (12-17 years), ALT levels ranged from 0.7 to 10.4 ULN, showing that some children did not have any active disease at inclusion in the study and that an important variability in the severity of the disease was reported in this age group. In  addition,  3  subjects  were  HBeAg  negative  at  baseline  (1  in  placebo  2-6  years,  2  in  ADV  12-17 years) while the criterion for inclusion was HBeAg positivity. HBeAg negative patients tend to show a better treatment response than HBeAg positive as shown in previous studies. It  was  noted  that 9  subjects  had  normal  ALT  at  baseline,  although  an  inclusion  criterion  was ALT ≥ 1.5 × ULN. Four of these were in the 12-17 years old treatment group. The  small  sample  size  of  the  patient  population  from  12  to  17  years  in  this  study  (56  ADV,  27 Placebo)  and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  disease  status  in  this  age  group  limited  the  study  results interpretation.

Only 4 patients (7%) with 12-17 years treated with ADV vs 0 treated with placebo had undetectable HBV DNA at week 48, whereas 13% vs 8% in the 2-6 years age group and 17% vs 0% in the 7-11 years age group achieved undetectability with ADV and placebo, respectively.

a Week 48 data, if week 48 result was missing, week 44 result was carried forward, if week 44 was missing, missing=failure Significantly more ADV-treated subjects in the 12 -17 years age group achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (23% vs 0%, p = 0.007). The statistical significant difference between the ADV-treated and the placebo treated subjects (19% vs 2%; p&lt;0.001) was mainly driven by the subjects in the group aged 12-17 years. Although a statistically significant difference was noted, a more stringent criteria for the virological response (undetectability with at least a LLQ of &lt;400 copies/ml) should have been used. Change from baseline in serum HBV DNA There was statistically significant difference between the ADV and placebo-treated subjects in each of the three age groups. However, for ADV-treated subjects, the magnitude of the change from baseline to week 48 decreased as the age of the subjects decreased:  12 -17 year age group, median change was -3.46 log10 copies/ml (mean, -3.72);  7 -11 year age group, median change was -3.27 copies/ml (mean, -3.38); and  2 -6 year age group, median change was -2.78 copies/ml (mean, -3.19). The  median  change  in  HBV  DNA  concentrations  from  baseline  to  week  48  were  similar  to  those reported in adults (study -437) where a median change of -3.52 in ADV-treated patients vs -0.55 in placebo-treated patients was observed. Categorical analysis of serum HBV DNA Older  subjects  were  more  likely  to  have  an  HBV  DNA  &lt;  1000  copies/ml  than  younger  subjects, however,  it  is  noteworthy  that  with  a  more  stringent  criterion,  a  better  response  could  be  seen  in younger children. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Furthermore, in the 12-17 years old group, a same proportion of patients achieved HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml (23%) or had HBV DNA &gt;10 6 copies/ml (27%). Overall, the response to adefovir therapy in the 12-17 years old was not convincing.

## HBeAg seroconversion

There were no statistically significant differences between ADV -treated and placebo-treated HbeAg positive subjects in any of the three age groups (16% ADV vs 5% placebo, p = 0.051) as regards loss of HBeAg. However, when data from the 2 -6 and 7 -11 years groups (combined 2 to 11 age groups)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  pooled,  there  was  a  statistical  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  (20%  ADV vs 0% placebo, p = 0.007).

A combined analysis of HBeAg seroconversion, decrease HBV DNA under 1000 copies/ml and ALT normalisation, was presented by the MAH:

| HBeAg seroconversion, HBV DNA < 1000   | 2-6 years   | 2-6 years      | 7-11 years   | 7-11 years     | 12-17 years   | 12-17 years    | Total       | Total          |

Only  children  treated  with  ADV  achieved  a  response,  however  the  difference  between  ADV  and placebo groups was not statistically significant in any of the age groups. Only 4 (7%) ADV-treated patients aged 12-17 years had a positive response. When the data were pooled for analysis, the difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant, when pooled for 2 -11 years group (14% adefovir dipivoxil vs 0% placebo, p = 0.048) and when pooled for all three age groups (11% adefovir dipivoxil vs 0% placebo, p = 0.009). Resistance No  subject  developed  the  rtA181V  or  rtN236T  mutation  associated  with  ADV  resistance  over  the 48 weeks.  However,  5  ADV-treated  patients  (3  lamivudine-experienced  and  2  naïve  patients) developed  mutations  other  than  those vs none  in  placebo  group.  This  did  not  translate  into  an identified  impact  on  the  virological  response.  Three  lamivudine-experienced  patients  on  ADV presented enrichment of the rtA181T mutation at week 48. Supplementary information provided by MAH showed that lamivudine was added to ADV treatment group causing a further decrease in HBV DNA but no further genotypic data was available. The  relationship  between  rtA181T  mutation  and  phenotypic  resistance  to  adefovir  is  under  close monitoring for adult patients. It cannot be excluded that the development of rtA181T is a preliminary step  of  rtA181V  emergence.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  provide  the  next  annual  resistance surveillance by the end of 2008 addressing any further genotypic change reported in this study. Discussion and conclusion on efficacy The 48 week efficacy data of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study showed that the proportion  of  HbeAg  positive  patients  aged  12  to  &lt;18  years  who  achieved  the  primary  efficacy endpoint (serum HBV DNA &lt; 1000 copies/ml and normal ALT) was significantly higher in adefovirtreatment group in comparison with placebo treatment group, 23% (13/56) vs 0% (0/27). The HBV DNA levels change and the ALT levels change observed in this population are consistent with those reported in adult HbeAg positive patients (Hepsera pivotal study GS-02-437). The  CHMP had major  concerns  related  to  the  methodological  limitations  of  this  paediatric  pivotal study precluding the interpretation of the study results. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The small sample size with 56 ADV-treated patients and 27 placebo-treated in the targeted population of 12 to &lt;18 year and the heterogeneity of baseline disease status and the level and identification of prior CHB treatment were limiting factors. Also the inclusion criteria did not meet the definition of active, rapidly progressive CHB (persistently elevated plasma ALT levels &gt; 3 ULN for ≥ 12 months) as define currently in the European guidelines. Furthermore, for the targeted age group the baseline ALT levels ranged from 0.7 to 10.4 ULN showing that part of this small population did not have an active disease at inclusion and that there was an important variability in the severity of the disease in this age group.

Overall, this study population could not be considered as representative of a population with active, progressive disease for which treatment with adefovir should be considered in clinical practice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As regards the study results, although a statistically significant difference was noted, a more stringent criteria  for  the  virological  response  (undetectability  with  at  least  a  LLQ  of  &lt;400  copies/ml)  should have been used. Also, given the high rate of spontaneous seroconversion, (aprox. 15% per year), in paediatric  population,  the  primary  efficacy  criterion  should  have  included  HBe  seroconversion (appearance of HBeAb).

Considering the methodological limitations of this pivotal paediatric study, including doubts on the baseline  characteristics  of  the  study  population,  the  poorly  convincing  efficacy  results  observed  in children aged 12 to &lt;18 years old (in particular in term of HBeAg seroconversion) and considering the risk of emergence of resistance, the limited therapeutic options and the existence of cross resistance, the CHMP agreed that the clinical study did not provide confirmatory results to consider the use of adefovir more beneficial than deleterious in adolescents. The CHMP was of opinion that the clinical data available were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.

## Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths

These concerns were expressed to the MAH. However, as no further efficacy data that could provide reassurance on the therapeutic utility of ADV in paediatric patients was available, the MAH proposed not to pursue at this stage with an extension to the therapeutic indication for adefovir to include the treatment of adolescent patients. The CHMP agreed to reflect the paediatric data in section 5.1 of the SPC. The information delivered in the SPC should however, be very limited and discourage off label use by highlighting the limitations of the efficacy demonstration in the overall paediatric population and not only in adolescent patients. Clinical safety An updated long term safety report was submitted as requested by the CHMP during the evaluation of this application. Available 96 week safety data included the ongoing open-label phase of the paediatric pivotal study GS-US-103-518 as well as additional information from the MAH drug safety and public health department database (DSPH). Patient exposure A total of 173 paediatric subjects with CHB were initially enrolled in the 48 week double blind phase of study -518 and received at least one dose of study treatment. The ongoing open-label phase includes a total of 162 paediatric subjects. The median exposure for the 12 - 17 years was 96 weeks. Adverse events Eighty four percent (84%) of the subjects in all ADV-groups experienced adverse events (AEs) over 48  weeks  of  treatment.  A  lower  percentage  of  patients  (72%)  experienced  AEs  when  data  from  48 weeks plus open-label phase were combined. The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  regardless  of  their  relationship  with  the  drug  were nasopharynigitis (24%), headache (16%), pharyngitis (14%), cough (12%) and abdominal pain (12%). No difference with the double blind 48 week period was observed. Between  week  48  and  week  96,  new  treatment-related  adverse  events  reported  in  ADV-treated adolescents were: 1 hepatitis, 1 candidiasis, 1 blood CPK increased and 1 depression. No additional cases of anorexia and/or decreased appetite attributed to ADV therapy was reported in adolescents in the second year of study. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

No deaths were reported during the 96 week period of this study. In the 12-17 years age group, seven subjects (9%) had SAEs with ADV treatment from week 0 -96 (compared to 6% during the first 48 weeks). One patient reported depression and hepatitis which were the only drug-related SAEs.

## Adverse events of special interest

## ¾ Related to appetite

A higher rate of anorexia, decreased appetite and/or decreased food intake in ADV treated patients compared to placebo treated patients (including some considered related to ADV) was seen at week 48.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, at week 96, anorexia was reported in 4 subjects with adefovir dipivoxil treatment (5%) and decreased appetite was reported for 2 other subjects (3%) in the 12 -17 year group with only one case occurred during the open label phase. None resulted in discontinuation of treatment. All were nonserious and two (one anorexia and one decreased of appetite) judged treatment related. One subject with decreased appetite also had an AE of decreased weight.

The performed analysis of vital signs (weight and height) showed a trend towards a lower weight gain from baseline  to  week  48  in  ADV-treated  paediatric  patients  (+2.5kg)  compared  to  placebo-treated paediatric patients (+3.4kg). This trend was reported in each age group but more marked in younger children. Adjusted analysis by age group and prior hepatitis B treatment-experienced, the mean difference  in  change  at  week  48  was  -1.2.  No  difference  was  however  apparent  in  terms  of change from baseline in height between both treatment groups.

An additional analysis of Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-scores will be submitted by Q1 2008 to further explore this issue. ¾ Psychiatric disorders Six subjects (8%) in the 12 -17 year group reported AEs in the 'psychiatric disorders' system organ class during ADV treatment although mostly considered unrelated to study drug. Depression was the only drug-related SAEs in an adolescent with a history of depression. There is insufficient evidence at this stage to confirm that ADV therapy in adolescent plays a direct role in the occurrence of new-onset psychiatric disorders or aggravation of pre-existing conditions. Psychiatric disorders are not listed in the Hepsera SPC. This issue will be closely monitored by the MAH. ¾ Renal events No  new  safety  concern  was  identified  and  no  trend  towards  a  higher  susceptibility  of  paediatric population regarding the impact of ADV on renal function was identified in the 96 week safety data. ¾ Hepatic events and on-treatment ALT flares No  ADV -treated  subject  showed  evidence  of  hepatic  decompensation.  In  the  12-17  years  group, during the double blind of ADV treatment no subject meet the definition of severe hepatic flare but in the open label treatment one had post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis B. This subject had an SAE of Grade 3 hepatitis approximately 3 months after ADV treatment was discontinued due to depression. Two subjects in this age group had marked abnormalities in ALT and/or in AST during ADV therapy. No particular concern is raised by these findings that are in line with the known safety profile of ADV in adult patients. ¾ Other laboratory abnormalities Serum Amylase and Lipase Nine (5%) ADV treated subjects had treatment-emergent Grade 3 increases in serum amylase. Only one occurred in 12-17 year group and during the double blind period. Serum lipase concentrations were also concomitantly increased. There were no other relevant AEs at the same time. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) In the 12 -17 year group, CPK increase was the only marked laboratory abnormality during ADV treatment  occurring  in  six  subjects  (8%).  All  CPK  elevations  resolved  during  ongoing  ADV treatment. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Discontinuation due to AEs

Two ADV treated subjects permanently discontinued study treatment because of an AE. Both subjects were  in  the  12 -17  year  group  (one  reported  in  the  48  week).  Both  had  pre-existing  psychiatric disorders.  In  one  case  the  patient  developed  a  worsening  of  his  abnormal  behaviour,  and  the  other experienced treatment-related depression. The role of ADV is unclear. An aggravation of pre-existing symptoms cannot however be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional safety information

Fifteen  additional  reports  of  SAEs  in  paediatric  subjects  were  identified  on  the  MAH  database,  in subjects who are or were enrolled in GS-US-103-518. These events were not yet in the clinical study database at the time of the data cut-off for this update.

Ten were hepatic SAEs, nine of which occurred after discontinuation of ADV treatment because of either seroconversion or an inadequate response to treatment. Five of them occurred in the 12-17 age group.

## Discussion and conclusion on safety

Overall, the 96-week safety data reported in study GS-US-103-0518 confirmed that the safety profile of adefovir in adolescent is comparable to the known safety profile in adult population.

No  major  concern  was  raised,  in  particular  renal  events  and  hepatic  decompensation.  Most  of  the adverse reactions related to adefovir treatment are already listed in the Hepsera SPC for adult patients. Higher  rates  of  anorexia,  decreased  appetite  and/or  decreased  food  intake,  currently  unlisted,  were reported in adefovir treated patient compared to placebo, during the double blind phase of this study. No additional cases were reported in adolescent in the second year of study. The  analysis  on  BMI  scores  to  be  submitted  by  Q1  2008  are  expected  to  address  the  remaining concern with regard to the lower weight change from baseline to week 48 observed in the adefovir group (-1.2kg). The 96 weeks data on vital signs (body weight, height and BMI) will also be provided. Seven cases of psychiatric disorders  were  reported.  Since  an  aggravation  of  pre-existing  conditions due  to  adefovir  therapy  cannot  be  excluded,  the  CHMP  recommended  that  this  issue  should  be monitored. Overall conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment CHB infection  in  children,  including  adolescents,  is  characterised  by  a  more  benign  disease  and  a relatively high annual rate of spontaneous and durable seroconversion as compared to adults. There is a particular need to be convinced on the benefit of the treatment and to have reassurance on its safety profile before any recommendation on its use in the paediatric population could be granted. In view of the methodological limitations of the pivotal paediatric study, including uncertainty of the active, progressive disease of the study population, the poorly convincing efficacy results observed in children  aged  12  to  &lt;18  years  old  (in  particular  in  term  of  HBeAg  seroconversion)  and  the uncertainties  surrounding  the  long-term  safety  profile  of  this  drug  in  children,  the  CHMP  was  of opinion that the efficacy and safety data available do not allow to make a benefit/risk assessment of adefovir in this specific population. Given the risk of emergence of resistance, the limited therapeutic options and the existence of cross resistance,  an  early  introduction  (longer  treatment  duration)  of  antiviral  treatment  in  children,  this clinical  study  does  not  provide  convincing  arguments to  consider  that  the  use  of  adefovir  might  be more beneficial than deleterious in adolescents. The MAH, acknowledging the CHMP concerns, proposed not to pursue an extension of indication for Hepsera in adolescent patients at this stage. It was also agreed that the clinical development of adefovir in children should be reflected in the SPC. Medicinal Product no longer authorised
