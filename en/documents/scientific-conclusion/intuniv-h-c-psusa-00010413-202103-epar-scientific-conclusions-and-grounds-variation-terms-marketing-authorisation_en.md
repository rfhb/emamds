## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for guanfacine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Suicidal events have been followed almost since the beginning of the assessment of the PSURs. Upon a request  from the  previous PSUR,  the  MAH  submitted  a cumulative  review  on  this  safety  topic.  After reviewing the information provided by the MAH, the PRAC considers that there is not enough information to include suicidal ideation in section 4.8, albeit the information included in section 4.4 is very limited and should  be  reinforced.  Information to  warn  the  caregivers or  healthcare  professionals  about  potential suicidal behavior should be included.

In  addition,  a  signal  of  aggression  was  opened  and  closed  by  the  MAH  during  the  current  interval. Nonetheless, there were reported cases with plausible temporal association and positive dechallenge after withdrawal or decrease in dose of GXR, and some of them without evidence of other concomitant drugs. Moreover, some cases occurred after increasing the dose of GXR. Regarding clinical trials, the percentage of  cases  was  slightly  higher  in  the  group  of  GXR  versus  placebo,  even when  considering  the  cases considered related with the medication by the investigator. In addition, there were cases of hostility and homicidal ideation. Therefore, the PRAC considers that information about aggression should be included in the SmPC in section 4.4 and section 4.8.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for guanfacine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing guanfacine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
