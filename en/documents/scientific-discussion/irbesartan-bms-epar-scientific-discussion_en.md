 identified and/or potential safety events of interest related to the cross-referred product KARVEA has been continuously assessed, documented and closely monitored through global pharmacovigilance activities. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Since this application is an informed consent of the KARVEA application, the CHMP considered that the  risk-benefit  balance  of  IRBESARTAN  BMS  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication: Treatment of essential hypertension.
