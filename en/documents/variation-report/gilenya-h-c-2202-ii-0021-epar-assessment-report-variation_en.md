## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/117/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/117/2013 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Fingolimod,  a  sphingosine  1-phosphate  receptor  modulator  is  a  selective  immunosuppressant.  It  is metabolised  by  sphingosine  kinase  to  the  active  metabolite  fingolimod  phosphate.  Fingolimod phosphate, binds at low nanomolar concentrations to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors 1, 3, and 4 located on lymphocytes, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to bind to S1P receptors 1, 3, and 5 located on neural cells in the central nervous system. By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P  receptors  on  lymphocytes,  fingolimod  phosphate  blocks  the  capacity  of  lymphocytes  to  egress from lymph nodes, causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. This redistribution is  believed to reduce the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocyte cells into the central nervous system, where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage.

Fingolimod (Gilenya) was authorised in the European Union (EU) on 17 March 2011 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).The recommended dose of Gilenya is one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once daily.  As of May 2013, Gilenya has been approved in more than 70 countries worldwide. The approved wording for the indication in the EU is as follows:

Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:

- -Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon.

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

or

- -Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

Interferon-β (IFN-β) and glatiramer acetate (GA) were the currently approved first-line therapies in the EU  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  MS  at  the  time  of  this  variation  submission.  Other treatments available for relapsing MS  include oral fingolimod, administered once daily, and natalizumab (Tysabri), administered via monthly intravenous infusions. These therapies offer improved efficacy over current first-line therapies but are also associated with some risks and are approved as second-line  therapy in the EU. Additionally, newer  MS  drugs,  dimethyl  fumarate  (Tecfidera), teriflunomide  (Aubagio)  and  alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada),  received  positive  opinions  by  the  CHMP recommending the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for their use in broader RRMS population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The European Commission (EC) Decisions on the Marketing Authorisation were issued in August and September 2013 for Aubagio and Lemtrada, and January 2014 for Tecfidera.

Available data indicate that the IFN-β agents and GA have comparable efficacy  (Cadavid et al 2007, Mikol et al 2007, Limmroth et al 2011), providing about a 30% to 35%  reduction in the relapse rate compared to placebo, and modest effect on slowing disability progression in patient with RRMS (Goodin et al 2002). In the literature, data from observational studies indicate that switching from a first-line DMT to another DMT (first- or second-line) is generally beneficial but do not indicate that switching from GA to IFN-β would offer significant benefits over a switch from IFN-β to GA (Oreja-Guevara et al 2009, Gajofatto et al 2009). According to expert opinion, the definitions of high disease activity despite treatment with IFN-β, would similarly apply to prior treatment with GA (Fazekas et al 2013).

On this basis, the MAH applied for the following variation:

Modification of the indication (section 4.1) of Gilenya to extend the patient population from patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon to patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a disease modifying therapy (DMT). The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

An updated ERA was submitted to support this application at the CHMP request. As the target patient population remains those with highly-active disease, the exposure of fingolimod is not expected to be increased  substantially  according  to  the  proposed  indication  update.  Based  on  the  maximum recommended daily dose of 0.5 mg fingolimod and using the default market penetration factor of 1% given in the current ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is 0.0025 μg/L for fingolimod which maintains below the trigger value for  Phase II studies(&lt; 0.01 μg/L). A risk for the environment is therefore not anticipated for fingolimod.

## 2.3. Clinical efficacy

No  new  efficacy  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application.  Additional  efficacy  post-hoc  analyses have been performed by the MAH to support the proposed modification of the indication using data from  phase  III  completed  studies  D2301,  D2302  and  D2309.  D2301  and  D2302  studies  were previously submitted as part of the initial MAA dossier. D2309 study was submitted as part of a postauthorisation measure (FUM 9).

## 2.3.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

Phase III studies used for the efficacy analyses are presented in Table 1.

For efficacy analyses, the following 4 populations were defined from the Phase III placebo- and activecontrolled studies: 1) Pooled data from Studies D2301 and D2309, 2) Data from Study D2301,3) Data from  Study  D2309  and  4)  Data  from  Study  D2302.  According  to  the  MAH,  given  the  similar  trial designs  of  studies  D2301  and  D2309  (2-year  placebo-controlled),  these  2  studies  were  pooled  for efficacy analyses. Hence this allows for a meta-analysis model for pooling Studies D2301 and D2309 with study and treatment as fixed effects. Study D2302 utilised a different design (1-year, IFN-β1a active-controlled) and was analyzed separately to provide supportive evidence. For individual Studies D2301 and 2309, only summary statistics and/or frequencies were provided.

## Subpopulation definitions

Four subpopulations were defined for those patients who were previously treated with GA and for those previously treated with IFN for evaluation of efficacy: 1) Patients previously treated with GA at any time ( Group GA ), 2) Patients previously treated with GA in the 1 year prior to Screening, defined as those  who  were  on  GA  at  any  time  during  the  year  prior  to  the  Screening  visit  ( Group  GA1 ),  3) Patients previously treated with IFN at any time ( Group IFN ) and 4) Patients previously treated with IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening, defined as those who were on any of the 3 IFN-β treatments at any time during the year prior to the Screening visit ( Group IFN1 ).

## Subgroup definitions

For the Group GA1 subpopulation, 2 key subgroups were defined: 1) GA failures (patients previously treated with GA in the 1 year prior to Screening with relapse in the year before Screening and with either  at  least  1  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesion  or  at  least  9  T2  lesions  at  Baseline)  and  2) GA  nonresponders (patients previously treated with GA in the 1 year prior to Screening with equal or more relapses in the year before Screening than in the previous year, ie, 2 years before Screening).

Similarly, for the Group IFN1 subpopulation, 2 key subgroups were defined: 1) IFN failures (patients previously treated with IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with relapse in the year before Screening and with either at least 1 Gd-enhancing T1 lesion or at least 9 T2 lesions at Baseline) and 2) IFN non-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responders (patients previously treated with IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with equal or more relapses in the year before Screening than in the previous year, ie, 2 years before Screening).

In addition to these key subgroups, the following subgroups were also defined for both Group GA1 and Group IFN1 : 1) Combined failures and non-responders to previous GA/IFN treatment: patients fulfilling any or both of the definitions of failure or non-responder, 2) Patients previously treated with GA/IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with relapse in the year before Screening and at least 1 Gdenhancing T1 lesion or a T2 lesion volume ≥ 0.5 mL at Baseline, 3) Patients with ≤ 2 relapses during the  past  2  years  prior  to  Screening,  4)  Patients  with  ≥  3  relapses  during  the  past  2  years  prior  to Screening, 5) Patients previously treated with GA/IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with a baseline EDSS score of 0 and 6) Patients previously treated with GA/IFN in the 1 year prior to Screening with a baseline EDSS score &gt;0.

## Efficacy variables

These were as follows:

· ARR (confirmed relapses only) up to Month 12 and 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309) and ARR (confirmed relapses only) up to Month 12 (Study D2302)

· Proportion of relapse-free patients up to Month 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309) and proportion of relapse-free patients up to Month 12 (Study D2302)

·  3-month  confirmed  disability  progression  up  to  Month  24  based  on  EDSS  (pooled  Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309) and 3-month confirmed disability progression up to Month 12 based on EDSS (Study D2302)

·  6-month  confirmed  disability  progression  up  to  Month  24  based  on  EDSS  (pooled  Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309)

· Total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at Month 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309,Study D2301, and Study D2309) and total volume of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at Month12 (Study D2302)

· Number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309,Study D2301, and Study D2309) and number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month12 (Study D2302)

· Change and percent change from baseline in total volume of T2 lesions at Month 24 (pooled Studies D2301/D2309, Study D2301, and Study D2309) and change and percent change from baseline in total volume of T2 lesions at Month 12 (Study D2302)

· Percent change from baseline in normalized brain volume at Month 24 (pooled StudiesD2301/D2309, Study  D2301,  and  Study  D2309)  and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  normalized  brain  volume  at Month 12 (Study D2302)

In the pooled studies D2301/D2309, the majority (68.6% and 74.5%) of patients in both Group GA1 and  Group  IFN1  completed  the  study,  with  the  highest  percentage  (75.0%  and  83.1%)  in  the fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment groups. In both Group GA1 and Group IFN1, the most frequently reported reasons  for  discontinuation  were  withdrawal  of  consent  and  adverse  events  (AEs);  both  more frequently reported in the placebo groups than in the fingolimod 0.5 mg groups. For the subgroups of failures  and  non-responders,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  completed  the  study  was  similar  for Group GA1 (69.2% and 67.0%, respectively) and Group IFN1 (76.9% and 73.0%, respectively). As for the overall groups GA1 and IFN1, the highest percentages of patients who completed the study in the subgroups of failures and non-responders were in the fingolimod 0.5 mg groups (77.2% and 84.2% respectively). The most frequently reported reasons for study discontinuation in both subgroups were withdrawal of consent and AEs, with AEs more frequently reported in the placebo groups than in the fingolimod 0.5 mg groups.

Patient disposition for pooled studies D2301/D2309 is presented in Table 3.

AE = adverse event.

For the overall population, N′ = number of patients in this subpopulation, n = number of patients in this category (%): the denominator is the number of patients in the subpopulation. For the subgroups of failures and non-responders, N′ = number of patients in this subgroup, n = number of patients in this category (%): the denominator is the number of patients in the subgroup.

* 'On study drug': patients who took study drug until study completion.

** 'Off study drug': patients who completed the study but discontinued the drug prematurely.

Overall, for both studies D2301 and D2309, taken individually, patient disposition in the subpopulations and subgroups was consistent with pooled Studies D2301/D2309. The main reasons for study  discontinuation  were  AEs,  patient  withdrawing  consent,  and  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect. Same consistent  findings  were  observed  for  study  D2302.  It  is  noted  that  the  numbers  of  patients discontinuing in Group GA1 compared to Group IFN1 were low, making difficult comparison between treatment groups and across populations.

## 2.3.2.2. Baseline data

Demographics were similar across subpopulations, subgroups, and treatment groups. The mean age was approximately 39 years, there were notably more women (mean: 76.1 for group IFN1 and 77.7% in group GA1), and the majority of patients were Caucasian (88.6% and 90.7%, respectively); these results  are  consistent  with  demographics  typically  seen  for  a  relapsing  MS  population.    Overall,  the duration of MS since first symptom and the baseline EDSS score were similar across subpopulations (Group GA1 and Group IFN1), subgroups and treatment groups.  The mean duration of MS was 9.82 (7.473) to 11.24 (7.344) across all subgroups. Mean EDSS score was 2.46 (1.237) to 2.89 (1.414). The mean number of relapses in the last 1 year tended to be higher in all treatment groups for both the failure and non-responder subgroups in Group GA1 (1.5 to 1.8) compared to Group IFN1 (1.4 to 1.6).  The  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  subgroups  and  treatment,  although  Group IFN1 was slightly more active than Group GA1. The proportion of patients free of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions  tended  to  be  slightly  higher  in  Group  GA1  and  the  GA1  subgroups  of  failures  and  nonresponders compared to Group IFN1 and Group IFN1 subgroups of failures and non-responders. The number of Gd-enhancing lesions was slightly higher in the Group IFN1 than in group GA1.

Baseline data are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

For the overall group, N′ = number of patients in the subpopulation. n′ = number of patients with an evaluable MRI scan at Baseline. For the subgroups of failures and non-responders, N′ = number of patients in the subgroup. n′ = number of patients with an evaluable MRI scan at Baseline.

Percentages use the number of patients with an evaluable MRI scan as the denominator.

Overall, for both studies D2301 and D2309, taken individually, baseline data in the subpopulations and subgroups were consistent with pooled Studies D2301/D2309. Same consistent findings were observed for study D2302.

## 2.3.2.3. Efficacy results

Results from the pooled studies are presented in Tables 7 to 13.

Efficacy analysis from the pooled studies D2301/D2309 showed significant reductions for the ARR ratio for fingolimod 0.5 mg vs. placebo for both subgroups of failures and non-responders in Group IFN1 and in Group GA1, with the reduction slightly being larger in Group IFN1 than in Group GA1 (see Table 7). In  Group  GA1,  a  similar  relative  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  vs.  placebo  was  observed  for subgroups of failures (ARR ratio: 0.518; 95% CI: 0.306, 0.877; p = 0.014 ; reduction of 48%) and non-responders (ARR ratio: 0.500; 95% CI: 0.294, 0.850; p = 0.011; reduction of 50%). In Group IFN1, a slightly  greater  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  vs.  placebo  was  observed  for  subgroups  of failures (ARR ratio: 0.437, 95% CI: 0.300, 0.637; p &lt; 0.001; reduction of 56%) and non-responders (ARR ratio: 0.372; 95% CI: 0.255, 0.545; p &lt; 0.001; reduction of 63%). Globally, the effects on ARR ratio  are  similar  in  GA1  and  IFN1  groups,  in  failures  and  non-responders  groups  and  similar  to  the overall  results.  In  addition,  an  increased  proportion  of  relapse-free  patients  was  observed  for fingolimod 0.5 mg versus placebo for both subgroups of failures and non-responders in Group IFN1 and  Group  GA1  (see  Table  8),  although  statistical  significance  was  not  reached  in  GA1  subgroup (failure group: odds ratio= 1.93; 95% CI: 0.853, 4.378; p = 0.114 and non-responders group: odds ratio= 2.10; 95% CI: 0.948, 4.635; p = 0.068) as opposed to INF1 group (failures group: odds ratio= 2.62; 95% CI: 1.575, 4.345; p &lt; 0.001 and non-responders group: odds ratio= 3.23; 95% CI: 1.946, 5.363; p &lt; 0.001).

** Logistic regression model adjusted for study, treatment, and treatment by study interaction for the overall model, and for study, treatment, subgroup, treatment by study interaction, and treatment by subgroup interaction for subgroup analyses. For subgroup analyses where the model did not converge, the logistic regression was estimated within the subgroup of interest and thus reduced only to include treatment, study, and treatment by study interaction.

Regarding disability parameters, the reduction in risk of 3-month disability progression up to month 24 for fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo was greater for Group GA1 than for Group IFN1 for both subgroups of failures and non-responders (see Table 9). In Group GA1, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 mg  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  risk  of  3-month  disability  progression  up  to  Month  24  compared  to placebo of 66.1% for failures (HR: 0.339, 95% CI: 0.138, 0.832) and 55.7% for non-responders (HR: 0.443, 95% CI: 0.193, 1.014). In Group IFN1, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 mg resulted in a small reduction in risk of 3- month disability progression up to Month 24 compared to placebo of 6.4% for failures (HR: 0.936, 95% CI: 0.500, 1.754) and 15.4% for non-responders (HR: 0.846, 95% CI: 0.460, 1.554).    Overall,  there  was  a  trend  towards  beneficial  effect  of  fingolimod  0.5  mg  on  3-  month disability progression in GA1 and IFN1 groups both in failures and non-responders; however statistical significance  is  only  reached  in  the  GA1  failures  subgroup.    A  reduction  of  the  risk  for  6-month confirmed  disability  progression  in  all  subgroups  and  the  reduction  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  versus placebo  was  also  observed  and  almost  similar  in  both  subgroups  of  failures  and  non-responders  in group GA1 (33.8% and 39.6%) and in group IFN1 (44%). However, none of the comparison reaches statistical significance (see Table 10).

Regarding  MRI  parameters,  the  number  of  new/newly  T2  lesions  and  the  number  of  GD  enhancing lesions were significantly reduced for fingolimod 0.5 mg versus placebo in failures and non-responders subgroups of both groups GA1 and INF1. These differences were statistically significant (see Tables 11 and 12).

NB = negative binomial.

N′ = number of patients in this subgroup n* = number of observations considered in this analysis: non-missing, T2 assessments at Month 24. ** NB regression model, log-link, adjusted for treatment, study, and treatment by study interaction for the overall result, and for treatment, study, subgroup, treatment by study interaction, and treatment by subgroup interaction for subgroup analyses. For subgroup analyses where the model does not converge, the estimates within the subgroup of interest are based on the reduced model adjusted for treatment, study, and treatment by study interaction.

Regarding  the  change  from  baseline  in  volume  of  T2  lesions,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  was numerically lower for fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo across all subgroups, although none of these achieved statistical significance for any subgroup in a non-parametric analysis for the Group GA1. In Group IFN1, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction from baseline to Month 24 in the volume of T2 lesions compared to placebo for both subgroups of failures and non- responders. The percent change from baseline in the volume of T2 lesions was statistically significant for fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo for all subgroups (see Table 13).

## 2.3.3. Discussion

The efficacy post-hoc analyses of the individual studies D2301, D2302, D2309 based on the subgroup of  patients  either  treatment-naïve  or  previously-treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  or  interferon-beta, were already reviewed by the CHMP as part of the initial MAA and FUM 9. All of these studies showed lower  aggregate  ARRs    for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  when  compared  to  placebo  for  both  patients  with  or without  prior  MS  DMT  (either  treatment-naïve  or  previously-treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  or interferon-beta), and these findings were consistent with the overall results of each of the study, when analysed individually. In addition, in all treatment groups, previously-treated patients (with glatiramer acetate or interferon-beta) showed higher ARRs than treatment-naïve patients.

The  new  post-hoc  efficacy  analysis  presented  in  this  application  relates  to  the  pooling  of  studies D2301/D2309. Description of the results is presented in 2.3.2.

Overall, the presented results appeared to show beneficial effects of fingolimod 0.5 mg in the subgroup of patients previously treated with GA and these were found to be consistent with the effects observed in  the  overall  study  populations  and  with  those  patients  previously  treated  with  beta-interferon  and subsequently treated with  fingolimod. However,  the  CHMP  noted  some  limitations  in  these  post-hoc analyses such as the relatively small number of patients previously treated with GA or IFN (which was further reduced when the MAH selected only those patients who were exposed to GA or IFN treatment during the last year prior to screening for the fingolimod trial), the overlap between treatment failures and  non-responders  definitions  making  these  subgroup  analyses  of  limited  relevance.  Prior  to concluding on the presented analyses, a number of concerns were raised by the CHMP regarding the need to discuss on how the differences in the placebo group between GA1 and IFN1 subgroups could affect  the  interpretation  of  the  results  and  to  provide  information  regarding  treatment  duration  with IFN  or  GA  as  well  as  the  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  these  treatments  (e.g  lack  of  efficacy, tolerability issue).These concerns were adequately addressed by the MAH and therefore the CHMP was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of Gilenya in RRMS patients with high disease activity despite treatment with glatiramer acetate was favourable.

Whilst concerns were initially raised regarding the absence of data in patients previously treated with other MS drugs that recently became available (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab) or even  natalizumab,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  availability  of  new  treatment  alternatives  for  MS patients  with  efficacy  comparable  to  well-established  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  (GA) therapies,  thus  possibly  broadening  the  options  for  neurologists  at  treatment  initiation  or  in  case  of treatment  failure.  According  to  the  MAH,  because  of  the  wording  of  the  indication  as  currently approved, MS patients with high disease activity while being treated with IFN or GA can be switched to any approved DMT except fingolimod, a switch only possible for those failing IFN treatment. In the current situation, patients with high disease activity treated with new oral agents, Tecfidera (DMF) or Aubagio (teriflunomide), are not eligible for treatment with fingolimod (or natalizumab). Both products have demonstrated superiority to placebo but not to an active comparator. If these patients fail their prescribed  therapy  and  require  greater  efficacy,  they  must  undertake  an  additional  year  of  therapy with  IFN  (or  either  IFN  or  GA  for  natalizumab),  even  if  they  are  experiencing  the  effects  of  high disease activity before they could be prescribed fingolimod or natalizumab. However, there is currently no efficacy or safety data to support the clinical benefit of this mandatory step, while there is evidence that  ongoing  clinical  or  imaging  disease  activity  may  lead  to  irreversible  neurological  deficits  in  the long-term. The only alternative for potentially more efficacious treatment for these patients becomes de facto alemtuzumab (which has also demonstrated superiority to an active comparator), although there is similarly no efficacy or safety data to support this algorithm.

Given  the  current  situation  and  the  available  therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  the  CHMP considered that it would be unreasonable to expect separate data to be provided in patients treated with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs.  Taking  into  consideration  the  different  mechanisms  of  action  of fingolimod,  teriflunomide  and  dimethyl  fumarate,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  there  was  a reasonable  scientific  plausibility  in  the  assumption  that  even  if  treatment  with  teriflunomide  and/or dimethyl fumarate failed due to lack of efficacy, the treatment with fingolimod would be effective. In addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  possibility  to  introduce  potentially  more  effective  treatment earlier, without unnecessary testing of similar alternatives in terms of efficacy in a stepwise procedure, will be beneficial for patients.

Therefore  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  change  of  the  indication  to  reflect  the  possible therapeutic options for Gilenya, could be acceptable, provided that amendments in section 4.1 of the SmPC are made in line with the CHMP recommendations. The final recommended wording by the CHMP is as follows:

'Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:

- -Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.'

The CHMP also recommended the MAH to submit a proposal for gathering additional data on the safety and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT , including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab. This proposal was submitted as part of the risk management plan and was considered acceptable by the PRAC/CHMP (see 2.5).

## 2.3.4. Conclusions

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP concluded that the proposed change in the wording of the indication (section 4.1) were acceptable.

## 2.4. Clinical safety

The safety profile for fingolimod 0.5 mg has been characterized during the Phase III program and in the post marketing setting since its launch, including over 63,000 MS patients who have been exposed to fingolimod for a total of more than 73,000 patient-years as of DLP of February 2013. To support the proposed modification of the indication, the MAH presented safety analysis using the same studies as for  the  efficacy  analysis  (D2301,  D2309,  D2301). Study D2316 was also included in the analysis to support the safety profile of fingolimod in the extended population applied for.

Group GA1 = Patients previously treated with GA at any time in the 1 year prior to Screening.

od a   ui    (s ii  ae o ) i  pn inad sd = i dn Screening.

N' = number of patients in this subpopulation. All percentages use N' as the denominator.

Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency in the Group GA1 FTY720 0.5 mg arm.

A patient with multiple adverse events (AEs) within a preferred term is counted only once in the preferred term for that treatment.

Source: [SCS-Appendix 1-Table 1.1-2c, Table 1.1-2d]

In  study  2316,  adverse  events  were  reported  in  331  of  438  patients  (75.6%)  in  Group  GA1,  which could be possibly related to the shorter treatment period of 16 weeks compared to the other analysed studies. The highest incidence of patients with AEs was reported in the SOC infections and infestations, with  36.5%  of  patents  in  Group  GA1.  The  preferred  terms  with  the  highest  incidence  were nasopharyngitis (14.6%) and influenza (4.1%). Nervous system disorders were reported in 25.3% of patients,  with  11.6%  reporting  headache.  Other  commonly  reported  AEs  (preferred  terms)  were fatigue in 9.4% of patients and lymphopenia in 7.1% of patients.

Six deaths were reported during the study periods presented in this submission. Three  deaths were reported  in  study  2301,    1  patient  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  treatment  arm  and  2  patients  in  the placebo  arm,  none  of  these  patients  were  included  in  any  of  the  subpopulations  based  on  prior treatment. One patient in the placebo arm died on Day 269 (65 days after last dose) in study D2309. Two  deaths  were  reported,  both  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  arm  in  study  D2302.  One  patient  was included  in  Group  IFN1.  This  death  occurred  more  than  60  days  after  last  study  dose,  and  was attributed to Herpes simplex encephalitis, which began during study treatment following a course of high-dose corticosteroids for an MS relapse and was complicated by a delay in antiviral treatment. Two additional  patient  deaths  were  reported  after  the  database  lock.  In  study  D2316,  one  death  was reported in the fingolimod 0.5 mg arm of this single-arm study in a patient that was not included in the subpopulation presented.

## 2.4.2.4. Laboratory findings

Results of laboratory examinations for the individual subgroups were not included in this submission. The  safety  evaluation  between  the  subgroups  is  limited  to  the  AE  analyses  which  were  considered acceptable by the CHMP, taking into account that clinically significant laboratory abnormalities would be reported as AEs by the investigator and discussed in 2.4.2.2.

## 2.4.2.5. Safety in special population

No new analyses were performed in special populations to support to the present application.

## 2.4.2.6. Discontinuation due to adverse events

These are presented in Tables 22 and 23.

In  study  2316,  AEs  resulting  in  study  drug  discontinuation  were  reported  in  a  similar  proportion  of patients in Group GA1 and the overall population, with the highest incidence in the investigations SOC due to liver enzyme abnormalities.

## 2.4.2.7. Additional data

During the evaluation, the MAH presented additional data on switching from natalizumab to fingolimod from post-marketing experience and clinical trial (study D2324). According to the MAH, about 10 to 15% of all fingolimod-treated  patients  had  previously  been  treated  and  switched  from  natalizumab. The  post-marketing  data  did  not  show  any  increased  reporting  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  in patients  who  switched  from  natalizumab  to  fingolimod.  In  particular,  there  is  no  pattern  of  any increase for any type of potential opportunistic infections with the exception of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Few patients were reported with PML within the first months of switching from natalizumab to fingolimod, during fingolimod treatment. These cases of PML were attributed to previous natalizumab treatment.

Study  D2324  investigated  disease  control  and  safety  in  patients  switching  from  natalizumab  to fingolimod after different washout periods (8, 12, and 16 weeks). Although the study was terminated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

early (n = 142 instead of n = 600) based on the publication of data after the start of this study, that addressed the return of MS disease after stopping the treatment with natalizumab, it contains useful information regarding the optimal interval of switching from natalizumab to fingolimod with respect to both risk of disease recurrence (disease control) and overall safety. Switching to fingolimod after 16 weeks washout was associated with notably higher disease activity on MRI when compared to 8 to 12 weeks  washout.  The  reported  results  did  not  demonstrate  substantial  difference  between  washout period of 8 or 12 weeks in terms of efficacy or safety parameters. However, patients in the 8 weeks washout group had lower mean number of active T2 lesions (primary objective; 8 weeks - 1.9, 12 weeks - 4.1 and 16 weeks - 7.7) when adjusted for the observational period. Similarly, changes in key secondary variables had tendency for a better outcome in a group with 8 weeks washout period. The mean number (SD) of active (new or newly enlarging)  T2  lesions,  adjusted  for  the  duration  of  the washout period, was the lowest in the 8 weeks group (0.4 [2.71]), followed by the 12 weeks group (2.1 [11.15]) and the highest in the 16 weeks group (3.6 [7.54]). The mean number (SD) of active (new or newly enlarging) T2 lesions during the first 8 weeks of fingolimod treatment was the lowest in the 8 weeks group (1.5 [4.56]), followed by the 12 weeks group (2.1 [5.50]) and the highest in the 16 weeks group (4.2 [10.24]). Overall, the least MRI activity was seen in patients who had a washout period of 8 weeks. More patients switching to fingolimod within less than 16 weeks remained relapsefree. Most relapses occurred between 4 and 5 months after discontinuation of natalizumab. There were no  unusually  severe  relapses.  No  new  safety  or  tolerability  signals  emerged  from  this  study. Particularly, there was no difference in AE profile, SAE, or discontinuation rates between the various washout groups. The infection rates, types of infections and severe infections did not notably differ between  groups  and  there  were  no  differences  compared  to  the  established  safety  profile  of fingolimod. There was no difference across groups with respect to abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). There was no case of PML or death.

Literature data (F. Rinaldi et al., 2012, MSJ, 18 (11) 1640-1643) also reported disease reactivation in 11 out of 22 patients switched to fingolimod after 3 months washout period.

## 2.4.3. Discussion

In  pooled  studies  D2301/D2309,  the  safety  data  reported  in  Groups  GA1  and  IFN1  were  generally consistent with the known fingolimod safety profile. The most commonly reported SOC were 'infections and infestations', 'nervous system disorders' and 'gastro-intestinal disorders'. The overall incidence of patients  with  SAEs  was  low,  but  was    slightly  higher  in  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  0.5  mg compared  to  placebo  in  both  pooled  Group  GA1    (19.7%  vs    15.6%)  and  Group  IFN1  (12.9%  vs 11.5%).

The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  Group  GA1  across  treatment  arms,  including  the  placebo  arm compared to Group IFN1 and the overall pooled safety population. The frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  low,  but  consistently  slightly  higher  in  patients  treated  with fingolimod  0.5  mg  compared  to  placebo  across  both  Groups  GA1  and  IFN1.  Similar  to  SAEs,  the incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was slightly higher across the fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo arms in Group GA1 compared to Group IFN1. Of the 6 deaths reported for the studies included in this application, none occurred on fingolimod 0.5 mg, and one death in Group IFN1 with fingolimod 1.25 mg dose, more than 60 days after last study dose was attributed to Herpes simplex encephalitis, which began during study participation.

Some specific AEs that were reported more commonly in MS patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg than in placebo-treated patients were: infections (nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, herpes infections), liver enzyme elevations (most often reported as increases in ALT and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)), lymphopenia,  hypertension,  respiratory  AEs  (primarily  driven  by  cough).  No  increases  in  neoplasms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(overall) were seen in the comparison of fingolimod 0.5 mg to placebo for Group GA1 or Group IFN1. No  cases  of  macular  edema  were  reported  in  fingolimod  0.5  mg  treated  patients  in  Group  GA1  or Group IFN1. There was an increase in the incidence of migraine with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo  in  both  subpopulations,  which  was  more  pronounced  in  Group  IFN1,  however  at  a  lower incidence overall in this subpopulation compared to Group GA1. Vascular disorder events were more frequent in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to placebo in both Group GA1 and Group IFN1.  This  was  primarily  driven  by  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  hypertension,  a  known  side effect of fingolimod. The difference was more pronounced in Group GA1 due to a considerably lower incidence of hypertension in the placebo arm in GA1 (1.1%) than in Group IFN1 (5.1%). More cases of BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) were reported on fingolimod 0.5 mg (4 patients; 2.2%) than on placebo (1 patient; 0.6%) in Group IFN1; in Group GA1 more cases of BCC were reported on placebo (3 patents; 3.3%)  than  on  fingolimod  0.5  mg  (1  patient;  1.3%).  Non-BCC  skin  malignancies  were  rare  in  all subpopulations and were too infrequent to draw meaningful conclusions.

Overall, slight increases in some specific AEs were observed in Group IFN1 (lymphopenia, headache, diarrhea) and  in Group  GA1  (cardiac events driven by higher incidence of palpitation AEs, hypertension,  nausea,  respiratory  disorders).  Isolated  seizure  events  were  reported  in  all  treatment arms in Group GA1, without evidence of a dose response or a particular seizure type predominating. However these specific AEs are consistent with the known safety profile of fingolimod. The presented safety  analyses  did  not  suggest  any  clinically-relevant  differences  in  the  comparisons  of  Group  GA1 and  Group  IFN1.  Rates  of  WBC  decrease  reported  as  AEs  overall  were  comparable  between  the fingolimod 0.5 mg arms in Groups IFN1 and GA1. Bradycardia was rarely reported (0-1 patient in the fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo arms in Groups GA1 and IFN1). There were no reports of atrioventricular (AV) blocks in Group GA1, and only rare reports of first-degree AV block in Group IFN1 reported (2-3 patients in the fingolimod 0.5 mg or placebo arms).

As mentioned by the MAH, for study D2302, the number of patients in Group GA1 was small. There was also a considerable imbalance in the number of patients in the fingolimod 0.5 mg and IFN-β1a arms,  in  both  the  Group  GA1  and  IFN1  subpopulations,  making  difficult  the  interpretation  of  the analysis.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  findings  were  consistent  with  the  safety  data  from  the  pooled studies  and  therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  these  data  as  supportive  of  the  safety  profile  in  the analysed populations, ie patients previously treated with IFN and GA.

As compared to IFN and GA, the safety profile of other DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab) in the MS population, is less known and safety information regarding switching from another first line DMT is limited. During the evaluation, the MAH proposed to maintain their proposed indication by introducing different levels of risk minimisation regarding certain DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, alemtuzumab),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic  and  safety  profiles.  Because alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects and the actual duration of these effects  is  unknown,  the  MAH  proposed  to  not  recommend  initiating  treatment  with  Gilenya  after alemtuzumab  unless  the  benefits  of  such  treatment  clearly  outweigh  the  risks  for  the  individual patient. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP also agreed that the additional data presented for the switching from natalizumab supported the existing SmPC warning in section 4.4 that concomitant immune  effects, could occur for up to 2-3 months following discontinuation of natalizumab. For the other DMTs, the proposal for risk minimisations were also considered acceptable, provided amendments are made in section of the SmPC in line with the CHMP recommendations (see 2.6). The CHMP also recommended the MAH to submit a proposal for gathering additional data on the safety and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, prior to final conclusions are made on this variation. This proposal was submitted as part of the risk management plan and was considered acceptable by the PRAC/CHMP (see 2.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Conclusions

On the basis of the available data, the CHMP concluded that the proposed warnings (section 4.4) to support the proposed change in the indication (section 4.1), were acceptable (see 2.6).

## 2.4.5. PSUR cycle

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and following the update of the RMP (version 7.3), was of the opinion that the PSUR cycle should remain unchanged.

## 2.5. Risk management plan

During the evaluation, the CHMP agreed with the introduction of different levels of risk minimisation regarding certain DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, alemtuzumab) as discussed in detailed above. In addition the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a proposal (e.g registry) for systematically gathering additional data on the safety and efficacy of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab.

Subsequently, the MAH submitted an updated RMP, version 7.1 to address the above recommendations.

The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan.

## PRAC Advice

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 7.1 the PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for fingolimod (GILENYA) in the treatment of highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in

- adult patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon disease modifying agent. These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon with a disease modifying agent. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium enhancing lesion. A 'nonresponder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year;

or

- adult patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI;

is acceptable. The following point should be taken into account with the next update:

- The MAH proposed as additional pharmacovigilance studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gilenya in patients switching from other disease modifying agents to amend the protocol for the on-going post-authorisation safety study FTY720D2406. The MAH should submit an updated protocol taking into account the comments (amendment of inclusion criteria: patients switching from disease modifying therapies to fingolimod, study objectives, statistical analysis plan) together with sample size calculation based on assumptions regarding the number of patients expected in each newly defined group.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed postauthorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC also considered that the MAH should submit an updated protocol FTY720D2406 taking into account the comments (amendment of inclusion criteria: patients switching from disease modifying therapies to fingolimod, study objectives, statistical analysis plan) together with sample size calculation based on assumptions regarding the number of patients expected in each newly defined group.

The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes and also recommended to include separate analyses according  to  the  type  of  therapy  previously  used  (teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab, natalizumab) in the updated protocol for study FTY720D2406.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  the  MAH  proposed  to  upgrade  'hypersensitivity'  from  'potential'  to  'identified'  risk  to comply with the latest PRAC recommendation on the PSUR (April 2014) in an updated version 7.3 of the RMP. The CHMP considered version 7.3 acceptable.

## 2.6. Update of the product information

The MAH initially proposed the following changes to the Product Information (new text=underlined, deleted text= strikethrough):

## Summary of the Product Characteristics

## · Section 4.1

Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:

-  Patients  with  high  disease  activity  despite  treatment  with  a  disease  modifying  therapy  betainterferon.

These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course (normally at least one year of treatment) of a disease modifying therapy interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions  in  cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gadolinium-enhancing  lesion.  A  'non-responder'  could  also  be defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as compared to the previous year.

or

-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

During the procedure, the MAH proposed to introduce different levels of risk minimisation regarding certain  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide,  alemtuzumab),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic and safety profiles as discussed in detailed above, (new text=underlined, deleted text= strikethrough):

## · Section 4.2

Patients can switch directly from beta interferon or glatiramer acetate to Gilenya provided there are no signs of relevant treatment-related abnormalities, e.g. neutropenia.

## · Section 4.4

Prior treatment with immunosuppressants

When switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to Gilenya, the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy must be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the risk of disease reactivation. A CBC is recommended prior to initiating Gilenya to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved.

Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl  fumarateto  Gilenya,  a  washout  is  not  necessary,  assuming  any  immune  effects  (i.e. cytopenia) of such therapies have resolved.

Due  to  the  long  half-life  of  natalizumab,  elimination  usually  takes  concomitant  exposure,  and  thus concomitant immune effects, could occur for up to 2-3 months following discontinuationnatalizumab if

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Gilenya  was  immediately  started.  Therefore  caution  is  required  when  switching  patients  from natalizumab  to  Gilenya.  Teriflunomide  is  also  eliminated  slowly  from  the  plasma.  Without  an accelerated  elimination  procedure,  clearance  of  teriflunomide  from  plasma  can  take  from  several months up to 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure is defined in the teriflunomide summary of product  characteristics.  Caution  regarding  potential  concomitant  immune  effects  is  required  when switching patients from natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya.

Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these effects  is  unknown, initiating  treatment with Gilenya after alemtuzumab is not recommended unless the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient.When switching from other immunosuppressive medications, the duration and mode of action of such substances must be considered when initiating Gilenya to avoid additive immune suppressive effects.

The CHMP, having considered the above, made the following recommendations:

-  The  wording of the indication (section 4.1) should state 'despite treatment with at least one DMT therapy' because of the safety profile of Gilenya.

- The deletion of section 4.2 is considered acceptable;

- The MAH proposed to start treatment with fingolimod directly after dimethyl fumarate discontinuation based on a short half life of its active metabolite MMF. However, lymphocytes count in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate is decreased by &lt;30% and increase of lymphocyte count is observed only four weeks after stopping the drug, albeit not returning to baseline levels. Having in mind that fingolimod also  reduces  lymphocytes  count  (reduction  to  20-30%  of  baseline)  though  likely  due  to  another mechanism, it would be recommended to reconsider the duration of washout period. The duration of washout period allowing recovery of the CBC counts might be appropriate. Recommendations should take into consideration the CBC counts following discontinuation of dimethyl fumarate treatment and prior to initation of fingolimod treatment;

- The MAH did not provide clear recommendations for the washout period for teriflunomide except of pointing to very long elimination period (up to 2 years). In MS patients, the median half life (t1/2z) was approximately 19 days after repeated doses of 14 mg of teriflunomide. If a decision is made to stop treatment with Aubagio, during the interval of 5 half-lives (approximately 3.5 months although may  be  longer  in  some  patients),  starting  other  therapies  will  result  in  concomitant  exposure  to Aubagio.  This  may  lead  to  an  additive  effect  on  the  immune  system  and  caution  is,  therefore, indicated, especially since fingolimod can even further reduce white blood cell counts. Having in mind that  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  teriflunomide  on  white  blood  cell  counts  (reduction  of  WBC  count &lt;15%) might be even further exagerated if fingolimod is introduced within the period shorter than 3.5 months  after  teriflunomide  discontinuation,  more  clear  recommendations  on  duration  of  washout period based on pharmacokinetic data as well as white blood cells counts should be made.

The final wording recommended by the CHMP and agreed with the MAH for sections 4.1 and 4.4 is as follows:

## · Section 4.1

Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:

Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course (normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions  in  cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gadolinium-enhancing  lesion.  A  'non-responder'  could  also  be defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe  relapses,  as compared to the previous year.

or

Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

## · Section 4.4

## Infections

[…]

Before initiating treatment with Gilenya, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also recommended periodically  during  treatment,  at  month 3  and  at  least  yearly  thereafter,  and  in  case  of  signs  of infection. Absolute lymphocyte count &lt;0.2x109/l, if confirmed, should lead to treatment interruption until  recovery,  because  in  clinical  studies,  fingolimod  treatment  was  interrupted  in  patients  with absolute lymphocyte count &lt;0.2x10 9 /l.

[…]

## Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies

There have been no studies performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gilenya when switching patients from teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab treatment to Gilenya. When switching patients  from  another  disease  modifying  therapy  to  Gilenya,  the  half-life  and  mode  of  action  of  the other therapy must be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the risk of disease reactivation. A CBC is recommended prior to initiating Gilenya to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved.

Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon or glatiramer acetate.

For dimethyl fumarate, the washout period should be sufficient for CBC to recover before treatment with Gilenya is started.

Due  to  the  long  half-life  of  natalizumab,  elimination  usually  takes  up  to  2-3 months  following discontinuation.  Teriflunomide  is  also  eliminated  slowly  from  the  plasma.  Without  an  accelerated elimination  procedure,  clearance  of  teriflunomide  from  plasma  can  take  from  several  months  up  to 2 years.  An  accelerated  elimination  procedure  as  defined  in  the  teriflunomide  summary  of  product characteristics is recommended or alternatively washout period should not be shorter than 3.5 months. Caution  regarding  potential  concomitant  immune  effects  is  required  when  switching  patients  from natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya.

Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these effects  is  unknown, initiating  treatment with Gilenya after alemtuzumab is not recommended unless the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient.

## Package Leaflet

The  Package  Leaflet  initially  proposed  an  update  in  section  1  of  the  Package  Leaflet.  Following additional updates in section 4.4 of the SmPC, sections 2 and 3 were also amended in line with the SmPC. The final recommended wording by the CHMP is as follows:

## · Section 1

## What Gilenya is used for

Gilenya is used in adults to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), more specifically in: Patients who have failed to respond despite treatment with an MS treatment.

or

Patients who have rapidly evolving severe MS.

Gilenya does not cure MS, but it helps to reduce the number of relapses and to slow down the progression of physical disabilities due to MS.

## · Section 2

## Other medicines and Gilenya

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:

- Medicines that suppress or modulate the immune system , including other medicines used to treat MS , such as beta interferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, teriflumomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab. You must not use Gilenya together with such medicines as this could intensify the effect on the immune system (see also 'Do not take Gilenya').
- Section 3

Your doctor may switch you directly from beta interferon, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate to Gilenya if there are no signs of abnormalities caused by your previous treatment. Your doctor may have to do a blood test in order to exclude such abnormalities. After stopping natalizumab you may have to wait for 2-3 months before starting treatment with Gilenya. To switch from teriflunomide, your doctor may advise you to wait for a certain time or to go through an accelerated elimination procedure. If you have been treated with alemtuzumab, a thorough evaluation and discussion with your doctor is required to decide if Gilenya is appropriate for you.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

## 3.1.1. Beneficial effects

Post-hoc analyses in patients previously treated with glatiramer acetate in the year prior to treatment with fingolimod showed beneficial effects of fingolimod 0.5 mg consistent with the effects of fingolimod in  the  overall  study  populations  and  with  those  patients  previously  treated  with  beta-interferon  and subsequently treated with fingolimod.

In  pooled  studies  D2301/D2309,  post-hoc  results  showed  effects  in  favour  of  fingolimod  0.5  mg compared to placebo in all  subgroups  (failures  and  non-responders  patients  treated  with  glatiramer acetate  or  interferon-beta  at  any  time  in  the  year  prior  to  screening)  for  all  efficacy  variables  as measured by the ARR, proportion of relapse-free patients, disability and MRI parameters, although not all results were  statistically significant.

## 3.1.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

No  efficacy  data  are  available  in  patients  previously  treated  with  other  DMTs  (e.g  teriflunomide, dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab,  or  even  natalizumab)  prior  to  fingolimod  0.5  mg,  and  under  the current conditions in clinical practice it would be unreasonable to request such data to be provided for all the available drugs on the market.

In addition, limitations in the presented post-hoc analyses were noted (e.g inclusion of relatively small number of patients in treatment groups, overlap of the failures and non -responder definitions).

## 3.2. Risks

## 3.2.1. Unfavourable effects

Although the number of patients included in the analysis was small, the safety profile of fingolimod in patients  previously  treated  with  glatiramer  acetate  is  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  fingolimod  in patients  previously  treated  with  interferon  beta  and  generally  consistent  with  the  known  profile  of fingolimod.

## 3.2.2. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No safety data are available in patients previously treated with other DMTs (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate,  alemtuzumab)  prior  to  fingolimod  0.5  mg.  Given  the  long  lasting  immunosuppressant properties of these MS therapies, this raised a concern on the possible potentiation of immunosuppressive  activities  when  switching  between  these  drugs,  and  for  that  reason  detailed recommendations, on how this should be done in clinical practice, were introduced in the SmPC. The CHMP  recommended  different levels of risk minimisation regarding the different DMTs  (e.g teriflunomide,  alemtuzumab,  dimethyl  fumarate),  based  on  their  pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Such measures were considered adequate to ensure safe and effective use in the proposed indication.

## 3.3. Benefit-risk balance

## 3.3.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The efficacy  of  Gilenya  in  patients  switching  from  glatiramer  acetate  treatment  is  supported  by  the available data. No new safety signal emerged and the overall safety profile of Gilenya is considered acceptable in this population. Due to safety concerns, Gilenya (fingolimod) was originally restricted to high  disease  activity  and  for  one  part  of  the  indication  after  failure  to  interferon-beta,  similarly  to Tysabri, and the indication of the latter has been updated to include RRMS patients with high disease activity who failed to respond to glatiramer acetate.

Whilst concerns were initially raised regarding the absence of data in patients previously treated with other MS drugs that recently became available (e.g teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab) or even  natalizumab,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  availability  of  new  treatment  alternatives  for  MS patients  with  efficacy  comparable  to  well-established  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  (GA) therapies,  thus  possibly  broadening  the  options  for  neurologists  at  treatment  initiation  or  in  case  of treatment  failure.  The  CHMP  also  considered  that  given  the  current  situation  and  the  available therapeutic options in clinical practice, it would be unreasonable to expect separate data to be provided in  patients  treated  with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs.  Taking  into  consideration  the  different mechanisms of action of fingolimod, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate, the CHMP was of the view

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that  there  was  a  reasonable  scientific  plausibility  in  the  assumption  that  even  if  treatment  with teriflunomide and/or dimethyl fumarate failed due to lack of efficacy, the treatment with fingolimod would be effective. In addition, the CHMP considered that the possibility to introduce potentially more effective treatment earlier, without unnecessary testing of similar alternatives in terms of efficacy in a stepwise procedure, will be beneficial for patients. The CHMP therefore concluded that the currently approved wording of the indication was not reflecting the possible therapeutic options for Gilenya and should be amended accordingly.

Additionally, as part of supplementary measures to ensure the effective and safe use of the product in the intended indication, data on the efficacy and safety of Gilenya treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with at least one DMT, including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, are to be collected as part of an ongoing long term study.

## 3.3.2. Benefit-risk balance

The overall benefit-risk balance of Gilenya is positive for the following indication:

'Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:

- -Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of at least one disease modifying therapy. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A 'non-responder' could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year.

or

- -Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.'
