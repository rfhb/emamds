## I. INTRODUCTION

On 2010-12-16 the MAH submitted completed paediatric studies for Prevenar 13, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do influence the benefit risk for Prevenar13 and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## II.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

The formulation used in the studies was the same as the currently approved formulation.

## II.2 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted final reports for:

6096A1-3012 :  To  assess  the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13vPnC in children that have previously received 1 or 2 doses of Prevenar at approximately 3 or 3 and 5 months of age, when measured 1 month after the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC in each of 2 age groups in Sweden.

6096A1-3013 To  characterize  the  immune  response  by  ELISA  and  OPA  at  approximately  1  month after vaccination to a single dose of 13vPnC challenge in children vaccinated with a primary series (3 or  2  doses)  of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (9vPnC-meningococcal  serogroup  C)  followed  by  a booster dose of either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PcV) or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in Iceland.

## 2. Clinical studies

6096A1-3012 :  To  assess  the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13vPnC in children that have previously received 1 or 2 doses of Prevenar at approximately 3 or 3 and 5 months of age, when measured 1 month after the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC in each of 2 age groups in Sweden.

-  Description
-  Methods
-  Objective(s)

The primary objective of this study was to assess the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC)  when  measured  1  month  after  the  last  scheduled dose  of  13vPnC  in  each  of  2  age  groups.  The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the pneumococcal immune response induced by 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant dose of 13vPnC in group 1. The safety objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

-  Study design

This was an open-label, multicenter study in which all subjects were enrolled into 1 of 2 groups based on age. The immunogenicity of 13vPnC was evaluated in children who had previously received 1 or 2 doses of Prevenar. A 2+1 vaccination schedule was followed with vaccinations at 3, 5, and 12 months of age. The study included 2 groups:

Blood samples for group 1 were to be obtained at approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the 13vPnC infant dose, prior to the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. For

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group  2,  blood  samples  were  to  be  collected  immediately  before  vaccination  and  approximately  1 month  (28  to  42  days)  after  vaccination.  Blood  samples  from  all  subjects  were  to  be  tested  for serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies elicited by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) present in 13vPnC.

-  Study population /Sample size

This  was  a  descriptive  study  and  was  not  powered  for  formal  statistical  comparisons.  Based  on previous experience, 115 subjects per group to provide 100 evaluable subjects per group was to be sufficient to provide adequate precision in study results for descriptive assessment.

Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects were eligible to be enrolled in this study if they were healthy infants;  were  available  for  the  entire  study  period;  and  if  their  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  could  be reached by telephone and were able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

Main  Criteria  for  Exclusion: Exclusion  criteria  included:  previous  vaccination  with  licensed  or investigational  pneumococcal  vaccine  other  than  Prevenar;  contraindication  to  vaccination  with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; previous anaphylactic reaction or allergy to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component; bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate  intramuscular  injection;  history  of  culture-proven  invasive  disease  caused  by  S pneumoniae; known or suspected immune deficiency or immune suppression; major known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder; significant neurologic disorder or history of seizure, including febrile  seizure,  or  significant  stable  or  evolving  disorders  such  as  cerebral  palsy,  encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, or other significant disorder; received blood products or gamma globulin during the last 3  months;  participation  in  another  interventional  or  investigational  trial,  although  participation  in purely observational studies was acceptable; direct descendant (eg, child or grandchild) of the study site  personnel;  any  major  illness  or  condition  that,  in  the  investigator's  judgment,  would  have substantially increased the risk associated with the subject's participation in, and completion of, the study, or could have precluded the evaluation of the subject's response.

##  Treatments

Group 1: Subjects were aged ≥140 to ≤196 days and were to receive 2 doses of 13vPnC at 5 and 12 months of age. These subjects had received a single dose of Prevenar at approximately 3 months of age prior to enrollment in the study.

Group 2: Subjects were aged ≥336 to ≤392 days and were to receive 1 dose of 13vPnC at 12 months of  age.  These  subjects  had  received  Prevenar  at  approximately  3  and  5  months  of  age  prior  to enrollment in the study. Thus, subjects continued on a 2+1 vaccination schedule (3, 5, and 12-month).

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity Assessment Methods: Blood samples for group 1 were obtained at approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the 13vPnC infant dose, prior to the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 42  days)  after  the  toddler  dose.  For  group  2,  blood  samples  were  collected  immediately  before vaccination and approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after vaccination. For all blood samples, serum concentrations (μg/mL) of anticapsular IgG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).

Safety Assessment Methods: Safety assessment was based on e-diary recordings of local reactions (redness,  swelling,  and  tenderness)  and  systemic  events  (decreased  appetite,  irritability,  increased sleep, decreased sleep, temperature, and use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms) for 7 days after each vaccination. AEs were also monitored during the study. For any reactions that persisted at day 7, the e-diary prompted the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on a daily basis regarding the status of the reaction until the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) recorded an end date in the e-diary.

##  Statistical Methods

Analysis Populations: For immunogenicity analyses, 2 analysis populations were defined: evaluable and all-available  immunogenicity  populations.  The  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  was  the  primary immunogenicity population.

To  be  included  in  an  evaluable  immunogenicity  population,  the  subject  was  eligible,  within  the  age range for the administered dose (infant or toddler), received study vaccine at all expected doses, had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blood  drawn  within  the  protocol  specified  time  frames,  had  at  least  1  valid  and  determinate  assay result for the proposed analysis, and had no other major protocol violations.

All  subjects  meeting  these  criteria  were  included.  To  be  included  in  an  all-available  immunogenicity population, a subject was to have at least 1 valid and determinate assay result related to the proposed analysis.

All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine were included in the safety population. Separate safety populations were defined for each vaccination: dose 1 and dose 2 (group 1) and all vaccinated subjects (group 2). Subjects who lacked any safety data for a particular vaccination were excluded from that analysis.

Immunogenicity: The primary endpoint for each of the serotypes was the IgG antibody concentration after the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC in each group. The geometric mean IgG concentrations and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each group following the last scheduled dose. The proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL measured 1 month after the infant dose of 13vPnC in group 1 was a secondary endpoint.

The pneumococcal IgG serotype antibody concentrations were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Within each age group and for each antibody concentration separately, geometric means of the  antibody  concentrations  from  each  of  the  blood  draws  were  calculated.  Two  (2)-sided,  95%  CI were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of  the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution.

To assess the within-subject post-vaccination and pre-vaccination differences in concentration for the last scheduled dose, the fold rise in geometric mean concentration (GMC) from pre-vaccination to postvaccination  and  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  estimated  for  each  age  group  using  the  logarithmically transformed assay results.

Safety: The safety endpoints were AEs, local reactions, and systemic events including fever and use of antipyretic medications. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher.

For  local  reactions  and  systemic  events,  including  fever  and  use  of  antipyretic  medications,  the duration  of  the  local  reaction/systemic  events  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics,  by  age group. The mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were presented along with the number of  unknown  durations.  Only  subjects  actually  experiencing  the  reaction/event  were  included  in  the summary statistics. Subjects with no reported reaction/event were included in the number of subjects with a known value.

The  minimum  and  maximum  diameters  for  redness  and  swelling  as  well  as  temperature  were summarized by age group using descriptive statistics. The mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard  deviation  were  presented.  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  in  each  category  of tenderness were summarized by age group. This tabulation was performed for each dose separately.

All AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The relationship between AEs and the study vaccine (13vPnC) was characterized as related or not related as described in the protocol. The severity of AEs was characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or lifethreatening. Any deaths were included in the last category, namely, life-threatening.

AE summaries were produced separately for each age group and for each vaccination. All summaries showed, by age group, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 event of each preferred  term,  arranged  by  system  organ  class,  and  the  number  of  occurrences  of  the  event. Separate summaries were produced for related AEs, for events characterized as severe, and for events characterized life-threatening.

SAEs (which included life-threatening events) were summarized for age group. A listing of SAEs was generated as an aid for the statistician during the clinical study report review.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 234 subjects were enrolled. Subjects in group 1 (N=118) were assigned to receive two doses of 13vPnC (infant and toddler dose) and subjects in group 2 (N=116) were assigned to receive a single dose of 13vPnC (toddler dose). All 118 subjects in group 1 received the infant vaccination. Two (2, 1.7%) subjects were withdrawn after the infant dose; 1 because of parent/legal guardian request and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 because of an AE. Thus, 116 (98.3%) subjects in group 1 received the toddler dose. All 116 subjects in group 2 received the toddler dose.

C. Confidence intervals (CIs) are back transformations of confidence levelsbased on the Student t distribution for the meanlogarithm of the concentrations.

When comparing the GMCs before and after vaccination with the toddler dose, the GMFRs for the 7 common serotypes ranged from 4.45 (serotype 14) to 11.49 (serotype 6B) for group 1 and from 4.17 (serotype 14) to 14.32 (serotype 6B) for group 2. For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMFRs ranged from  4.51  (serotype  3)  to  30.58  (serotype  1)  for  group  1  and  from  4.3  (serotype  5)  to  177.31 (serotype 7F) for group 2.

In group 1 for the infant dose, the proportion of subjects achieving an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL to the 7 serotypes in common with Prevenar ranged from 53.0% (serotype 6B) to 99.1% (serotypes 4 and 9V). The proportions of responders to the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 36.8% (serotype 6A) to 100.0% (serotype 3).

##  Safety results

Local  Reactions: After  the  infant  dose  in  group  1,  tenderness  was  reported  for  36.1%  of  subjects. Significant tenderness (defined as tenderness interfering with limb movement) was reported for only 3.0% of subjects. Swelling and redness were reported for 33.7% and 40.2% of subjects, respectively. Most reports of swelling and redness were mild (0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter) and none were severe (&gt;7.0 cm). The mean duration of both tenderness and redness was 1.5 days, while the mean duration of swelling was 3.4 days.

After the toddler dose, tenderness was reported for 59.6% of subjects in group 1 and for 52.7% of subjects  in  group  2.  Significant  tenderness  was  reported  for  ≤7.8%  of  subjects  in  either  group. Swelling was reported for 53.8% of subjects in group 1 and for 54.5% of subjects in group 2, while the incidence  of  redness  was  62.5%  in  group  1  and  59.3%  in  group  2.  Most  reports  of  swelling  and redness were mild, and none were severe. In group 1, the mean durations of tenderness, swelling, and redness, respectively, were 2.6, 4.7, and 2.4 days; and in group 2 the mean durations were 2.5, 4.8, and 2.4 days.

Systemic Events: After  the  infant  dose  in  group  1,  mild  fever  (≥38°C  but  ≤39°C)  was  reported  for 26.2% of subjects,  moderate  fever  (&gt;39°C  but  ≤40°C)  was  reported  for  2.0%  of  subjects,  and  no subjects reported severe fever (&gt;40°C). Use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms was  reported  for  35.2%  of  subjects.  Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  reported  type  of  systemic event  (80.7%  of  subjects),  followed  by  increased  sleep  (50.9%),  decreased  sleep  (39.3%),  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreased  appetite  (36.4%).  The  mean  duration  of  fever  (≥38°C  )  was  1.4  days,  while  the  mean duration of other types of systemic events ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 days.

After  the  toddler  dose,  the  incidence  of  mild  fever  was  31.3%  and  32.4% in  group  1  and  group  2, respectively; the incidence of moderate fever was 5.2% and 3.9%, and no subjects had severe fever. Antipyretic  medication  was  used  to  treat  or  prevent  symptoms  in  45.5%  and  44.9%  of  subjects  in group 1 and group 2, respectively. The incidence of other systemic events in group 1 and group 2, respectively, was 82.0% and 76.1% for irritability, 49.5% and 38.9% for increased sleep, 46.6% and 44.0% for decreased appetite, and 36.2% and 33.0% for decreased sleep. The mean duration of fever was 1.6 days and 1.7 days, respectively; and the mean duration of other systemic events ranged from 2.3 to 3.7 days in group 1 and from 2.2 to 3.3 days in group 2.

Adverse Events: In  general,  the types  of  unsolicited  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  the types of childhood illnesses  and  conditions  commonly occurring  in  this  age  group.  In  group  1,  AEs  occurring within 1 month after the infant dose were reported for 14 subjects (11.9%). The types of AEs reported most frequently were infections and infestations (8 subjects, 6.8%) and gastrointestinal disorders (3 subjects, 2.5%). The most frequent individual AEs reported during this period were nasopharyngitis (5 subjects, 4.2%) and diarrhea (2 subjects, 1.7%). All other AEs occurred in 1 subject each. Only 1 AE was considered related to study vaccine (mild diarrhea beginning on day 2). Between the postinfant series visit and the toddler dose, AEs were reported for 8 subjects (6.8%).

After the toddler dose, AEs were reported for 21.6% of subjects in group 1 and for 23.3% of subjects in group 2. The most frequent types of AEs were infections and infestations (14.7% in group 1; 13.8% in  group  2).  In  group  1,  the  most  frequently  reported  individual  AEs  (≥3%  of  subjects)  were nasopharyngitis  (6.9%),  vomiting  (5.2%),  and  pyrexia  (3.4%);  and  in  group  2,  nasopharyngitis (6.0%) and pyrexia (3.4%). After the toddler dose, 5 AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported  for  3  subjects  in  group  1  (diarrhea  and  vomiting;  nasopharyngitis  and  cough;  and  lower extremity mass) and 1 subject in group 2 (rash). The lower extremity mass was described as a \"nontender lump on the left leg.\"

One serious AE (SAE) was reported within 1 month after the infant dose (severe diarrhea lasting 6 days,  considered  not  related  to  study  vaccine).  Between  the  postinfant  series  visit  and  the  toddler dose, 6 SAEs were reported for 4 subjects; these included gastroenteritis (in 4 subjects), foreign body, and intussusception. After the toddler dose, 4 SAEs were reported for 1 subject: bronchitis, asthma, diarrhea, and vomiting. There were no deaths during the study. One subject was withdrawn from the study on day 194 due to severe eczema (not considered related to study vaccine).

Assessor's comment on study 6096A1-3012: The immunogenicity results of this study show that the responses to the 7vPnC vaccine serotypes were very similar between the two groups. Group 1, which received the 13vPnC vaccine for the 5- and 12-month doses had higher GMCs to some of the additional serotypes (1, 5, 6A and 7F) compared with group 2, which received the 13vPnC vaccine for the 12month  dose  only.  Group  2  had  higher  GMCs  for  serotype  19A  than  group  1.  No  OPA  results  were available for this study, but it is likely that the response to 19A in group 2 to some degree consists of non-functional antibodies.  No  new  safety  concerns  arise  from this  study.  Overall, the  responses  are acceptable, and do not conflict with what has been demonstrated in other studies previously.

6096A1-3013 To  characterize  the  immune  response  by  ELISA  and  OPA  at  approximately  1  month after vaccination to a single dose of 13vPnC challenge in children vaccinated with a primary series (3 or  2  doses)  of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (9vPnC-meningococcal  serogroup  C)  followed  by  a booster dose of either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PcV) or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in Iceland.

infant series (2- or 3-dose schedule) of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) followed by a toddler dose of either PCV or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS).

The secondary objectives of this study were as follows:

-  To  describe  the  immune  response  by  avidity  assay  to  a  single  dose  of  13vPnC  in  children previously vaccinated with a primary infant series (2- or 3-dose schedule) of PCV followed by a toddler dose of either PCV or 23vPS.
-  To  describe  the  kinetics  of  the  immune  response  over  the  entire  observation  period  after  a single dose of 13vPnC in children previously vaccinated with a primary infant series (2- or 3dose schedule) of PCV followed by a toddler dose of either PCV or 23vPS.

The safety objective of this study was as follows:

-  To evaluate the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  (AEs),  and  solicited  local  and  systemic  reactions  in  the  2 vaccine treatment groups.

The results from the infant series and toddler dose analyses are presented in a separate study report (CSR-54901).

-  Study design

Study 6096A1-3013 was a phase 3, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 13vPnC in healthy children in Iceland who had participated in study D139-P506. These subjects  had  previously  received  a  primary  infant  series  of  9-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate, meningococcal group C saccharide conjugate combination vaccine (9vPnC-MnCC; includes polysaccharides of serotypes 1, 4, 5 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F; referred to in this study as PCV) in a  2-  or  3-dose  schedule  followed  by  a  toddler  dose  of  either  PCV  or  23vPS  (ie,  PCV/PCV  or PCV/23vPS). A minimum of 100 subjects from study D139-P506 (50 subjects each from the PCV and 23vPS toddler dose groups) were to enroll in study 6096A1-3013 and were to receive a childhood dose of 13vPnC (ie, vaccine sequence PCV/PCV/13vPnC or PCV/23vPS/13vPnC).

-  Study population /Sample size

Main Criteria for Inclusion and exclusion:

Subjects were enrolled in the study if they satisfied all of the following inclusion criteria:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participated in study D139-P506 and received all study vaccinations (infant series and toddler dose) as specified  in  the  protocol;  and,  were  healthy  children  as  determined  by  medical  history,  physical examination, and judgment of the investigator.

Subjects  were  excluded  from  participation  in  the  study  if  they  met  any  of  the  following  exclusion criteria:

known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) or  13vPnC;  history  of  culture-proven  invasive  disease  caused  by  S  pneumoniae;  known  or suspected immune deficiency or suppression (including but not limited to: HIV infection, malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy, sickle cell hemoglobinopathy, diabetes); receipt of concomitant vaccination during study period; receipt of immunoglobulin within the previous 3 months; any medical condition  that  would,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  substantially  increase  the  subject's  risk associated with participation and completion of the study or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives or subject's response; or, receipt of 23vPS or 7vPnC since the completion of study D139P506.

The sample size for this study was limited by the number of subjects who participated in the original study D139-P506 (CSR-54901; N=224) and the ability to recruit eligible subjects from that study. A minimum of 100 subjects from study D139-P506 were to be enrolled (50 subjects each from the PCV and 23vPS toddler dose groups). However, if it  was  not  possible to enroll  the  minimum  number  of subjects within the 6 month enrollment period, then the analysis was to be performed with the number of subjects enrolled at the end of the 6 months.

##  Treatments

Each subject was to receive 1 dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC following enrollment.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

## Pneumococcal Antibody Response

Blood samples were to be obtained from all subjects before 13vPnC administration at visit 1 and at visit  3  (28-42  days  after  13vPnC  administration).  A  second  optional  blood  draw  at  day  5-7  after 13vPnC  administration  was  planned  in  order  to  describe  the  kinetics  of  the  immune  response. Immunogenicity was to be assessed by ELISA, OPA, and avidity assays.

## Safety

The safety parameters included reactogenicity, local reactions and systemic events that occurred for a total  of  4  days  (day  of  13vPnC  administration  [day  0]  and  days  1  through  3  after  13vPnC administration),  and  AEs  that  occurred  from  consent  to  completion  of  the  study  at  visit  3  (day  28 through day 42 after 13vPnC administration).

##  Statistical Methods

The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35μg/mL by ELISA and the proportion of subjects achieving a titer ≥1:8 by OPA for each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  at  visit  3  (28-42  days  after  vaccine  administration).  Two additional endpoints were added to further evaluate response. These were the proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG antibody concentration ≥1.0μg/mL by ELISA and the proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥ lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ).

Immunogenicity was also evaluated by avidity assay as a secondary endpoint. The assay performed to measure avidity had a measurable range of 0.117 to 7.5 units. In accordance with the recommendation of the lab performing the assays, values above the upper limit were assigned a value of  8.0  and  those  below  the  lower  limit  were  assigned  a  value  of  0.10.  Results  were  expressed  as avidity index (AI). The AI was provided for each of the following 5 pneumococcal serotypes: 1, 5, 6B, 19F, and 23F.

The kinetics  of  the  immune  response  following  13vPnC  administration  were  described  based  on  the antibody levels over time as assessed by IgG ELISA, OPA, and avidity assays.

The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG  antibody  concentration  ≥1.0  μg/mL measured  1  month  after  the  last  scheduled  dose  of  13vPnC  was  also  calculated.  In  addition,  the proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ measured 1 month after the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC  was  calculated.  For  each  serotype,  exact,  unconditional,  2-sided  95%  confidence  intervals (CIs)  on  the  proportions  were  calculated.  To  assess  treatment  differences,  exact,  unconditional,  2sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions [23vPS/13vPnC - PCV/13vPnC] were calculated.

Within each vaccine group and for each antibody concentration or titer, geometric mean concentrations/titers  (GMCs/GMTs)  were  calculated.  The  geometric  mean  fold  rises  (GMFRs)  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antibody concentration/titers (postvaccination/prevaccination) were summarized by geometric means and 95% CIs,. With regard to OPA titers, for analysis purposes, titers below the LLOQ were set equal to  4  (one-half  the  limit  of  detection).  To  assess  differences  between  the  2  vaccine  groups,  2-sided, 95% CIs for the ratio of the GMCs and the GMTs were constructed. In addition, the ratio of the GMFRs and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were  calculated.  The  CIs  were  computed  using  the  Student  t distribution for the mean difference of the measures on the logarithmic scale (23vPS/13vPnC relative to PCV/13vPnC).

The  safety  endpoints  were  AEs,  local  reactions,  and  systemic  events,  including  fever.  Fever  was defined as an oral temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F). Use of antipyretic medication to treat and prevent symptoms was reported with systemic events but analyzed separately. The proportion of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported on any day within the 4-day period after vaccination was summarized for each type of event.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A  total  of  89  eligible  subjects  from  study  D139-P506  consented  to  participate  and  received  a subsequent  13vPnC  dose  as  part  of  vaccine  sequence  9vPnC-MnCC  (primary  series)/23vPS  (toddler dose)/13vPnC or 9vPnC-MnCC  (primary series)/PCV (9vPnC-MnCC; toddler dose)/13vPnC; for convenience, these groups are described as '23vPS/13vPnC' and 'PCV/13vPnC' groups.

##  Immunogenicity results

At  1  month  after  vaccination,  the  proportion  of  responders  achieving  a  serotype-specific  IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL was ≥97% in both vaccine groups for all 13 serotypes (Table 9-3). IgG GMCs were higher in the PCV/13vPnC group than in the 23vPS/13vPnC group for all serotypes except serotype  3  (Table  9-5).  The  GMC  ratios  (23vPS/13vPnC  relative  to  PCV/13vPnC)  were  1.14  for serotype 3, and for all other serotypes ranged from 0.27 (serotype 1) to 0.89 (serotype 7F). The upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio was &lt;1.0 for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 9V, 18C, and 23F, indicating a statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vaccine  groups  for  these  6  serotypes.  For  the 23vPS/13vPnC group, GMFRs from before vaccination to 1 month after vaccination ranged from 1.83 (serotype 3) to 7.87 (serotype 7F); in the PCV/13vPnC group GMFRs ranged from 1.88 (serotype 19F) to 6.9 (serotype 14), except for serotype 1 (GMFR = 25.51) and serotype 4 (GMFR = 26.07).

In  the  23vPS/13vPnC group, adjusted GMAs ranged from 1.50 (serotype 1) to 3.44 (serotype 23F), while in the PCV/13vPnC group, adjusted GMAs ranged from 2.39 (serotype 19F) to 5.35 (serotype 23F). The ratios of GMAs ranged from 0.34 (serotype 1) to 0.93 (serotype 19F).

##  Safety results

Local  Reactions:  The  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  any  local  reaction  was  similar  in  the 23vPS/13vPnC group (90.0%) and the PCV/13vPnC group (87.2%). The incidences of local reactions were  generally  similar  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  and  PCV/13vPnC  groups,  respectively,  for  tenderness (88.0%,  76.9%),  redness  (50.0%,  66.7%),  and  swelling  (44.0%,  59.0%),  and  there  were  no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of any type of local reaction. Significant tenderness was reported for 12.0% of subjects in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and for 20.5% of subjects in the PCV/13vPnC group; and in both groups, reports of redness and swelling were most often reported as being of moderate severity. The mean duration of each type of local reaction was ≤2.8 days in both vaccine groups.

Systemic Events: Fever was reported for only 1 subject in each vaccine group, and both reports were mild (≥38°C but ≤39°C). Use of antipyretic medications to treat or prevent fever was reported for 3 subjects (6.0%) in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and for 4 subjects (10.3%) in the PCV/13vPnC group. The incidences  of  each  of  the  other  types  of  systemic  events  were  similar  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  and PCV/13vPnC groups, respectively, for irritability (18.4%, 11.4%), decreased appetite (12.2%, 10.3%), increased sleep (4.0%, 12.8%), rash (6.0%, 2.6%), and decreased sleep (0.0%, 5.1%). The mean duration of each type of systemic event was ≤2.2 days in both vaccine groups.

Unsolicited Adverse Events: Adverse events occurring within approximately 1 month after vaccination were reported for 8 subjects (16.0%) in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and for 7 subjects (17.9%) in the PCV/13vPnC group. The most frequently reported types of AEs were infections and infestations (4.0% of  subjects  in  the  23vPS/13vPnC  group  and  12.8%  of  subjects  in  the  PCV/13vPnC  group),  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gastrointestinal disorders (6.0%, 2.6%). Most of the events were the types of diseases and conditions often seen in children of this age. Only 2 subjects (in the 23vPS/13vPnC group) had AEs considered related to study vaccine: 1 subject with lymphadenopathy and vomiting, and 1 subject with urticaria. There were no deaths, no serious AEs, and no discontinuations due to AEs during the study.

Assessor's  comment:  The  immunogenicity  results  of  this  study  show  that  the  group  receiving  the 23vPS vaccine had lower responses to the majority of serotypes after the childhood dose (at 7 years of age). The 23vPS vaccine has been reported to induce immune hyporesponsiveness, and this could be the case even after 6 years. It is unclear why the results are presented for the 7vPnC serotypes and additional  serotypes,  when  the  primary  vaccination  was  given  using  a  9-vPnC  vaccine.  However,  all results are presented, and no additional information is requested. No new safety signal was detected in this study. Overall, the responses are acceptable, and do not conflict with what has been demonstrated in other studies previously.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Both  studies  present  results  for  vaccination  schedules  involving  other  pneumococcal  vaccine,  i.e. 7vPnC  and  23vPS  vaccines  respectively.  They  provide  useful  information,  but  the  results  are  in agreement with the current SPC, and no type II variation is requested.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

No new information has been obtained from these studies that change the overall benefit/risk balance. No type II variation is requested.
