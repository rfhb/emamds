In total, 877 patients were enrolled (i.e., 77.4% of patients from OPTIMUM; n=439 from ponesimod arm and n=438 from teriflunomide arm). All patients |

1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The mean treatment duration was 46.91 months (range: 0.7-71.8 months) and drop-out rate was 25.4%. The mean ARR in the extension period was 0.132 (95% CLs: 0.113, 0.152). At Week 384, the Kaplan Meier estimate of patients with a 24-week CDA in the extension study, continuously treated with ponesimod (P20 mg/P20 mg) since core study randomization, was 21.3% (95% CLs: 17.7, 25.6).

The time to onset of IRIS in patients with PML was generally within four months after S1P receptor modulator discontinuation. Monitoring for development of IRIS and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation should be undertaken.
