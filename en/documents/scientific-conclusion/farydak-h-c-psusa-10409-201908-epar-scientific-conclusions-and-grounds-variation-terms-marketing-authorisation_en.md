## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for panobinostat, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data from the literature regarding DNA damage in an in vivo dose-dependent molecular mechanisms study in murine bone marrow cells, the PRAC concluded that the existing wording in section 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics of products containing panobinostat should be amended to include this information.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for panobinostat the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing panobinostat is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
