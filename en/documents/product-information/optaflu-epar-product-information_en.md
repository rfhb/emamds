<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Optaflu in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available. Therefore, Optaflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age (see section 5.1).

## Method of administration

<!-- image -->

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Immunisation shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Optaflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Optaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that adverse reactions may be intensified. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation The safety of Optaflu in pregnancy and breast-feeding has not been assessed in clinical trials. Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

In general data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate adverse foetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see Section 5.3 - Preclinical safety data). The use of Optaflu may be considered from the second trimester of pregnancy. For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from influenza, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

There is no human data on use of Optaflu during lactation. No effects on the breastfed newborn /infant are anticipated. Optaflu may be used during lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility (see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Optaflu has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8 Undesirable effects a) Summary of safety profile The safety of Optaflu has been assessed in seven randomized, active controlled clinical trials performed as part of the development program. Overall 7253 single doses of Optaflu were administered to 6180 adults aged 18 - 60 years of age and to 1073 elderly (aged 61 years or older). Safety and reactogenicity evaluations were performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and SAEs have been collected for approximately 6700 vaccinees during six months of follow-up. b) Summary of adverse reactions Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency: Very Common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 -&lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 - &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 - &lt;1/1,000) Very Rare (&lt;1/10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The following adverse reactions have been observed: Table 1: Frequency in adults (18-60 years of age) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal products is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionols are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting sytem listed in Appendix V.

- Extensive swelling of injected limb * These reactions usually disappeared within 1-2 days without treatment. ** Thrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts less than 5000 per mm 3 ) In the elderly frequencies were similar, except for myalgia, headache and injection site pain which were classified as 'common'. The incidence rates for moderate and severe pain after Optaflu vaccination are similar to those of egg-derived influenza vaccines; however a slightly increased risk for mild short-lasting injection site pain was observed with Optaflu in the subgroup of elderly vaccinees (8% compared to 6% with egg-derived influenza vaccine). Post-marketing surveillance: So far there is limited post-marketing experience with Optaflu. The following additional adverse reactions were reported from post-marketing surveillance with egg-based seasonal trivalent vaccines: Nervous system disorders: Neuralgia, convulsion, febrile convulsion.

A multinational (US, Finland, and Poland), randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess clinical efficacy and safety of Optaflu during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to 49 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive Optaflu (N=3828), Agrippal (N=3676) or placebo (N=3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Among the overall study population enrolled, the mean age was 33 years, 55% were female, 84% were Caucasian, 7% were Black, 7% were Hispanic, and 2% were of other ethnic origin. Optaflu efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness caused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases were identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral temperature ≥ 100.0°F / 38°C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab samples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral strains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were calculated (Tables 2 and 3).

## Immunogenicity

Seroprotection is generally obtained within 3 weeks, as shown by the pivotal phase III clinical study V58P4 for the adult and elderly population.

In this comparative trial against an egg-derived influenza vaccine the seroprotection* rate, seroconversion or significant increase rate** and the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for anti-HA antibody (measured by HI) were assessed according to predefined criteria.

| Strain specific anti-HA antibody         | A/H1N1 N=650      | A/H3N2 N=650      | B N=650         |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Seroprotection rate                      | 86% (83, 88)      | 98% (97, 99)      | 83% (80, 86)    |
| Seroconversion/Significant increase rate | 63% (59, 67)      | 58% (54, 62)      | 78% (75, 81)    |
| GMR                                      | 7.62 (6.86, 8.46) | 4.86 (4.43, 5.33) | 9.97 (9.12, 11) |

| Strain specific anti-HA antibody         | A/H1N1 N=672     | A/H3N2 N= 672     | B N=672         |
|------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Seroprotection rate                      | 76% (72, 79)     | 97% (96, 98)      | 84% (81, 87)    |
| Seroconversion/Significant increase rate | 48% (44, 52)     | 65% (61, 68)      | 76% (72, 79)    |
| GMR                                      | 4.62 (4.2, 5.08) | 5.91 (5.35, 6.53) | 9.63 (8.77, 11) |

Optaflu has not been studied in the paediatric population and therefore, data on immune response are not available for this age group.

Data for adults were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals): Table 4: Immunogenicity in Adults * Seroprotection = HI titers ≥ 40 ** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titer and post-vaccination HI titer ≥ 40; significant increase = positive pre-vaccination HI titer and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titer Data for elderly were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals): Table 5: Immunogenicity in Elderly * Seroprotection = HI titers ≥ 40 ** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titer and post-vaccination HI titer ≥ 40; significant increase = positive pre-vaccination HI titer and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titer. No differences were observed between the cell-culture and the comparator egg-derived vaccine. Across all three influenza strains, for the egg-derived vaccine seroprotection rates ranged between 85% and 98%, seroconversion or significant increase rates ranged between 62% and 73% and GMRs ranged between 5.52- and 8.76-fold over baseline HI titers. The persistence of postvaccination antibodies to strains included in the vaccine is usually 6-12 months, as shown by studies performed during the clinical development of this vaccine. Paediatric population Medicinal product no longer authorised

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies withOptaflu in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of influenza (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeat dose toxicity studies. Optaflu was well tolerated and immunogenic in mice and ferrets. In a repeated-dose toxicity study in rabbits there was no evidence of systemic toxicity and the vaccine was locally well tolerated.

No evidence of reproductive or developmental toxicity was seen in a study where the human dose of Optaflu was administered prior to and during gestatioin to female rabbits. 6.

## Optaflu suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe

Influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Optaflu is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive Optaflu 3. How Optaflu is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Optaflu 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What OPTAFLU is and what it is used for Optaflu is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Due to the kind of manufacturing Optaflu is free of chicken/egg protein. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause the flu. Optaflu is used to prevent flu in adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of experiencing associated complications in case they fall ill with flu. The vaccine targets three strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World Health Organisation for the 2015/2016 season. 2. What you need to know before you receive OPTAFLU You should not receive Optaflu  if you are allergic to influenza vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6)  if you have an acute infection. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Optaflu. BEFORE receiving the vaccine Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  you should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see Section 2, 'Taking other medicines').
-  your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. This reaction may occur with Optaflu as with all vaccines that are injected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.
-  if you have an acute illness associated with fever.

If you need a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses in the first few weeks after vaccination with Optaflu, the result of the test may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting the test that you have recently received Optaflu.

Other medicines and Optaflu Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other vaccine. If you take any medicines against cancer (chemotherapy), corticosteroid medicines (such as cortisone) or other medicines affecting the immune system, the immune response of your body may be weakened. Therefore, the vaccine may work less effectively. Optaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. In this case the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. Note that the side effects of the vaccines may be intensified. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility Pregnancy: Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your doctor will decide if you should receive Optaflu. The limited data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate that there are negative effects for the unborn child. The use of this vaccine may be considered from the second trimester of pregnancy. For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from the flu, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy. Breast-feeding: Optaflu may be used during breast feeding. Fertility: No human fertility data are available. Animal data have not shown effects on female fertility. Driving and using machines Optaflu may have a minor effect on your ability to drive and use machines. Optaflu contains sodium chloride and potassium chloride This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'. This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'. 3. How OPTAFLU is given Optaflu is given to you by your doctor or nurse. Optaflu should under no circumstances be injected into a blood vessel. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adults from the age of 18 years: One dose of 0.5 ml Optaflu is injected into the muscle on the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle).

## Children and adolescents:

Optaflu is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age since there is no information available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The following side effects have been observed during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance:

## Very serious side effects

Tell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty department at your nearest hospital if you experience the following side effect - you may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation:

-  flu-like symptoms such as headache, feeling of discomfort, tiredness, muscle pain.

Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)  swelling most apparent in the head and neck, including the face, lips, tongue, throat or any other part of the body (angioedema) Very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000):  difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash which are symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction) Rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000):  painful disorders of the nerves, e.g. attacks of extreme pain in the face, throat or ear fits (convulsions) (only observed with egg-derived influenza vaccines) Also, tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects - you may need medical attention: Very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000):  skin rashes, fever, joint pain or kidney problems which are symptoms of an inflammation of the blood vessels  fever, headache, vomiting and drowsiness progressing to coma or fits (convulsions) which are symptoms of an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord  weakness beginning in the legs and progressing to the arms with numbness and tingling sensation which are symptoms of an inflammation of the nerves Serious side effects Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects - you may need medical attention: Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)  extensive swelling of injected limb Very Rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000):  bleeding or bruising which are symptoms of a low platelet count in the blood Mild side effects Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data):  numbness and tingling sensation Very common (affects more than 1 user in 10): Medicinal product no longer authorised
