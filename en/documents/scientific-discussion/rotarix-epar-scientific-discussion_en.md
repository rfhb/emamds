## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

Rotavirus  infection  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  acute  gastroenteritis  (GE)  in  infants  and  young children throughout the world. The incidence of rotavirus infections is highest in children between 6 and 24 months of age.

Rotavirus  is  transmitted  mainly  by  the  fecal-oral  route  through  close  person-to-person  contact  and through fomites. After the incubation period (2 -4 days), there is an abrupt onset of watery diarrhoea and vomiting, which can result in (severe) dehydration. Other common clinical findings include fever and  abdominal  distress.  Viral  shedding  peaks  at  about  day  3  of  illness  and  then  declines.  The symptoms typically last from 3 to 9 days.

A  recent  review  of  epidemiological  data  estimated  that,  worldwide,  rotavirus  causes  annually approximately  111  million  episodes  of  gastroenteritis  requiring  home  care,  25  million  clinic  visits, 2 million  hospitalizations,  and  352,000-592,000  deaths  in  children  less  than  5  years  of  age.  New surveillance  data  suggest  that  the  mortality  rate  is  now  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  608,000  deaths annually worldwide.

The rotavirus belongs to the Reoviridae family of viruses. Rotaviruses carry three important antigenic specificities: group, subgroup and serotype. Group specificity is mainly conferred by viral protein VP6 (inner  capsid  protein);  subgroup  specificity  is  also  determined  by  VP6  and  has  been  used  for characterizing  the  antigenic  properties  of  various  strains  in  epidemiologic  surveys.  The  serotype specificities  are  independently  determined  by  the  outer  VP4  and  VP7  proteins.  A  binary  system  of rotavirus  classification  was  established,  the  VP7  serotype  is  designated  as  G  serotype  (VP7  is  a glycoprotein) whereas the VP4 serotype is designated as P serotype (VP4 is protease sensitive).

The prevalence of HRV in different regions within the same country can differ during the same year and the prevalence of individual serotypes in the same region can show a yearly change. There is no correlation between disease severity and serotype.

To  date,  the  only  licensed  rotavirus  vaccine  has  been  a  tetravalent  (G1-4)  RRV  rhesus/human reassortant  vaccine  marketed  as  RotaShield  by  Wyeth-Lederle  in  1998.  Less  than  a  year  after licensure,  the  vaccine  was  withdrawn  as  it  became  clear  that  there  was  an  increased  risk  of intussusception (IS) during the first few weeks after vaccination. As a consequence, occurrence of IS has  become  an  important  safety  parameter  in  the  evaluation  of  any  new  rotavirus  vaccine.  The majority of the IS cases occurred in infants who were 4 months old or older at first vaccination. This suggests that the risk of IS may have been reduced by restricting first immunization to infants younger than 4 months old.

GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has submitted a marketing authorisation application for Rotarix (human rotavirus,  live,  attenuated)  in  accordance  with  Article  8.3(i)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  active ingredient of Rotarix is a live attenuated strain of human rotavirus (HRV), which belongs to the G1 serotype and the P[8] genotype. Rotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants from the age  of  6  weeks  for  prevention  of  gastro-enteritis  due  to  rotavirus  infection.  Two  doses  of  Rotarix should be administered. The first dose may be administered from the age of six weeks and no later than the age of 14 weeks. There should be intervals of at least 4 weeks between doses. It is preferable that both doses should be administered before the age of 16 weeks. Both doses must be given by the age of 24 weeks.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

The finished product is presented as a powder and solvent for suspension for oral use, containing not less than 10 6.0 CCID50 of human rotavirus. The lyophilised vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator at 2 ° C - 8 ° C. The lyophilised powder is presented in a vial (Type 1 glass) with a butyl rubber and flip-off cap.  The  finished  product  contains  the  following  excipients:  sucrose,  dextran,  sorbitol,  amino  acids and  Dulbecco's  Modified  Eagle  Medium  (DMEM).  Prior  to  administration,  the  vaccine  must  be reconstituted  with  1  ml  of  diluent  containing  calcium  carbonate,  xanthan  and  sterile  water  in  a prefilled syringe (Type 1 glass) fitted with a butyl rubber plunger stopper and a rubber tip cap. An overage is applied both for the lyophilised powder and the diluent in order to guarantee a potency at release of ≥ 6.2 log10 CCID50 per vial and a nominal volume per dose of reconstituted vaccine of 1 ml respectively.  For  reconstitution,  a  transfer  system  is  included,  consisting  of  two  plastic  parts assembled together: a vial adaptor whose spike will pierce the vial stopper, and a soft hose that will fit tightly the syringe tip.

## Active Substance

## · Manufacture

## Manufacturing process

The active substance is manufactured at Wavre (Belgium).

Production  of  HRV  is  based  on  the  seed  lot  principle.  The  seed  lots  are  produced  on  a  Vero  cell substrate  and  the  working  seed  (WS)  is  derived  from  the  master  seed  (MS)  lot  by  one  additional passage.  Due  to  limited  yields,  it  is  not  possible  to  produce  adequate  amounts  of  rotavirus  bulk directly from the working virus seed. An intermediate virus culture, derived from the working seed, is produced and then used as inoculum for the bulk vaccine production. The process followed to produce the intermediate virus culture used for inoculation is the same as that followed for the bulk vaccine, up to the virus harvest step. No clarification or DNA removal step is applied to this intermediate HRV culture  inoculum.  The  inoculum  is  frozen  at  -70°C  in  sterile  polyethylene  containers  for  up  to  24 months.

Vero  cells  derived  from  the  manufacturer's  working  cell  bank  (WCB)  at  passage  136  (P136)  are expanded to P142 in serum-free culture conditions. The cells are grown using T-flasks and multi-tray units  (cell  factories).  For  each  passage,  when  the  cell  sheets  reach  confluence,  the  cells  are  washed with washing buffer and harvested using irradiated trypsin solution. The trypsin is then neutralised, and the cell suspension is diluted with medium before sub-passage. A part of the cell suspension at production  level  is  transferred  to  the  QC  laboratory  for  control  of  uninoculated  cultures  and  the remaining cultures are used for rotavirus propagation.

On the day of virus inoculation, virus inoculum is thawed and diluted in culture medium that contains trypsin.  Confluent  cell  monolayers  are  washed  after  which  the  washing  medium  is  removed  and replaced by the diluted Rotavirus working seed or inoculum. The inoculated cell cultures are incubated at 37°C ± 1°C . In general, cytopathic effect is observed after 5 to 7 days of incubation with resulting cell layer detachment.

The culture medium is harvested and distributed in sterile polyethylene containers and frozen at -45°C for up to 24 months. Samples of the virus harvest are taken for QC testing.

Before  the  last  steps  of  bulk  production,  harvests  are  thawed  and  pooled  in  a  mixing  vessel. Clarification is performed in order to eliminate the Vero cell debris. DNase treatment of clarified bulk

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is carried out with Benzonase after which oligonucleotides are further removed by ultrafiltration: HRV bulk is submitted to a 5 to 6 fold concentration followed by diafiltration at constant volume with 5 to 6 volumes of medium. The applicant has validated the re-use of ultrafiltation/diafiltration cartridges for 6 runs with a goal of 20 runs. The Company has committed to provide validation data for the reuse of the cartridges from the next purification campaign. The purified bulks are finally sterilised by filtration through a 0.2 µm membrane.

After  sterile  filtration,  the  HRV  purified  bulks  are  filled  into  sterile  polyethylene  containers  and further frozen at -45°C for up to 72 months. The bulks are then transferred for formulation and filling from  the  Wavre  site  to  the  Rixensart  site  under  controlled  temperature  conditions.  Compatibility between  bulk  vaccine  and  primary  container/closure  materials  was  retrospectively  demonstrated through real-time stability studies.

## Control of materials

## Virus Seed Lots

The 89-12 HRV strain was isolated from the stool sample of a 15-month old infant with mild rotavirus diarrhoea in Cincinnati, USA in 1988. The original isolate was passed 26 times in Primary African Green Monkey Kidney cells (AGMK) in order to prepare seed material, referred to as P26 (J. Gamble Institute of Medical Research, Cincinnati). Initial development of the human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine was done by Virus Research Institute  (VRI),  now  AVANT, an  American Biotechnology company. The  vaccine  developed  by  AVANT  was  further  passaged  on  an  approved  AGMK  cell  line  to  P33 (DynCorporation, MD, USA).

GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine was developed from the P33 virus material. The P33 material was propagated on Vero cells to generate the Master Seed (P40) RVCL25A99, identified as RIX4414; the Working Seed RVCL01B99 was derived from this MS.

The  production  of  this  MS  and  WS  was  carried  out  on  Vero  cell  substrate  derived  from  WCB P136/93,  originally  used  at  the  company  for  the  production  of  the  inactivated  poliomyelitis  virus (IPV). Those seed materials, produced in 1999, have been used to prepare clinical lots for Phase I and Phase II studies. However, these initial HRV seeds were not fully compliant with the TSE guideline that  came  into  operation  in  May  2001  that  required  compliance  for  virus  seed  materials  of  new products  (Joint  CPMP/CVMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products). The main reason for non-compliance was the use of gelatin-derived amino acids in the preparation of the virus seeds.

Consequently, new virus seeds (MS RVCL13E02 and WS RVCL29G02) were produced in 2002 in compliance with the CPMP/CVMP TSE Guideline. These new seeds have been produced in serumfree  culture  on  Vero  cells  derived  from  a  new  working  cell  bank  prepared  and  stored  without  any addition of serum. The new seed materials have been used to produce consistency bulks for Phase III and are being used for commercial HRV vaccine production.

Specifications and test methods for HRV master and working seeds are described in GSK Biologicals' monographs. The testing program was established based on the current ICH and Ph. Eur. requirements for live attenuated viral vaccines. The identity and homogeneity of the RIX4414 isolates, virus seeds and  further  passages  have  been  demonstrated  by  molecular  characterisation.  Genetic  stability  was further confirmed by direct comparison of the entire genomic sequence of two distinct HRV harvests derived  from  new  seed  materials  with  those  of  both  initial  and  new  working  seeds.  Full  genomic sequences,  as  determined  from  these  materials,  were  shown  to  be  identical,  clearly  indicating  high stability of HRV strain from seed storage throughout routine manufacturing process. To monitor the stability,  the  Applicant  has  committed  to  submit  data  in  order  to  set  acceptance  criteria  and  action limits for HRV MS, WS and inoculum.

The current inoculum, which is used in actual production of the vaccine, is expected to last to 2008. This would infer that there will be many years of storage for the current WS. Therefore, the Applicant has committed to provide the stability data generated for the inoculum during the production campaign and data for the WS every two years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cell substrate

The Vero cell line was derived from an African Green Monkey kidney in 1962 at the Chiba University in  Chiba,  Japan.  The  cells  were  brought  at  P93  to  the  laboratory  of  Tropical  Virology  National Institute of Health (USA). The cell line has been further submitted to the National Institute of Health (USA) and, later, to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) at P113. Cells were received at GSK Bio laboratories at P124 from ATCC stock, no. CCL-81. A MCB was established in 1983 at passage 133 (MCB P133/83F). Two WCBs were established from this MCB and successively used in Rotavirus vaccine production.

Routine production of HRV commercial vaccine lots will be carried out on Vero cells derived from the serum-free WCB VEROSF/RIX4415/WCB. For the production of this WCB, 3 ampoules of MCB P133/83F were thawed and 3 passages were performed successively on cell factories in serum-free growth  medium.  At  P136,  cells  were  trypsinised,  centrifuged  and  suspended  in  cryopreservation medium.

The cell bank qualification includes control testing at the stage of MCB, WCB and End-of-production cells  (P145).  The  testing  program  was  established  based  on  current  EU,  WHO  and  FDA  (USA) guidelines.  The  virus  titres  obtained  during  the  on-going  production  campaign  will  be  reported  to indirectly  support  the  stability  of  the  WCB  for  6  years.  The  Applicant  has  committed  to  submit stability data of the WCB in serum-free storage conditions on an annual basis.

## Reagents

The materials used during manufacture of the rotavirus vaccine, together with their pharmacopoeial references  were  provided.  The  only  compounds  not  described  in  a  pharmacopoeia  are:  Benzonase, bovine  serum,  EGF,  L-Glutamine,  Ferric  (III)  Nitrate,  Soybean  Trypsin  Inhibitor  and  VP-SFM medium. For these, the applicant referred to in-house monographs and has established specifications that provide assurance that the quality of the product is adequate for the intended use.

Trypsin  is  the  only  product  of  animal  origin  (porcine).  It  is  obtained  from  porcine  pancreas  of  US origin.  Bovine  serum  was  included  in  the  culture  medium  used  for  adaptation  of  the  Vero  cells  to serum-free culture conditions (first passage from the master cell bank). No bovine serum is used in routine production of HRV vaccine.

## Controls of critical steps / Process validation

Three  critical  manufacturing  steps  have  been  identified  during  which  in-process  controls  are performed: cell substrate preparation, virus inoculation/propagation, and harvest processing. Appropriate  in-process  control  tests  (HRV  harvest  potency  titre,  temperature  during  HRV  harvest thawing,  effectiveness  of  Benzonase  treatment,  concentration  during  ultrafiltration)  and  acceptance criteria have been provided.

The  process  followed  to  produce  the  intermediate  inoculum  is  the  same  as  followed  for  the  bulk vaccine,  up  to  the  virus  harvest  step;  no  clarification  or  DNA  removal  step  is  applied.  The  HRV inoculum is QC tested according to the same tests, methods and specifications as those applied to the HRV bulks at the cells and virus harvest level.

For the potency titre of the HRV harvest, the Applicant has committed to set interim consistency limits which after the on-going production campaign will be based on 18 harvests; the interim limits will be revised when data from at least 30 harvests are available.

The robustness and consistency of production of the HRV active substance have been demonstrated through two production campaigns: the first one using the initial seed materials and the second one

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

using the new seed materials intended for commercial production. Regarding the purification process, the filtration steps applied exclude the possibility for intact Vero cells to be present in the product. In addition, the residual DNA content in commercial bulks was consistently very low and the Benzonase treatment has been shown to efficiently reduce the DNA fragment size. The Applicant has committed to complete the validation package on the effectiveness of the DNA degradation process by measuring residual high molecular weight DNA from at least 30 purified bulks for statistical significance.

## Manufacturing process development

Vero  cell  cultures  used  to  prepare  the  initial  Phase  I/II  clinical  lots  were  derived  from  a  WCB produced  with  serum  containing  medium.  A  serum-free  WCB  was  established  and  used  from  late Phase II clinical studies and afterwards; this WCB is also used for commercial production.

New seed materials have been produced in 2002, on Vero cells derived from the serum-free WCB. , The  new  seed  materials  have  been  used  in  Phase  III  vaccine  development  and  are  also  used  for commercial production.

Regarding  the  production  scale,  the  harvest  scale  was  doubled  from  initial  development  bulks  to consistency  bulks.  For  the  consistency  bulks,  two  harvests  were  pooled  before  purification.  The current  harvest  scale  for  commercial  vaccine  bulk  production  is  the  same,  but  prepared  from  one single harvest. Future HRV production might reach double the size of the current harvest scale, but is outside the current scope of this marketing authorisation application.

## · Characterisation and specifications

Molecular  characterisation  studies  have  confirmed  the  genetic  stability  of  the  HRV  vaccine  strain throughout the in vitro passages that are routinely applied during the HRV production process, from the pre-master seed material (P38) up to P43 production lots and after 3 additional passages (P46). No sequence heterogeneity has been detected in the cloned material in the 6 nucleotide positions which were found to be variable in VP4 and VP7 coding genes of the non-cloned virus strain. Full genomic sequence  from  two  different  HRV  harvest  material  and  two  different  working  seed  viruses  were shown to be identical, indicating the high stability of HRV strain upon seed storage and throughout routine manufacturing process.

A monkey neurovirulence test has been performed on Rotavirus Vaccine WS RVCL29G02 according to  the  Ph.  Eur.  recommendation  for  live  attenuated  vaccines.  There  was  no  unexpected  clinical  or histopathological evidence of involvement of the central nervous system attributable to the inoculated virus.

Potential  impurities  may  originate  from  two  major  sources:  the  cell  substrate  (proteins,  lipids  and DNA) and the reagents used in the production and purification of the bulk vaccine (e.g. Benzonase). It was demonstrated that these residuals are effectively removed during the purification process.

Quality control tests (identity, potency, sterility, extraneous agents) are performed at various stages of the  preparation  of  the  vaccine  bulks  (cells,  supernatant  at  the  end  of  the  observation  period,  single harvest and purified bulk). Specifications applied to the HRV bulks are based on ICH and Ph. Eur. requirements relevant for live attenuated vaccines.

For  the  potency  assay,  two  methods  of  titration  have  been  evaluated  during  Phase  II  clinical development of HRV vaccine. Both methods have the same objective of determining the infectious titre of rotavirus by inoculation of the virus on MA-104 cells. The first method was used in-house for release of initial clinical lots. This method requires counting of fluorescent foci after ~18 hours of cell infection  and  allows  the  determination  of  the  titre  expressed  in  ffu  (foci  forming  unit).  The  second method  was  developed  in-house  and  determines  the  dose  infecting  50%  of  the  cell  culture  and rotavirus  titres  are  expressed  in  CCID 50 .  The  latter  method  will  also  be  used  for  identity  testing  of HRV, since a specific monoclonal antibody (VP7 specificity) is used in the test. A summary of the validation study for the test has been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RVC021A44/Q  is  a  lyophilised  vaccine  used  as  a  reference  standard  for  the  potency  assay.  Its established  titre  is  6.5  log10  CCID50/vial.  The  Applicant  presented  the  procedures  to  perform  the qualification  of  a  new  reference  preparation  and  provided  the  acceptance  criteria  for  any  new reference.

Batch analysis results have been provided for HRV harvests and derived purified bulks that were used to prepare clinical and stability vaccine lots from early phases of vaccine development up to Phase III, as well as for the six commercial bulks produced in 2004; all complied with the specifications in force at the time of their release. For bulks used in Phase I/II development, the potency test virus titres are only expressed in ffu. For consistency bulks used in Phase III development, virus titres are expressed in  CCID50  in  addition  to  ffu  but  for  routine  release  of  commercial  lots  the  bulk  virus  titres  are expressed in CCID50 only.

## · Stability

The proposed shelf-lives are 24 months at -45°C for the virus harvest and 72 months at -45°C for the purified bulk. Three HRV harvest lots have entered a stability study for 24 months at -45°C and this storage has been demonstrated not to affect their potency and their suitability for further purification steps.  Three derived HRV purified bulks are being followed in real-time stability for 72 months at 45°C, according to an approved stability protocol. The data available to date show that there is no potency  loss  upon  storage  at  -45°C  for  at  least  24  months.  Additional  data  generated  on  Phase  II purified bulks produced with a different Working Virus Seed and source of cell substrate from that used now, also supported the proposed shelf-life of 72 months at -45°C.  The Applicant committed to submit further results on an annual basis.

## Finished Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

## Formulation development

In  initial  development,  the  vaccine  was  buffered  by  pre-administration  of  a  commercially  available antacid, given 10-15 minutes prior to administration of the rotavirus vaccine. The current pharmaceutical form is a lyophilised vaccine to be reconstituted with an antacid diluent before oral administration, allowing to administer the HRV vaccine without pre-administration of a buffer.

The current HRV lyophilised vaccine formulation includes sucrose, dextran, sorbitol and amino acids as rotavirus stabilisers during lyophilisation (lyoprotectant). DMEM is added for bulk dilution which is applied to achieve the targeted final titre. The current liquid diluent used for vaccine reconstitution includes calcium carbonate as antacid to buffer gastric acids and to prevent HRV inactivation during passage through the stomach. Xanthan is added as thickening agent in order to increase the diluent viscosity and avoid rapid sedimentation of calcium carbonate during the diluent filling. The amount of calcium carbonate per dose has been set based on the antacid capacity as measured by the so-called 'Baby Rossett-Rice' method which simulates the conditions in a two to six month-old baby stomach..

## Manufacturing process development

For  the  formulated  active  substance,  a  short  (1  day)  and  a  long  (2  days)  lyophilisation  cycle  was established and validated.

For the diluent, initially, the sterilisation was performed at the bulk level and filling of sterile syringes was carried  out  in  aseptic  conditions.  However,  the  sterilisation  step  had  an  impact  on  the  xanthan thickening properties, and the diluent sedimentation rate was increased after sterilisation. Therefore, for diluent lots used in Phase III studies and for commercial production, the sterilisation is performed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on  the  filled  syringes  by  autoclaving  at  121.5°C  for  at  least  20  minutes.  Filling  and  stoppering operations are automated and take place in aseptic conditions and filling equipment is sterilised by autoclaving. The containers and closures used for the filling are sterilised before use. Sterility testing has  been  performed  on  all  diluent  lots  produced  so  far.  However,  the  diluent  is  a  turbid  liquid suspension and the method requires a sub-passage of the diluent suspension which entails a significant risk of false negative samples. Based on the information collected during the production process (inprocess  controls  and  monitoring)  and  the  validation  of  the  terminal  sterilisation,  it  was  accepted  to replace sterility testing of samples with parametric release for diluent batches when satisfactory data from at least 30 commercial lots are available; this process was GMP inspected.

The  compatibility  of  the  vaccine  and  the  diluent  with  the  container-closure  components  has  been demonstrated through stability studies. The compatibility of diluent components with the HRV active ingredient has also been validated by reconstitution assays and by clinical evaluation of the vaccine.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Formulation, filling and lyophilisation of the vaccine is performed at GSK Bio, Rixensart (Belgium). Commercial batch sizes may vary between several tens of thousands to maximum 168,000 vials and 180,000 diluent syringes.

The formulation of the HRV final bulk vaccine is carried out in aseptic conditions (Class 100 laminar air flow/ Grade A) in a refrigerated airlock. Stainless steel tanks are sterilised by steam (121.5°C for 60  minutes).  Glassware,  transfer  and  filtration  devices,  connections  are  sterilised  by  autoclave  at 121.5°C  for  30  minutes.  Pure  and  pyrogen-free  WFI  produced  by  distillation  is  added  to  the formulation tank via transfer lines fitted with 0.2 μ m filters.

For  the  manufacture  of  the  lyophilised  powder,  the  HRV  purified  bulk  is  thawed  and  then  further mixed with the appropriate volume of DMEM dilution medium. The stabiliser solution (lyoprotectant) is prepared separately and then transferred into the HRV mixture and stirred. At this stage, samples are taken for QC sterility testing. Prior to filling, the final bulk is stored at 2-8°C in sterile formulation tank, under positive relative pressure.

The dilution medium and stabiliser solution are sterilised by filtration through 0.2 µm membranes.

The final bulk vaccine is aseptically filled into 3-ml depyrogenised and sterilised glass vials (type I), using  an  automatic  filling/stoppering  machine.  The  HRV  final  bulk  is  maintained  under  constant agitation  during  the  whole  filling  operation.  After  filling,  the  vials  are  automatically  partially stoppered and are transferred to a freeze-dryer for subsequent lyophilisation.

The formulation of the diluent is carried out at room temperature and takes place in mobile stainless steel tanks. At the end of the formulation, the mixture is kept in stainless steel tanks under continuous stirring until filling. The diluent bulk is distributed aseptically into 1.75 ml sterile, siliconised syringes (drawn  glass,  type  I),  using  an  automatic  filling/stoppering  machine.  Diluent  is  maintained  under constant  agitation  during  the  whole  filling  operation.  After  filling,  the  syringes  are  automatically closed  with  grey  butyl  plunger  stoppers.  After  filling  the  syringes  are  sterilised  by  autoclaving  at 121.5°C for at least 20 minutes. Compatibility of the primary containers for the HRV vaccine and the diluent has been demonstrated through stability studies.

Approved, inspected containers (vials and syringes) coming from the filling and/or lyophilisation are placed in boxes, palletised, quarantined and stored. For the HRV lyophilised vaccine, a preliminary storage at -20°C for no longer than 2 years may be applied prior to final labelling and packaging. For the  diluent,  appropriate  stability  data  are  being  generated  to  validate  its  storage  at  non-refrigerated temperatures in addition to the storage at 2-8°C.

There is no intermediate produced between thawing of the purified bulks and end of lyophilisation. Inprocess controls and monitoring carried out at the successive steps of HRV vaccine preparation are described.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is also no intermediate produced from diluent preparation to filling in glass syringes. In-process controls and monitoring carried out during diluent formulation and filling are described.

Aseptic  manipulations  during  vaccine  formulation  and  filling,  the  lyophilisation  process  and  the terminal sterilisation of the diluent syringes have been validated.

The  robustness  of  the  production  process  was  established  retrospectively  on  the  basis  of  the satisfactory batch analysis results obtained for 18 batches (including 6 commercial lots).

## · Control of excipients

The  excipients  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  except  for  the  amino  acids  for  which  applicable  tests, specifications and methods of analysis are provided.

## · Product Specification

The HRV lyophilised vaccine is tested and released independently from the liquid diluent.

The product in the final container is tested for description (appearance), identity and potency (CCID50 method), sterility, moisture content and pH. The proposed specification for potency, not less than 6.2 log10 CCID50 per vaccine vial is set in order to guarantee the minimum titre of not less than 6.0 log10 CCID50  per  nominal  dose  of  vaccine  up  to  the  end  of  shelf  life.    This  latter  lower  limit  in  active ingredient was set based upon efficacy results obtained during clinical development of the vaccine.

The diluent  in  the  final  container  is  tested  for  description  (appearance),  identity  (calcium  salts  and carbonates), pH, volume and calcium carbonate content.

The control tests performed for release of the HRV lyophilised vaccine are done after reconstitution with sterile water. However, the Applicant must first perform potency testing on the final vaccine lot where the  product  is  reconstituted  with  diluent,  until  potency  data  have  been  submitted  from  three final batches of finished product that have been released with different batches of diluent (containing the same lot numbers for all of the excipients). In addition, to verify whether new batches of diluent excipients do not have a negative effect on the potency, the Applicant committed to undertake potency testing on a final vaccine lot when new diluent batches are introduced.

The  specifications  have  been  satisfactorily  justified  and  the  test  methods  have  been  adequately described and validated.

The reference standard is identical to the one described in the active substance section.

The origins of potential impurities present in the HRV vaccine are discussed in the active substance section. No impurity is introduced in the diluent throughout the formulation/filling/packaging steps.

Batch analysis results are presented for all HRV vaccine lots produced from early phases of Rotarix clinical development, as well as for the first six HRV vaccine lots produced for commercial purpose. All the vaccine batches tested complied with the specifications in force at the time of their release. General information batch analysis results were presented for diluent lots produced from early phases of  Rotarix  clinical  development.  All  the  diluent  batches  tested  from  early  stages  of  HRV  vaccine development complied with the specifications in force at the time of their release.

## · Viral safety and TSE

The use of cell substrates in the production of the HRV vaccine could support bacterial and fungal growth.  Therefore,  starting  materials  are  tested  for  microbiological  purity  according  to  the  relevant requirements, and possible contamination during production is monitored.

No materials of bovine origin are used in the current routine production process of Rotavirus vaccine, including the master seed (MS RVCL13E02) and the current working seed (RVCL29G02), except for lactose (from bovine milk fit for human consumption) which is used as a stabiliser for porcine trypsin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, a few materials of bovine origin including donor calf serum, lactalbumin hydrolysate and amino acids were used in the preparation of the Vero master cell bank, MCB P133/83F, produced in 1983. Information on materials of animal origin used in the preparation of the MCB P133/83F have previously been reviewed and approved for Infanrix Penta and Infanrix Hexa.

Also donor calf serum was used in initial stages of adaptation of Vero cells to a serum-free culture process  prior  to  the  preparation  of  the  Vero  MWCB  RIX4415,  produced  in  1999;  a  copy  of  the certificate of suitability has been provided.

Virus  testing  of  starting  materials  was  based  on  ICH,  WHO  and  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  As  the Company AVANT reported the presence of Bovine Parainfluenza type 3 virus (bPIV-3) in the AGMK cell line initially used for propagation of HRV, the applicant decided to test the P33 parent seed for bPIV-3 by inoculation of appropriate cell substrates (MRC5 and Vero cells), treat the P33 seed with ether before cloning by limit dilution and to conduct appropriate in vitro control tests for bPIV-3 at all stages of production (MS, WS, inoculum, harvest); no evidence of the presence of bPIV-3 was found.

In conclusion, the applicant has taken all the necessary precautions to avoid any contamination during production and has put in place appropriate control tests throughout manufacturing of HRV vaccine.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability data have been provided on the HRV lyophilised vaccine (on all clinical lots and on three lots validating the 1 day lyophilisation cycle) and on the vaccine after reconstitution with the diluent. The proposed shelf life for HRV lyophilised vaccine is 36 months at +2°C to +8°C. There is no potency loss  upon  storage  at  both  -20°C  and  +2°C/+8°C.  There  is  a  trend  towards  an  increase  in  moisture content over time, but no impact on the vaccine potency has been demonstrated. There is also no loss of potency after incubation of the lyophilised vaccine at 37 ° C for 7 days. Real time stability studies on commercial  lots  at  the  recommended  storage  temperature  of  +2°C  to  +8°C  up  to  36  months  are ongoing.

A preliminary storage of the vaccine in final container for up to 24 months at -20°C may be applied prior to final labelling and packaging operations. The shelf life at +2°C to +8°C starts from the date the  vaccine  is  removed  from  the  freezer  for  final  labeling  and  packaging.  There  is  no  potency  loss after  2  years  of  storage  at  -20°C.    Cumulative  stability  studies  are  ongoing  in  order  to  validate  the storage of the lyophilised vaccine for 24 months at -20°C followed by 36 months at +2°C to +8°C.

The reconstituted vaccine has been shown to be stable for 24 hours at both 2°C-8° and 18°C-25°C.

A shelf-life  of  36-months  is  currently  proposed  for  the  diluent,  which  may  be  stored  either  in  the refrigerator  (2-8°C)  or  at  ambient  temperature  (up  to  37 ° C).  The  diluent  must  not  be  frozen. Satisfactory  stability  data  have  been  generated  for  seven  diluent  lots  used  in  clinical  studies  of Phase II;  real-time,  long-term  stability  studies  have  been  initiated  on  three  Phase  III  diluent  lots,  in order  to  extend  the  proposed  shelf-life  from  3  to  5  years  of  storage  at  either  2-8°C  or  'ambient' temperature (25°C and +37°C).

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

During the evaluation of Rotarix, no major objections were identified. A number of other concerns were identified, including the need of further stability data on the serum-free WCB, setting acceptance criteria  and  defining  a  maximum  storage  period  for  the  'inoculum',  and  the  effectiveness  and validation of the Benzonase treatment.

The  Applicant  also  claimed  that  the  validation  of  the  rotavirus  identity  test  demonstrated  the specificity of the VP7 specific monoclonal antibody, 2C9. Consequently, the use of the VP7 specific MAb in the potency test has made the separate identity test redundant. The Applicant has submitted additional data demonstrating the virus titre reduction in the presence of specific neutralising antibody

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed for the final products released up to now, in order to document that the identity test can be accepted as part of the potency assay.

For  the  HRV  purified  bulks,  a  shelf  life  of  72  months  at  -45°C  was  considered  acceptable.  The Applicant has committed to submit the results that will be generated during the long-term real-time stability studies according to the protocol given in the MAA.

The proposed tests and specifications  for  the  control  of  the  lyophilised  vaccine  and  the  diluent  are considered  adequate.  To  rule  out  any  impact  of  the  mode  of  reconstitution  (water  or  diluent),  the Applicant committed to submit potency data from three final vaccine batches that have been released with different batches of diluent (with the same production lot numbers for all of the excipients).

The  proposed  shelf-life  of  the  HRV  vaccine  is  36  months  at  2-8°C.  The  potency  data,  which  also verifies  the  identity,  is  supportive  of  a  36  month  shelf-life  at  2-8°C.  However,  the  Applicant  has committed  to  generate  additional  stability  data  up  to  36  months,  which  also  includes  the  tests  for description  (appearance),  sterility,  moisture,  pH,  and  abnormal  toxicity.  Studies  are  currently  being conducted to determine if an extension of the shelf-life of the lyophilised vaccine for up to 5 years, by combining storage at -20°C (24 months) followed by 36 months at 2-8°C, is acceptable.

In conclusion, all quality issues are resolved and several commitments are made by the applicant, to provide further information post-approval.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical programme includes two non-GLP conform preliminary pharmaco-dynamic studies and one GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity study.

## Pharmacology

The selection of a non-clinical animal model for the human rotavirus strain RIX4414 has been based on the fact that mice are not susceptible to human strains and piglets seem only susceptible to a limited number of human rotavirus strains. In contrast, in neonatal Lewis rats, human group A rotavirus was shown to replicate, spread, and induce disease for up to 10 days post-inoculation and rotavirusinduced diarrhoeal disease was shown to be age-dependent.

The immunogenicity and viral shedding of the RIX4414 rotavirus vaccine strain was investigated in 3 studies, two exploratory studies and one 'vaccine take report'-study, which was part of the repeated dose toxicity study

- Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

## Development of a preclinical model in Fischer F344 rats to study human rotavirus strain

In the first exploratory study the Fischer F344 rat was used to study the susceptibility of different human rotavirus strains (Wa &amp; RIX4414) at different ages (5-day versus 21-day old rats). The virus suspensions were administered intragastrically to groups of 5 rats, either 5 days old or 21 days old, twice at 2 weeks interval with HRV strain Wa or RIX4414 (10 6 ffu, without the addition of CaCO3, which is present in the Rotarix vaccine candidate as an antacid). A control group of rats received the cell culture medium. Blood samples were taken on day 14 and 28 post dose 2 for anti-rotavirus antibody evaluations. The 5 sera of each group were pooled. An ELISA method developed by the applicant was used to evaluate the specific antibody responses. Seroconversion was defined as a 2-fold increase of optical density (OD). Viral shedding was analysed in the faeces by an ELISA developed by the applicant. Presence/absence of diarrhoea was monitored.

No rotavirus specific response was observed in 5-day old rats regardless of the human rotavirus strain administered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A weak level of anti-rotavirus antibodies was measured at days 14 and 28 after administration of the Wa strain in 21-day old rats while a high level of antibodies was measured after administration of the RIX4414 strain.

No diarrhoea or viral shedding was observed regardless the age of the animals and the rotavirus strain administered. The applicant concluded that 21-day old Fischer 344 rats were more susceptible to human rotavirus strains than 5-day old animals.

## Evaluation of seroconversion and viral shedding associated with RIX4414 with or without CaCO3 in Fischer F344 rats

In the second exploratory study seroconversion and viral shedding induced by different doses of virus administered either alone or with CaCO3 of different granularity  was studied in 21-days old Fischer F344 rats. Groups of 5 rats were administered intragastrically twice (on days 0 and 14) with the different viral preparations of RIX4414 (10 6 ffu, 10 5 ffu or 10 4 ffu) formulated on CaCO3. A positive control group was administered 10 6 ffu of RIX4414 alone.  A placebo group of animals was administered with CaCO3 alone.

Stool samples were taken from day 3 to day 7 post-dose 1 for viral shedding evaluation, which was assessed by detection of rotavirus specific RNA by an RT-PCR assay developed by the applicant.

Viral shedding peaked between day 4 and day 6-post virus administration and was present in the stools of each group of animals receiving the virus (10 4 ffu, 10 5 ffu or 10 6 ffu of RIX4414).

Blood samples were taken on day 14 after the first dose and day 28 after the second dose for specific anti-rotavirus Ig evaluations, using a direct ELISA.

Seroconversion was observed in 20 to 80 % of animals receiving 10 6 ffu of RIX4414 with or without CaCO3.

## Vaccine take report

The vaccine take/exposure of RIX4414 was investigated in the absence and or presence of CaCO3 as part of the repeated dose-toxicity study in the Fischer F344 rat.

Groups of young Fischer 344 rats, (15 males and 15 females in each group), received oral 0.5 ml doses of either saline (control group), the antacid alone (80 mg of CaCO3), the Rotavirus vaccine strain (RIX4414 at 10 6.1 ffu) or the Rotavirus vaccine candidate (RIX4414 at 10 6.7 ffu + 80 mg CaCO3). Each treatment was administered orally on 4 occasions at 14 days interval. Blood samples from a subset of 10 rats of each group were taken on day 27 (13 days post second administration) and day 70 (28 days post fourth administration). Antibodies against Rotavirus were measured at these time-points in individual sera in order to assess seroconversion.

Stools were taken on day 4, 5, 6 after the first administration and on day 4, 5 and 6 after the second administration.  Viral shedding in stool samples was assessed by detection of specific nucleic acid sequences of Rix4414 measured by RT-PCR.

Oral administration of Rotavirus in young Fischer rats induced seroconversion in 20 % of RIX4414 recipients and 10 % of Rotavirus vaccine candidate recipients (RIX4414 + CaCO3).

Rotavirus administration induced viral shedding in 20 % of RIX4414 recipients and in 80 % of Rotavirus vaccine candidate recipients (RIX4414 + CaCO3). Vaccine take was evidenced in 40 % of the RIX4414 recipients and 80 % of the vaccine candidate recipients.

## · Safety pharmacology

Native rotavirus replicates in the intestine. Human rotavirus is known to cause gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal distress, intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions in the intestinal villi and vacuolization, atrophy of the villi.

In the repeated dose toxicity study there was no evidence of loose stools, effects on bodyweight, food consumption, rectal temperature or histopathological signs of intestinal infection, excluding intestinal disturbances induced by the candidate vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no lesions induced by the candidate vaccine in lungs or heart after one and up to 4 oral administrations to young Fischer F344 rats. Therefore, a single dose study on the cardiovascular or respiratory system, as recommended for human medicines by ICH S7A, was not warranted.

## Pharmacokinetics

Animal bio-distribution data in a relevant animal model, which closely mimics the viral replication, tropism and spread as in the human situation, are not available.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

No separate study was performed to assess the single dose toxicity of the candidate vaccine. However, full investigations were performed after the first oral vaccine dose administration in rats, during the GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity study.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The objective of the repeated dose toxicity study was to determine the toxicity of the test item (HRV/ CaCO3 all in one formulation) following one or four oral (gavage) administrations to 21-day old Fischer 344 rat at two-week intervals (days 0, 14, 28, 42), in comparison with the reference item (HRV without CaCO3).

Morbidity/mortality, clinical examinations, ophthalmological examination, body weights, food consumption, body temperature and clinical laboratory determinations were used as criteria to disclose any toxic effects. All surviving animals were killed for necropsy on days 5, 47 and 70.  Selected organs/tissues from all animals were weighed and examined histopathologically.

No histopathological changes were seen in the intestinal villi. No pathognomonic epithelial syncytia and no intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were present in the ileum (as commonly seen during infection by Rotaviruses). Standard examination of the lymphoid organs did not reveal any changes related to the administration of the test item.

Up to four administrations of the rotavirus vaccine by the oral route at two-week intervals to 3-week old Fischer 344 rats were not associated with toxicological changes or histopathological (including gut draining mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) lesions on days 5, 47 or 70. No differences were seen between the test and control group.

- Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics) /Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

Studies on genotoxic and carcinogenic potential are not applicable, since no novel adjuvants and/or additives need to be tested for genotoxicity (Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxcicological testing of vaccines, CPMP/SWP/465/95)

- Reproductive and developmental studies

Taking the intended target population for the vaccine, which includes newborns, infants and toddlers and not humans of childbearing age, as well as the nature of the product into account, studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity are not necessary (CPMP/SWP/465/95 and ICH S6).

## · Local tolerance

A specific study on local tolerance has not been performed. Microscopic investigations of oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestine were reported in the repeated dose toxicity study in the rat and were not associated with histopathological lesions.

- Other toxicity studies

The potential for hypersensitivity and autoimmune reactions by Rotarix has not been investigated in an animal model. Even large-scale clinical trials cannot prove that a vaccine is completely safe in this respect. Ultimately, post marketing surveillance studies are the only tool to study whether a new vaccine can cause autoimmune disease or allergic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Neither the attenuated virus nor any excipient will enter the environment in quantities that raise ecological concern. Since the PEC levels are lower than the threshold or very close to the threshold of 0.001 µg/L, the Phase I ERA for the Rotarix vaccine is adequate and a Phase II assessment is not required.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

During the clinical development program a total of 15 clinical trials (phase I, II and III) were conducted in 20 countries. In these trials 72,111 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated. Of them, 38,441 subjects received the HRV vaccine. In addition, 1,851 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in ongoing study 024, for which interim immunogenicity data obtained in 285 subjects are presented at in this report.

Immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine was evaluated in ten clinical trials. A total of 4,802 subjects (3,635 vaccines and 1,167 placebo recipients) were included in the according to protocol (ATP*) cohort for immunogenicity. Final immunogenicity data are available for a subset of 4,517 subjects. From one study (024) interim data (285 subjects) are available.

In Rota-023 the pivotal phase III trial 63,225 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated (31,673 vaccine and 31,552 placebo recipients). The mean duration of the efficacy follow-up was 8 months. First year efficacy results have become available. A part of the efficacy subset (13 000 subjects planned) is being followed for efficacy and safety up to 24 months of age.

The applicant has also submitted the Interim Study Report of study Rota-024 (related to the immune response to oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Rotarix).

During the evaluation procedure the applicant submitted the interim immunogenicity results of study Rota-036, which is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted in six European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and which is evaluating the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of two doses of Rotarix (10 6.5 CCID50) in healthy infants in coadministration with specific childhood vaccines including Infanrix Hexa. Only the results from the Czech Republic (post dose 3) and Finland (post dose 2) were submitted.

Safety data with the candidate HRV vaccine are available from:

- Eight studies with complete final data (003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 014, 021, 033) (7,369 subjects vaccinated)
- One study with final safety data (023), with respect to the primary safety objective (intussusception (IS) within the 0-30 day period after any dose) as well as to SAEs up to minimum one month post dose 2 is available (63,225 subjects vaccinated)
- SAEs arising from all ongoing studies up to the data lock point of August 31, 2004 are presented
- Supportive safety data are available from 3 studies with the mHRV vaccine (016, 020, 021) (893 subjects vaccinated)
- With respect to the incidence of IS, the applicant submitted the final study report of study SeroEpi-IS-204 (999910/204), which estimates the incidence of IS in children &lt; 24 months old in hospitals involved in study Rota-023. This study report is submitted as background information to assess the incidence of hospital-related IS in unvaccinated children under 2 years of age in the same countries as study Rota-023 (except, for the inclusion of Costa Rica and exclusion of Venezuela and Finland).

Clinical trials were performed with two formulations of HRV vaccine: the \"candidate\" HRV vaccine and the 'modified' HRV vaccine. The same vaccine viral strain, RIX4414, is used in both the \"candidate\" and \"modified\" HRV vaccines.

The candidate HRV vaccine is the formulation for which the license is being sought and is referred to as the \"HRV vaccine\". The active ingredient of the HRV vaccine is a live attenuated virus derived from HRV strain belonging to G1 serotype and P8 genotype (G1P[8]). The lyophilised vaccine strain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is reconstituted in a calcium carbonate buffer directly prior to administration. The following trials were conducted with the HRV vaccine:

1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium

Early studies performed with a precursor vaccine (Bernstein DI 1999 and 2002) demonstrated that 2 doses of 10 5.0 plaque-forming units (pfu) 89-12 had 89% vaccine efficacy.

During the clinical development program the applicant evaluated a range of viral concentrations The quantitative composition per nominal dose (1 ml) of reconstituted HRV vaccine as specified above was used. The potency of all clinical lots administered during HRV vaccine development has been evaluated using two different titration methods, and titres in focus forming units (ffu) and in cell culture infective dose (CCID50) are compared. Based on the results, viral concentration of 10 5.5 ffu could be considered as representative of 10 6.0 CCID50. As indicated in the proposed SPC, the end of shelf life titres should not be less than 10 6.0 CCID50. The placebo was prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized excipients in the glass vial with the liquid calcium carbonate-based diluent contained in the pre-filled syringe. The reconstituted placebo had the same visual appearance as the reconstituted HRV vaccine.

The results on vaccine take, seroconversion rate and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were evaluated in dose-escalating studies -003, -005, -006, -007 and -021.

In study 003 higher serum anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs were observed with increasing vaccine viral concentrations. This trend was most striking after the first vaccine dose.

In study 005 no statistical difference in the combined vaccine take between the HRV 10 5.2 group and the HRV 10 6.4 group was observed ( p =0.153).

In study 006 there was a trend towards greater immunogenicity with an increase in viral concentration. However, seroconversion rates and vaccine take rates in the three vaccine groups post dose 2 were similar. A trend toward higher anti-rotavirus IgA antibody GMCs post dose 2 was observed in the HRV 10 5.8 group.

In study 007 the seroconversion rates were higher in subjects receiving the HRV at a viral concentration of 10 5.2 ffu than in subjects receiving the HRV vaccine at 10 4.7 ffu. No further increase in seroconversion rates was observed in subjects who received the HRV vaccine at a viral concentration of 10 6.2 ffu. However, vaccine take rates were close to 100% for all the three groups.

In study 021 three doses of HRV 10 5.2 ffu and mHRV 10 5.8 ffu, respectively, were compared. Seroconversion rate and , GMCs in the HRV vaccine group had a higher trend. Based on these results the further development of the mHRV vaccine was abandoned.

In study Rota-033 the lot-to-lot consistency of three lots of the HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity two months after Dose 2 was studied. For any pair of the three HRV vaccine lots, the limits of 90% CI for the ratio of serum anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs were within the pre-specified limits (0.5-2). Consistency of the manufacturing process was therefore demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy

Immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine was evaluated in ten clinical trials. A total of 4,802 subjects (3,635 vaccines and 1,167 placebo recipients) were included in the according to protocol (ATP*) cohort for immunogenicity. Final immunogenicity data were available for a subset of 4,517 subjects (ATP immunogenicity cohort).

- Eight of these clinical trials were completed ([Rota-003, Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-021 - HRV arm, and Rota-033).
- Two trials were still ongoing. The final immunogenicity analysis is presented from study Rota-013 and an interim immunogenicity analysis from study Rota-024.

All ongoing trials are being conducted with the HRV.

Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in four trials conducted in different regions of the world; Europe (Rota-004), Latin America (Rota-006), Asia (Rota-007), and Latin America and Finland (023)

- In studies Rota-004 and Rota-006, a total of 2,214 subjects (1,637 vaccinees and 577 placebo recipients) were followed-up over the first efficacy follow-up period and a total of 802 subjects (573 vaccines and 229 placebo recipients) were followed up for up to 22 month.
- In Rota-007 the vaccine efficacy was evaluated in the total vaccinated cohort, comprising 2,421 subjects (1,779 vaccines and 642 placebo recipients), over the combined first and second year efficacy period.
- In Rota-023 the pivotal phase III trial 63,225 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated (31,673 vaccine and 31,552 placebo recipients). The mean duration of the efficacy follow-up was 8 months. A part of the efficacy subset is being followed for efficacy and safety up to 24 months of age.

*In study 005 a small subset of 83 infants (67 vaccinees and 16 placebo recipients) were followed for GE in order to provide logistical information for conducting future rotavirus efficacy trials.

** The 2 year efficacy data are not available yet.

§ In study 007 efficacy was an endpoint but no accurate calculation was possible due to the low number of rotavirus GE stool samples (See Section 2.5.4.3.2). Efficacy was calculated on the total vaccinated cohort for the combined efficacy follow-up period.

# number of subjects included in the total enrolled cohort with available interim immunogenicity results.

## All subjects had to fulfil the following inclusion criteria:

- Male or female between the ages specified in the protocol at the time of the first vaccination.
- Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.
- Written informed consent obtained from the parents or guardians.
- Born after a normal gestation period (between 36 and 42 weeks).
- In study Rota-013, only subjects whose mothers were HIV negative were enrolled. The HIV status of mothers was therefore ascertained before infants were enrolled.
- In study Rota-024, only subjects who the investigator believed that their parents/guardians could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol were enrolled in the study.

The following were exclusion criteria:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the study vaccine or placebo, or planned use during the study period.
- Planned administration of a vaccine (including routine paediatric vaccines) not foreseen by the study protocol within 14 days before and after any dose of study vaccine.
- Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressive or other immune-modifying drugs since birth (topical steroids were allowed).
- Use of antibiotics within 14 days preceding the study vaccine administration and during the first 7 days after vaccine administration.
- Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease or other serious medical condition as determined by the investigator.
- Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including HIV infection.
- History of allergic disease or reaction likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.
- Acute disease at time of enrolment: acute disease was defined as the presence of moderate or severe illness with fever i.e. temperature ≥ 100.4°F ( ≥ 38.0°C) as measured by a rectal thermometer.
- Vaccination should be postponed if the subject had gastro-enteritis within the past 7 days. In Rota-005 and 013 this criterion led to exclusion.
- Household contact with an immunosuppressed individual or pregnant woman.
- Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.
- Previous confirmed occurrence of rotavirus gastro-enteritis.

In study 014 and 013 there were two additional exclusion criteria:

- Previous routine vaccination except BCG, HBV and OPV vaccination at birth (should be documented in the CRF).
- History of/or intercurrent polio disease

In Rota-024 there was one additional exclusion criterion: children unlikely to remain in the study area for the duration of the study

Hypersensitivity reaction due the vaccine and previous occurrence of intussusception (Rota-005, 006, 007, 013, 014, 021 and 033) were considered as absolute contraindications to further administration of HRV vaccine or placebo. Rectal temperature ≥ 100.4°C ( ≥ 38°C) and gastro-enteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration constituted a contraindication to administration of vaccine or placebo at that point in time; the subject could be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specified in the protocol, or withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator.

The contraindications to the routinely co-administered vaccines are described in each of the protocols.

## Design and Treatment

All studies were double blind with respect to rotavirus vaccination and were placebo controlled.

All studies were randomised. A randomisation blocking scheme was used to ensure that the balance between treatments was maintained. The randomisation number uniquely identified the vaccine dose to be administered to any subject.

In studies Rota-003 and Rota-004 feeding 1 hour prior to vaccination was prohibited. In all other studies feeding was unrestricted with respect to vaccination.

The vaccination schedule in the target population consisted of two doses of 1 ml from the age of 5 weeks onwards. An interval of at least one month was respected between the 2 doses: vaccination schedules such as 6-10 weeks, 10-14 weeks, 2-4 months, 3-4 months were assessed. The immunisation schedules used were based on the respective official country recommendations.

No routine paediatric vaccines were co-administered with the study vaccine in trials Rota-003 and Rota-004. In studies 005, 006, 007, 013, 014, 020, 021, 024 and 033, the concomitant administration of the HRV vaccine with other routinely administered vaccines was assessed for the following

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigens: DTPa, DTPa-IPV and Hib, DTPw-HBV and Hib, HBV, Hib, S. pneumoniae, OPV (oral polio vaccine) and IPV

In studies Rota-006, Rota-021 and Rota-033, the administration of OPV was separated from the administration of HRV or placebo and the co-administered routine vaccines by at least two weeks. In studies Rota-013, Rota-014 and Rota-024 OPV was co-administered with the HRV vaccine.

## Objectives

The objectives for all studies were to assess efficacy and/or immunogenicity and safety of the HRV vaccine (see also study 023).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Clinical efficacy was defined as prevention of rota virus gastro enteritis (RVGE) and defined as an episode of gastroenteritis occurring at least two weeks after dose 2, in which rotavirus other than vaccine strain was identified in a stool sample collected not later than 7 days after onset of symptoms. In studies 004 (Finland) and 007 (Singapore), GE was defined as presence of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. In study 006, GE was defined as presence of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was defined as three or more looser than normal stools within a day. Vomiting was defined as one or more episodes of forceful emptying of partially digested stomach contents ≥ 1 hour after feeding within a day. GE episodes were analysed according the Vesikari scale, which takes into account the intensity and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting, the intensity of fever and dehydration as well as the need for treatment (hospitalisation). Two RVGE episodes were considered as two separate episodes if there were 5 or more symptom-free days between the episodes. Time periods during which subjects were to be followed for occurrence of gastroenteritis (GE) were specified in each study protocol.

In study Rota-023, the pivotal Phase III trial, the primary efficacy objective was to determine if two doses of HRV vaccine could prevent severe RVGE caused by the circulating wild-type RV strains.

The diagnosis of RVGE was based on the demonstration of the virus in the stools. Rotavirus antigen in stool samples collected during the efficacy follow-up were analysed by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Comparison of the results of ELISA and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) showed concordance between both methods for all moderate to severe cases. RT-PCR detected more cases; most of these cases were associated with vaccine virus shedding.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity of HRV was determined by testing for anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies in paired samples. A seropositive subject was defined as a subject whose antibody concentration was ≥ 20 U/ml, the assay cut-off value. Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of anti-rotavirus IgA antibody concentration ≥ 20 U/ml post-HRV vaccinations in subjects who were negative for anti-rotavirus IgA prior to the first vaccine administration. A serum sample was collected approximately 6-12 months after the administration of the second vaccine dose in studies 004, 005 and 006.

Immune response to concomitantly administered antigens was determined when appropriate.

## Vaccine take

Vaccine take was calculated as a combined endpoint of serum IgA antibody seroconversion and/or antigen positivity in post vaccination stool samples.

## Statistical methods

Efficacy analysis was performed on the per protocol cohort (primary analysis) and on the total cohort. A global overview of the number of GE episodes and RVGE episodes reported by the subjects from 2 weeks after dose 2 until approximatively one year of age was provided for studies 004, 006 and 023. The percentage of subjects reporting RVGE (any and severe intensity) was calculated by group with its 95% CI.

## Study 023 (pivotal study)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study Rota-023 is the pivotal Phase III trial, which evaluated the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine (co-primary endpoints). In total 63,225 infants were enrolled at 2 and 4 months of age. The analysis of the safety data coming from these 63, 225 subjects up until study visit 3 (30 to 90 days after the 2nd dose of HRV/placebo (median time of 100 days)) is complete. In a subset of subjects the HRV vaccine to prevent severe RVGE (co-primary endpoint) was evaluated. In this subset 20,169 infants (10,159 in the HRV group and 10,010 in the placebo group) from Latin American countries were included. The infants were followed for occurrence of severe GE until 12 months of age (first follow-up period). The mean duration of the efficacy follow-up period starting at 2 weeks post-dose 2 was 8 months. First year efficacy results have become available. A part of the efficacy subset (13 000 subjects planned) is being followed for efficacy and safety up to 24 months of age.

The primary efficacy objective was, to determine if two doses of HRV vaccine could prevent severe RV GE caused by the circulating wild-type RV strains during the period starting from 2 weeks after Dose 2 until one year of age. Assuming a 1.5% incidence of severe RV GE in the placebo group during the observation period, and a 70% vaccine efficacy, the sample size of 20 000 subjects had at least 80% power to detect a lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the vaccine efficacy above 50%.

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort (9,009 subjects in HRV group and 8,858 subjects in the placebo group) with severe RVGE caused by the circulating wild-type RV strains as endpoint. Demographic characteristics (age at each dose, gender distribution and race) of the two study groups were comparable.

Severe GE was defined as an episode of diarrhoea with three or more loos stools that required hospitalization and/or WHO treatment plan B or C in a medical facility. Stool samples were tested by ELISA to detect the presence of rotavirus (RV) antigen and were serotyped using a RT-PCR technique.

## · Efficacy of HRV vaccine against severe GE until one year of age

RV infection accounted for 24% of all severe GE episodes in the placebo group.

A secondary analysis using the Vesikari scale to assess the intensity of GE episodes showed an efficacy against severe RVGE (i.e. score ≥ 11) was 84. 8% [95% CI: 71.1%, 92.7%].

## · Type-specific protection induced by HRV vaccine

Multiple RV serotypes were circulating and the number of RV GE cases for each serotype was sufficiently large to make an evaluation of vaccine efficacy against severe RV GE by serotype possible (G1P[8], G2 P[4], G3 P[8] and G9 P[8]).

Vaccine efficacy against severe RV GE by RV G-type from 2 weeks after Dose 2 up to Visit 4 - Study Rota-023 (ATP efficacy cohort):

- -G1P[8]: 91.8% [95% CI: 74.1% ,98.4%]

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -G9P[8]: 90.6% (95% CI: 61.7%; 98.9%).
- -G3P[8]: 87.7% (95% CI: 8.3%; 99.7%).
- -G2P[4]: 41.0% (95% CI: -79.2%, 82.4)
- -Overall P[8] serotypes: 90.9% (95% CI: 79.2-96.8)

Vaccine efficacy against severe RV GE was evaluated for each non-G1 serotype. Fewer subjects in the vaccine group than in the placebo group reported severe RVGE episodes caused by the G2 P[4] type but the difference did not reach statistical significance due to the limited number of cases observed (6 versus 10, two-sided Fisher's exact P-value = 0.328).

## Study 004 (Finland)

The primary objective of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to determine if two doses of HRV vaccine could prevent any RV GE over one season following vaccination (primary objective). The secondary objectives addressed efficacy against severe GE during the first and second season, efficacy against any RV GE during the second season, combined efficacy over the two seasons, reactogenicity and safety. Subjects were randomized in two groups (2:1) to receive HRV vaccine (10 4.7 ffu) and placebo. Two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered to healthy infants aged 6 to 12 weeks in a 0, 2-month schedule. All subjects received their scheduled routine vaccinations 14 days apart from the study vaccine doses. Feeding 1 hour prior to vaccination was prohibited.

In total, 405 infants (mean age 8.3 weeks) were enrolled in the study with 270 infants receiving the HRV vaccine. A statistically significant decrease in the percentage of subjects reporting any or severe rotavirus GE was detected in the HRV vaccine group as compared to the placebo group. Two doses of HRV vaccine at viral concentration 10 4.7 ffu were effective in preventing severe rotavirus GE illness.

Severe was defined as a score with ≥ 11 points on the 20-point Vesikari scale.

One month after the second dose of HRV vaccine 80.4% of subjects in the HRV vaccine group were serum anti-RV IgA seropositive (GMCs: 164.0 U/ml)

## Study 006 (Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela)

The primary objective of the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was to determine if two doses HRV vaccine could prevent RV GE during the first efficacy follow-up period. The secondary objectives assessed efficacy against severe RV GE during the first efficacy follow-up period, the efficacy against rotavirus serotypes during the first efficacy follow-up period; the efficacy against any and severe RV GE observed during the second efficacy follow-up period; the immune response to concomitantly administered routine vaccinations; and the effect of unrestricted feeding on the immune response to HRV vaccine. Subjects were randomised into 4 groups (1:1:1:1): 3 vaccine groups (viral concentrations: 10 4.7 , 10 5.2 and 10 5.8 ffu) and a placebo group. Two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered to healthy infants aged 6 to 12 weeks in a 0, 2 month schedule. A subset of subject received a third dose (0, 2, 4 month schedule). Routine vaccines (DTPw-HBV, Hib) were concomitantly administered. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was separated from the study vaccines by a 2-week period. Feeding prior to vaccination was permitted.

A total of 2,276 subjects (mean age 8.3 weeks) were enrolled in the study and a total of 1,709 received the HRV vaccine. A statistically significant decrease in the percentage of subjects reporting any or severe rotavirus GE, as well as those that were hospitalised for rotavirus GE, was detected in the HRV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group as compared to the placebo group. Efficacy to prevent severe rotavirus GE illness ranged from 65.8% (95% CI, 32.2-83.9) to 85.6% (95% CI, 63.0-95.6) depending on the viral concentration (10 4.7 , 10 5.2 , 10 5.8 ). Efficacy against a rotavirus GE episode of any severity ranged from 55.7% (95% CI, 25.3-74.5) to 70.0 % (95% CI, 45.7-84.4) . Protective efficacy against hospitalisation for rotavirus GE, ranged from 65.4% (95% CI, -1.8 - 90.2) to 93.0% (95% CI, 53.7-99.8).

Pooling the results from the groups in study 006 receiving the HRV vaccine with viral concentrations of 10 5.2 and 10 5.8 ffu results in a protective efficacy against any, severe and hospitalised rotavirus GE of 62.9%, 78.3% and 86.0%, respectively. This pooling gives a fair estimate of a protective viral concentration of 10 5.5 ffu. These data support the proposed specification of the titres (10 6.0 CCID 50) at the end of the shelf-life.

(Combined Vaccine take was assessed in 107, 109 and 106 subjects in the groups receiving the HRV vaccine at viral concentration of 104.7ffu, 105.2ffu and 105.8ffu, respectively).

Seroconversion rates and vaccine take rates in the three vaccine groups post dose 2 were similar. A trend toward higher anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs post dose 2 was observed in the 10 5.8 ffu HRV vaccine group as compared to the other vaccine groups. A subset of 121 infants from Brazil received a third dose of the HRV vaccine or placebo to assess the impact on the HRV immune response. The administration of the third dose seems to further increase the immune response, however some seroconversion was observed in the placebo group, which is indicative of wild type RV infection. The majority of shedding occurred 7 days post first dose and the rate was similar in all groups. The response to HRV was similar in subjects who had been breast-fed and formula fed. The administration of the HRV vaccine did not alter the immune response to the concomitantly administered routine vaccines or the response to the three polio viral strains.

## Study 007 (Singapore)

The primary objective of this double-blind, randomised, controlled study was to determine if two doses of HRV vaccine could prevent RV GE during the first efficacy follow-up. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine at 3 viral concentrations were assessed. The immune response to concomitantly administered routine vaccinations and the effect of unrestricted feeding on the immune response to HRV vaccine were evaluated. Subjects were randomised into 4 groups (1:1:1:1): 3 vaccine groups (10 4.7 , 10 5.2 and 10 6.1 ffu) and a placebo group. Two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered to healthy infants aged 11 to 17 weeks in a 0, 1 month schedule. Routine vaccinations (DTPa-IPV/Hib) were administered concomitantly. Feeding prior to vaccination was permitted.

A total of 2,464 subjects (mean age 13.3 weeks) were enrolled in the study and a total of 1,811 received the HRV vaccine. The study was not conclusive for efficacy due to the smaller number of documented rotavirus GE cases than expected. However, based on the 6 episodes (2 in Group HRV 10 4.7 ffu and 4 in the placebo group) of rotavirus GE detected during the combined 13-month follow-up period, the vaccine efficacy for pooled vaccine groups was 82% (95% CI: -25.9 - 98.4); P-value = 0.046, which is consistent with the vaccine efficacy found in studies 004 and 006. The attack rate of rotavirus GE was much lower (0.6%) than expected (10-12%). The attack rate of rotavirus GE in Singapore may have been overestimated: there being no recent epidemiological reports on acute

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gastroenteritis in the general population in Singapore, the sample size of the present study was determined based on the attack rate observed in other published studies. In addition, the parents did not collect any stool sample in 41.5 % of the GE episodes, contrary to instructions that had been given. Thus the statistical power to conclude on the efficacy endpoints was not adequete.

(Combined Vaccine take was assessed in 35, 47 and 46 subjects in the groups receiving the HRV vaccine at viral concentration of 104.7ffu, 105.2ffu and 106.1ffu, respectively).

The seroconversion rates were higher in subjects receiving the HRV at a viral concentration of 10 5.2 ffu than in subjects receiving the HRV vaccine at 10 4.7 ffu. No further increase in seroconversion rates was observed in subjects who received the HRV vaccine at a viral concentration of 10 6.1 ffu. Vaccine take rates were close to 100%. The majority of shedding was seen 7 days post dose 1. There was no difference in the response to concomitantly administered vaccines in the groups, which received HRV vaccine, and the group, which received placebo.

- Analysis performed across trials (Post-hoc analyses, pooled analyses AND meta-analysis)

Efficacy against RVGE by severity in Rota-004 and Rota-006

In study 023 the primary endpoint was severe RVGE. The applicant presented an additional exploratory analysis of study 004 and 006 to support prevention against any RVGE.

Percentage of subjects who reported RV GE episode(s) and efficacy of the vaccine from day of Dose 1 till the end of the first efficacy follow-up period, by RV GE severity (total vaccinated cohort)

Vaccine efficacy was higher against the most severe forms of RVGE. This finding is expected since, it has also been found that efficacy estimates were higher against the more severe forms of diseases for other vaccines (for instance pertussis and varicella).

It should be emphasized that the studies were not designed to evaluate efficacy against mild or moderate RVGE and that in both studies 004 and 006, formulations with a lower viral titer than in the commercial formulation were tested.

## Efficacy against G2P[4]

To allow a more precise estimation of efficacy against severe RV GE due to G2P[4], a meta-analysis of efficacy against severe RV GE (score ≥ 11 on the Vesikari scale) caused by G2P[4] in studies 004, 006 and 023 was performed. In the analysis all Rotarix efficacy studies with reports of RV GE due to G2P[4] were included. Since in studies Rota-004 and -006 all GE were collected, whereas in study 023 only severe GE were collected, the same definition of severe RV GE across all studies was used, ie score ≥ 11 on Vesikari scale.

The vaccine's efficacy against severe RVGE caused by G2P[4] in study Rota-023 was 41.0% (95% CI, - 79.2%; + 82.4%). These results suggest efficacy against this particular serotype. The CHMP consider the prospectively obtained information form study 023 more relevant than the outcome of a meta-analysis.

## Co-administration

The studies described below support the CHMP recommendation on co-administration of routine paediatric vaccines.  The effect of the administration of the HRV vaccine on the response to routine paediatric vaccines was investigated as part of the clinical evaluation of the HRV vaccine in five trials: Rota-005 , Rota-006 (see above, main studies), Rota-007 (see above, main studies), Rota-013 and Rota-014 .

## Study 005 (USA)

The primary objective of the study was to assess the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of two doses of HRV vaccine at different viral concentrations in infants of approximately 2 months of age while permitting unrestricted feeding and administration of other routine childhood vaccinations concomitantly with HRV vaccine. The study was double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, with three parallel groups. Subjects were randomized (2:2:1) in three groups: 2 groups received the HRV vaccine (viral concentrations 10 5.2 ffu or 10 6.4 ffu) and the third group received placebo. Two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered to healthy infants aged 6 to 12 weeks in a 0, 2 month schedule. Routine vaccines (DTPa, Hib, IPV, 7Pn) were concomitantly administered and feeding prior to vaccination was permitted.

A total of 529 subjects (mean age 8.5 weeks) were enrolled in the study. A total of 421 subjects received the HRV vaccine.

There was no statistical difference in the combined vaccine take (co-primary endpoint) between the two vaccine groups (p = 0.153). The majority of shedding occurred 7 days post first dose and was similar between the two groups. The vaccine take rates were slightly lower in subjects who had been breast-fed compared to those who had been formula fed. The administration of the HRV vaccine did not alter the response to the routinely administered vaccines.

## Study 013 (South Africa)

The main objective of this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was to compare the immune response to the HRV vaccine after 2 and 3 doses. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and reactogenicity of the HRV vaccine and evaluate the response to OPV in all subjects. Subjects were randomised in parallel groups with an unbalanced allocation (2:2:1). One vaccine group received two doses of vaccine at 10 and 14 weeks of age, while the second vaccine group received three doses of vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. The third group received three doses of placebo. The HRV vaccine had a viral concentration of 10 6.5 CCID50. All routine vaccines, including OPV, were administered according to EPI schedule. All subjects were followed for the occurrence of GE through the RV season

A total of 475 subjects were enrolled (mean age 6.4 weeks), 190 subjects received 2 doses of HRV, 189 subjects received 3 doses of HRV and 96 subjects received 3 doses of placebo.

After two doses of HRV vaccine administered at the age of 10 and 14 weeks concomitantly with OPV, the seroconversion rate was 44.3% (95% CI, 35.6-53.2) which is similar to the seroconversion rate observed after three doses of HRV vaccine co-administered with OPV at the age of 6, 10 and 14 weeks, (44.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-53.2). Seroconversion among placebo recipients was low (1.7%). Therefore no marked increase in response to HRV vaccine was achieved by the administration of a dose at 6 weeks of age.

## Study 014 (South Africa)

The primary objective of this double-blind controlled study was to demonstrate that co-administration of HRV vaccine did not decrease the poliovirus immune response one month after the third dose of polio vaccine. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine when concomitantly administered with OPV(oral polio vaccine) or IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) were also assessed. Subjects were randomised in three groups (1:1:1): group 1 (HRV vaccine + OPV + DTPa/Hib); group 2 (HRV vaccine + DTPa-IPV/Hib) and group 3 (Placebo + OPV + DTPa/Hib). The study was conducted in two parts, part 1 prior to the start of the 2002 RV season and part 2 after the end of the 2002 RV season. In part 1, two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered at 6 and 10 weeks of age. In part 2, two doses of the vaccine/placebo were administered at 10 and 14 weeks of age. The HRV viral concentration was 10 5.2 ffu. Routine vaccinations were concomitantly administered and unrestricted feeding was permitted.

A total of 450 (271 in part 1 and 179 in part 2) subjects (mean age 6.2 weeks in part 1 and 10.9 weeks in part 2) were enrolled in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The co-administration of the HRV vaccine with OPV did not significantly decrease the response to the polioviruses post dose 3. The seroconversion rates, GMCs and HRV vaccine take rates one month post dose 1 and 2 are below.

The seroconversion after the first dose was lower in subjects receiving OPV co-administered with the HRV vaccine as compared to subjects who received IPV. After the second dose of HRV vaccine, the seroconversion rates and GMCs were similar in both groups.

## Study 036

Study Rota-036 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The study is evaluating the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of two doses of HRV (10 6.5 CCID50) in healthy infants in co-administration with specific childhood vaccines including GSK Biologicals' Infanrix Hexa® vaccine. The study vaccine and co-administered childhood vaccines were given according to the local national Plan of Immunisation schedule in each country (3, 4, 5 month schedule in the Czech Republic and 3, 5, 11-12 month regimen in Finland). Subjects aged 9 to 18 weeks at the time of the first dose received a hexavalent vaccine with the first and second doses of HRV vaccine or placebo, and a third dose of hexavalent in accordance with national immunization practices.

In Finland, 300 subjects enrolled at specific centres were part of the immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset. For the Czech Republic, all enrolled subjects were part of the immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset.

Interim data of the anti-HRV immune response are now available on subjects enrolled in the Czech Republic and Finland as well as interim immunogenicity results for concomitant vaccinations (post dose 3 for the Czech Republic, post dose 2 for Finland). The interim results of study Rota-036 (only the part conducted in the Czech Republic and Finland is shown), demonstrated that seropositivity/seroprotection rates as well as geometric mean concentrations of all antibodies to the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib antigens were similar between HRV and placebo recipients The immune response observed with HRV (10 6.5 CCID50) co-administered with hexavalent vaccine was as good as the response seen in study Rota-004 where HRV (10 4.7 ffu) was administered without concomitant vaccination and where 83.6% (95% CI: 78.1-88.2) of subjects had anti-rotavirus IgA antibody concentration ≥ 20 U/ml. Furthermore, immune responses and safety profiles of the co-administered vaccines were comparable. It should however be stressed that the immune response to polio 2 antigen was very low among both HRV vaccine and placebo recipients in Finland when compared with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Czech republic. The applicant committed to submit the final study report as soon as it becomes available.

## Study 024 (Brazil, Panama, Colombia, Argentina), interim analysis of immunogenicity/efficacy

A total of 1,851 subjects were enrolled (mean age 8.3 weeks), 1,234 subjects received 2 doses of HRV; 617 subjects received 2 doses of placebo. Routine childhood vaccines and OPV was administered concomitantly. The efficacy follow-up of this study is ongoing. However an interim analysis has been conducted for subset of 285 subjects (191 received HRV and 94 received placebo) and is presented at this time. The serum anti-RV IgA levels were measured 1 to 2 months after the last dose of HRV.

The immune response to the polio antigens is not impacted by co-administration of OPV with Rotarix, as shown by the largely overlapping 95% CI. An additional analysis of these results showed that the OPV response in the HRV group was non-inferior in terms of seroprotection rates for polio types 1, 2 and 3 compared to the OPV response in the placebo control group, with a non-inferiority limit of 10%

With respect to the immune response to Rotarix after co-administration with OPV, Rotarix given concomitantly with OPV in study Rota-024 was immunogenic in infants with 60.2% (95% CI: 52.9%; 67.2%) seropositivity rate for anti- rotavirus IgA antibodies. The seropositivity rate tended to be lower as compared to that seen in the other Latin American studies Rota-006 [69.5% (95% CI: 65.2%; 73.6%)] and Rota-023 [77.9% (95% CI: 73.8%; 81.6%)] where no OPV was co-administered, although an overlap in 95% CI's was observed between studies Rota-024 and -006.

## · Efficacy in special populations

Data on the efficacy and safety of the candidate vaccine among HIV infected infants are currently missing. Data on the efficacy and safety among prematurely born infants are limited. The applicant committed to perform further studies in immune compromised and preterm infants as part of the Risk Management Plan.

The applicant commits to further study the effectiveness of Rotarix in Africa.

## Breastfed infants

To document the impact of maternal antibodies on the immune response, serum levels of maternal antibodies (anti-rotavirus IgG and neutralising antibodies) were evaluated in pre-vaccination blood samples from a subsets of subjects. The results showed a trend towards a limited impact on HRV immunogenicity. However, it should be noted that Rotarix has been demonstrated to induce high protection against RV GE in studies Rota-006 and Rota-023 (overall efficacy of 85% in Rota-023 with the commercial formulation). As shown by data on breast feeding practices more than 90% of infants were breast-fed in these studies.

## · Supportive studies

## Study 003 (Finland )

One hundred ninety two (192) infants (mean age 8.3 weeks) were enrolled in the study with a total of 128 infants receiving the HRV vaccine. The serum anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and post vaccination GMCs observed in part 1 and part 3 were in similar ranges. In study parts, 2, 3 and 4 higher serum anti-RV IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs were observed with increasing viral concentrations. The seroconversion rates ranged from 72.7% to 95.7% and GMCs in all subjects ranged from 110.3 U/ml to 375.3 U/ml. The trend was more striking after the first dose. The percentage of vaccinees with rotavirus shedding was highest after the first dose and ranged from 37.5% to 60% in the HRV vaccine groups.

## Study 021 (Panama)

A total of 406 subjects (mean age 8.0 weeks) were enrolled in the study and a total of 177 and 178 subjects received the HRV and mHRV vaccines, respectively. Seroconversion rate and GMCs in the HRV vaccine group had an higher trend. Based on these results, the further development of the mHRV vaccine was abandoned.

## Study 033 (Mexico, Columbia, Peru)

A total of 855 subjects were enrolled (mean age 8.4 weeks), 243 subjects in Group HRV vaccine lot A, 242 subjects in Group HRV vaccine lot B, 246 subjects in Group HRV vaccine lot C and 124 subjects in the placebo group. For any pair of the three HRV vaccine lots, the limits of 90% CI for the ratio of serum anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs were within the pre-specified limits [0.5; 2].

The three consecutive production lots of the HRV vaccine were shown to be consistent in terms of seroconversion rates and reactogenicity.

## Safety

Safety data with the candidate HRV vaccine are available from:

- Eight studies with complete final data (003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 014, 021, 033) (7,369 subjects vaccinated)
- One study with final safety data (023), with respect to the primary safety objective (intussusception within the 0-30 day period after any dose) as well as to SAEs up to minimum one month post dose 2 is available (63,225 subjects vaccinated)
- SAEs arising from all ongoing studies up to the data lock point of August 31, 2004 are presented
- Supportive safety data are available from 3 studies with the mHRV vaccine (016, 020, 021) (893 subjects vaccinated)
- With respect to the incidence of IS, the applicant submitted the final study report of study SeroEpi-IS-204 (999910/204), which estimates the incidence of IS in children &lt; 24 months old in hospitals involved in study Rota-023. This study report is submitted as background information to assess the incidence of hospital-related IS in unvaccinated children under 2 years of age in the same countries as study Rota-023 (except, for the inclusion of Costa Rica and exclusion of Venezuela and Finland)

## Study 023

In study 023, the pivotal phase III trial 63,225 subjects were enrolled to evaluate the safety of the HRV vaccine with respect to definite IS diagnosed within 31 days after each HRV vaccine dose. Final safety data with respect to the primary safety objective (intussusception within the 0-30 day period after any dose) as well as to SAEs up to minimum one month post dose 2 are included in this report.

- Intersusseption (IS)

A total of 63,225 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated; 31,673 subjects received the HRV vaccine and 31,552 subjects received the placebo. The safety follow-up period was from dose 1 up until study visit 3 (30-90 days post vaccination) for these subjects

Parents/guardians and investigators were informed prior to study start about IS risk and symptoms. Clinical investigations were performed on every case of IS which occurred, and the subjects were followed until the event subsided.

A number of biological samples (stool samples, throat swabs, blood samples (acute and convalescent sera), intestinal and lymph node biopsies if surgery was performed) were collected at the IS treatment site. Several characterization assays (detection rotavirus, enteroviruses and adenoviruses in tissue, stools, throat &amp; rectal swabs; detection of anti-RV IgA and RV RNA in acute and convalescent sera, respectively; and detection of bacterial enteropathogen in stool samples) were performed. In the event that RV was detected, the viral RNA was sequenced to distinguish wild type strains from the vaccine viral strain.

Totally 25 definite IS cases adjudicated by the CEC and diagnosed from Dose 1 until study visit 3 are included in the analysis on definite IS:

- 13 cases (6 in the HRV vaccine group and 7 in the placebo group) were diagnosed within the 31-day risk window after any dose
- 12 (3 in the HRV vaccine group and 9 in the Placebo group) cases were diagnosed beyond the 31-day risk window.

Of the 25 definite IS cases, 10 cases (3 in the HRV vaccine group and 7 in the Placebo group) occurred after Dose 1 and 15 cases (6 in the HRV vaccine group and 9 in the Placebo group) occurred after Dose 2. The primary safety objective was met. The observed Risk Difference of -0.32/10 000

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(95%CI: -2.91/10 000; 2.18/10 000) and the Relative Risk of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.30; 2.42) provide evidence of no increased risk of IS in the HRV vaccine group as compared to placebo.

In study 023, there were a total of 99 fatal cases reported up until the data lock point of September 10, 2004. Fifty-six cases were reported in the HRV group (17.7 per 10,000) and 43 (13.6 per 10,000) in the placebo group (p value = 0.198). Various diagnoses have contributed to the fatalities and none of the cases were assessed as related to vaccination by the investigators.

A potential imbalance was noted for one cause of death coded to MedDRA preferred term 'Pneumonia'. Pneumonia was reported by 14 subjects in the HRV vaccine group versus 5 subjects in the placebo group as the primary cause of death.

Given the overlap between pneumonia and bronchopneumonia and the fact that the etiologic pathogen was not recovered in all cases, all deaths coded to these three preferred terms were grouped together for an ad hoc exploratory analysis to evaluate any potential imbalance. There was no potential imbalance noted between groups for fatal SAEs related to various PT categories for pneumonia (based on predefined exploratory &lt; 0.05 significance level).

The majority of subjects who reported a SAE coded to pneumonia were hospitalised, 277/280 subjects in HRV vaccine group versus 273/277 subjects in the placebo group. A temporal association between a primary CoD of pneumonia and HRV vaccination was not established.

SAEs classified under the 'Infections and Infestations' were most frequently reported (234.9 per 10,000 in the HRV vaccine group and 272.2 per 10,000 in the placebo group). The next most frequently reported system organ class category (SOC) was the 'Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders' (30.3 per 10,000 in the HRV vaccine group and 28.2 per 10,000 in the placebo group).

SAEs related to the MedDRA SOC 'Nervous system disorders' were evenly distributed between HRV and Placebo groups (29 versus 29 cases). However, when analysing PTs within the Nervous system category, a potential imbalance in favour of the placebo was noted for SAEs classified under the MedDRA PT 'Convulsion'. From Dose 1 until Visit 3, at least one SAE relating to 'convulsion' was reported by 16 subjects in the HRV vaccine group versus 6 subjects in the Placebo group. These apparent signals were then reviewed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the potential imbalance. Additional exploratory group comparisons were performed, indicating that the observed potential imbalance is likely to be a chance finding and not clinically relevant. All cases were assessed as not related to vaccination by the investigators.

## Other studies

- Adverse events

Solicited adverse events included irritability, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, fever, vomiting and cough/runny nose. There was no increase in the reactogenicity following HRV vaccination as compared to the placebo administration. There was no significant difference between the respective vaccine groups, receiving vaccine of different potency (viral concentrations in the range of 10 5.2 ffu 10 6.2 ffu per dose), nor between the placebo group and the vaccine groups with regard to fever, vomiting or diarrhoea grade/intensity 3 during the 15-day follow-up period.

When routine paediatric vaccines were given concomitantly with HRV vaccine or placebo, the applicant concluded that the solicited adverse events were due to the paediatric vaccines. For this reason the Company proposes to present in the SPC only the pooled incidences of solicited symptoms from subjects receiving the HRV vaccine in the absence of concomitant vaccines (Studies Rota-003 and Rota-004). This proposal was accepted by CHMP.

Unsolicited symptoms classified in MedDRA as infections and infestations (preferred terms: bronchitis, influenza, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection and viral infection) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Of unsolicited adverse events bronchitis was reported in 1.95% and 1.03% of subjects receiving HRV vaccine and placebo, respectively. Only one case of bronchitis was related to vaccination, i.e. 0.02% of 5,543 subjects, and no cases in the placebo group. Nine cases (0.16%) of upper respiratory tract infection were probably

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related to administration of the HRV vaccine. However, this incidence was not significantly different from that of the placebo group (p=0.128).

The incidence of pyrexia was similar between HRV and placebo recipients (3.75% versus 3.94%, respectively). Only 0.09% and 0.05% of the cases of pyrexia observed in the HRV and placebo groups, respectively, were related to vaccination. These observations confirm the results of fever seen in the analyses of solicited symptoms.

Similar rates with grade 3 intensity of all unsolicited symptoms reported as causally related to vaccination were seen between HRV and placebo groups.

The use of medication was similar between subjects receiving HRV vaccine and placebo in all studies. There was no increase in the use of medication after the second (and third) HRV vaccine dose as compared to the use after the first dose. There was no increase in the use of medication with higher viral concentrations of HRV vaccine. As could be expected, the use of antipyretics was higher in studies where the subjects had received DTPa or DTPw based vaccines concomitantly with the HRV vaccine than in studies where the HRV vaccine was administered alone.

## DEATHS

A total of 18 deaths were reported in studies Rota-003, Rota-004, Rota-005, Rota-006, Rota-007, Rota-014, Rota-016, Rota-020, Rota-021 and Rota-033. Twelve deaths were reported in subjects who had received the HRV or mHRV vaccine (0.19%; 95%CI: 0.10-0.33) vaccine and 6 deaths were reported in subjects who had received the placebo or mPlacebo (0.30%; 95%CI: 0.11-0.65). All fatalities were assessed as not related to the study vaccines by the investigators. Most of the fatalities can be explained by the underlying medical condition. Two fatalities were caused by accidental events. Eight of the 18 deaths occurred in study Rota-014. Three deaths were reported in subjects who had received the HRV vaccine and 5 deaths were reported in subjects who had received placebo. Six out of eight subjects were found to be HIV positive and the cause of death was found to be HIV related. This trial was conducted in South Africa where there is a high prevalence of HIV and a subsequently high infant mortality rate (42 deaths per 1,000 live births). The death rate observed in study Rota-014, part 1, is 26 per 1,000 for a follow-up period of ca.10.5 months after birth was lower than the national and provincial figures for South Africa.

## SAEs leading to hospitalisation

The number of subjects with SAEs leading to hospitalisation from Dose 1 up to study visit 3 was reviewed post-hoc as part of the safety analysis given their clinical significance. Of the 1975 subjects with SAEs, 1889 (95.6%) were actually hospitalised. There was significantly less hospitalisation in the HRV vaccine group compared to the placebo group (886 versus 1003, two-sided asymptotic P-value = 0.005).

When hospitalised SAEs under the MedDRA SOC 'Infections and infestations' were analysed excluding the potential impact of GE related events, there was no potential imbalance between the treatment groups (627 in the HRV vaccine groups versus 654 in the Placebo group)

- Safety in special populations

HIV infected infants were excluded from vaccination.

The applicant committed to address the safety of the vaccine in preterm and immune compromised infants in the 'Risk Management Plan'.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Routine paediatric vaccines were concomitantly administered with the candidate vaccine. There was no difference in reactogenicity and safety between subjects who received the candidate vaccine simultaneously with routine paediatric vaccines and subjects who received routine paediatric vaccines together with placebo.

The widespread prophylactic use of antipyretic treatment in studies Rota-005 and, to a lesser extent, in study Rota-006, precludes a valid conclusion on the impact of the vaccine and concomitantly administered vaccines on the incidence of fever. Children who received prophylactic treatment should be excluded for assessing the incidence of fever in these studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

There is no significant difference in the number of drop-outs due to AES in the respective vaccine groups and placebo groups.

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market

##  Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan. The postmarketing safety surveillance will rely on standard pharmacovigilance activities based on passive surveillance and additionally, specific surveillance activities are planned in the early postmarketing period for addressing potential safety risks and missing information:

The vaccine contains 9 mg of sucrose as an excipient. This amount is far too low to cause adverse events in patients with rare hereditary problems such as fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency. Therefore these words of caution should not be mentioned in the section 4.3 (contraindications) and can be downgraded to section 4.4.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 6. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The  dossier  covers  the  rotavirus  active  substance  manufactured  in  serum  free  conditions  and  the lyophilised rotavirus vaccine as finished product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Applicant  detailed  the  manufacturing  processes,  including  the  'in  process'  controls  and acceptance criteria. The control of virus seed lots and Vero cell bank system is adequately presented, as well as the genetic stability studies for the Human Rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 strain. The analytical control procedures are summarised and the validation parameters, acceptance criteria and validation results are reported, as the references to international requirements in force. The Applicant committed to submit the stability data for the intermediates as for the final vaccine on an ongoing basis. The accepted shelf life for the HRV lyophilised vaccine is 36 months at +2-8°C. In conclusion, the benefit/risk ratio was found positive with regard to the quality of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

In a first study, the antibody response was investigated by analysing seroconversion. No induction of diarrhoea and no seroconversion has been observed in the proposed Fisher rat model regardless the age of the animals and the rotavirus strain administered. In a second study, the vaccine take was defined as the combination of seroconversion and/or viral shedding (by RT-PCR analysis of rotavirus mRNA in the stools), which is a more accurate measure of animal exposure than seroconversion alone. The seroconversion and viral shedding induced by different doses of the RIX4414 vaccine administered either alone or with CaCO3 in two different granularities was studied. Although from the data obtained in this preliminary experiment, it cannot be concluded that the addition of CaCO3 has a beneficial effect, there is a clinical need for addition of CaCO3 (neutralisation of the acidic pH of the stomach).

In both preliminary pharmacodynamic studies in Fisher rats, no induction of diarrhea has been observed. The capability of group A rotaviruses to replicate and induce diarrhoea in rats has been suggested to be rat-strain specific. Therefore, the choice of the Fisher rat for the development of the pre-clinical animal model is questioned. An animal model that closely resembles the human disease should have been used. However, CHMP agreed that at the current stage of vaccine development, with protection data documented in humans, further primary pharmacodynamic studies in animals are not approbriate.

## Toxicology

No separate study was performed to assess the single dose toxicity of the candidate vaccine. However, full investigations were performed after the first oral vaccine dose administration in rats, during the GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity study.

The vaccine formulation used in the repeated-dose toxicity study is different from the one used in the final clinical trials. With respect to inherent toxicities of the product, the additional excipient (xanthan) is not assumed to change the safety profile of the RIX4414 final vaccine. Xanthan is widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient and generally regarded as non-toxic. In addition, the differences in the formulation raise no concern with respect to hepatotoxicity (liver enzyme elevations have been reported with human rotavirus disease), but were absent with the formulation used in the repeateddose toxicity study.

Studies on genotoxic and carcinogenic potential were not performed; this is in line with the note for guidedance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/495/95).

Taking the intended target population for the vaccine, which includes newborns, infants and toddlers and not humans of childbearing age, as well as the nature of the product into account, studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity are not necessary (CPMP/SWP/465/95 and ICH S6).

A specific study on local tolerance has not been performed, since microscopic investigations of esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine were reported in the repeated dose toxicity study in the rat.

The potential for hypersensitivity and autoimmune reactions by Rotarix has not been investigated in an animal model. Even large-scale clinical trials cannot prove that a vaccine is completely safe in this respect. Ultimately, post marketing surveillance studies are the only tool to study whether a new vaccine can cause autoimmune disease or allergic reactions or not.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, the applicant has followed a minimalistic approach in the non-clinical support of this new vaccine, which is line with the note for guidedance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/495/95).

## Efficacy

The clinical protection elicited by two doses of the candidate vaccine against rotavirus gastroenteritis due to serotype G1P[8], G3P[8] and G9P[8] was demonstrated in the clinical studies. However crossprotection against gastroenteritis caused other serotypes is not sufficiently demonstrated in the clinical trials. The applicant could not demonstrate cross protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis due to serotype G2[P4] type. This is not an unexpected finding, since immune response to HRV is dependent on both, G and P type. Cross protection against strains with neither G1 or P[8] moiety can not be expected. Similarly, immunogenicity (tested in 10 studies) varied across different geographic areas. With a similar viral load, the candidate vaccine provided a difference in seroconversion rates and vaccine take in Finland (Rota-004), Singapore (Rota-007) and Latin American countries (Rota-006)..

Although the efficacy data were broken down with regard to protection against mild, moderate and severe disease and protection against 'severe' HRV infection was demonstrated it was agreed that mentioning 'protection against severe disease' in the SPC might lead to misunderstanding and have a negative impact on the vaccine uptake.

Data on the efficacy and safety of the candidate vaccine among HIV infected infants are currently missing. Data on the efficacy and safety among prematurely born infants are limited. The applicant committed to perform further studies in immune compromised and preterm infants as part of the Risk Management Plan. The applicant further committed to investigate the efficacy and safety in Africa.

Upon request the applicant provided an analysis of vaccine take and combined seroconversion rates for each HRV viral concentration tested according to feeding habits. It was concluded that breastfeeding had no clinical effect. This is reflected in section 4.6 of the SPC

The vaccine can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. Concomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune response to the respective polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the immune response to rotavirus vaccine there is currently no evidence that clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis would be affected. The immune response to Rotarix is unaffected when OPV is administered two weeks apart from Rotarix. This is reflected in section 4.5 of the SPC.

The ongoing study 024 will provide additional efficacy data after co-administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine. The applicant committed to provide 1-year efficacy data by mid 2007.

## Safety

For all studies, the incidences of solicited general symptoms (irritability, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, fever and vomiting) were comparable between the vaccine and placebo recipients. There was no increased incidence of symptoms neither with increasing number of doses nor with increasing viral concentration. The vaccine did not induce gastroenteritis-like symptoms. A total of 25 cases of intussusception (IS) were diagnosed in study Rota-023, from which 13 were within the 31-day window period after vaccination. The incidence of IS was not significantly different between the vaccine and placebo groups and the upper limit of 95% CI of the difference between these group (2.18/10,000) was lower than the pre-specified limit of 6/10,000. Sporadic, naturally occurring intussusception tends to peak in incidence between 5 to 9 months of age, and occurs only very rarely before that age. The studies have been performed in children younger than 5 months and the data provided by the applicant did not show evidence that intussusception is age related. Taking this into consideration and in order to accommodate the diversity in the European vaccination schedules, it is decided to allow more flexibility for the time point of the second dose. Thefollowing wording for section 4.2 is decided by the CHMP: The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose should be given between 6 and 14 weeks of age. 'The interval between doses should be at least 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weeks. The second dose should be given preferably before 16 weeks and not later than the age of 24 weeks'&gt;

In  study  Rota-023,  within  the  unsolicited  AEs,  there  is  a  very  weak  signal  represented  by bronchitis. Presence of a safety signal with respect to bronchitis will be investigated in the ongoing Rota036 study

## Benefit/risk assessment

The major efficacy and safety concerns have been satisfactorily addressed. Clinical studies in Europe and Latin America have clearly demonstrated that two doses of Rotarix confer a clinical protection against rotavirus gastro-enteritis. In the absence of major safety issues, especially the fact that the vaccine did not increase the risk of intussusception, the benefit risk balance is positive.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns
- No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Rotarix indicated for the active immunisation of infants from the  age  of  6  weeks  for  prevention  of  gastro-enteritis  due  to  rotavirus  infection  was  favourable  and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
