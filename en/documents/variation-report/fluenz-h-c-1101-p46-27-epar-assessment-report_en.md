## 3.2. Clinical studies

## Study MI-CP111

Study MI-CP111 was a Phase 3, pivotal, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study that assessed the safety and relative efficacy of FluMist against trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV) in children 6 to 59 months of age.

Both the ca and ts phenotypes were preserved in all shed subtype A vaccine viruses tested for which results were available. For the A/H1N1 samples, 29 out of 30 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes, while for 1 sample results were not reportable, as the sample could not be amplified. For the A/H3N2 samples, 21 out of 33 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes, while for 12 samples results were not reportable. The reasons for the nonreportable results included inability to amplify the sample (10 samples), no further testing possible with the fluorescent focus assay (FFA) due to low titre (1 sample), and inconsistent retest results (1 sample). The sample having the inconsistent retest result

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the relative efficacy and assess the safety of FluMist compared to TIV. The secondary objectives were to estimate the relative effectiveness of FluMist compared to TIV and to assess the tolerability of FluMist compared to TIV. The study was conducted during the 2004-2005 influenza season in 16 countries in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either intranasal FluMist plus intramuscular placebo (N = 4,243) or intramuscular TIV plus intranasal placebo (N = 4,232). Subjects with no history of receipt of influenza vaccine received 2 doses 28 to 48 days apart, while subjects with a history of receiving influenza vaccine were administered one dose. Nasal swab specimens were collected from subjects with qualifying symptoms of influenza illness, within 24 hours of symptom recognition or as soon as possible thereafter. Influenza-positive samples were further assayed for genotype (wild-type vs vaccine-type), subtype (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B), and antigenic similarity to vaccine strains, as appropriate. FluMist demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to TIV against influenza illness due to matched strains, with a relative efficacy of 44.5%. Methods Viral harvests from influenza-positive nasal swab samples that had been collected &lt; 28 days after study vaccination (all influenza-positive samples collected &gt; 28 days after study vaccination were assumed to be wild-type) were prepared by local and central laboratories according to the protocolspecific procedures for viral cultures and provided to MedImmune for further characterization. Influenza-positive specimens were also tested by MedImmune using hexaplex PCR. For any sample that did not display the ca or ts phenotypes or yielded inconsistent results upon retesting, genetic sequencing was performed to definitively determine whether any genetic changes had occurred that altered the genotypic and phenotypic stability of the vaccine virus. Results Phenotypic Stability Data The phenotypic stability data for the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes and the B strain from Study MICP111 are presented in Table 7.1-1.

was initially tested in 2006, when it was shown to have lost the ts phenotype; the difference in average titres in the ts assay (33°C-39°C) was 1.9 log10 TCID50 (the threshold for temperaturesensitivity being a 2 log10 difference). Following retesting in 2010, the sample was assessed as retaining the ts phenotype, with difference in average titres of 3.7 log10 TCID50. A discussion of the sequencing data for this sample is provided in Section 7.2.1.

One A/H3N2 sample (from Subject 44200012) was initially tested in 2006 as not temperature sensitive (1.9 log10 TCID50 difference in titres), but following retesting in 2010, the sample was assessed as temperature sensitive (3.7 log10 TCID50 difference in titres). Based on these inconsistent results the sample underwent genomic sequencing. This sample had sequence changes located on 4 separate gene segments (PA, NP, NA, and PB1); these changes would predict 4 amino acid substitutions, with the amino acid change in the PB1 gene being at amino acid position 581, whereby a glycine was to a glutamic acid; this change occurred at a site previously identified as one of the 5 major determinants for the control of the ts phenotype (Jin et al, 2003). However, changes occurring solely at this specific amino acid are not considered sufficient to confer complete loss of the ts phenotype (Jin et al, 2003).

Of the 32 B strain samples, 10 retained the ca and ts phenotypes, 9 showed an apparent loss of the ts phenotype, 10 were not reportable for the ts phenotype, and 3 were not reportable for both the ca and ts phenotypes (Table 7.1-1). The reason for the 10 samples not having reportable results for the ts phenotype was inconsistent retest results between the original test in 2005 and the re-test in 2010. In 8 of the 10 samples, the initial test result showed the samples as retaining the ca and ts phenotypes; however, following retesting, these samples showed a loss in the ts phenotype. In the remaining 2 samples, the initial test result showed the samples as having the ca phenotype, but not the ts phenotype but, upon retesting, both samples were shown to have retained the ca and ts phenotypes. Reportable results were not available for both the ca and ts phenotypes for 3 samples as a result of the inability to amplify 2 samples, and no further testing was possible using the FFA due to low titre in 1 sample. Sequencing results from the samples that did not retain the ts phenotype are discussed in Section 7.2.2. Table 7.1-1 Phenotypic Stability of Vaccine-type Virus Samples, Intent-to-Treat Population Genomic Sequencing Data Results of sequencing for the samples from MI-CP111 that had not retained their ts phenotype are discussed below. Full genomic sequencing was performed on 1 A/H3N2 and 4 B strain samples, while partial sequencing at the known ca and ts sites (not at the known att site) was performed on 9 B strain samples.

The sequence changes predicting the other 3 amino acid changes did not occur at sites that are involved in controlling temperature sensitivity .

Previous work focused on characterizing the genetic basis for the ts phenotype has determined that, while sequence changes to single gene segments such as PB1 are able to partially revert the ts phenotype when introduced individually, sequence changes predicting a combination of 4 amino acid changes in the PB1, PB2 and NP gene segments are required to fully revert the ts phenotype (Jin et al, 2003). In addition, identification of a change in only the glutamic acid at position 581 in the PB1 gene showed a slight reduction in the ts phenotype at 38°C but no effect at 39°C; changes in 3 amino acids in this gene segment were required to decrease the virus ts phenotype at 39°C (Jin et al, 2003).

Study MI-CP114 was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind study in mildly to moderately immunocompromised children 5 to 17 years of age with cancer. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of FluMist compared to placebo. The secondary objectives were to describe the immune response and determine the incidence and duration of viral replication following vaccination with FluMist. The study was conducted outside the influenza season at 4 sites in the United States of America (USA). Subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intranasal dose of FluMist or placebo. A total of 20 subjects were enrolled and treated: 10 subjects in the FluMist group and 10 subjects in the placebo group.

As a result of the identified genetic change, the available clinical information for this subject was reviewed. Subject 44200012 was 12 months old at study entry and had a positive nasal swab on Day 9 after vaccination. From 01Nov2004 through 15Nov2004, the subject experienced low grade fever that did not exceed 38.3°C (100.9°F), a cough, and runny/stuffy nose for a duration of 9 days. The subject received Dose 2 of the vaccine and was followed through the end of the study. These symptoms are consistent with the established reactogenicity profile of live, attenuated influenza vaccine in young children, which can be characterized by low-grade fever and runny nose. B Strains Partial sequencing performed at the known ca and ts sites for 3 of the 9 samples that had not retained the ts phenotype revealed no changes in the 4 gene segments involved in controlling the ts phenotype (subject numbers 42830026, 43210034 and 45330026). Sequencing of the remaining 6 samples could not be performed, as there was an insufficient quantity of sample in 2010 to do further phenotyping or sequencing (subject numbers 42640062, 43590019, 43780011, 44220013, 44270008, and 80100068). For the 10 samples that had a nonreportable result for the ts phenotype, inconsistencies in the results were observed between the initial testing in 2005 (one sample was tested in 2006) and the retesting in 2010. Based on these inconsistent results, the samples underwent sequencing and results from 9 samples (genomic sequencing on 3 samples and partial sequencing at the known ca/ts sites on 6 samples) showed no changes in the 4 gene segments involved in controlling the ts phenotype. Genomic sequencing of one of the samples (from Subject 42830003) identified sequence changes predicting 2 amino acid substitutions: at position 14 of the NP gene segment (containing mixtures of isoleucine and valine), and at position 191 of the M1 gene (substitution of a glycine for a glutamic acid). None of the amino acid substitutions were at sites known to be associated with maintenance of the ca or ts. Study MI-CP114 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Methods

Nasal swab samples from each nostril were collected on Day 0 (before study vaccination), and at visits occurring between Days 3 to 5, Days 7 to 10, Days 14 to 21, (Days 22 to 28, if health assessment indicated presence of respiratory illness), and Days 35 to 42. Samples were placed in 4 mL of M4 viral transport media, stored at 2-8ºC, and shipped within 24 hours to the central laboratory. For those specimens that were determined to be influenza-positive at the central laboratory, an aliquot of the supernatant and an aliquot of the original stabilized swab solution were shipped to MedImmune for phenotyping, subtyping, genotyping, and sequencing.

Study FM026 was a Phase 4, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study that assessed the shedding, immunogenicity, and safety of FluMist administered to healthy subjects 5 to 49 years of age. The objectives of this study were to describe the proportion of subjects who shed vaccine strain viruses, the duration of shedding of vaccine viruses, the genotypic and phenotypic stability of shed vaccine viruses, the immune responses of FluMist, and the safety of FluMist in relation to shedding and the immune response. The study was conducted during the influenza off season at 11 sites in the USA. A total of 345 subjects were enrolled into the study, and 344 subjects received a single intranasal dose of FluMist: 102 subjects 5 to 8 years of age, 127 subjects 9 to 17 years of age, and 115 subjects 18 to 49 years of age.

For any sample that did not display the ca or ts phenotypes or yielded inconsistent results upon retesting, genetic sequencing was performed to definitively determine whether any genetic changes had occurred that altered the genotypic and phenotypic stability of the vaccine virus. Results Phenotypic Stability Data Phenotypic stability was examined in the per protocol population, which included subjects who received a full dose of study vaccine. Shedding of influenza vaccine virus was seen in 4 of the 10 subjects who received FluMist, 2 of whom shed type A vaccine viruses and 2 of whom shed type B vaccine viruses. Each subject shed one vaccine virus type and no vaccine virus was shed after Day 7 to 10. Phenotyping results were generated for all 4 subjects who shed vaccine virus. A total of 3 samples from the 2 subjects who shed type A virus were evaluated for the ca and ts phenotypes; both the ca and ts phenotypes were preserved for all 3 samples. Two samples from the 2 subjects who shed type B vaccine virus were evaluated for the ca and ts phenotypes. Both of the samples retained the ca phenotype but not the ts phenotype. Genomic Sequencing Data All type A vaccine virus samples were found to retain both the ca and ts phenotypes, therefore, sequencing of type A vaccine viruses was not performed. Directed sequencing at the known ca and ts sites was conducted for both type B vaccine virus samples that failed to retain the ts phenotype; no sequence changes to the vaccine virus were noted at these sites.

## Methods

## Phenotyping and Sequencing Evaluations

To characterize the phenotypic and genotypic stability of FluMist after intranasal vaccination, viruses from the nasal swab samples of subjects enrolled in Study FM026 were expanded in Rhesus monkey kidney (RMK) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and were evaluated for maintenance of the cold-adapted ( ca ) and temperature-sensitive ( ts ) phenotypes in an in vitro cell-based infectivity assay. For subjects who shed vaccine virus, the last positive nasal specimen confirmed as containing A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B was to be evaluated for phenotypic stability. For any sample that did not display the ca or ts phenotypes or yielded inconsistent results upon retesting, genetic sequencing was performed to definitively determine whether any genetic changes had occurred that altered the genotypic and phenotypic stability of the vaccine virus. Samples were initially evaluated in late 2005 through 2006 for phenotypic and genotypic stability.

45 subjects shed vaccine viruses confirmed as A/H1N1, 17 subjects shed vaccine viruses confirmed as A/H3N2, and 41 subjects shed vaccine viruses confirmed as B. For these subjects, the last positive nasal specimen confirmed as containing A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B was to be evaluated for phenotypic stability. The last positive nasal specimen (ie, the specimen that was positive with the longest time interval since vaccination) was selected to maximize the potential duration of intranasal replication and thus the possibility of accumulating mutations that might affect the ca and ts phenotypes.

Microneutralization Evaluations Serum samples (approximately 5-6 mL of blood) were obtained prior to dosing on Day 0 and at 28 days post dosing and were evaluated for strain-specific microneutralization titre for all subjects regardless of baseline serostatus as well as for those seronegative at baseline and those seropositive at baseline. Baseline serostatus was defined by strain-specific microneutralization titre: · Baseline seronegative subjects; titre ≤ 10 · Baseline seropositive subjects; titre &gt; 10 IgA Evaluations A total of 17 nasal swab samples were to be obtained from each subject in Study FM026: once daily from Study Days 1 to 7, every other day from Study Days 9 to 25, and on Study Day 28. Nasal swab samples collected on Days 1, 7, and 15 from a subset of 30 subjects (10 subjects 5 to 8 years of age; 10 subjects 9 to 17 years of age; and 10 subjects 18 to 49 years of age) were evaluated for IgA responses.

Due to a sample accessioning error, an additional 8 A/H1N1 samples, 2 A/H3N2 samples, and 2 B samples were also evaluated for phenotypic stability. These additional samples were either not the last positive sample for a given subject or were tested for a type or subtype that the subject had not been confirmed as shedding (e.g. a subject was confirmed by culture to be shedding only type B vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

virus but phenotyping was performed on an A strain in error). These additional samples tested in error are included in Listing 16 but are not presented in Table 6.3-1.

Table 6.3-1 presents the phenotypic stability results from the last positive quantifiable sample for all subjects using the original assay. Both the ca and ts phenotypes were preserved in all shed A strain vaccine viruses tested for which results were available. For A/H1N1 samples, 43 out of 45 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes while 2 samples had results not reportable. For A/H3N2 samples, 9 out of 17 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes while 8 samples had results not reportable.

## Genomic Sequencing Data

Because the phenotypic stability data generated for type B vaccine viruses were not consistent with historical FluMist data, clinical samples were sequenced to determine whether any genetic changes could be identified that might have led to an alteration in the ca and ts phenotypes. Results of sequencing for samples from Study FM026 that had not retained their ts phenotype are discussed below. Full viral genomic sequencing was performed on 5 samples, while partial sequencing at the known ca and ts sites was performed on 17 samples.

Study MI-CP129 was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age.

A/H1N1 No A/H1N1 samples were sequenced. A/H3N2 Two A/H3N2 samples (Subject 1307 Day 2 and Subject 1304 Day 2) underwent full genomic sequencing. Testing performed in 2006 assessed these samples as retaining the ca but not ts phenotypes, but retesting in 2010 indicated that the isolates retained both ca and ts phenotypes. Due to the inconsistency between these results, sequencing was performed. For both samples no changes in sequence were noted. As the genetic basis of the ts phenotype for A/H3N2 strain has been well characterized (Jin et al, 2003) and involves changes to 5 amino acids associated with 3 separate gene segments, it is likely that the results generated in 2006 did not reflect a true loss of temperature sensitivity. Six B samples were cold adapted but not temperature sensitive , however they were not sequenced due to insufficient sample volume. As a result, 20 B samples were sequenced based on phenotyping results. Samples for 4 Subjects were assessed as cold-adapted but not temperature sensitive. Samples for 8 Subjects were assessed for temperature sensitivity due to inconsistent retest results. For all these samples, no changes in sequence were noted. Three samples had genetic changes that would predict amino acid changes. The sample for Subject 1082 had sequence changes that would predict one amino acid substitution at position 718 in the PB2 gene product, whereby a glutamic acid was changed to a lysine. The sample for Subject 1131 had sequence changes predicting one amino acid change at position 200 in the PB2 gene product, whereby an isoleucine was changed to a valine. The sample for Subject 1462 had sequence changes that would predict one amino acid substitution at position 742 in the PB1 gene product, whereby an alanine was changed to a threonine. None of these changes occurred at sites previously identified as being determinants for the control of the ts phenotype in type B viruses (Hoffman et al, 2005; Chen et al, 2006).

## Methods

- Objectives

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of this study was to describe the proportion of individuals who shed vaccine strain viruses.

Among the secondary objectives of this study were:

- -the genotypic and phenotypic stability of shed vaccine viruses
- Study design

This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety of FluMist in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. Enrolment of approximately 200 subjects was stratified by age, with 100 subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their second year birthday) and 100 subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (who reached their second year but not their fifth year birthday). Baseline medical history data collection included the subject's receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory confirmed influenza illness in the previous influenza season. Each subject received one dose of FluMist by intranasal administration on Day 0. Subjects were evaluated for viral shedding by collection of nasal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 post vaccination and approximately every other day thereafter from Days 9 to 28. Subjects with a positive shedding sample at Day 25 or Day 28 were to have additional shedding samples collected approximately every 7 days, or as soon as possible upon awareness of culture positivity, until 2 consecutive samples were negative for vaccine virus. Genotypic and Phenotypic Stability data of Shed Vaccine Virus Phenotypic Stability Results Table 11.4.1.2.3-1 presents the phenotypic stability data for subjects with influenza-positive vaccine samples within 28 days of dosing. Both the ca and ts phenotypes were preserved in all shed A subtype vaccine viruses tested for which results were available after phenotypic analysis. For A/H1N1 samples, 90 out of 93 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes while 3 samples had results not reportable as the samples had insufficient volume. For A/H3N2 samples, 37 out of 39 samples retained the ca and ts phenotypes while 2 samples had results not reportable due to insufficient volume. For type B samples, 29 out of 61 samples retained both the ca and ts phenotypes. However, 29 samples retained the ca phenotype but not the ts phenotype. In addition, 3 samples retained the ca phenotype but ts phenotype results were not reportable due to inconsistent retest results; initial test results for the samples were that they were cold adapted but not temperature sensitive, while retest results indicated that they were both cold adapted and temperature sensitive.

As several studies have demonstrated the phenotypic and genotypic stability of FluMist in human subjects (Murphy and Coelingh, 2002; Buonagurio et al, 2006; Vesikari et al, July 2006), these phenotype test results were considered to be artifactual and likely due to assay performance or sample handling issues. In order to confirm vaccine phenotypic stability, sequencing was performed for samples that appeared to no longer retain the ts phenotype or for which inconsistent results were available (Table 11.4.1.2.3-1). In addition an investigation was undertaken to determine whether failure in the ts phenotype assay might be attributable to a technical issue

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As part of the phenotype assay investigation, it was noted that PCR-amplified viral genomes used as starting material for sequence analysis contained high levels of internally deleted genomic segments, indicative of the presence of defective interfering (DI) particles in the amplified virus samples. Since it is known that high levels of DI particles affect viral replication in tissue culture cells (Nayak et al, 1978), it was hypothesized that failure to meet the acceptance criteria in the ts phenotype assay might have been due to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the tested samples.

The results of the investigation indicated: 1) failure of the clinical influenza B isolates to meet acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay was due to a technical issue related to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the amplified samples, and 2) when a subset of clinical influenza type B isolates that failed to meet the acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay were re-evaluated under more appropriate assay conditions, they did in fact retain the ts phenotype, consistent with the finding that there had not been changes within the genetic sequences responsible for regulating this phenotype.

These results indicated that the shed vaccine viruses remained phenotypically stable when tested under appropriate assay conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Twenty-nine type B samples were sequenced based on the phenotype testing results of being cold adapted but not temperature sensitive. In addition, 3 samples were sequenced based on inconsistent retest results and one sample (that was not the last shed sample from a subject) was sequenced in error. Of these 33 samples, 5 underwent full genomic sequencing and, after no sequence changes were noted, the remaining 28 samples underwent focused sequencing at the genetic loci that are known to control the ca and ts phenotypes (Hoffmann et al, 2005; Chen et al, 2006; Chen et al, 2008).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the 5 samples that underwent full genomic sequencing, no changes were noted that would have resulted in amino acid changes. For the remaining 28 samples, no changes were identified at the genetic loci known to control the ca and ts phenotypes.

These results indicate that the shed vaccine viruses remained genotypically stable.

## SUMMARY DATA OF GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC STABILITY DATA OF SHED VACCINE VIRUS FOR THE 4 STUDIES SUBMITTED

To characterize the phenotypic and genotypic stability of FluMist after intranasal vaccination, viruses from the nasal swab samples of subjects enrolled in 4 clinical studies were expanded in Rhesus monkey kidney and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and were evaluated for maintenance of the ts and ca phenotypes in an in vitro cell-based infectivity assay. Virus samples from the 4 studies (MI-CP111, MI-CP114, MI-CP129, and FM026) were initially evaluated in late 2005 through 2006 for phenotypic and genotypic stability. Results of the phenotypic and genotypic stability data for the type A vaccine viruses showed that the vast majority (~97%) maintained the ts phenotype across the 4 studies. Conversely, more than 50% of the influenza type B vaccine viruses from the 4 studies did not meet the acceptance criterion for the ts phenotype. The criterion for temperature sensitivity for type B vaccine viruses requires that titres at the nonpermissive temperature of 37°C are at least 2 log10 (100-fold) lower than the titres at the permissive temperature of 33°C. Evaluation of the isolates that had lost the ts phenotype revealed a lower than anticipated growth at 33°C, resulting in a &lt; 2 log10 difference in titres between the permissive temperature of 33°C and the nonpermissive temperature of 37°C for the type B viruses. As a result, testing was suspended in 2006 to further investigate the reason why these isolates no longer met the criterion for temperature sensitivity. Initial studies investigated the theory that samples containing the type B vaccine viruses might have been contaminated with type A vaccine viruses, which are not restricted in growth at 37°C, thus possibly contributing to the apparent loss of the ts phenotype by increasing the viral titre at 37°C. However, retesting of the samples after removal of contaminating type A viruses revealed again that the ts phenotype had not been retained. Therefore, further testing to confirm the genotypic stability of the type B vaccine viruses and explore possible issues with the assay performance was pursued and the results are discussed below. Genomic Sequencing of Type B Isolates To determine whether genetic changes could be identified at the known genetic loci that control the ca and ts phenotypes, or at other positions that might alter the ca or ts phenotypes, sequencing was performed on 76 type B vaccine isolates (collected across the 4 studies) that did not meet the acceptance criterion of the ts phenotype. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Of the 76 isolates sequenced, 19 were from Study MI-CP111. Of these 76 samples, 8 underwent full genomic sequencing, 59 were partially sequenced at the known ca and ts sites, and 9 samples could not be sequenced due to lack of sufficient material remaining from the nasal swabs. Four additional B samples from Study MI-CP129 that were evaluated in the phenotype assay due to a sample accessioning error and did not maintain the ts phenotype also underwent full genomic sequencing. As a result, a total of 12 samples from Studies FM026, MI-CP111, and MI-CP129 were analyzed by full genomic sequencing. Eight of the 12 viruses (67%) that were fully sequenced did not have any genetic changes. The remaining 4 viruses contained 1 or 2 amino acid changes associated with 1 or 2 segments of PB2, PB1, NP, or M. None of these changes were at the known ca , ts , or attenuated ( att ) sites and none of the 59 samples that were partially sequenced contained any changes at the critical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

genetic determinants for the ca and ts genotypes. The nucleotide sequence data from the full genomic sequencing and the sequencing at the known ca and ts sites indicate that the shed type B vaccine viruses retained the desired ca and ts genotypes and are genotypically stable.

## Influenza Type B Phenotypic Assay Investigation

Concurrent with the type B genomic sequencing analyses, a parallel effort was undertaken to investigate whether the ts phenotype assay results might be attributable to a technical issue (see Attachment 1). As part of this effort, it was noted that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified viral genomes used as starting material for the sequence analysis of the isolates that failed the ts phenotype assay contained high levels of internally deleted genomic segments, indicative of the presence of defective interfering (DI) particles in the amplified virus samples. Since it is known that high levels of DI particles affect viral replication in tissue culture cells, it was hypothesized that failure to meet the acceptance criteria in the ts phenotype assay might have been due to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the tested samples (Nayak et al, 1978).

To test this hypothesis, a set of influenza B viral samples, including 6 clinical samples that failed the ts phenotype assay, one clinical sample that passed the ts phenotype assay, and two control viruses (wild-type B/Jilin/20/2003 and cold-adapted B/Jilin/20/2003) were re-amplified in MDCK cells at 31°C and 33°C (both permissive temperatures used for growing vaccine viruses) and at varying multiplicities of infection (MOIs). The MOI was varied, as it is known that influenza viruses amplified in MDCK cells at a low MOI usually produce a lower level of DI particles. Following amplification at MOIs of 0.001 to 0.1, the amplified viruses (with titres&gt; 6.5 log10 fluorescent focus units/mL) were evaluated for their ts and ca phenotypes in PCK cells by comparing titres obtained following growth at 25°C, 31°C, 33°C and 37°C. For all of the samples expected to have the ts phenotype, including the 6 clinical samples that had previously failed the initial ts phenotype assay, titres of 5.3-6.5 log10 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL were obtained at the permissive temperature (33°C) while titres of 3.03.7 log10TCID50/mL were obtained at the nonpermissive temperature (37°C). Consequently, each of the clinical isolates re-amplified under these conditions passed the ts phenotype assay, as the viral titres between the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures differed by more than 2 log10. The results of this investigation indicated: 1) failure of the clinical influenza B isolates to meet acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay was likely due to a technical issue related to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the amplified samples, and 2) the clinical influenza B isolates that failed to meet the acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay did in fact retain the ts phenotype when evaluated under more appropriate conditions, consistent with the finding that there had not been changes within the genetic sequences responsible for regulating the ts phenotype of these viruses. CHMP comment: The MAH states that failure of the clinical influenza B isolates to meet acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay was likely due to a technical issue related to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the amplified samples. Even if this explanation could be scientifically relevant, the manufacturer should justify/clarify the following points: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- why the same results were not already observed in the several studies conducted before (eg: Murphy and Coelingh, 2002; Buonagurio et al, 2006; Vesikari et al, 2006).

- data were generated in 2005 and also in 2010. Regarding the 2010 results, the MAH should clarify if the new phenotypic test (low MOI) was used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- from the data provided, it seems that this phenomenon is not observed for A strain. The MAH should comment this point. Moreover the MAH should clarify if the new operational conditions (use of low MOI) will be also implemented for A strain ts testing.
- the MAH should perform a complete validation of the phenotypic test used for the assessment of clinical virus samples taking into account the new virus inoculation condition.
- regarding the sequencing data, the MAH should clarify if deep sequencing has been envisaged.
- Study design

Study MI-CP-129 Study MI-CP129 was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. The interim CSR was submitted to the EMA on 12 August 2011. Viral shedding was relatively common post vaccination with the majority of shedding occurring from Days 1 to 11. For all subjects, the highest incidence of shedding occurred on Day 2. A history of prior influenza vaccination did not appear to influence the incidence or number of days of shedding. The A/H1N1 subtype was shed more frequently than the other vaccine-type virus subtypes. Titres of shed virus were below the lower limit of detection for the assay after Day 11 for subjects 6 to 24 months of age and after Day 9 for subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age. Overall, FluMist/Fluenz was safe and well tolerated in subjects 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. Methods · Objectives The primary objective of this study was to describe the proportion of individuals who shed vaccine strain viruses. The secondary objectives of this study were: -To describe the duration of shedding of vaccine viruses -To quantitate shed vaccine viruses -To describe the genotypic and phenotypic stability of shed vaccine viruses -To describe the safety and tolerability of FluMist -To describe the safety and tolerability of FluMist in relation to shedding Medicinal product no longer authorised

This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety of FluMist in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. Enrolment of approximately 200 subjects was stratified by age, with 100 subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their second year birthday) and 100 subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (who reached their second year but not their fifth year birthday). Baseline medical history data collection included

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the subject's receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory confirmed influenza illness in the previous influenza season.

Each subject received one dose of FluMist by intranasal administration on Day 0.

Subjects were evaluated for viral shedding by collection of nasal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 post vaccination and approximately every other day thereafter from Days 9 to 28.

Subjects with a positive shedding sample at Day 25 or Day 28 were to have additional shedding samples collected approximately every 7 days, or as soon as possible upon awareness of culture positivity, until 2 consecutive samples were negative for vaccine virus.

Safety was evaluated by the collection of reactogenicity events (REs), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medication use. Significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) were also collected. Reactogenicity events, AEs, and concomitant medication use were collected from study vaccination through Day 28; SAEs and SNMCs were collected from study vaccination through Day 180. The total duration of subject participation in the study was up to 6.5 months, including a screening period of up to 14 days and a post-treatment period of 180 days after study vaccination. Discussion of Study Design Because the current study (Study MI-CP129) was intended to be a descriptive study, an open label, single-arm study design was selected. The design of the current study was intended to be as close to the design of shedding evaluation in Study FM026 (children and adults 5 to 49 years of age) as possible based on the request of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for shedding data in all populations for whom MedImmune has an indication (subjects 2 to 49 years of age). Enrolment was stratified by age (6 to &lt; 24 months; 24 to &lt; 60 months) to ensure an adequate sample size in each age cohort. · Study population /Sample size Subjects were stratified by age group; 6 to &lt; 24 months or 24 to &lt; 60 months. As this was a singlearm trial and only active vaccine was administered, no randomization and no blinding to study assignment occurred. One hundred eligible subjects were enrolled in each of the two age groups. · Treatments Dose and Form: A total volume of 0.2 mL was administered intranasally (approximately 0.1 mL into each nostril) as a single dose. Each dose of FluMist contained approximately 107 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of each of the following 3 influenza virus strains: A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) -A/Wyoming/03/2003 (H3N2) (A/Fujian/411/2002-like) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Efficacy

1-Primary analysis: proportion of subjects who shed vaccine virus (Table 11.4.1.1-1)

The incidence of any shedding, regardless of age group or vaccine history, was 78.9%

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

(95% CI: 72.6, 84.3). Of subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age, 88.9% shed virus compared with 69.0% of subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age. Of the 157 subjects who shed during the study, vaccine-type virus was confirmed by PCR-based assays as A/H1N1 for 128 subjects, A/H3N2 for 72 subjects and B for 74 subjects. Through Day 7, the A/H1N1 subtype was shed more frequently than the other virus subtypes (Figure 11.4.1.1 1). Shedding of more than one strain also occurred during the study. As an example, on Day 1, 6.1% of subjects shed both influenza A and B strains, and 1.5% of subjects shed all 3 strains. The highest incidence of subjects shedding more than one strain occurred on Day 2, when 19.7% of subjects shed both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains. Of the 88 subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age who shed during the study, vaccine-type virus was confirmed by PCR-based assays as A/H1N1 for 76 subjects, A/H3N2 for 57 subjects and B for 37 subjects (Table 11.4.1.1-1). Results for B were similar for the 69 subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age who shed during the study; however, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 shedding occurred at lower rates. Vaccinetype virus was confirmed by PCR-based assays as A/H1N1 for 52 subjects, A/H3N2 for 15 subjects, and B for 37 subjects in the 24 to &lt; 60 months age group.

## 2-Secondary Analyses

## 2.1-Duration of Vaccine Virus Shedding

The mean number of days of shedding any strain, regardless of age group or vaccine history, was 2.8 days. The number of days of shedding any strain was 3.0 days for subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age and 2.7 days for subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age. The mean number of days of shedding vaccinetype virus, as confirmed by PCR-based assays and regardless of age group, was 2.1 days for A/H1N1, 1.7 days for A/H3N2, and 1.9 days for B.

There was no apparent difference in mean days of shedding based on vaccine history 2.2-Quantitation of Shed Vaccine Virus If the TCID50 value was reported as &lt; 1.5, the lowest limit of detection for the assay, half of the value was to be imputed, i.e. a value of 0.75 TCID50. Also, the TCID50 value for a given sample was excluded from the summary tables if, for that sample, more than one strain was isolated from culture or more than one Flu A subtype was determined to be present in the sample; this resulted in the exclusion of 72/3,358 samples due to the presence of both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains and in the exclusion of 42/3,358 samples due to the presence of both type A and type B strains. Peak mean viral titres for influenza A strains were observed on Day 2 for both age groups. A similar pattern was observed for B strains, with the highest mean titres also observed on Day 2. One exception to this observation was on Day 13 for subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age, when the high mean titre observed was determined by only one subject who shed a B-strain virus. Overall, mean titres among subjects who shed virus A subtypes or type B strain were &lt; 10 3.0  TCID50/mL in both age groups on all study days, with the exception of the subject who shed a type B-strain virus on Day 13 with a titre of 10 4.0  (described above) Despite positive culture results that extended through Day 25, virus titres were below the lower limit of detection for the assay (101.5 TCID50) after Day 11 for subjects 6 to 24 months of age, and after Day 9 for subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age. Safety Introduction This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety of refrigerated FluMist (CAIV-T) in healthy children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. All subjects were entered into the study from 15May2006 and 22Jun2006 at 16 sites in the USA. Baseline medical history data collection included the subject's receipt of influenza vaccine or history of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in the previous influenza season. Each subject received one dose of FluMist by intranasal administration on Day 0. All investigational product dosing occurred outside of the influenza season. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Subjects were evaluated for viral shedding by collection of nasal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 post vaccination and approximately every other day thereafter from Days 9 to 28. Subjects with a positive shedding sample at Day 25 or Day 28 were to have additional shedding samples collected approximately every 7 days, or as soon as possible upon awareness of culture positivity, until 2 consecutive samples were negative for vaccine virus.

The total duration of subject participation in the study was up to 6.5 months, including a screening period of up to 14 days and a post-treatment period of 180 days after study vaccination.

## Patient exposure

Enrolment of approximately 200 subjects was stratified by age, with 100 subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age and 100 subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age.  All 200 subjects were included in the analysis of safety. One subject was excluded from the evaluation of viral shedding due to a protocol deviation (receipt of HBV vaccine 3 days prior to study entry).

## Methodology/ Definitions

Safety was evaluated by the collection of reactogenicity events (REs), adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) were also collected.

Reactogenicity events (REs) were predefined solicited events that could potentially occur after investigational product administration. The REs for this study included: Fever, ≥ 100.6°F (38.1°C)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rectal/tympanic, ≥ 99.6°F (37.6°C ) axillary, ≥ 100°F (38.8°C ) oral, Runny/stuffy nose, Sore throat, Cough, Vomiting, Headache, Abdominal pain (stomach ache), Muscle ache, Chills, Decreased activity level (lethargy), Decreased appetite and Irritability.

An SNMC was defined as a newly diagnosed medical condition that was of a chronic, ongoing nature and was assessed by the investigator as medically significant. Examples of SNMCs included, but were not limited to, diabetes, asthma, autoimmune disease (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), and neurological disease (e.g. epilepsy, autism). Events that were not considered SNMCs included mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital anomaly present at study entry, or acute illness (e.g. otitis media, bronchitis).

REs and AEs were collected from the time of vaccination on Day 0 through Day 28 and, SAEs and SNMCs from the time of vaccination on Day 0 through Day 180. CHMP comment: The follow-up period for detection of RE, AE or SAE were consistent with those observed in previous paediatric studies of Flumist.

## Incidence of Reactogenicity Events Days 0 to 28 Post Vaccination by Age Group, Safety Population

| longer   |
|----------|

<!-- image -->

Overall, the incidence of any RE peaked on Day 2 (32.5%), and the mean ± SD number of days of any RE was 7.3 ± 6.3 days. For subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age, the incidence of any RE also peaked on Day 2 (26.0%). The mean and median number of days for REs tended to be lower in subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age compared with subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age.

Overall, a total of 161 (80.5%) subjects experienced any RE. Runny/stuffy nose was the RE with the highest incidence (63.0%). Other REs that occurred in &gt; 20% of the subjects included cough (29.0%), irritability (26.0%), and fever &gt; 100°F (37.8°C) oral or equivalent (22.5%). Overall, the incidence of any RE was higher in subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (84.0%) than subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (77.0%) . A majority of the REs that occurred during Days 0 to 28 post vaccination occurred during the first 10 days post vaccination. Of the 161 subjects who experienced any RE during Days 0 to 28 post vaccination, 138 experienced REs during Days 0 to 10 post vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In general, the incidence of runny/stuffy nose followed similar patterns as the incidence of any RE and appeared to be the most influential RE in terms of frequency and peak day of incidence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP comment: On Days 0-28 after vaccination, no statistically significant differences in the rates of REs were observed in subject 6 to &lt;24 months vs 24 to &lt; 60 months (84.0% vs 77.0%).

The most frequently reported REs in the 2 age groups were runny/stuffy nose, cough, irritability and fever &gt; 100°F (37.8°C) oral or equivalent (63.0%, 29.0%, 26.0% and 22.5% respectively). However, no statistically significant differences in the rates of Runny/stuffy nose were observed.

<!-- image -->

Of the 160 subjects who were evaluable for shedding and experienced any RE during Days 0 to 28 post vaccination, 130 (81.3%) shed virus. Subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age were more likely to experience any RE and shed virus (75/83; 90.4%) than subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (55/77; 71.4%).

The only statistically significant differences observed between the two age groups were a higher rate of fever &gt; 100°F (37.8°C) and &gt;101°F (38.3°C) oral or equivalent in subjects 6 to &lt;24 months compared to subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months (19.0% vs 7.0% and 13.0% vs 19.0% respectively, p=0.01) and a higher rate of headache in subjects 24 to &lt;24 months compared to subjects 6 to &lt;24 months (0.0% vs 5.0%, p=0.02).

Adverse events (AEs) Medicinal product no longer authorised

MedDRA =Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.

Within a system organ class, a subject was only counted once. The sum of the terms may exceed 100%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 39.5% (79/200) of subjects reported ≥ 1 AE. Adverse events were reported by proportionally more subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (48.0%) than subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (31.0%). The system organ classes in which the highest proportions of subjects reported AEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders (18.5%) and Infections and Infestations (11.0%). Adverse events reported by ≥ 5.0% of subjects included: teething (10.5%); and diarrhea (7.0%). All subjects who reported teething only were in the 6 to &lt; 24 months age group. Most AEs (102 of 121 events) were mild in intensity. There were no severe AEs reported during the study.

Relatively few AEs (12/121, 9.9%) were considered by the investigator to be related (possibly, probably, or definitely) to investigational product. The most frequently reported related AEs were body temperature increased (3/200; 1.5%) and diarrhea (2/200; 1.0%). All other related AEs were unique events reported by one subject each. CHMP comment: Any reported AEs were significantly higher in the 6 to &lt;24 months recipients as compared with the 24 to &lt;60 months recipients (48.0% vs 31.0%, p=0.01). The majority of events for all ages combined were gastrointestinal events (18.5%). When evaluated by age group, the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AE was teething (21.0% in 6 to &lt;24 months subjects and 0.0% in 24 to &lt;60 months subjects; p&lt;0.05). No severe AEs were reported during the study. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) There were no deaths reported from screening to Day 180. Two subjects were diagnosed with SNCMs during the study; neither was considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product. One of these SNCM's was associated with the only SAE reported during the study. This serious case-report (PID 4107107) involved a white male who was 8 months old at the time of vaccination. He had a medical history of bronchodilator-responsive bronchiolitis and a family history of asthma. The subject reported an SAE of asthma, &gt; 4.5 months post vaccination. The subject was hospitalized and treated with intranasal oxygen therapy as needed, Atrovent (ipratropium) nebulizer inhaler every 6 hours, albuterol nebulizer inhalant every 2 to 4 hours as needed, Xopenex (levalbuterol) nebulized inhaler, Orapred (prednisolone) 75 mg twice daily, Pulmicort (budesonide) nebulized inhaler, oral amoxicillin twice daily. Due to slow improvement, intravenous Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) was also given. The subject improved and was discharged from the hospital on Xopenex, amoxicillin, Orapred, and Pulmicort therapy. The asthma was assessed as moderate in intensity and the investigator considered the SAE to be definitely not related to investigational product based on timing and medical history. Lesions on head (verbatim term, PID 1047206) was diagnosed for the remaining SNCM. The subject's medical history was significant for hair Loss. No AEs were reported for this subject during the study. The investigator considered this SNMC to be definitely not related to investigational product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

CHMP comment: Considering its medical history, the patient involved in the first case is at increased risk of asthma. Therefore, the assessor considers that it is unlikely that the event has been caused by the vaccine.

## CONCLUSIONS

- -Overall, the findings from this MI-CP129 study were consistent with those observed in previous paediatric studies of refrigerated FluMist (MI-CP111, D153-P002, MI-CP123, D153-P504, D153P501, D153-P005, AV014 studies):
- -The incidence of REs was common during Days 0 to 28 post dosing. Runny/stuffy nose was the most frequently reported RE. Other REs reported by &gt; 20% of subjects included cough, irritability, and fever &gt; 100°F (37.8°C) oral or equivalent. These common REs have also been identified in previous paediatric FluMist studies.

The PAM is considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is considered necessary.

-The incidence of AEs was relatively low, a majority of these AEs was mild in intensity, and few AEs were considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product. -As in previous paediatric FluMist studies, few SAEs were reported during MI-CP129 study. Overall, the SAE were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to investigational product. A large proportion of subjects evaluable for shedding experienced ≥ 1 RE also shed virus. Thus, of subjects who experienced any RE during Days 0 to 28 post dosing and who were evaluable for shedding, a majority (81.3%) shed virus. Subjects with a history of receiving influenza vaccine in a previous season were less likely to experience any RE and shed virus (77.4%) than subjects who had not previously received influenza vaccine (86.6%). The analysis of safety data issued from MI-CP129 demonstrated that the investigational product appears safe and well tolerated in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. However, based on the safety data provided in previous paediatric study MI-CP111, an increase risk of wheezing has been identified in children aged &lt;24 months, but only in those with a medical history of wheezing/asthma. The major objection initially addressed for the population aged &lt;24 months experiencing an increase of wheezing and hospitalizations has been solved by the withdrawal of this population from the applicant's claimed indication. Overall, MI-CP129 study safety data confirm that refrigerated Fluenz appears safe and well tolerated in subjects from 24 months of age. 4. Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion and  recommendation endorsed by the CHMP The risk-benefit ratio for this product remains unchanged and positive following the assessment of the study results submitted. Some clarifications are requested on the Genotypic and Phenotypic Stability data of Shed Vaccine Virus. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Assessment of the MAH responses to the request for supplementary information Questions The MAH states that failure of the clinical influenza B isolates to meet acceptance criteria in the original ts phenotype assay was likely due to a technical issue related to the presence of high levels of DI particles in the amplified samples. Even if this explanation could be scientifically relevant, the manufacturer should justify/clarify the following points: Why the same results were not already observed in the several studies conducted before (eg: Murphy and Coelingh, 2002; Buonagurio et al, 2006; Vesikari et al, 2006). MAH answer MedImmune believes that this issue was not previously seen due to differences in the virus amplification methods that are currently used for the assay compared to those used previously. In our more recent studies, the nasal samples were amplified in rhesus monkey kidney (RMK) cells followed by amplification in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the presence of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) strain specific influenza antibodies to select for influenza B viruses. In contrast, in the study by Vesikari et al, nasal samples were only amplified in MDCK cells and did not undergo amplification in RMK cells. The two rounds of amplification in RMK cells and in MDCK cells, in the presence of influenza A specific antibody, may have enriched the defective particles that interfere with the phenotype assay.

## MAH answer

The new phenotypic test (modified sample amplification step to reduce defective interfering particles) was not used previously. In 2010, it was believed that the atypical results were due to B influenza sample contamination with influenza A vaccine virus, and corresponding modifications were made to the assay to remove any potential A viruses.

From the data provided, it seems that this phenomenon is not observed for A strain. The MAH should comment this point. Moreover the MAH should clarify if the new operational conditions (use of low MOI) will be also implemented for A strain ts testing. MAH answer It is likely that the issue with the ts assay was observed only with Type B vaccine viruses due to the fact that the Type B vaccine viruses replicated at somewhat lower levels at the permissive temperature of 33°C compared to the Type A vaccine viruses. This lower level replication at the permissive temperature meant that some samples did not demonstrate the 2 log difference in replication levels between the permissive and non-permissive temperatures used to define the ts phenotype. The definition of the ts phenotype for both Type A and Type B vaccine viruses involves comparing replication levels seen at a permissive temperature (defined as 33°C for both Types) to replication levels seen at non-permissive temperatures (39°C for Type A vaccine viruses and 37°C for Type B vaccine viruses). In order to be defined as ts , the replication levels at the non-permissive temperature must be 2 logs lower than the levels seen at the permissive temperature. However, while the assay definition of a permissive temperature, 33°C, is the same for both Type A and Type B vaccine viruses, Type B vaccine viruses have been reported to replicate better at 31°C than 33°C in avian cells (Hoffmann et al, 2005; Chen et al, 2006; Chen et al, 2008), suggesting that the temperature of 33°C used during the viral amplification and testing of these samples in the assay may not have resulted in optimal replication levels for Type B vaccine strains. While using a low MOI in the ts evaluation of Type A vaccine viruses would seem reasonable, MedImmune does not currently have any ongoing or planned studies in which samples will be evaluated for phenotypic stability as outlined below. CHMP comments: Issue solved. The MAH should perform a complete validation of the phenotypic test used for the assessment of clinical virus samples taking into account the new virus inoculation condition. MAH answer Medicinal product no longer authorised

MedImmune proposes not to perform a complete validation of the phenotypic test. The assay was used during the early development of the live attenuated influenza vaccine to examine the phenotypic stability of shed vaccine viruses when the overall safety and tolerability profile of the vaccine was less established than it is today. As over 80 million doses of the live attenuated vaccine (trivalent and monovalent) have been commercially distributed to date, the benefit-risk profile for the vaccine is now firmly established. As a result, MedImmune does not have any ongoing or planned clinical studies in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which samples will be evaluated for phenotypic stability and does not envision a need for a modified assay. In addition, it is worth noting that the original ts phenotype assay was not formally validated for use with clinical study samples. If a situation should arise where there is a need to evaluate the phenotypic stability of shed vaccine viruses MedImmune proposes that this would again be evaluated through use of sequencing data as the 5 major determinants that control the ts phenotype have been extensively characterized (Jin et al, 2003).

## CHMP comments: Issue solved.

Regarding the sequencing data, the MAH should clarify if deep sequencing has been envisaged. MAH answer Deep sequencing (massive parallel sequencing) of virus samples has been considered as a technical approach to understand genetic population distribution of shed vaccine virus. Nucleotide diversity is expected to be observed in influenza viruses, as negative strand RNA viruses have low fidelity polymerase and the mutational frequency is estimated at 1:10,000 nucleotides. Because a priori definitions for acceptance criteria were deemed problematic, and consideration for qualifying and validating deep sequencing as an analytical method for clinical samples was determined not to be feasible, this approach was not considered further.
