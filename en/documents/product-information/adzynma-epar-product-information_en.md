For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder and solvent for solution for injection.

White lyophilised powder.

The solvent is a clear and colourless solution.

The reconstituted solution has a pH of 6.7 - 7.3 and an osmolality of no lower than 240 mOsmol/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ADZYNMA is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) indicated for the treatment of ADAMTS13 deficiency in children and adult patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP).

ADZYNMA can be used for all age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

ADZYNMA treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with haematological disorders.

## Posology

Prophylactic enzyme replacement therapy

-  40 IU/kg of body weight once every other week.
-  The prophylaxis dosing frequency may be adjusted to 40 IU/kg of body weight once weekly based on clinical response (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

## On-demand enzyme replacement therapy for acute TTP episodes

In case of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) episode, the recommended dose of ADZYNMA to treat acute TTP episodes is as follows:

-  40 IU/kg of body weight on day 1.
-  20 IU/kg of body weight on day 2.
-  15 IU/kg of body weight starting day 3 once daily until two days after the acute event is resolved (see section 5.1).

## Special populations

## Elderly

There are limited data on the use of ADZYNMA in patients over 65 years of age. Based on the results from population pharmacokinetics analysis, no dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

As rADAMTS13 is a recombinant protein with a high molecular weight, it is not excreted renally and no dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

As rADAMTS13 is a recombinant protein with high molecular weight, it is cleared via catabolism (rather than hepatic metabolism), and no dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The recommended body-weight based dosing regimen in paediatric patients is the same as in adults. Based on the results from population pharmacokinetics analysis, it might be more likely for infants &lt; 10 kg body weight to require adjustment to dosing frequency from every other week to once weekly dosing (see section 5.2).

## Method of administration

For intravenous use after reconstitution only.

ADZYNMA 500 IU and ADZYNMA 1 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection is administered at a rate of 2 to 4 mL per minute.

## Home or self-administration

Home or self-administration under the supervision of a healthcare professional may be considered for patients who are tolerating their injections well. The decision to have a patient move to home or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

self-administration should be made after evaluation and recommendation by the treating physician. Appropriate training should be given by the treating physician and/or nurse to the patient and/or caregiver prior to initiation of home or self-administration. Dose and administration rate should remain constant while at home, and not be changed without consulting the treating physician. If the patient experiences early signs of hypersensitivity during the home administration, the administration process should be stopped immediately, and appropriate treatment should be initiated (see section 4.4). Subsequent injections need to occur in a clinical setting. Treatment should be closely followed by the treating physician.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Allergic-type hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions may occur. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including but not limited to tachycardia, tightness of the chest, wheezing and/or acute respiratory distress, hypotension, generalised urticaria, pruritus, rhinoconjunctivitis, angioedema, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, paraesthesia, restlessness, and may progress to anaphylactic shock. If signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions occur, the administration of this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care should be provided.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Patients may develop antibodies to rADAMTS13 following treatment with ADZYNMA which could potentially result in a decreased response to rADAMTS13 (see section 5.1). If such antibodies are suspected and there is a lack of efficacy, consider other therapeutic strategies.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ADZYNMA in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of ADZYNMA during pregnancy may only be considered after a thorough individual risk benefit analysis by the treating physician before and during treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

There is insufficient information on the excretion of rADAMTS13 in human or animal milk but it is unlikely that it is excreted in human milk due to its high molecular weight. The decision either to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue ADZYNMA should take into account the importance of this medicinal product to the mother.

## Fertility

No human data are available on the effects of rADAMTS13 on male and female fertility. Animal data do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male or female fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Recombinant ADAMTS13 may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and somnolence may occur following the administration of ADZYNMA (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical studies were headache (31.5%), diarrhoea (17.8%), dizziness (16.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (15.1%), nausea (13.7%), and migraine (11%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed in Table 1.

Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each System Organ Class (SOC), ADRs are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Paediatric population

There is limited information from controlled studies of ADZYNMA in paediatric patients. The safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the safety data from one phase 3 clinical study comparing ADZYNMA to plasma-based therapies (fresh frozen plasma [FFP], pooled solvent/detergent [S/D] treated plasma, or factor VIII:von Willebrand factor [FVIII-VWF] concentrates, as assigned by the investigator) and one phase 3b study. The studies included 20 and 1 paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years of age in the prophylactic and on-demand cohorts, respectively. Overall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult population.

One neonate aged 36 hours old was treated with ADZYNMA in a compassionate use program and had no reported safety or immunogenicity concerns after 2 years of prophylactic treatment.

Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In clinical studies, single doses up to 160 IU/kg were used and their safety profile was generally consistent with results from clinical study results in cTTP patients.

In case of overdose, based on the pharmacological action of rADAMTS13, there is the potential for increased risk of bleeding (see section 5.1).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, enzymes, ATC code: B01AD13

## Mechanism of action

rADAMTS13 is a recombinant form of the endogenous ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 is a plasma zinc metalloprotease that regulates the activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by cleaving large and ultralarge VWF multimers to smaller units and thereby reducing the platelet binding properties of VWF and its propensity to form microthrombi. rADAMTS13 is expected to reduce or eliminate the spontaneous formation of VWF-platelet microthrombi that leads to platelet consumption and thrombocytopenia in patients with cTTP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were very commonly detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, however, data are still limited (see section 4.4).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The clinical efficacy and safety were assessed in two ongoing studies (Study 281102 and Study 3002).

## Study 281102

ADZYNMA was studied in a global phase 3, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicentre, two-period crossover study followed by a single arm continuation period (Study 281102) evaluating the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic and on-demand ERT with ADZYNMA compared to plasma-based therapies in patients with severe cTTP (ADAMTS13 activity &lt; 10%).

## Prophylactic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with cTTP

The efficacy of ADZYNMA in the prophylactic treatment of patients with cTTP was evaluated in 46 patients in the prophylaxis cohort who were randomized to receive 6 months of prophylactic treatment with either 40 IU/kg (± 4 IU/kg) of ADZYNMA or plasma-based therapies (period 1) once weekly (for patients who were previously treated with plasma-based therapies once weekly prior to joining the study) or every other week then crossed over to the other treatment for 6 months (period 2). After periods 1 and 2, all patients entered a 6 month single arm treatment period with ADZYNMA (period 3). The initial ADZYNMA prophylactic treatment frequency was every other week for 35 (76.1%) patients and once weekly for 9 (19.6%) patients.

The mean (SD) age was 30.5 (16.0) years (range: 3 to 58 years). Of the 46 patients, 4 (8.7%) were &lt; 6 years of age, 4 (8.7%) were ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age, 4 (8.7%) were ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 34 (73.9%) were ≥ 18 years of age. The mean (SD) weight was 65.9 kg (21.8) (range: 18.5 to 102.4 kg), and the majority of patients were white (65.2%), and were female (58.7%) of whom 74.1% were of child-bearing potential.

Prior to joining the study, the majority (69.6%) of patients received FFP treatment, 21.7% received solvent/detergent (S/D) plasma and 6.5% received FVIII-VWF concentrate.

The efficacy of prophylactic treatment with ADZYNMA in patients with cTTP was evaluated based on the incidence of acute TTP events (as defined by a drop in platelet count [≥ 50% of baseline or a platelet count &lt; 100 x 10 9 /L] and an elevation of lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] [&gt; 2 × baseline or &gt; 2 × upper limit normal (ULN)]), subacute TTP events (as defined by a thrombocytopenia event or a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia event; and organ specific signs and symptoms including but not limited to renal dysfunction events, neurological symptoms events, fever, fatigue/lethargy, and/or abdominal pain), and TTP manifestations (such as thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, neurological symptoms, renal dysfunction, and abdominal pain); as well as the incidence of supplemental doses prompted by subacute TTP events (see Table 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall ADZYNMA efficacy results were consistent throughout the study, including period 3, and across age groups.

## On-demand enzyme replacement therapy for acute TTP episodes

The efficacy of the on-demand enzyme replacement therapy for acute TTP episodes was evaluated based on the proportion of acute TTP events responding to ADZYNMA in both the prophylactic and the on-demand cohorts throughout the duration of the study.

An acute TTP event responding to ADZYNMA was defined as a resolved TTP event when platelet count was ≥ 150 x 10 9 /L or platelet count was within 25% of baseline, whichever occurs first, and LDH ≤ 1.5 x baseline or ≤ 1.5 x ULN, without requiring the use of another ADAMTS13-containing agent.

The on-demand cohort included 5 adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) and 1 paediatric patient (&lt; 6 years of age). Patients enrolled in this cohort had a total of 7 acute TTP events. Of these 6 patients, 2 patients were randomized to receive on-demand treatment with ADZYNMA and 4 patients were randomized to receive plasma-based therapies. All 7 acute TTP events resolved after treatment with either ADZYNMA or plasma-based therapies within 5 days.

Most patients (66.7%) were male, white (50%) with a median (min, max) age of 20 (5, 36) years, a mean (SD) weight of 56.4 (18.6) kg and a median (min, max) weight of 64.3 (23.0, 74.0) kg.

## Study 3002 (Continuation study)

Patients who completed the phase 3 study (Study 281102) were eligible to enrol in a long-term continuation study (Study 3002). The prophylaxis cohort included 65 patients among which 40 rolled over from Study 281102 and 25 were naïve patients. Of the 40 roll-over patients, 7 (17.5%) were ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 33 (82.5%) were ≥ 18 years of age. Of the 25 naïve patients, 3 (12%) were &lt; 6 years of age, 3 (12%) were ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age, 3 (12%) were ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, and 16 (64%) were ≥ 18 years of age. The on-demand cohort included 1 patient aged ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years. All patients were treated with ADZYNMA. The mean and maximum prophylactic treatment durations were 0.98 years and 2.17 years, respectively. Incidence rates of acute and subacute TPP events and TPP manifestations were consistent with the results from Study 281102.

## Paediatric population

Overall, the efficacy in paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult population.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ADZYNMA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Exceptional circumstances

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.

The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ADZYNMA was determined based on clinical study ADAMTS13 activity data analyses.

Following single-dose intravenous administration of ADZYNMA at 5 IU/kg, 20 IU/kg, and 40 IU/kg to adults and adolescents, dose-related increases in individual ADAMTS13 activity were observed and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reached a maximum at approximately 1 hour post-administration or earlier. At clinical dose of 40 IU/kg the mean (SD) half-life and mean residence time (MRT) in adults and adolescents were 47.8 (13.7) hours and 63.8 (16.0) hours, respectively.

The population PK parameters of ADAMTS13 activity following intravenous administration of ADZYNMA at 40 IU/kg in adults, adolescents, and younger children are described in Table 3.

Table 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters of ADAMTS13 activity following intravenous administration of ADZYNMA in cTTP patients

| Parameter (unit)                     | Mean (SD) Min; Max (N = 83)   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| C max                                | 1.13 (0.29)                   |
| (IU/mL)                              | 0.72; 2.29                    |
| AUC                                  | 72.8 (37.4)                   |
| (IU*h/mL)                            | 38.7; 274                     |
| Duration ADAMTS13 activity above 10% | 8.85 (2.45)                   |
|                                      | 4.51; 14.0                    |
| (days)                               |                               |

AUC = area under ADAMTS13 activity-time curve; Cmax = maximum ADAMTS13 activity. Note :  1 IU/mL ADAMTS13 activity corresponds to 100% average normal activity.

ADZYNMA intravenous administration at 40 IU/kg resulted in approximately greater than 5-fold higher ADAMTS13 activity exposures (Cmax, AUC, and duration above 10% ADAMTS13 activity) and lower variability when compared to plasma-based therapies.

## Special populations

Age, gender, race, and other intrinsic factors

Besides body-weight dosing regimen, no intrinsic factors such as age, gender, race, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and baseline bilirubin were identified as covariates impacting ADAMTS13 PK.

ADAMTS13 activity PK characteristics (MRT, steady-state volume of distribution [Vss], and clearance [CL]) were similar across age groups in patients with cTTP. Body weight-based ADZYNMA dosing provides similar ADAMTS13 activity PK parameters (Cmax and average ADAMTS13 activity [Cave]) across the different age groups including paediatric patients &lt; 12 years of age.

In infants &lt; 10 kg body weight, median duration above 10% ADAMTS13 activity was estimated to be shorter (approximately 5-6 days) compared to adults (approximately 10 days).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, single dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development, local tolerance and immunogenicity. Studies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of rADAMTS13 have not been performed.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## ADZYNMA 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection ADZYNMA 1 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection

## rADAMTS13

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What ADZYNMA is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use ADZYNMA
3. How to use ADZYNMA
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store ADZYNMA
6. Contents of the pack and other information
7. Instructions for use

## 1. What ADZYNMA is and what it is used for

ADZYNMA contains the active substance rADAMTS13, which is a manmade copy of the natural enzyme (protein) ADAMTS13. This enzyme is lacking in people with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP).

Congenital TTP is a very rare inherited blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can block the flow of blood and oxygen to the body's organs, which leads to a lower-than-normal number of platelets (components that help the blood to clot) in the blood.

Congenital TTP is caused by a lack of the ADAMTS13 enzyme in the blood. ADAMTS13 helps prevent blood clots by breaking down large molecules called von Willebrand factor (VWF). When VWF molecules are too large, they can cause dangerous blood clots. ADZYNMA is used to replenish levels of the lacking ADAMTS13. This helps break up these larger molecules into smaller ones, reducing the likelihood of blood clots forming and potentially preventing low blood platelet levels in patients with cTTP.

## 2. What you need to know before you use ADZYNMA

## Do not use ADZYNMA

- -if you have experienced severe or potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to rADAMTS13 or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ADZYNMA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Allergic reactions

There is a risk that you may experience an allergic-type hypersensitivity reaction to ADZYNMA. Your doctor should inform you about early signs of severe allergic reactions such as:

-  fast heart rate
-  tightness of the chest
-  wheezing and/or sudden onset of difficulty in breathing
-  low blood pressure
-  hives, rash and itchy skin
-  runny nose or nasal congestion
-  red eyes
-  sneezing
-  rapid swelling under the skin in areas such as the face, throat, arms and legs
-  tiredness
-  nausea (feeling sick)
-  vomiting
-  sensations like numbness, tingling, pins and needles
-  restlessness
-  anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or swollen face and/or hands).

If any of these symptoms occur, your doctor will decide if your treatment with ADZYNMA should be stopped and will give you appropriate medicines to treat the allergic reaction. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and dizziness, require prompt emergency treatment.

## Inhibitors

Neutralising antibodies (called inhibitors) may develop in some patients receiving ADZYNMA. These inhibitors could potentially cause the treatment to stop working properly. Tell your doctor if you think your medicine is not working for you.

## Other medicines and ADZYNMA

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

You must not receive ADZYNMA during pregnancy unless your doctor specifically recommends it. You and your doctor should decide if you can use ADZYNMA if you are breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

This medicine may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and somnolence (sleepiness) may occur following the use of ADZYNMA.

## Keeping a record

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the medicine should be clearly recorded.

## ADZYNMA contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## ADZYNMA contains polysorbate 80

This medicine contains 2.7 mg of polysorbate 80 in each ADZYNMA 500 IU or 1 500 IU vial which is equivalent to up to 0.216 mg/kg. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use ADZYNMA

Treatment with ADZYNMA will be given to you under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with blood disorders.

ADZYNMA is given by intravenous (into a vein) injection. It is supplied to your doctor as a powder that will be dissolved (reconstituted) using the provided solvent (a liquid that is able to dissolve the powder) before it is given.

The dose is calculated based on your body weight.

## Taking the medicine at home

Your doctor may consider that you can use ADZYNMA at home if you are tolerating your injections well. When you are able to inject ADZYNMA yourself (or it is given to you by a caregiver) after appropriate training by the treating physician and/or nurse, your doctor will continue to monitor your response to the treatment. If you get any side effects when taking the medicine at home, you need to immediately stop the injection and seek the attention of a healthcare professional.

## Recommended dose

## Preventative enzyme replacement therapy

The usual dose is 40 IU per kg of body weight, given every other week.

Your doctor may change the frequency to once weekly if ADZYNMA every other week is not working for you.

## On-demand enzyme replacement therapy for sudden episodes of TTP

If you develop a sudden episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), the recommended dose of ADZYNMA is as follows:

-  40 IU/kg of body weight on day 1.
-  20 IU/kg of body weight on day 2.
-  15 IU/kg of body weight starting day 3, once daily until two days after the sudden episode of TTP is resolved.

## If you take more ADZYNMA than you should

Taking too much of this medicine may result in bleeding.

## If you forget to use ADZYNMA

If you have missed an injection of ADZYNMA, tell your doctor as soon as possible. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop using ADZYNMA

Speak to your doctor if you wish to stop ADZYNMA treatment. The symptoms of your disease may worsen if you stop treatment.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
