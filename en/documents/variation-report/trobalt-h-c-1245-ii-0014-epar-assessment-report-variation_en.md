## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Trobalt  (retigabine)  is  an  anti-epileptic  drug  (AED)  being  a  neuronal  potassium  channel  opener (KCNQ/Kv7). Retigabine was first authorised in the EU on 28 th  March 2011 and is available in Europe, the United States, Thailand and Chile.

Trobalt  is  indicated  as  adjunctive  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary generalisation in adults aged 18 years and above with epilepsy.

The  maximum total  daily  starting  dose  is  300 mg  (100 mg  three  times  daily).  Thereafter,  the  total daily  dose  is  increased  by  a  maximum  of  150 mg  every  week,  according  to  the  individual  patient response and tolerability. An effective maintenance dose is expected to be between 600 mg/day and 1,200 mg/day.

## 1.2. Clinical Safety aspects

The maximum total maintenance dose is 1,200 mg/day. The clinical development programme for Retigabine includes the following long term studies: · a number of long-term open-label extension (OLE) studies, two of which (VRX-RET-E22-303 and VRX-RET-E22-304) provide data in patients with up to six years of exposure to retigabine · a Compassionate Use Programme (D-23129-3227), providing data in patients with more than 10 years of exposure to retigabine. Adverse event reports of pigmentation/discolouration or co-incidental findings at study visits have been received from these long-running OLE studies and the Compassionate Use Programme. Most of these describe a blue-grey to purple discolouration of the nails and /or lips. A few reports also describe a blue/purple pigmentation of the skin and retinal pigmentation. The number of these cases reported to GSK  has  increased  with  time.  This  increase  prompted  a  review  by  Global  Clinical  Safety  and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP). Adverse  events  relating  to  discolouration/pigmentation  have  only  been  observed  in  these  above mentioned studies. There  are  limited  data  on  the  nature  of  these  events.  However,  while  a  number  of  measures  were being taken in order to further characterise the nature of the events, the MAH submitted a variation update the label to describe these findings.

## 1.2.1. Overview of safety data where discolouration events were detected Clinical trials

- VRX- RET-E22-303; (RTG115098): A multicentre, open-label, long-term, safety, tolerability and efficacy study of retigabine in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures (Extension of Study VRX-RET-E22-301). A total of 181 patients were enrolled from centres in five countries in North and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and United States).  As of 5th September 2012, 42 subjects remain in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· VRX-RET-E22-304; (RTG115097) A multicenter, open-label,  long-term,  safety,  tolerability  and efficacy study of retigabine in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures (Extension of Study VRX-RET-E22-302. A total of 375 patients were enrolled from countries in 13 countries from Europe, United States, Australia, Israel and South Africa.  As of 5 th  September 2012, 64 subjects remain in the study.

These  are  ongoing  open-label,  long-term  safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  studies  of  retigabine administered  as  adjunctive  therapy.  These  studies  were  offered  to  patients  who  were  expected  to benefit  from  continued  treatment with retigabine after successfully completing the maintenance and transition phase of the parent study (pivotal study VRX-RET-E22-301, which started in November 2005 and pivotal study VRX-RET-E22-302, which started in February 2006). A patient's dose of retigabine or other AEDs could be adjusted at investigator's discretion to optimise patient response and tolerability. Newly  approved  AEDs  could  be  added  and  background  AEDs  discontinued,  to  achieve  monotherapy with retigabine at investigator's discretion. Patients could remain in the study as long as their dose of retigabine remained in the range of 600 to 1200 mg/day.

Compassionate Use Programme (D-23129-3227) This ongoing programme, which is being conducted under an open-label, long-term, named patienttreatment protocol, enrolled patients with refractory partial seizures who had derived significant benefit in  Phase  II  OLE  studies  and  were  offered  ongoing  access  to  retigabine  when  the  Wyeth-sponsored studies  were  discontinued  in  2001.  Patients  could  receive  retigabine  as  an  adjunct  therapy  to  their ongoing  AEDs,  or  were  given  the  opportunity  to  take  as  monotherapy,  at  the  discretion  of  the investigator.  Information on SAEs, deaths and pregnancies are collected. A total of 50 subjects enrolled in to the programme, from the United States, Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Israel. As of 5th September 2012, two subjects remain ongoing in the programme. 1.2.2. Signal of pigmentation/discolouration events At the time of submission of this variation, an analysis with a cut-off date of 13th September 2012 revealed  a  total  of  27  cases  relating  to  pigmentation  or  discolouration  following  treatment  with retigabine received from the long-term OLE studies 303 (n=14) and 304 (n=8) and the Compassionate Use programme (n=5). These events are summarised by the following information: · 20 AEs of nail discolouration, 16 AEs of lip discolouration, 9 of skin discolouration and one of retinal pigmentation (diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa by an ophthalmologist). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The events presented after long-term exposure to retigabine with a median time to onset of 4.4 years (0.7 to 8 years.).
- There  appears  to  be  no  trend  with  age  or  gender.  The  events  tend  to  occur  at  higher  doses (median dose where reported 1050 mg/day).
- In most cases, retigabine has been continued.
- Where specified, a causal relationship with retigabine was suspected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  few  data  was  available  at  that  time  on  which  to  evaluate  these  findings  in  terms  of distribution,  appearance,  medical  history,  skin  type,  ethnic  origin,  sun  exposure  and  whether  the event(s) resolved on discontinuation of retigabine.

No spontaneous report of discolouration or pigmentation has been received.

The MAH initiated a number of investigations in the patients from these studies, as they have had the longest prolonged exposure to retigabine, in order to increase the chance of confirming the underlying features of the discolouration events.

The  MAH  informed  investigators  and  patients  participating  in  the  on-going  clinical  trials  of  the discolouration events via updates to the Investigator Brochure and patient Informed Consent Forms. A Dear Investigator Letter (DIL) was issued to all active sites for studies VRX-RET-E22-303, VRX-RETE22-304, and the treating physicians for two patients being treated under a Named Patient Program, to communicate the findings and to advise that patients with discolouration/pigmentation of the nails, lips and/or skin should be referred for a dermatology consultation. Consultation with an ophthalmologist for an ophthalmological examination was recommended for all patients remaining in studies  VRX-RET-E22-303  and  VRX-RET-E22-304  to  investigate  whether  there  are  ocular  effects  in those patients receiving long-term treatment with retigabine. These  measures  aimed  to  provide  further  detailed  information  on  ongoing  patients  and  where available, those who experienced discolouration events but who have discontinued from active clinical studies,  to  elucidate  the  possible  underlying  mechanism  and  better  understand  the  cause  for  these events. 1.3. Other additional investigations Non-clinical pharmacology/toxicology studies Because the reports of pigmentation were associated with chronic dosing, the chronic dosing studies with retigabine were reviewed: · 26 week oral (dietary) toxicity study in the rat D-23129/3000913454 · Two year oral (gavage) carcinogenicity study in the rat PR2005-080 · 13 week oral toxicity in the dog D-23129/3000896861 · 52 week oral toxicity study in the dog D-23129/3000912148 Medicinal product no longer authorised

The review included the pathology reports, macroscopic and microscopic data from the studies along with  any  subsequent  amendments  (additional  pathological  investigations)  for  any  incidences  of pigmentation/discolouration.

With the exception of the 26-week oral study in rats there were no unusual or unexplained findings. In  the  26-week  rat  study  a  black  globular  pigment  was  observed  microscopically,  and  was  seen  in association with lipofuscinosis of the intestine (particularly duodenum). This was an isolated finding in the  gut,  which  was  additionally  not  observed  in  the  2-year  study.    Therefore,  the  observed pigmentation was not considered to have any significance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no corresponding macroscopic or microscopic changes (nonneoplastic or neoplastic) noted in the carcinogenicity study.

Levels of total labelled material (includes retigabine, metabolites and derivatives) in organs following a single dose of labelled retigabine indicate that no particular retention of radiolabel in any organ system examined was found. The CHMP agreed that the preclinical programme does not provide suggestions of a mechanism for the findings.  Non-clinical  pharmacology/toxicology  studies  have  shown  that  there  was  no  recorded increased  incidence  of  pigment  in  the  potentially  clinically-relevant  tissues  including  skin,  eye,  and urinary  bladder  and  because  of  the  normal  background  incidence  of  pigmentation  in  intestine  and kidney in the rodent, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In addition, tests showed that  there  was  no  particular  retention  of  radiolabelled  retigabine  (retigabine  and  derivatives)  in  any

Urinary crystals having the microscopic appearance of bilirubin have been described in urine samples collected during the Phase III trials (Studies 301, 302, 303 and 304).  This involved 15% of patients (127 out of 843) and only occurred in patients who received active drug; there have been no reports in any  of  the  other  Phase  I  or  Phase  II  retigabine  studies.  The  crystals  were  not  associated  with  any trends  in  clinical  symptoms  and  no  effects  on  relevant  laboratory  data  or  post-void  residual  urine volume (PVR) have been observed in these patients.

organ system examined. Supporting  non-clinical  investigations  are  currently  being  conducted  including  a  re-evaluation  of histopathology  slides  from  previous  retigabine  non-clinical  toxicology  studies  to  assess  for  pigment accumulation in potentially clinically-relevant tissues including skin, eyes and urinary bladder. This may provide  additional  data  to  inform  the  clinical  finding  and/or  the  design  of  additional  nonclinical investigations. Urinalysis findings during the clinical development programme During  the  clinical  development  programme,  there  were  reports  of  purple  crystals  forming  in  urine samples and some reports of urine colouration (orange-brown). LC-MS/MS identified the crystals as retigabine (likely in the formation of dimers). The formation of retigabine solids are time dependent and seem to require both oxygen and light. It was speculated that the formation of these crystals are due to sample handling and processing and are unlikely to form in vivo. In addition retigabine has been shown to interfere with clinical laboratory assays of both serum and urine bilirubin, which can result in falsely  elevated readings. The relevance of this finding to the reports of discolouration/pigmentation observed following long-term treatment is not known, but there is no evidence of tissue accumulation of retigabine from non-clinical studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  MAH  provided  a  comparison  of  clinical  and  biochemical  profiles  between  patients  who  reported crystals and those who did not. In addition, a chemical analysis of urine samples containing crystals determined that the crystal were not bilirubin.

The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  tissue  accumulation  of  retigabine  from  nonclinical studies.

The MAH is currently attempting to chemically identify the purplish, water-insoluble crystalline drug substance observed in human urine samples through in vitro assessments. Understanding the origin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and identity of any coloured byproducts of retigabine formed in vitro, may help in the understanding and characterization of the discolouration observed in humans and in providing chemical identification in human biopsy samples.

Because there are no data on potential melanin binding of retigabine and/or metabolites of retigabine, GSK plans to investigate the potential for retigabine and/or retigabine-related materials (metabolites and/or degradants) to bind melanin in nonclinical assays. The design of these assays is currently in progress.

## Published literature

It has been reported that drug-induced skin pigmentation accounts for 10-20% of all cases of acquired hyperpigmentation  (Dereure  2001).    Several  drugs  are  implicated  and  there  are  a  number  of mechanisms of action reported, including (Dereure 2001): · Drug or drug metabolite deposition in the dermis and epidermis · Accumulation of melanin (overproduction or lack of clearance) · Drug-induced post-inflammatory changes to skin · Synthesis of pigments, such as lipofuscin The  clinical  presentation  of  skin  pigmentation  varies  according  to  the  drug  and  the  mechanism  of action.    The  colour,  appearance  (patchy  or  diffuse)  and  location  of  the  pigmentation  appears  to  be extremely variable (skin, nails, lips etc). The rate of drug-induced pigmentation varies depending on the drug and cumulative dose.  Patients with darker skin tend to be more affected as are those with greater sun exposure.  There appear to be no differences in prevalence with age or between males and females. 1.3.1. Overall discussion Discolouration/pigmentation of the nails, lips and skin Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  Dear  Investigator  Letter  (DIL)  issued  on  19th  November  2012  to  all  investigators  actively participating  in  VRX-RET-E22-303  and  VRX-RET-E22-304  and  the  treating  physicians  of  the  two patients under the Named Patient Program, specified that patients with discolouration/pigmentation of the nails, skin and/or mucosal membranes should be referred for a dermatology consultation.

As  part  of  this  dermatology  consultation,  a  Targeted  Questionnaire  was  to  be  completed  by  the dermatologist  conducting  the  consult  to  collect  details  which  may  provide  further  information  on potential  factors  which  may  contribute  to  understanding  potential  mechanisms  of  action.  This questionnaire  was  targeted  at  collecting  relevant  dermatological  information  in  patients  ongoing  in Studies VRX-RET-E22-303 and VRX-RET-E22-304 who have presented with discolouration findings.  It was anticipated that by following up patients with long-term exposure and with existing discolouration events, the underlying features of the discolouration events could be identified more expeditiously and may be used to provide information to update the retigabine label with any advisory statements, as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

necessary. The questionnaire requests information on medical and medication history, ethnicity, time to onset of the event(s), whether retigabine was continued or discontinued and the outcomes arising from  any  actions  taken  (e.g.  did  the  event  resolve  on  stopping  retigabine).  The  form  also  collects information on detailed description of the areas affected and how quickly the discolouration developed. The dermatologist is requested to provide copies of results and an interpretation of diagnostic tests, including results from nail clippings, biopsy, Woods lamp and photography. The Fitzpatrick Skin Scale is also provided to gather details on patients' genetic predisposition, sun exposure and skin type.

As of 2 May 2013, there have been 51 subjects with events relating to discolouration/pigmentation of nails, lips and/or skin (this includes the additional cases of discolouration of periocular tissue and eyelid discolouration found on eye exam and categorized as 'skin' discolouration) in the two long-term clinical studies and the compassionate use programme.

The events generally presented after long-term exposure to retigabine, with a median time to onset of 4.4 years (range 4 months to 6.9 years) (time to onset refers to date discolouration events were first reported; in some cases the patient is described as having the event(s) before mentioning them to the investigator).

There appeared to be no relation with age or gender.

Events  tended  to  occur  at  higher  doses,  with  the  majority  at  900  mg/day  or  higher  (dose  range between  600mg/day  up  to  1500mg/day).    Note  that  the  maximum  approved  dose  of  retigabine  is 1200mg/day.

On  review  of  the  existing  cases  by  a  dermatologist,  it  is  considered  that  the  nail  and  skin discolouration/pigmentation  is  unlikely  to  be  triggered  by  sun  exposure,  considering  the  anatomical location  of  the  pigmentation  (hard  palate,  toenails)  and  the  fact  that  neither  nail  dystrophy  nor photoonycholysis was observed.

To date, the biopsy reports available have been examined by a dermatologist at GSK. Based on these biopsy  findings,  it  was  considered  that  these  cases  are  consistent  with  a  non-immunological  drug eruption that presents with discolouration/pigmentation.

The  CHMP  noted  the  currently  available  dechallenge  information  is  limited.  Some  patients  who  had been found to have discolouration  events  have  chosen  to  continue  treatment.  GSK  will  provide  the CHMP with periodic  updates  of  the  events  of  discolouration,  as  information  becomes  available.  The CHMP agreed with the plan to obtain further information presented by the MAH.

The CHMP agreed that the dermatological discolourations seem to be under appropriate evaluation with the detailed dermatological examination and reporting of this, together with the on-going toxicological re-investigations and the attempt to chemically identify the observed urine crystals.

However, the underlying mechanism for the findings is currently not understood.

## Retinal pigmentation

The  Dear  Investigator  Letter  (DIL)  issued  on  19th  November  2012  to  all  investigators  actively participating  in  VRX-RET-E22-303  and  VRX-RET-E22-304  and  the  treating  physicians  of  the  two patients under the Named Patient Program, specified that all active patients in these studies have a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consultation with an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive ophthalmological examination to investigate whether there are ocular effects in those patients receiving long-term treatment with retigabine.

An Eye Examination Worksheet was distributed with the DIL and included recommended ophthalmologic examinations, to include best corrected visual acuity testing, a comprehensive slit lamp examination and dilated funduscopic examination, with further ancillary testing (e.g. fundus photographs,  formal  visual  fields,  electroretinogram  (ERG),  electrooculogram  (EOG),  fluorescein angiography, etc) to be performed on the judgment of the examining ophthalmologist or by a retina specialist, based on the findings on the comprehensive eye examination.

These actions were described in the most recent EU RMP (Version 07, November 2012) as additional pharmacovigilance measures and were discussed in the most recent PSUR. In addition to the above measures, the following actions were also taken to ensure wider communication about these events:

- GSK initiated steps to change the product labelling in countries where the drug was approved, in order to reflect this adverse reaction to the nails, lips and skin.
- GSK has informed  investigators  and  patients  participating  in  the  ongoing  clinical  trials  of  the discolouration events via updates to the Investigator Brochure and patient Informed Consent Forms.
- Information  regarding  these  communications,  and  protocol  amendments  to  studies  VRX-RETE22-303 and VRX-RET-E22-304, were submitted in countries with active subjects in these studies.

Since the variation application was submitted, the MAH is continuously gathering information on the ophthalmological consultations of the patients still participating in the ongoing trials mentioned before and  the  two  patients  in  the  compassionate  program  to  further  investigate  the  cases  of  retinal pigmentation and determine whether there is any impairment of visual field or impairment of retinal physiology which may predict future visual impairment.

Detailed patient narratives with information on the tests performed and the information awaited were provided through different updates.

As  of  2  May  2013,  GSK  has  received  56  cases  of  pigment  changes  to  ocular  tissues  (including  the retina) and of discolouration to the nails, lips and/or skin, 29 of which have been received from study VRX-RET-E22-303, 22 from study VRX-RET-E22304 and five from the Compassionate Use Programme.

As of 2 May 2013, there have been 55 eye exams received by GSK: Of the 55 subjects, there were 21 cases of pigment changes to ocular tissues, including 15 involving the retina.

From these 15 patients with retinal pigmentation, five patients had worse than 20/20 visual acuity. One of  these  patients  had  visual  acuity  of  20/160  in  one  eye,  while  the  remaining  four  had  visual acuity  of  20/25  to  20/40  in  one  or  both  eyes.  No  baseline  eye  assessment  is  available  for  these patients.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Mild abnormalities on retinal electrophysiology tests have been reported in two further subjects.  In one  subject,  an  associated  diagnosis  of  retinitis  pigmentosa  was  made;  and  in  this  patient,  a generalised  reduction  in  the  visual  fields  of  both  eyes  on  Humphrey  Visual  Testing  was  also noted. Visual acuity was reported to be normal in both subjects.

In  the  case  diagnosed  as  retinitis  pigmentosa,  the  pigment  on  the  retina  was  first  reported  at approximately the same time as the discolouration events of the nails, lips and skin were observed. In this  patient,  follow-up  ophthalmological  evaluation  more  than  one  year  after  the  initial  consultation (and  approximately  one  month  after  tapering  off  the  drug  was  completed),  demonstrated  that  the patient's presentation remained unchanged with respect to earlier examinations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although  there  is  lack  of  information  available  on  the  time  to  onset  of  the  ocular  findings,  the underlying mechanisms by which the ocular pigmentary effects occur are likely to be similar as those causing discolouration of the nails, lips and/or skin.

Even if it is unclear to what extent the pigment changes lead to visual impairment, the high proportion of patients affected was of great concern to the CHMP.

The MAH therefore proposed a restriction of the indication which will effectively make Trobalt last-line therapy in partial epilepsy.

The  proposed  restriction  of  the  indication  will  read  in  the  SmPC  'Trobalt  is  indicated  as  adjunctive treatment of drug-resistant partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged  18  years  or  older  with  epilepsy,  where  other  appropriate  drug  combinations  have  proved inadequate or have not been tolerated'.

This  more refractory population carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality and will have already failed treatment with the more conventional AEDs utilising the more common Modes of Action. In the registration trials, 25% of patients discontinued due to an AE, which were generally related to the central nervous system and were dose related. Most discontinuations occurred early in treatment during  the  titration  phase  and  as  such  these  patients  would  not  be  exposed  to  risk  from  the discolouration/pigmentation events that tend to be reported later during treatment.  Therefore, even in this  restricted  population,  it  is  highly  likely  that  patients  who  have  not  received  significant  clinical benefit will discontinue retigabine before they are at risk of discolouration events occurring. Events of retinal pigmentation have been reported in 15 patients in the phase 3 open-label extension studies  and  yet  12  have  chosen  to  continue  receiving  treatment  with  retigabine  under  close monitoring. Of those who discontinued treatment, 2 did so for reasons of lack of efficacy, while one was reported to have discontinued due events of nail, lip and skin discolouration. At the present time data are limited from electrophysiological studies of the retina. In addition to the index case diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, only 1 other subject has completed their assessment with a retinal specialist. That subject was seizure free and retigabine has been continued.  For all the other cases of possible retinal pigmentation, the results from ancillary testing are necessary for the principal investigator to assess  the  findings  and  to  agree  with  the  subject  in  determining  the  benefit  versus  the  risk  of continuing treatment. A warning will be also introduced in section 4.4 of the Product Information recommending baseline and periodic  comprehensive  ophthalmological  examinations  (to  include  corrected  visual  acuity,  dilated funduscopic  exam  via  slit  lamp  exam)  throughout  treatment.  Furthermore,  retigabine  should  be discontinued if any retinal pigment or vision changes are observed, unless no other treatment options are available. If continued, the patient should be closely monitored and the potential risks assessed against the benefits of continuing treatment with retigabine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The proposed ophthalmological examinations suggested by the MAH are considered sufficient to detect ocular abnormalities and identify any potential visual sequelae.

The  CHMP  recommended  that  ophthalmological  examination  should  be  carried  out  every  6  months since very limited information is available as to how fast the pigment changes progress.

A Dear Healthcare Provider (HCP) letter will be issued to communicate these recommendations.

## 1.4. Risk management plan

The MAH is requested to update the RMP expected with next PSUR in June 2013 in order to properly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reflect the restriction of the indication and the important safety concerns of pigmentation/discolouration.

## 1.5. Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Trobalt  is  indicated  as  adjunctive  treatment  of  drug-resistant  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without secondary  generalization  in  patients  aged  18  years  or  older  with  epilepsy,  where  other  appropriate drug  combinations  have  proved  inadequate  or  have  not  been  tolerated.  Trobalt  is  indicated  as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults aged 18 years and above with epilepsy.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Eye disorders Pigment changes (discolouration) of ocular tissues, including the retina have been reported in longterm clinical studies with Trobalt,  sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of the skin, lips or nails (see below paragraph and section 4.8). The long-term prognosis of these findings is  currently  unknown,  but  some  of  the  reports  have  been  associated  with  visual  impairment.  A comprehensive  ophthalmological  examination  (including  visual  acuity,  slit-lamp  examination,  and dilated  fundoscopy)  should  be  performed  at  baseline  and  at  least  every  6  months  thereafter  while treatment is ongoing. If retinal pigment or vision changes are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of the balance of benefits and risks. Trobalt should be discontinued unless no other suitable treatment options are available. If continued, the patient should be monitored more closely. Skin disorders Pigment  changes  (discolouration)  of  the  skin,  lips  or  nails  have  been  reported  in  long-term  clinical studies with Trobalt, sometimes but not always in conjunction with pigment changes of ocular tissues (see above paragraph and section 4.8). In patients who develop these changes, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment  of the balance of benefits and risks. 4.8 Undesirable effects System Class Eye disorders Medicinal product no longer authorised

Changes were also made to the Package Leaflet in line with the above amendments.

In  addition,  as  Trobalt  was  identified  in  the  list  of  medicines  undergoing  additional  monitoring,  an inverted triangle will be included on the product information.

The symbol will allow patients and health care professionals to easily identify medicinal products that are  undergoing additional  monitoring,  and  its  accompanying  text  will  encourage  them  to  report unexpected adverse reactions through national reporting systems.

The list of local representatives in the PL has also been revised.

1.6. Direct Healthcare Professional Communication The CHMP considered that a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) was needed to communicate  on  the  restrictions  for  use  of  Trobalt  and  the  pigment  changes  of  ocular  tissues, (including retina), skin, lips and nails. The final version of this DHPC agreed by the CHMP is provided in Attachment 9 together with the communication plan. 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance The  benefit  of  retigabine  as  adjunctive  treatment  in  partial  epilepsy  was  established  in  the  pivotal clinical trials submitted at the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation application. Uncontrolled  epilepsy  carries  a  significant  burden  in  terms  of  an  increased  risk  of  morbidity  and mortality. Approximately 30% of patients remain uncontrolled despite treatment with other available AEDs, which have a number of different mechanisms of action. Retigabine with a novel mechanism of action  offers  treating  physicians  and  their  patients  the  opportunity  to  try  a  medicine,  which  acts differently to all other AEDs. Now  approximately  two  years  since  Trobalt  was  authorised,  reports  of  discolouration  and  pigment changes in the skin, lips and nails, and pigmentation of ocular tissues, including the retina, begin to emerge. All reports originate from the long-term open-label extensions to the clinical trials forming the basis  for  the  marketing  authorisation  (or  an  associated  compassionate  use  programme).  Almost  all discolouration events occur after a minimum of two years retigabine treatment. This may explain why no post-marketing reports have drawn attention to the pigment changes since no or very few patients who started retigabine after marketing authorisation would have been treated long enough to develop the changes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Even  if  the  skin  changes  may  be  bothersome  to  patients,  the  pigmentation  in  the  ocular  tissues, especially  in  the  retina,  is  considered  to  be  the  most  important  safety  issue  since  they  carry  the potential  to  impair  vision.  So  far  there  have  been  21  cases  of  pigment  changes  (discolouration)  of ocular tissue, including 15 involving the retina, after treatment with retigabine in two long-term clinical studies,  and  investigations  continue  as  not  all  patients  have  examined  yet.  This  is  a  very  high proportion  of  patients,  and  even  if  baseline  information  is  very  sparse,  it  suggests  that  retinal pigmentation is indeed a very common undesirable effect of long-term treatment with retigabine.

Some of these 15 patients have impaired vision whereas others have normal vision as measured by visual acuity. It is very difficult to judge if the cases of visual impairment are caused by the retinal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pigmentation  or  if  they  are  caused  by  pre-existing  co-morbid  conditions.  Unfortunately,  baseline information about vision and pre-disposing factors is very limited. It should be noted that the patients represent a chronic epilepsy population which cannot be satisfactorily treated with mono-therapy, and it  is  not  unlikely  that  they  could  be  pre-disposed  to  visual  impairment  compared  to  a  non-epilepsy population.  Further,  there  appear  not  be  to  be  very  strong  correlation  between  the  extent  of  the pigment changes and the reported visual impairment.

On  the  other  hand,  at  this  stage  it  cannot  with  any  reasonable  certainty  be  excluded  that  retinal pigmentation  induced  by  retigabine  treatment  has  caused  or  contributed  to  the  reported  cases  of impairment of visual acuity or reduction of visual field - or will do so in the longer term.

It is noteworthy that the vast majority of patients with identified retinal pigmentation (12 out of 15) continued retigabine therapy despite the observation of the findings. This suggests that the physicians in  charge  of  the  treatment  saw  no  viable  treatment  alternative  for  these  patients.  In  the  remaining patients who did discontinue treatment, only one patient appeared to do so because of the pigment changes. Also considering that retigabine represents a new mode of action, this speaks in favour of a benefit in some, very difficult-to-treat patients with partial epilepsy.

With  the  proposed  restricted  indication  and  the  recommendations  for  monitoring,  only  treatmentresistant  patient  with  no  other  treatment  options  should  be  treated  with  retigabine,  and  patients should have an ophthalmological examination before treatment and at least every six months during treatment. These measures are considered adequate to ensure that only the most treatment-resistant patients  will  be  treated  and  that  the  treating  physician  will  be  monitoring  patients  for  retinal pigmentation or deterioration in vision,  and  prompted  to  perform  a  thorough, individual  benefit-risk assessment at treatment start and when retinal pigment changes arise during treatment.

Overall, it is considered likely that some treatment-resistant patients obtain satisfactory seizure control with  retigabine  and  that  these  patients  cannot  be  treated  satisfactorily  with  other  anti-epileptic medicines. Benefit-risk balance As highlighted above, the retinal pigment changes are very important as they could potentially result in severe visual impairment or even blindness. At present the nature, possible mechanism and natural history of these events still needs to be elucidated. However, due to the potential risks the indication of Trobalt has been restricted as last-line therapy in partial epilepsy. In addition, Health Care Professionals should request a comprehensive ophthalmological examination (including  visual  acuity,  slit-lamp  examination,  and  dilated  fundoscopy)  performed  at  baseline  and every  six  months  thereafter  while  treatment  is  ongoing.  If  retinal  pigment  or  vision  changes  are detected, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of the balance of  benefits  and  risks.  Trobalt  should  be  discontinued  unless  no  other  suitable  treatment  options  are available.  If  continued,  the  patient  should  be  monitored  more  closely.  Also  in  patients  who  develop discolouration of the nails, lips or skin, treatment with Trobalt should only be continued after a careful re-assessment of the balance of benefits and risks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore,  with  the  above  mentioned  risk  minimisation  measures,  the  planned  investigations  and follow-up  actions  to  further  understand  the  concern,  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  retigabine  in  this restricted population is considered positive.
