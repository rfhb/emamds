Interstitial lung disease is associated with respiratory symptoms such as cough or difficulties in breathing. One case was reported in pivotal clinical trials which enrolled a total of 493 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the majority of the reported cases and based on the information available, no explanation other than an association with riluzole was found for the occurrence of interstitial lung disease. Symptoms resolved after drug discontinuation and symptomatic treatment in most cases. In one instance, the symptoms re-appeared upon re- administration of Rilutek. |

In addition section 4.9 has also been updated to more fully reflect the symptoms that have been seen following overdose of riluzole including neurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor, coma and methemoglobinemia, which have been observed in isolated cases. The proposed changes are in line with the available data from clinical trials, spontaneous reports and the published literature that has been submitted by the MAH. The PL was amended accordingly. |

Some of these cases were excluded due to insufficient information or non-serious event, or confounding by concomitant hepatatoxic medication, pre- existing and/or infectious liver disorder. Of the remaining cases, some described increases in liver enzymes that were in line with the currently approved SPC. The other cases described clinical hepatitis that occurred within 3 months of starting treatment. In four of these cases the patient fully recovered between 2 weeks and 3 months after riluzole treatment was stopped; in one of these cases the patient experienced a positive rechallenge. There was one fatal case. The available data would support the addition of hepatitis as a very rare side effect. The CHMP considered acceptable the wording in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC proposed by the MAH. Concerning overdose, a total of 10 spontaneous reports of overdose of riluzole alone were received by the MAH, three of which were also published in the literature. Of these 10 cases, eight were considered to be serious. The most common symptom in these cases was methemoglobinemia; other symptoms were neurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor and   |
