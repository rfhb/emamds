## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

Pursuant to Article 19 and Annex I (point 2d) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bayer Pharma AG submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 29 November 2012 an application for an extension of Marketing Authorisation. The  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  concerns  a  new  pharmaceutical  form:  orodispersible tablet (10 mg). In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) proposed to bring the Product Information in line with the latest QRD template. Bayer Pharma AG is already the MAH for Vivanza 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (EU/1/03/249/001-015). The applicant applied for the same indication as approved for already authorised strengths: 'Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Vivanza to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.' The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, and two pivotal, placebo controlled, randomized Phase III trials (Studies 12093 and 12094; Table 2) with a treatment period of 12 weeks have been conducted to support efficacy and safety of the 10 mg ODT. In addition the clinical program included three Phase I trials (Studies 10021, 12769 and 13396; Table 1) which provided pharmacokinetic results in healthy volunteers as in patients with erectile dysfunction.. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/345/2010 on the granting of a class waiver. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity Similarity Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. Scientific Advice Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

## Licensing status

Vivanza has been given a Marketing Authorisation in the EU on 04 March 2003.

1.3. Steps taken for the assessment of the product The Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP was: Concepcion Prieto Yerro · The application was received by the EMA on 29 November 2012. · The procedure started on 26 December 2012. · The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 13 March 2013. · During the meeting on 11 April 2013, the PRAC agreed on an RMP Advice and assessment overview to the CHMP. · During the meeting on 22-25 April 2013, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for an extension of the Marketing Authorisation for Vivanza, 10 mg orodispersible tablets on 25 April 2013. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Vivanza film-coated tablet contain vardenafil as the active substance and is indicated in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men.  Vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the most prominent PDE in the human corpus cavernosum. During sexual stimulation nitric oxide is released resulting in an increased level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus  cavernosum,  smooth  muscle  relaxation  and  induction  of  penile  erection.  Inhibiting  PDE5 vardenafil increases the level of cGMP enhancing relaxation of smooth muscle, which increases blood flow to the penis and induces penile erection. Currently Vivanza is available as film-coated tablets containing 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of vardenafil. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The present application supports a line extension for new tablet formulation developed as single oral dose  for  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction.  The  orodispersible  tablet  disintegrates  rapidly  in  the mouth in the presence of saliva and permits a convenient mode of intake without water. Patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets or who prefer a more discreet mode of administration of the product can benefit from using this form.

The additional pharmaceutical form applied for is orodispersible containing 10 mg of vardenafil. There are no changes in the route of administration or indications compared to the currently approved filmcoated tablets. The same orodispersible tablet formulation has already been approved in September 2010 for the product Levitra, of which Vivanza is a duplicate license. The principle data package is therefore identical.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With this line extension application the entire product information was brought in line with the latest QRD template.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The  new  pharmaceutical  form  is  presented  as  orodispersible  tablets  containing  10 mg  of  vardenafil (active substance) in form of the hydrochloride salt. Tablets are round and white, and are provided in aluminium (alu/alu) blister packs. Excipients used in the preparation of orodispersible tablets are well known  excipients  such  as  magnesium  stearate,  aspartame  (E951),  peppermint  flavour,  mannitol (E421), sorbitol (E420), crospovidone and hydrated colloidal silica. 2.2.2. Active Substance Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets contain the same active substance as the one authorised for filmcoated tablets. The substance is sourced from the same manufacturers, is manufactured with the same manufacturing  process  and  released  in  accordance  with  the  same  approved  active  substance specification.  The  active  substance specifications were found to be suitable for use in orodispersible tablets.  Hence  the  applicant  referred  to  the  dossier  of  the  already  authorised  film-coated  tablets  of Vivanza for information on the active substance. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to provide an immediate release dosage form of vardenafil with high convenience and patient compliance. Orodispersible tablets have been selected as dosage form which may be taken without water in a discreet manner. The  selected  tablet  size  was  considered  small  enough  to  support  convenient  intake  and  to  prevent gastrointestinal problems in sensitive patients caused by high doses of polyols. However the tablet size is large enough to allow easy handling also by elderly patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Apart  from  flavour,  sweetener  and  lubricant,  the  formulation  is  solely  composed  of  the  direct compression  excipient  Pharmaburst  B2  which  is  commercially  available  mixture  of  crospovidone, mannitol, hydrated colloidal silica and sorbitol. The ratio between the active substance and the filler Pharmaburst  B2  was  determined  by  the  size  of  the  orodispersible  tablet.  A  slightly  bitter  taste  of vardenafil  hydrochloride  was  compensated  by  addition  of  aspartame  as  sweetener  and  peppermint flavour.

Compatibility of the active substance with standard tablet excipients such as crospovidone, magnesium stearate or silica colloidal anhydrous has already been known from the previous development of the film-coated tablets. Compatibility with specific excipients needed for the formulation of orodispersible tablets was investigated in a separate study. It has been demonstrated that excipients chosen did not affect the appearance, assay or degradation products, there was no sign of significant degradation of the active substance. Compatibility was further demonstrated by the finished product stability studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vivanza orodispersible tablets are manufactured in a direct-compression process. The components are blended and compressed into final tablets on a standard rotary press. During development and scaleup  the  impact  of  manufacturing  conditions  on  key  quality  attributes  were  investigated.  As  rapid disintegration  of  orodispersible  tablets  based  on  Pharmaburst  B2  is  only  achieved  if  addition  of  any binder is avoided, the powder blend is not granulated. Thus, a direct compression process has been selected.

## Adventitious agents

None of the excipients present in the formulation is of animal or human origin.

Magnesium stearate is of vegetal origin. Manufacture of the product The manufacturing process is sufficiently described with clearly defined critical steps. A flow diagram and detailed description of the process have been provided. The manufacturing process comprises the following steps: (1) premixing, (2) final blending, (3) tablet compression and (4) packaging. Standard in-process controls are routinely performed during the manufacturing process to control the product quality. Acceptance criteria and specification limits have been set-up. The proposed in-process control tests are adequate to control critical steps of the manufacturing process. The validation was performed with 3 consecutive batches at commercial scale. All manufacturing steps, in-process controls and quality tests were performed in accordance to the requirements and complied with  the  specification.  The  evaluation  of  these  batches  was  based  on  manufacturing  process parameters, in process control data that accompanied every production batch, and additional tests that were carried out only in the validation phase. Each validation batch was tested for compliance with the release specification. It  was  demonstrated  that  the  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  the  intended quality. Product specification The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, identification (HPLC, TLC or NIR), friability, water content, disintegration, uniformity of dosage units, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC) and microbial limits. Full  details  of  all  analytical  methods  were  provided.  All  non  pharmacopoeial  methods  have  been satisfactory validated. The same HPLC method is used for identification, assay and degradation products. The method has been  appropriately  validated.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  method  is  suitable  for  the identification and determination of vardenafil and its degradation products in orodispersible tablets.

Batch  analysis  data  was  provided  on  three  commercial  scale  batches.  Batches  met  the  proposed specification  limits.  Results  showed  that  orodispersible  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according to the finished product specifications.

## Stability of the product

Long-term stability data were provided for 3 commercial scale batches stored at 30°C/75 % relative humidity (RH) in order to prove that the product is stable in climatic zones I - IV.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additionally, 18 months stability data were provided for one laboratory scale batch packed in the same primary  packaging  after  storage  at  25°C/60 %  RH  and  at  30°C/75 %  RH.  The  stability  data  were evaluated against the proposed shelf life specification.

Accelerated  studies  at  40°C/75 %  RH  have  been  performed  over  a  period  of  6  months.  Test parameters, methods and specification were the same as described for the long-term stability studies. The tablets were stable under accelerated storage conditions over the test period of 6 months.

The applicant also performed stressed stability testing. For stress stability testing, the samples were exposed to heat, humidity and light.

In  order  to  investigate  the  stability  of  the  product  under  moist  conditions  (humidity  stress)  tablets were stored in open containers at 25°C/60 % RH, 30°C/75 % RH and 40°C/75 % RH for 8 weeks. It has been demonstrated that the formulation is humidity sensitive and need to be stored in the original water-tight package to prevent exposure to high ambient humidity. Unprotected tablets exposed to light showed signs of decomposition of the active substance however, the assay results and the amount of degradation products still remained within the specification limits. Only the discoloration proceeded rapidly. Although tablets were shown to be sensitive to humidity and slightly sensitive to light it shows good chemical  and  physical  stability  when  adequately  protected  by  a  hermetic  primary  container.  This confirms that aluminium blisters which have been chosen as the packaging material for clinical trial and commercial supply are appropriate. In addition to the blistered samples one commercial scale tablet batch was tested as bulk material and stored in the chosen container material at 25°C/60 % RH, 30°C/75 % RH and 40°C/75 % RH. Data were  available  for  a  storage  period  of  12  months  at  25  °C/60  %  RH  and  for  1  month  storage  at 30°C/75 % RH and 40°C/75 % RH. All parameters remained unchanged under the storage conditions tested  and  it  was  possible  to  conclude  that  the  bulk  packaging  offers  sufficient  protection  for  the tablets. In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines  the  stability  studies  will  be  continued  following  the  stability protocol and any out-of-specification result will be reported to the authorities. Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  as  stated  in  section  6.3  of  the  SmPC  are acceptable. In summary the stability data provided support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  10 mg  orodispersible  tablets  have  been  developed  to  be  a  more  convenient  dosage  form  in comparison  with  the  approved  film-coated  tablets  because  it  can  be  administered  without  water. Orodispersible tablets contain different excipients than the film-coated tablets, however none of the excipients is considered a concern. The active substance is identical to the one used in the film-coated tablets.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner.

The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit-Risk balance of the product.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Regarding  the  environmental  risk  assessment,  no  significant  increase  in  environmental  exposure  is anticipated.  The  Applicant  has  submitted  a  statement  on  non-significant  increase  of  environmental exposure to vardenafil exposing that the introduction of Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets is not assumed  to  increase  the  overall  environmental  concentration  of  vardenafil  as  active  ingredient significantly,  since  this  new  formulation  is  administered  at  the  same  dose  regime  as  the  already marketed tablets, but allows for the uptake of just 1 tablet (10 mg) instead of 2 (5 mg) in the previous formulation.  Hence,  Vivanza  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets  does  not  increase  the  number  of  overall doses of vardenafil significantly. Accordingly, it can be expected that no additional significant increase in use will occur. Therefore no further environmental risk assessment is required, following the EMEA guideline CPMP/SWP/4447/00, where  it  is  stated  that  an  environmental  risk  assessment  is  not  required,  when  the  proposed  line extension does not result in a significant increase in the environmental exposure. This is not assumed for Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablets. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction To support this application two pivotal, placebo controlled, randomized Phase III trials (Studies 12093 and 12094; Table 2) with a treatment period of 12 weeks have been conducted to support efficacy and safety of the 10 mg ODT. In addition the clinical program included three Phase I trials (Studies 10021, 12769  and  13396;  Table  1)  which  provided  pharmacokinetic  results  in  healthy  volunteers  as  in patients with erectile dysfunction. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  initial  development  strategy  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  of  the  orodispersable tablets  (ODTs)  with  the  approved  film-coated  tablets  (FCTs).  As  the  orodispersable  formulation showed  suprabioavailability,  clinical  studies  to  demonstrate  efficacy  and  efficacy  in  patients  with erectile dysfunctions were performed.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics Methods Analytical Methods Sampling Scheme On the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile days as defined in the studies, venous blood samples were taken for the determination of plasma concentrations of vardenafil. A typical schedule was comprised of a pre-dose sample and 17 sampling time points after administration as detailed in the following: 10*, 20, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5*, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 24 hours (h) (* not used in study 12093). Determination of vardenafil concentrations in human plasma Vardenafil (in free base equivalents) plasma concentrations were measured using fully validated highperformance liquid chromatography assays with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). Deuterated analogues of vardenafil (i.e. [ 2 H5]-vardenafil) were used as internal standard (ISTD) for the respective analyte. Monitored ion transitions (m/z) were 489 → 151 (312) for vardenafil and 494 151 (312) for the [ 2 H5]-labelled ISTD. The applied calibration range of the procedure reached from the lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ;  0.1  -  0.123 µ g/l)  to  50  -  52.5 µ g/l.  The  concentrations  were validated by assaying quality control samples of blank plasma spiked with known concentrations of the analytes.  Concentrations  above  LLOQ  were  determined  with  a  precision  of  better  than  15%  and accuracy  within  85 - 115%  in  accordance  with  internal  SOPs  and  pertinent  guidelines  on  method validation Determination of vardenafil concentrations in human saliva Vardenafil concentrations in saliva were determined after dilution employing HPLC with gradient elution and  ultraviolet  (UV)  absorbance  detection  at  230  nm  wavelength.  The  working  range  comprised concentrations in the range 0.0206 to 8.23 µg/l. Accuracy / precision in calibrators were 92.8% / 9.4% at the LLOQ and 98.1-100.6% / 0.25-1.5% above LLOQ. The QC samples were determined with 98.4% accuracy and 2.5% precision. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

The linear-logarithmic trapezoidal method was used to calculate AUC, and t1/2 was estimated by linear least squares regression after logarithmic transformation of the terminal concentrations. Based on the plasma  concentration  time  data  the  following  parameters  were  calculated  using  non-compartmental methods.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cmax and AUC values were dose- and body weight normalized ([Cmax,norm] and [AUCnorm]), according to the dose in milligram per kilogram body weight. Plasma concentration-time courses (calculated if two thirds or more of individual values were greater than the LLOQ, at the scheduled time) are presented as geometric mean values with or without geometric standard deviations. Pharmacokinetic parameters (except  tmax)  are  presented  as  geometric  mean  values  including  geometric  coefficient  of  variation [%CV] and range. Results for tmax are presented as median [range].

## Absorption

Vardenafil hydrochloride (HCl) is highly soluble in aqueous media at pH 1, however, due to the strong decrease in solubility with increasing pH a dose of 10 mg (vardenafil) is not completely soluble at pH values above 4.5 (250 ml of aqueous medium; 37 °C). Vardenafil is a highly permeable drug in vitro in the Caco-2-cell model. Due to the low solubility at neutral pH vardenafil HCl is a BCS class 2 drugs. This  condition  makes  that  a  small  amount  of  vardenafil  is  bioavailable  in  the  oral  cavity  as  it  was studied in the mechanistic study 10021. o Study 10021: Study to investigate local oral absorption Randomized, unblinded, two fold crossover study was performed in 10 healthy male subjects (aged 33.8 (26 - 43) years; mean (range)) in order to investigate the local bioavailability of vardenafil in the oral  cavity.  Fasted  subjects  received  a  solution  of  10  mg  vardenafil  as  HCl  salt  which  they  either swallowed with water or rested into the oral cavity, respectively. Subjects remained in a sitting position while  they  kept  the  solution  in  their  mouth  for  15  minutes  and  were  instructed  not  to  swallow. Subsequently they emptied their mouth and rinsed it with 5 x 20 ml water. The mouth rinses were collected,  combined  and  subject  to  analysis  of  vardenafil  concentrations  in  order  to  estimate  the amount of drug absorbed in the oral cavity. The relative bioavailability frel (ratio of AUC values) after local administration was 24.6 (17.0 - 35.6) % (point  estimate  (90%  CI))  compared  to  oral  (swallowed)  intake  of  a  solution  containing  10  mg vardenafil  as  HCl.  A  pronounced  lag  time  (tlag)  of  about  30  minutes  was  noted  and  the  rate  of absorption was slower after local oral compared to gastrointestinal absorption resulting in a delay in median tmax of 2 h (see Figure 1). The terminal elimination half-lives (3.5 and 3.6 h) were independent of formulation. The pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 3. 92 (48 - 113)% (arithmetic mean (range)) of the sublingually administered dose was recovered in saliva  and  water  collected  after  rinsing  the  oral  cavity.  Assuming  a  negligible  portion  of  vardenafil swallowed  after  local  oral  administration  it  can  be  inferred  that  about  8%  of  the  dose  (0.8  mg vardenafil) was absorbed in the oral cavity. The vardenafil AUC after administration to the oral cavity (4.904 µg*h/l) resulting from this small dose compares  to an AUC  of 19.91 µg*h/l after gastrointestinal absorption of a 10 mg dose. The relative bioavailability frel* of vardenafil after local oral absorption based on the actual absorbed dose (ratio of [AUC/Dose]) is estimated at 308%. This study  indicates  that  a  small  amount  of  vardenafil  is  absorbed  in  the  oral  cavity  with  increased bioavailability. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table   3:  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  vardenafil  in  plasma  following  single  dose administration  of  10  mg  vardenafil  oral  (swallowed)  solution  and  sublingual  solution, respectively (geometric mean / %CV (range), all subjects valid for PK, n=10) (Study 10021) Bioavailability Study 12769: Relative bioavailability, effect of food and effect of water Medicinal product no longer authorised

This was a randomized, open-label, four-fold crossover study in healthy young male subjects (mean age  and  range:  37.8  (29  -  49)  years,  n=13  valid  for  pharmacokinetics).  The  study  compared  the pharmacokinetics of 10 mg vardenafil as ODT (fasting, w/o water) and film-coated tablet (fasting, with 180 mL water), and investigated  the  effect of  a  high  fat,  high  calorie  breakfast  on  ODT  taken  w/o water.  The  ODT  was  administered  30  minutes  after  start  of  the  meal.  A  fourth  treatment  arm investigated  the  effect  of  water  (180 ml)  administered  together  with  the  10  mg  ODT  in  the  fasting condition in order to assess the pharmacokinetic changes in subjects who are non-compliant with the recommended mode of administration (i.e. w/o water).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When administered w/o water the ODT demonstrated suprabioavailability in comparison to film-coated tablet i.e. its mean bioavailability (AUC) was increased by 44% (point estimate and 90% CI of ratio [ODT fasted w/o water vs. film-coated tablet]: 144 (132-158) %). The AUC increase was observed from about 1 h post administration onwards and is attributed to the local absorption of vardenafil in the  oral  cavity  with  increased  bioavailability.  The  change  in  shape  of  plasma-concentration  vs.  time profile translated into a small increase in mean residence time (MRT) from 4.6 h (film-coated tablet) to 5.0 h (ODT). With the rate of absorption through the oral mucosa being slow, Cmax was less affected with the 90% CI of the ratio including unity (point estimate and 90% CI of ratio [ODT fasted w/o water vs. film-coated tablet]: 115 (94-140) %). ODT intake w/o water also resulted in an increase in median tmax of 0.75 h compared to film-coated tablet. In the treatment '10 mg ODT w/o water' the geometric CV% as a measure of inter-subject variability was numerically smaller for AUC compared to film-coated tablet (42 vs. 55%), while Cmax demonstrated similar variability (51 vs. 50%).

If  taken with water (180 ml) the concentration vs. time profiles of ODT and film-coated tablet were similar and the ODT was no longer suprabioavailable in comparison to film-coated tablet, with the AUC ratio and 90% CI ([ODT fasted with water / film-coated tablet] of 103 (94.0 - 113)%) complying with bioequivalence  criteria.  Under  these  conditions  of  intake  with  water,  Cmax  demonstrated  a  10% increase (point estimate and 90% CI [ODT with water / film-coated tablet]: 110 (90 - 135) %) and median tmax was reduced by 0.25 h compared to 10 mg film-coated tablet (0.75 to 0.5 h). If the ODT is taken with water, vardenafil is completely swallowed and its residence time in the oral cavity is not sufficient  to  allow  permeation  of  the  oral  mucosa.  When  comparing  'ODT  with  water'  to  'ODT  w/o water'  these  effects  of  intake  with  water  translate  into  a  decrease  in  AUC  by  29%,  essentially unchanged Cmax (- 4%) and a decrease in median tmax by 1 h (1.5 to 0.5 h). Administration of  the  ODT  with  a  high  fat/high  calorie  meal  had  no  effect  on  vardenafil  AUC  (point estimate and 90% CI of ratio [fed / fasting]: 98 (89 - 107) %) while Cmax was reduced by 35% (Cmax ratio [fed / fasting]: 65 (53 - 79) %). Food had no effect on the time to reach Cmax. Geometric CV % values for exposure parameters were numerically smaller if the ODT was taken with food (36 vs. 42% (AUC) and 34 vs. 51% (Cmax), fed vs. fasted condition). Given the lack of food effect on extent of bioavailability, slight reduction in Cmax and unchanged tmax with food, it can be concluded that the ODT can be administered without regard to food intake.

Vardenafil pharmacokinetics was similar in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment compared with  a  normal  renal  function  control  group.    No  statistically  significant  correlation  was  observed between creatinine clearance and vardenafil plasma exposure.  Subjects with severe renal impairment showed a 21% increase in mean vardenafil AUC and a decrease in mean Cmax of 23% compared with subjects with normal renal function.

Distribution No additional studies to investigate distribution following administration of the ODT were performed. The distribution of vardenafil after absorption from the ODT is considered to be no different from that of the film-coated tablet. Elimination No additional studies to investigate excretion or metabolism following administration of the ODT were performed. The excretion and metabolism of vardenafil after absorption from the ODT is considered to be no different from that of the film-coated tablet.

65 years (frel: 129 %; BAY BAY 38-9456 65 years). Regardless of age, a once-daily dosing regimen of vardenafil ODT did not result in accumulation in plasma.

Elderly The  covariate  'age'  was  specifically  investigated  for  Vivanza  ODT  in  view  of  the  possibility  of  local absorption in the oral cavity being age-dependent. The age-effect was investigated in the Study 13396. o Study 13396: Multiple-dose study to investigate the effect of age in male patients with erectile dysfunction Male ED patients were stratified by age according to the categories 18 to ≤45 years (n=14), &gt;45 to &lt;65  years  (n=6),  ≥65  to  &lt;70  years  (n=7)  and  ≥70  years  (n  =  7).  The  primary  comparison  to evaluate the effect of age was performed between subjects ≥65 years (actual mean (range): 70.5 (65 - 80) years; n=14) and ≤45 years (actual mean (range): 39.9 (31 - 45) years; n=14). The subjects received a single dose of 10 mg film-coated tablet with water on study day 1 followed by a wash-out of 2 days duration. Subsequently, 10 repeated once-daily doses of 10 mg ODT were administered w/o water with pharmacokinetic profiles being collected after the first  dose  (study  day  4)  and  last  dose (study day 13). Drug intake on day 1, 4 and 13 was in the fasting condition while administrations on days 5-12 were performed after a standardized Continental breakfast. Study 13396 showed that age has similar effects on the systemic vardenafil exposure of the ODT and film-coated tablet. Following  the  first  10  mg  ODT  dose  vardenafil  AUC  and  Cmax  were  increased  by  39  %  and  21  %, respectively, in subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared to subjects aged ≤ 45 years. On the last day of the multiple-dose regimen, vardenafil AUC τ ,ss [AUC(288-312)ss] and Cmax,ss were greater by 31 % and 16 %, respectively, in subjects aged ≥ 65 years. These effects of age on systemic drug exposure of the 10 mg ODT formulation were numerically smaller compared to 10 mg vardenafil IR tablet where AUC and Cmax were increased by 48 % and 39 %, respectively, in subjects aged ≥ 65 years. However the relative  suprabioavailability  of  the  ODT  compared to 10 mg film-coated tablet was decreased in the elderly. The relative bioavailability of the 10 mg ODT compared to the 10 mg IR tablet was slightly decreased in subjects aged ≥ / 13396 / 28 May 2009 123 of 1395 subjects aged ≤ 45 years vs 121 %; subjects aged ≥ Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The effects of CYP3A4 inhibitor comedication on the metabolism of vardenafil have been investigated in detail with the marketed Vivanza film-coated tablet and are also considered to apply to the ODT.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No specific studies have been conducted in support of this application.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

<!-- image -->

All special requirements for special population emerged from the studies have been properly included in the SPC.

Not applicable as no new pharmacodynamics data was required. 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology The applicant calculated that about 8% (0.8 mg) of the dose is absorbed from the oral cavity. However, considering that the amount of drug recovered in saliva and water collected after rinsing the oral cavity showed a high variability in the amount of drug recovered (48 - 113)% (arithmetic mean (range)) and also  taking  into  account  that  the  sample  used  (10  subjects)  seems  to  be  small,  the  8%  of  dose absorbed can be considered as an approximation. Nevertheless, the important issue is that part of the dose is  absorbed in  the  oral  cavity,  which  would  avoid  to  some  extent  the  hepatic  first  pass  effect leading to an increase of bioavailability. In  a  relative  bioavailability  study  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  ODT  shows  suprabioavailability  in comparison to the film coated tablet. It means bioavailability was increased by 44% point estimate and 90% CI of ratio [ODT fasted w/o water vs. film-coated tablet]: 144 (132-158) %, which is attributed to the local absorption of vardenafil in the oral cavity. This information is clearly reflected in the SPC to allow prescribers knowing that the ODT 10 mg and the film coated tablet are not bioequivalent. In this study the 10 mg ODT in the fasted state showed a median time to reach Cmax between 45 to 90 min, which supposes an increase in median Tmax of 0.75h compared to film-coated. When the ODT was taken with a high fat/high calorie meal, no effect on vardenafil AUC was observed, while Cmax was reduced by 35% and food had no effect on the time to reach Cmax. So it can be concluded that the ODT can be administrated without regard to food intake If the ODT is taken with water, vardenafil is completely swallowed and its residence time in the oral cavity  is  not  sufficient  to  allow  absorption  in  the  oral  cavity.  This  way  AUC  showed  bioavailability equivalence to the film coated tablet. However, Tmax was reduced by 0.25h compared to the 10 mg film  coated  tablet  and  Cmax  showed  a  10%  increase.  This  is  addressed  in  the  SPC  under  section 'method of administration'. The  submitted  studies  have  demonstrated  time-linear  pharmacokinetics  and  unchanged  AUC  after multiple once-daily doses. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall, what is important to highlight is that the 10 mg orodispersable tablet is not bioequivalent to the 10 mg film coated tablet, and therefore should not be used as an equivalent. The Applicant has included this information in section 4.2 of the SPC, indicating: 'Vivanza10 mg orodispersable tablet is not  bioequivalent  to  Vivanza  film-coated  tablet  (see  section  5.1).  The  maximum  dose  for  Vivanza orodispersable is 10 mg/day'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetic  studies  show  that  the  ODT  is  suprabioavailable  when  compared  to  the  film  coated tablets,  so  both  formulations  are  not  bioequivalent.  The  submitted  documentation  showed  that vardenafil pharmacokinetic levels are inside the efficacy/safety window considered for the film coated tablets.

Although a direct comparison between the 10 mg ODT and the 10 mg film coated tablets would have been desirable, the information provided with the submitted study is considered acceptable as this new formulation achieves the characteristic flat dose response curved linked to this active substance.

2.5. Clinical efficacy The pivotal clinical program for the development of Vivanza ODT 10 mg included two Phase-III studies, Study 12093 and Study 12094, with identical study design. These were multi-center, age-stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, and fixed-dose studies. Subjects followed a 4-week nonmedicated run-in period during which the diagnosis of ED was assessed and verified. Subjects were then randomized to one of the two treatment groups (vardenafil 10 mg ODT, or matching placebo) for a 12-week treatment period, after which there was a 48-hour follow-up period to record any adverse events (AEs). In order to provide sufficient safety and efficacy data of elderly patients exposed to Vivanza ODT, a stratified randomization procedure guaranteed the inclusion of 50% elderly subjects in each treatment group. 2.5.1. Dose response study The  efficacy  was  assessed  using  the  same  efficacy  parameters  that  those  already  used  in  studies investigating the film coated tablets, i.e. IIEF-EF Domain score, SEP 2 (success rates of penetration), and SEP 3 (success rates of maintenance of erection). The clinical efficacy documentation showed that the ODT was significantly superior to placebo in the parameters assessed. The marketing authorization was granted for 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film coated tablets. The 10 mg is considered  the  starting  dose,  however  as  general  precaution  a  lower  starting  dose  of  5  mg  is recommended for subjects ≥ 65 years of age. The MAH considered that since the ODT 10 mg dose is within the EU approved dose range for the film-coated tablets, a higher or lower dose-finding for the ODT  was  considered  unnecessary  and  a  single  dose  (10  mg)  clinical  development  program  was pursued. 2.5.2. Main study The Applicant has submitted two phase III pivotal studies; 12093 and 12094. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study 12093: Pivotal phase III trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of an Orodispersible Tablet vardenafil  versus  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  men  with  Erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  -  a  fixed-dose, double-blind, randomized multi-centre Trial - POTENT I.

Study 12094: Pivotal phase III trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of an Orodispersible Tablet vardenafil  versus  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  men  with  erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  -  a  fixed-dose, double-blind, randomized multi-centre Trial - POTENT II.

Study 12093 was carried out in 40 centres. Study 12094 was carried out in 35 active centres.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## METHODS

The design of both studies was identical and the following is therefore applicable to both studies.

## Study Participants

Both studies enrolled men in a stable heterosexual relationship lasting for at least 6 months, 18 years or  older,  with  ED  of  more  than  6  months'  duration,  as  defined  by  the  NIH  Consensus  Development Panel  on  Impotence  (inability  to  achieve  or  maintain  an  erection  of  the  penis  sufficient  to  permit satisfactory sexual performance).

Subjects were required to make at least 4 attempts at sexual intercourse on separate days during the 1-month untreated baseline period, with at least 50% of these attempts reported to be unsuccessful (inability to get an erection, failed penetration, or maintenance of an erection). Subject exclusion criteria The exclusion criteria ensured the correct diagnosis of ED and a population representative of subjects with ED. Subjects who may have had conditions that would have posed a risk during sexual activity according  to  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  Consensus  Panel  were  excluded  to  ensure  safe conduct  of  the  study.  Thus,  subjects  with  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  illnesses  within  the preceding 6 months such as unstable angina, history of myocardial infarction, stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia  were  excluded.  Subjects  with  congenital  QT  prolongation  or  on  drugs  known  to  cause significant  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  (in  particular  Type  Ia  and  Type  3  anti-arrhythmics), significant  hypo-  and  hypertension,  uncontrolled  atrial  fibrillation  or  flutter  (defined  as  a  ventricular response rate of ≥100 beats per minute), as well as subjects with a history of syncope or clinically significant postural hypotension within the six months prior to study entry were also excluded. Concomitant use of nitrates or other nitric oxide donors as well as anti-androgens and alpha-blockers were also exclusion criteria. Any use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir  and  indinavir  but  also  of  the  macrolide  antibiotics  clarithromycin  and  erythromycin  were excluded from concomitant use with the 10 mg ODT. Treatments Vardenafil  was  supplied  as  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets  (ODT)  and  matching  placebo  tablets.  Both active study drug and placebo had the same peppermint taste. At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects were stratified according to their age (18 to 64 and ≥ 65 years-of-age) and randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to vardenafil or placebo. Subjects  received  1  tablet  per  day.  At  Visit  2  (Week  0),  all  subjects  received  30  tablets  of  study medication, which was sufficient for the first 4 weeks of treatment and at Visit 3 (Week 4), 60 tablets of study medication which was sufficient for the last 8 weeks of treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The subject was to take the study medication approximately one hour before intended sexual activity. Study medication was to be taken on demand, but no more than one dose of study drug was to be taken per day.

Subjects were instructed that the study medication was not to be swallowed whole. Instead, the study medication tablets were to be placed in the oral cavity where they would quickly disintegrate. The ODT was taken without liquids

In both studies patients were to take the study medication approximately one hour before intended sexual activity. The SPC should recommend to take the medication also one hour before sexual activity.

## Objectives

The primary objective of  this  study  is  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  vardenafil  ODT  10  mg (PRN) after 12 weeks of treatment or LOCF with placebo in a general population of men with erectile dysfunction.

In these studies, approximately 50% of the men on active treatment have to be 65 years-of-age or older to get information on the safety profile as the 10 mg ODT formulation has a higher bioavailability when compared the 10 mg film coated tablet added to the fact that the elderly patients have higher AUC and Cmax values than younger patients with both formulations.

-  Success in maintaining erection during intercourse ('Did your erection last long enough for you to have  successful  intercourse?')  according  to  the  subject's  diary  from  randomization  to  Week  12 (overall) using the per-subject overall success rate.

Outcomes/endpoints Primary efficacy parameters The efficacy of the ODT was determined using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a 15item  questionnaire  that  has  proven  a  reliable,  cross-culturally  valid,  self-administered  measure  of erectile function.  The 15 items cover five domains: erectile function (6 items), orgasmic function (2 items),  sexual  desire  (2  items),  intercourse  satisfaction  (3 items),  and  overall  sexual  satisfaction  (2 items). Apart from the IIEF questionnaire, two event diary questions derived from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP), measuring success in penetration and maintenance of successful intercourse, were included as primary co-variables for the evaluation of efficacy. Primary measures of efficacy for the two studies were: - The baseline-adjusted erectile function (EF) domain score of the IIEF, calculated as the sum of scores from questions 1 to 5 and 15 at Week 12, using the LOCF method to account for missing data. These 6 questions  measure  the  frequency  of  achieving  erections,  the  frequency  of  achieving  erections  with sufficient  rigidity  for  penetration,  the  frequency  of  penetration,  the  frequency  of  maintenance  of erection  after  penetration,  the  ability  to  maintain  erections  to  completion  of  intercourse,  and confidence  in  obtaining  and  maintaining  an  erection.  Depending  on  the  question  in  the  IIEF,  the responses were scored either from 0 to 5, or 1 to 5, with 0 for no attempt at sexual intercourse. The responses were evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as covariate and with the treatment  and  center  as  factors,  presenting  the  least  squares  (LS)  means  at  baseline  and  postrandomization  together  with  the  standard  error  (SE)  for  the  LS  means  for  each  treatment.  In agreement with the CPMP recommendations (CPMP/EWP/2863/99, 2003), the stratum variable 'age' was also tentatively included as an additional factor. ED can be classified into five categories based on the EF domain score: severe (6-10), moderate (11-16), mild to moderate (17-21), mild (22-25) and no ED (26-30). - Success in penetration ('Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?') according to the subject's diary from randomization to Week 12 (overall) using the per-subject overall success rate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  answers  to  these  two  questions  on  penetration  and  maintenance  of  erection  came  from  the subject's  diary  and  were  collected  after  every  attempt  at  intercourse  during  the  untreated  baseline phase,  and  capturing  each  attempt  at  intercourse  over  a  24-hour  period  after  every  dose  of  study medication during the double-blind treatment phase.

Per-subject success rates were calculated as the total number of successes divided by the total number of  sexual  attempts  in  an  interval,  and  baseline  was  calculated  from  the  subject's  diary  completed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during the 4-week baseline phase. The primary time point for assessing efficacy for these two diary questions in both efficacy studies was predefined as the overall interval from randomization to Week 12.  No substitution was made for missing values in overall per-subject success rates.

## Secondary efficacy parameters

Secondary measures of efficacy included subjects achieving 'back to normal' erectile function scores in the IIEF questionnaire, as well as responses on the subject's diary concerning success of intercourse attempts, overall satisfaction with sexual experience, the Treatment Satisfaction Scale (TSS) and the Global Assessment Question (GAQ).

Sample size The  number of  subjects  required  in  this  study  was  based  on  the  primary  efficacy  variables,  the  EF domain score of the IIEF Questionnaire, and the success rates (coprimaries) of penetration (SEP 2) and maintenance (SEP 3) obtained from the data collected in the Subject Diaries. No alpha adjustment was required under the restriction that the IIEF-EF, the SEP 2, and the SEP 3 had to be simultaneously significant. However, the power of the total test was affected by the presence of coprimary endpoints and consequently, this impacted the sample size. For the case of the two co-primary efficacy variables, a good lower boundary for the overall power of the analyses was one minus the sum of the probability of the type II error for each variable. Randomisation At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were stratified according to their age (18 to 64 years-of-age and ≥ 65 years-of-age) and randomly and equally assigned (using a 1 to 1 ratio) to either vardenafil 10 mg ODT or placebo ODT according to a randomization code that was computer generated by the sponsor. The study was randomized in blocks of appropriate size meant to ensure a balance in terms of subjects between treatment groups. In order to achieve the intended allocation  of  50% of all  subjects  older  than  65  years-of-age,  a  forced  randomization procedure was used. Blinding (masking) In  this  randomized,  double-blind,  multicentre,  parallel-arm  trial,  blinding  was  maintained  until completion of the study. Statistical methods All  quantitative  clinical  variables  were  tabulated  as  descriptive  statistics  using  sample  sizes,  means, standard  deviations,  minimum  and  maximum,  and  the  median  per  item,  domain,  visit,  LOCF,  and treatment group. For the primary and coprimary variables, tables were generated for two samples: ITT (intent-to-treat  population)  and  PP  (per  protocol  population).  When  possible,  means  and  standard deviations were plotted against time and per treatment group (primary and coprimary). The two populations analysed for efficacy were defined as follows: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Intent to Treat Population (ITT): Subjects who had taken at least one dose of study medication and who had baseline and any post-baseline efficacy data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method to account for dropouts.

Valid-for-efficacy (VfE) population or Per Protocol Analysis (PP): All ITT subjects with the following additional criteria were included in PP analysis:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subjects who received 12 weeks of randomized treatment provided they had no additional major protocol violations or if they did not prematurely discontinue the study due to lack of efficacy or due to drug-related adverse events.
- Subjects who had no major protocol violations.

In both studies, the primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population and repeated for the  PP  population.  All  three  (co-)primary  efficacy  variables  were  required  to  simultaneously  show significance (p&lt;0.05) so no adjustment to alpha level for multiple endpoints was necessary.

Clinically relevant differences between 10 mg ODT and placebo were predefined for power calculations. A score difference of at least 5 points for the IIEF-EF domain and a percentage response difference of at  least  18%  for  the  diary  questions  in  the  general  population  were  used  for  clinical  studies  on vardenafil.    According  to  pooled  data  analyses,  improvement  of  ED  is  generally  smaller  in  elderly subjects  ( ≥ 65  years)  under  treatment  with  PDE5  inhibitors  compared  with  younger  subjects.    Both studies  12093  and  12094  included  50%  elderly  subjects,  however  a  score  difference  of  at  least  4 points  for  the  IIEF-EF  domain  and  a  percentage  response  difference  of  at  least  15%  for  the  diary questions was assumed, which were interpreted as clinically relevant treatment differences.

Altogether 44 subjects (13% of all randomized patients) had protocol deviations during the study; 21 subjects  (13%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  23  subjects  (13%)  in  the  vardenafil  group.  The  most commonly  reported  protocol  deviations  in  either  treatment  group  were  also  missing  follow-up information in all efficacy parameters (8% of the subjects in each of the treatment groups) and the use of erectile dysfunction treatment within 7 days of the selection visit (2% of the subjects in each of the treatment groups).

Conduct of the study Study 12093 Altogether 50 subjects (14% of all randomized patients) had protocol deviations during the study, 29 subjects  (16%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  21  subjects  (11%)  in  the  vardenafil  group.  The  most commonly  reported  protocol  deviations  in  either  treatment  group  were  use  of  erectile  dysfunction treatment within 7 days of the selection visit (7% of the placebo subjects and 4% of the vardenafil subjects) and missing follow-up information in all efficacy parameters (6% of the placebo group and 3% of the vardenafil group).

In study 12093 a total of 11 subjects (3.1% of the safety population) received a sexually enhancing drug after initiation of the study drug (5 subjects in the vardenafil group and 6 subjects in the placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group),  and  in  study  12094  a  total  of  8  subjects  (4  in  each  treatment  group;  2.4%  of  the  safety population).

One patient (&lt;65 years) in the placebo group in study 12093 and one more also in the placebo group in study 12094 used a vacuum pump after randomization.

## Treatment compliance

The  number  of  doses  was  based  on  the  difference  between  dispensed  and  returned  tablets  or  the number of doses documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).

Study 12093 The average number of doses per week overall for all safety population subjects in the vardenafil group was 2.8 tablets per week compared with 2.2 tablets per week for the placebo group in study 12093. Subjects &lt; 65-years-of-age in the vardenafil took an average of 3.2 tablets per week overall compared with  2.1  tablets  per  week  for  the  placebo  group  indicating  that  the  vardenafil  subjects  made  more sexual attempts. Elderly subjects in the vardenafil and placebo groups took an average of 2.4 tablets per week overall. Similar trend were seen in the ITT and PP populations. Study 12094 The average number of doses per week overall for all safety population subjects in the vardenafil group was 2.7 tablets per week compared with 1.8 tablets per week for the placebo group. Subjects &lt; 65years-of-age  in  the  vardenafil  took  an  average  of  3.0  tablets  per  week  overall  compared  with  1.9 tablets per week for the placebo group. Elderly subjects in the vardenafil group took an average of 2.3 tablets per week overall compared with 1.7 tablets per week for the placebo group. Similar trend were seen in the ITT and PP populations Baseline data Major  baseline  demographic  and  clinical  characteristic  were  similar  for  each  group  of  treatment (placebo vs. vardenafil ODT) in both studies.

About two-thirds of the safety population were Caucasians, followed by about 22% Hispanic (Study 12094 only) and 4% to 5% black or Asian subjects (see table below).  In study 12093, the ethnic origin of about 26% of the subjects was not determined due to country-specific reasons.

Non-codable* N.A. Missing** * In South Africa, 18 subjects could not be categorized with regard to race (study 12093). ** In France, race was not allowed to be reported (study 12093). More than 78% of all patients were married. Altogether 234 subjects (65.4%) (study 12093) and 183 subjects (53.7%) (study 12094) in both age groups  reported  'light'  alcohol  consumption  and  200  subjects  (55.9%  of  all  subjects  in  the  safety population-  study  12093)  and  164  subjects  (48.7%-  study  12094)  were  past  or  present  smokers. However,  approximately  28%  (study  12093)  and  19%  (study  12094)  of  all  subjects  were  present smokers  who  continued  after  terminating  the  study  while  the  majority  of  smokers  (approximately 72%-study 12093 and 81%- study 12094 ) already stopped smoking before the end of study. There were no apparent differences between the ITT and PP populations. Altogether  266  subjects  (74.3%  of  all  subjects  valid  for  safety)  of  study  12093  and  280  subjects (83.1%) of study 12094 had experience with PDE-V inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or the test drug vardenafil. The ED symptom pattern reported for the total safety population was comparable in both age strata in both treatment groups for both studies. The  average  time  from  onset  of  ED  for  the  total  safety  population  was  about  6  to  7  years  in  both studies whereas the mean time since diagnosis of ED was about 4 to 5 years.  The majority of subjects in both studies were diagnosed with ED with organic aetiology (52.2% and 65.0% in study numbers 12093  and  12094,  respectively).  The  severity  of  ED  symptoms  during  the  last  6  months  was comparable between both studies with 'Erection is not maintained during intercourse', 'Erection too soft to penetrate the vagina' and 'Inability to obtain an erection' being the most frequently (≥75%) reported complaints.

Apart from erectile dysfunction, subjects in the study reported further concomitant diseases that are frequently associated with ED. Vascular  hypertensive  disorders  were  the  most  frequently  reported  abnormalities  affecting  148 subjects or 41.3% of all randomized subjects in the safety population-study 12093 and 142 subjects or 42.1% -study 2094. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  both  treatment  groups,  subjects  ≥  65  years-of-age  had  a  higher  occurrence  of  hypertensive disorders than subjects &lt;  65 years-of-age. Elderly subjects also had higher frequencies of gastrointestinal  atonic  and  hypomotility  disorders,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  had  higher frequencies of diabetes hyperlipidaemia and (osteo) arthropathies than the younger subjects in both treatment groups.

Altogether 78.5% (study 12093) and 82.2% (study 12094) of all subjects in the safety population used concomitant medication post-enrolment.

Two Phase III studies of identical design have been performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the ODT formulation compared to placebo in patients with erectile dysfunction.

Ancillary analyses Not applicable. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) An  integrated  analysis  was  also  submitted;  data  for  both  studies  taken  together  showed  that  the treatment  group  differences  and  the  differences  between  ages  are  consistent  throughout  the  study from week 4 to week 12. Clinical studies in special populations Comparisons  of  results  in  subpopulations  were  done.  Sufficiently  sized  subgroups  were  ED  patients with and without diabetes/diabetic complications, dyslipidaemia or hypertension. All  analyses  (for  IIEF  Erectile  Function  Score,  SEP  2  and  SEP  3)  showed  a  nominally  significant superiority (p&lt;0.0001) of ODT treatment when compared with placebo within stratum and any disease subgroup.  There were nominally significant differences between subgroups, always reflecting poorer success rates in the elderly or in the subgroup with the underlying disease compared to the younger or the subgroup without the disease, respectively. Nevertheless, there were no significant 'stratum/subgroup*treatment' interactions. Efficacy of the ODT treatment was shown less pronounced in diabetic patients than in the other disease subgroups assessed. Supportive study Not applicable. 2.5.3.

In both studies, there was a 4-week run-in period without erectile dysfunction therapy (medication or devices).  During the 12-week treatment period, visits were planned on Week 0, Week 4 and Week 12. Forty-eight hours after the last dose of study medication was administered, a follow-up telephone call (or  personal  visit)  was  performed  to  obtain  information  about  the  possible  occurrence  of  serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths.

The  efficacy  was  assessed  using  the  same  efficacy  parameters  that  those  already  used  in  studies investigating the film coated tablets, i.e. IIEF-EF Domain score, SEP 2 (success rates of penetration),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and SEP 3 (success rates of maintenance of erection). The clinical efficacy documentation showed that the ODT was significantly superior to placebo in the parameters assessed.

Major  baseline  demographic  and  clinical  characteristic  were  similar  for  each  group  of  treatment (placebo vs. vardenfil ODT) in both studies. The average age of all safety subjects was about 62 years (for both studies). This is due to the increased number of elderly subjects required in this study as maintained by the forced randomization technique. The average age in the younger patient stratum was  about  53  years,  while  elderly  subjects  had  an  average  age  of  approximately  70  years.  The calculated age at entry in the study ranged from 21 to 84 years.

These results  showed  for  the  primary  efficacy  variables  in  both  studies  that vardenafil  10  mg  ODT treatment was significantly superior to placebo with respect to change from baseline to Week 12/LOCF in  the  IIEF-EF  domain and in the change from baseline to Week 12 overall in the diary item SEP 2 (penetration) success rate and the SEP 3 (maintenance of erection) success rate. Subjects &lt;65 year-of-age achieved slightly higher scores on the IIEF-EF and had better success rates in the SEP 2 and SEP 3 than subjects ≥65 years-of-age. There  was  a  treatment-independent  statistically  significant  age  effect.  And  nominally  significant country-specific difference, due lower success rates in Australian centers. All  secondary  efficacy  measures  showed  significant  differences  in  favour  of  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT (diary  success  rates  reported  for  SEP  1,  SEP  4,  SEP  5,  SEP  6,  Treatment  Satisfaction  Scale  (TSS) domains,  higher  percentages  of  subjects  taking  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  reported  'back  to  normal erectile'  function,  higher  percentage  of  subjects  treated  with  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  responded positively to the Global Assessment Question, subjects treated with vardenafil 10 mg ODT needed to initiate fewer sexual attempts until their first successful maintenance of erection. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy The efficacy results obtained for the primary efficacy variables in both studies showed that vardenafil 10 mg ODT treatment was significantly superior to placebo with respect to change from baseline to Week 12/LOCF in the IIEF-EF domain and in the change from baseline to Week 12 overall in the diary item SEP 2 (penetration) success rate, and the SEP 3 (maintenance of erection) success rate. Also all secondary efficacy measures demonstrated nominally significant differences in favour of vardenafil 10 mg ODT (diary success rates reported for SEP 1, SEP 4, SEP 5, SEP 6, Treatment Satisfaction Scale (TSS) domains, higher percentages of subjects taking vardenafil 10 mg ODT reported 'back to normal erectile'  function,  higher  percentage  of  subjects  treated  with  vardenafil  10  mg  ODT  responded positively  to  the  Global  Assessment  Question  and  subjects  treated  to  initiate  fewer  sexual  attempts until their first successful maintenance of erection). The clinical  efficacy  documentation showed that the ODT was significantly superior to placebo in all parameters assessed. These clinical results support the claimed indication.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The clinical program for Vivanza ODT is based on Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and subjects suffering from ED and on two pivotal Phase III studies in subjects suffering from ED.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patient exposure

From the phase III studies (12903 and 12094) 695 patients made up the safety population, 343 received placebo and 358 received 10 mg ODT.  A total of 357 of the 695 patients were ≥65 years of age (175 patients in the placebo group and 182 patients in the 10 mg ODT group). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for both phase III studies were very similar thereby justifying pooling of the safety data for integrated analyses.

The average exposure time per treatment group is 72 days (placebo; median: 78 days) and 76 days (vardenafil; median: 81 days). About 80% of all randomized subjects have been treated for up to 12 weeks (84 days), 20% have been treated for more than 12 weeks.

From the phase I studies, 52 patients made up the safety population. Adverse events The most frequently adverse events observed with ODT in the submitted clinical trials were headache, followed by flushing, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, and back pain. All of them are already covered in film coated tablets and were reported to be mild or moderate in intensity. In clinical studies phase III, 355 patients were treated with 10 mg ODT, 135 (38.0%) reported a treatment emergent AE, but only 86 (24.2%) patients had Adverse Events considered to be studydrug-related. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events In clinical studies phase III, the incidence of serious adverse events was low, with 5 (1.4%) patients in the  ODT group and 2 (0.6%) patients in the placebo group. None of these Serious Adverse Events were considered to be related to 10 mg ODT treatment. In phase I studies there were two serious adverse events, none of them drug related according to the investigator (motorcycle accident and CK elevation after physical exercise). Laboratory findings There were no signs of drug associated changes in the Laboratory findings and vital signs did not show relevant differences between placebo and Vivanza ODT. Safety in special populations Subgroup  analysis  showed  higher  incidence  only  in  patients  with  history  of  hypertension  (patients without  hypertension  13.6%  versus  patients  with  hypertension  18.4%).    Specifically  dizziness  was seen  more  frequent  in  patients  on  ODT  with  hypertension  (3.5%)  as  compared  to  patients  without hypertension (1.4%). Adverse Events by age were similar for most body systems except for vascular disorders with more elderly patients reporting Adverse Events (3%) than younger patients (1%).

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

An interaction study investigating the additional effect of a single dose of vardenafil 10 mg ODT on blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  on  the  background  of  a  vasodilator  is  ongoing  as  a  post-marketing commitment in conjunction with the FDA approval of 10 mg ODT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  (BAY  38-9456  /  15345)  is  performed  in  a  placebo-controlled,  2-fold  crossover  design  in elderly patients with erectile dysfunction and hypertension receiving chronic nifedipine treatment. The statistical analysis of this study is currently ongoing while the clinical part is completed.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Ten adverse events in 5 subjects lead to discontinuation of vardenafil compared to 2 AE in 2 subjects leading to discontinuation of placebo. Each AE has been reported only once, except dizziness, which is reported twice with vardenafil. The other AE leading to discontinuation are: chest pain, acute coronary syndrome,  vision  blurred,  ALT  increased,  muscle  spasm,  flushing,  dysphagia  and  headache  with vardenafil, anxiety and deafness neurosensory with placebo.

Of these discontinuations, particular attention has been provided to subject 14013-0009, who is a 39 year old man with no relevant past medical history that discontinued the study prematurely due to drug related adverse events (chest pain and blurry vision). However, the day in which these adverse events occurred, the subject took two doses of study treatment, which could reasonably explain the AEs. Post marketing experience Post-marketing data with the 10 mg ODT is available as a product containing the same active substance and the same new formulation is available in currently about 22 countries under the trade names Levitra 10 mg orodispersible tablets and Staxyn. Since market authorization in 2010 Levitra 10 mg ODT was introduced country by country with the first overall sales presented in the most recent PSUR no. 15 covering the reporting period 05 MAR 2011 04 MAR 2012. During this period 8.515.877 tablets of Levitra ODT and Staxyn were sold. Thus, based on the recommended maximum dosing frequency of one (1) tablet per day, approximately 0.023 Mio patient years of vardenafil ODT exposure can be estimated. The safety data from this product are in line with the known safety profile of Vivanza film-coated tablet. Ongoing Clinical Pharmacology Studies An interaction study investigating the additional effect of a single dose of vardenafil 10 mg ODT on blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  on  the  background  of  a  vasodilator  is  ongoing  as  a  post-marketing commitment in conjunction with the FDA approval of Levitra 10 mg ODT.

Subgroup  analysis  showed  higher  incidence  only  in  patients  with  history  of  hypertension  (patients without  hypertension  13.6%  versus  patients  with  hypertension  18.4%).    Specifically  dizziness  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seen more frequent in patients on the ODT with hypertension (3.5%) as compared to patients without hypertension (1.4%). Adverse Events by age were similar for most body systems except for vascular disorders with more elderly patients reporting Adverse Events (3%) than younger patients (1%).

In clinical studies phase III, the incidence of serious adverse events was low, with 5 (1.4%) patients in the  ODT group and 2 (0.6%) patients in the placebo group. None of these Serious Adverse Events were considered to be related to 10 mg ODT treatment.

In phase I studies there were two serious adverse events, none of them drug related according to the investigator (motorcycle accident and CK elevation after physical exercise).

There were no signs of drug associated changes in the Laboratory findings and vital signs did not show relevant differences between placebo and ODT. 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety Overall, the available safety data from clinical studies with the 10 mg ODT formulation confirmed the safety profile of vardenafil. No new or previously unreported side effects with respect to Vivanza filmcoated tablets have been reported. The post-marketing safety data from the already commercialised 10 mg ODT is also reassuring. 2.7. Pharmacovigilance The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH fulfils the legislative requirements. 2.8. Risk Management Plan The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: PRAC Advice The RMP submitted along with this procedure (Line Extension Application for Vivanza 10 mg orodispersable tablets) is the RMP version 2.0 dated 15 th  January 2010 which is the RMP submitted to support the Line Extension Application of Levitra 10 mg orodispersable tablets which was approved in September 2010. Since the last adopted RMP for vardenafil no regulatory actions have been taken for safety reasons leading to additional risk minimisation measures or pharmacovigilance activities not covered in the submitted RMP. Nevertheless, an update to the RMP is considered warranted. Therefore, the Applicant should submit an updated RMP together with the next PSUR submission (DLP 03/03/2013): The updated RMP should: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -be submitted in the new format according to the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices, Module V - Risk management systems
- -at least, include information gathered with the already marketed orodispersible formulation,
- -take into account the actions taken for safety reasons on vardenafil containing products since last RMP version.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 2.9. User consultation Vivanza 10 mg orodispersable tablets is a duplicate of Levitra 10 mg orodispersable tablets, and since no major changes have been made to the package leaflet for Levitra, no additional user consultation was required. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Vardenafil is a potent and selective phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, an extensive preclinical and clinical development program demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Vivanza film-coated tablets for the indication of erectile dysfunction. The orodispersible tablet (ODT) disintegrates rapidly in the mouth  in  the  presence  of  saliva  and  permits  a  convenient  mode  of  intake  without  water.  It  could benefit patients that have difficulty swallowing tablets or that would prefer a more discreet mode of administration. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risks

The  most  common  treatment  emergent  AEs  were  headache  (14.4%),  flushing  (7.6%),  nasal congestion (3.1%), dyspepsia (2.3%), dizziness (2.3%), and back pain (2.0%). Most of the treatmentrelated  AEs  reported  were  of  mild  severity.  The  rate  of  drug  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  was  low (placebo 0.6%, Vivanza 10 mg ODT 1.4%). For this new formulation there are no new unfavourable effects added to the already known for Vivanza film coated tablets. Importantly, the available post-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

marketing data from the same ODT formulation that has been approved in September 2010 under a different invented name does confirm the known safety profile.

PK  studies  show  that  vardenafil  ODT  is  suprabioavailable  when  compared  to  vardenafil  film  coated tablets,  so  both  formulations  are  not  bioequivalent.  The  submitted  documentation  showed  that verdanafil PK levels are inside the therapeutic window considered safe for the film coated tablets. This information is clearly reflected in the SPC to allow prescribers knowing that ODT 10 mg and film coated tablet are not bioequivalent. Furthermore,

PK studies showed a 10% increase in Cmax if the orodispersible tablet is taken with water. The SmPC indicates that Vivanza 10 mg ODT tablet must not be taken with water and that the maximum dose to be administered is one 10 mg orodispersible tablet, which is considered appropriate..

Benefit-risk balance The  available  data  shows  that  this  new  formulation  achieves  the  characteristic  flat  dose  response curved linked to this active substance. Furthermore, it shows that its pharmacokinetic profile is inside the safety/efficacy window already studied for vardenafil film coated tablet. This was confirmed with Phase III studies were vardenafil 10 mg ODT was significantly superior to placebo in all parameters assessed and safety data indicate that the safety profile is in line with that already known for Vivanza film coated tablets formulation and the information is already included in the current SPC. The applicant should also submit the results when available of the interaction study investigating the additional effect of a single dose of vardenafil 10 mg ODT on blood pressure and heart rate on the background of a vasodilator. Study BAY 38-9456 / 15345 placebo-controlled, 2-fold crossover design, in elderly patients with erectile dysfunction and hypertension receiving chronic nifedipine treatment. The overall benefit-risk balance of Vivanza 10 mg orodispersable tablets is positive. 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision that the benefit-risk balance of Vivanza 10 mg orodispersible tablet in the following indication: 'Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men. Erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Vivanza to be effective, sexual stimulation is required' is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the extension of the marketing authorisation Medicinal product no longer authorised subject to the following conditions:
