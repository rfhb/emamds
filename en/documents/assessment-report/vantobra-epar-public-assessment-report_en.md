## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant PARI Pharma GmbH submitted on 26 July 2012 an application for a Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for VANTOBRA, through the centralised procedure, falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 September 2011. The applicant initially applied for the following indication: · VANTOBRA  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  chronic  pulmonary  infection  due  to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. On 23 August 2013, at the time of submission of the responses to the D120 List questions, the Applicant changed the indication applied for to: · VANTOBRA  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  chronic  pulmonary  infection  due  to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who do not tolerate or are physically unable to manage tobramycin dry powder inhalation. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. On 28 March 2014 this proposed indication was further changed by the Applicant to: · VANTOBRA  is  indicated  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  chronic  pulmonary  infection  due  to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who cannot use tobramycin dry powder inhalation due to intolerance. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. On 15 April 2014 the proposed indication was further changed by the Applicant to: · VANTOBRA  is  indicated  for  the  suppressive  therapy  of  chronic  pulmonary  infection  due  to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who cannot use tobramycin dry powder inhalation due to intolerance. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. On 24 April 2014, the final proposed indication was agreed with the CHMP: · VANTOBRA is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who cannot use tobramycin dry powder inhalation due to intolerance. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. During  the  decision-making  phase,  the  European  Commission  raised  concerns  with  regard  to  the interpretation of the orphan legislation provisions on similarity. Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

On 25 September 2014, the CHMP agreed to re-assess the Similarity Assessment Report for VANTOBRA vis-à-vis authorised orphan medicinal products.

On 20 November 2014, the CHMP adopted a similarity assessment based on the indication last applied by the applicant on 24 April 2014.

- VANTOBRA is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who cannot use tobramycin

dry powder inhalation due to intolerance. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.

Since the proposed mode of action, molecular structure  and therapeutic indication were the same as those for the approved orphan medicinal product TOBI Podhaler, the CHMP concluded that VANTOBRA was similar to TOBI Podhaler and that the applicant would have to rely on at least one of the derogations foreseen in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 in order to be authorised.

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant submitted a claim addressing the following derogation laid down in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No141/2000: the applicant can establish in the application that the medicinal product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorised, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. An updated report was submitted to reflect the applicant's revised claims, in line with the final proposed indication for VANTOBRA.

On 28 November 2014, the Applicant changed the proposed indication to: · VANTOBRA is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF). Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article  10(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  -  relating  to  applications  for  hybrid  medicinal products. The application submitted  is composed of administrative information, complete quality data,  some non-clinical tests ( in vitro aerosol characterisation), clinical studies (2 bioequivalence studies with the reference medicinal product TOBI, one in healthy volunteers and one in cystic fibrosis patients), additional supportive clinical data (pulmonary deposition study, safety and efficacy data generated in the BE study in patients and a series of narratives from patients who were switched from tobramycin dry powder inhalation  to  tobramycin  solution  for  inhalation  due  to  intolerance),  and  supportive  bibliographic literature. Information on Paediatric requirements Not applicable.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary, autosomal recessive chronic condition in which the chronic airway disease is a prominent complication present in more than 98% of patients. Its clinical features, which include chronic cough, are complemented by periodic episodes of exacerbations, characterised by increased sputum volume and purulence. Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial agent, is the most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in patients suffering from CF. This marketing authorisation application concerns a new tobramycin formulation for inhalation developed by PARI Pharma GmbH, VANTOBRA 170 mg/1.7 ml nebuliser solution administered via a new delivery system (Tolero), based on a vibrating membrane technology (eFlow). 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The finished product is presented as a sterile nebuliser solution containing 170 mg of tobramycin as active substance. Other  ingredients  are:  sodium  chloride,  calcium  chloride,  magnesium  sulphate,  water  for  injection, sulphuric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) The product is available in single-dose polypropylene (PP) ampoules that are packed in sealed aluminium foil pouches (2 ampoules per pouch). The ampoules are supplied with a single patient use, reusable, drug specific, electronic Tolero nebuliser handset which has a CE mark. 2.2.2. Active Substance The chemical name of tobramycin is 4-O-(3-Amino-3-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)2-deoxy-6-O-(2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxyα -D-ribo-hexopyranosyl)-L-streptamine and has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CEP of the active substance manufacturer includes a suitably validated re-test period in a defined container closure system, supported by the available stability data.

The active substance is a white or almost white hygroscopic powder freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in ethanol (96%). As there is a monograph of tobramycin in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance  has  been  granted  a  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (CEP)  for tobramycin which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. Manufacture The information provided regarding the manufacturing process and the control of the active substance was assessed and approved by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.  Satisfactory quality of the active substance is ensured through the CEP. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (Ph. Eur.), identity (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.),  specific  optical  rotation  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC-UV),  related  substances  (HPLC-UV),  residual solvents (GC), water (Ph. Eur.) and sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.). The active substance will be tested and assessed by the finished product manufacturer applying the methods and specifications laid down in the Ph. Eur. monograph and the CEP, except for assay and related substances. The applicant has developed two in-house methods to test these parameters in both the active  substance  and  the  finished  product.  Both  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and cross-validated against the Ph.Eur. methods. Batch analysis data on seven commercial scale and one pilot scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and consistent from batch to batch. Stability Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

Finished product development The  product  has  been  developed  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Guideline  on  the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr.). The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to prepare a tobramycin nebuliser solution with reduced inhalation time in comparison to TOBI, the reference product. The development focused on the reduction of the volume to be administered by increasing tobramycin concentration in the solution and the use of a different device for nebulisation. The results of this study showed that tobramycin concentrations up to 100  mg/ml  show  appropriate  lung  deposition.  Therefore  this  concentration  was  selected  for  further development. A nominal dose of 150 mg in 1.5 ml of the 100mg/ml formulation was used during initial development, but based on the pharmacokinetic studies, the nominal dose was increased to 170 mg in 1.7 ml in order to maintain the therapeutic equivalence. Subsequent studies were aimed at improving the formulation characteristics. Since aqueous solutions of tobramycin at 100 mg/ml have a pH around 10.5, pH adjustment was required to obtain physiological pH values in the solution for inhalation. The excipients chosen for pH adjustment were sulphuric acid 96% and sodium hydroxide. Moreover, in order to ensure an adequate osmolality range for a nebuliser solution and  isotonicity,  sodium  chloride,  calcium  chloride  and  magnesium  sulphate  were  added  as  tonicity agents. The compatibility of tobramycin sulphate with the excipients used in the final formulation and other potential excipients investigated during pharmaceutical development was adequately demonstrated. All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph.  Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The primary packaging consists on single-dose polypropylene ampoules. The material complies with Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Nebuliser development VANTOBRA was developed to be delivered with a drug-specific, single patient use, reusable electronic nebuliser called Tolero. The Tolero device is CE marked and is composed of three main components: a Controller (eBase controller or eFlowrapid control unit), a connection cord and a drug specific nebuliser handset (aerosol head) as illustrated below: Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 2.

Tilting of the handset and its effects on the delivered dose and nebulisation time was also evaluated. No significant effects were observed when tilting the device 15° in different directions. However, tilting 45° resulted in significant differences in delivered dose. Although 45° tilting is considered extreme since the instructions indicate to keep it horizontally, a warning has been included in the proposed SmPC (section 6.6).

Appropriate studies have been performed to evaluate the compatibility of the device materials with the medicinal product. In  addition,  the  product  has  been  adequately  characterised  and  compared  with  TOBI/PARI  LC  Plus (nebuliser used to administer the reference product, TOBI) using the tests described in Ph. Eur. 2.9.44. monograph. Namely, active substance delivery rate, total active substance delivered, and aerodynamic assessment of nebulised aerosols were evaluated. VANTOBRA nebulised with the Tolero handset was shown to have a similar delivered dose (DD), a similar mean mass-related median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), a higher mean respirable dose and a shorter nebulisation time than the reference product. Due to the different principles of aerosol generation between the two devices PARI LC Plus and eFlow, there were statistically significant differences between the two devices in Drug Delivery Rate (DDR), with the VANTOBRA/ eFlow system significantly higher than for the jet nebuliser system TOBI/PARI LC Plus, both for adults and children. As a consequence the nebulisation times are much shorter for the eFlow device (3.4 minutes for the new devices and 4.5 minutes for the returned study devices compared to 14.6 minutes for PARI LC Plus). No statistically significant differences were seen between unused and used eFlow devices for any of the parameters  tested.  Breath  simulation  experiments  also  confirmed  that  the  drug  delivery  rate  of VANTOBRA is independent of the breathing pattern applied (adult or child). Since  there  were  differences  in  the  concentration  and  delivery  rate  of  both  products,  therapeutic equivalence between VANTOBRA and the reference product could not be established based on in-vitro data. Nevertheless, these results are supportive of the clinical efficacy studies presented. A simulated user test was conducted to investigate the effect of operating eFlow/Tolero with VANTOBRA 170mg over 56 treatments (corresponding to 28 days twice daily use). The results from this study showed that Tolero nebuliser handset when nebulising VANTOBRA delivers tobramycin in a consistent manner during a treatment cycle of 28 days.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## Manufacture of the product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The manufacturing process consists of: preparation of tobramycin bulk solution, pH adjustment, double sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling  using  a  blow/fill/seal  technology  and  packaging.  Sterile  filtration  was chosen as the sterilisation method due to the degradation of tobramycin at high temperatures.

The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process and has been validated on three full  scale  batches of tobramycin 150 mg/1.5 ml solution at the proposed manufacturing site. This is acceptable since the process is identical and only the fill volume differs with respect to the product intended  for  commercialisation  (VANTOBRA  170  mg/1.7  ml).  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  the  intended  quality  in  a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. Product specification The finished product release specifications  include  appropriate tests  for this  kind  of  dosage  form  as described in the Ph. Eur. and EMA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr. It includes description, appearance (clarity, color and visible particles) (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), identity (HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV) and related substances (HPLC-UV). Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  four  pilot  scale  batches  used  in  clinical  studies  and  three commercial scale validation batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability  to  manufacture to the intended product specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing. Stability of the product Stability data of three production scale batches of tobramycin 150 mg/1.5 ml solution stored for 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC) and accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH)  according to ICH guidelines; and for up to 6 months under 40 ºC / 75% RH were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing, except of the fill volume. In addition, supportive data from a pilot scale batch of VANTOBRA (tobramycin 170 mg/ 1.7 ml) stored under long term conditions (5 ºC) and accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH, 30 ºC / 65% RH and 40 ºC / 75% RH) for 33 , 12 and 6 months, respectively, was presented. Samples were tested for appearance (clarity, colour and visible particles), uniformity of dosage units, pH, osmolality,  sterility,  assay,  related  substances,  calcium  chloride,  magnesium  sulfate,  discoloration, density, surface tension, dynamic viscosity, refractive index, weight loss and dispensing volume. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The  stability  results  of  the  three  production  scale  batches  over  36  months,  showed  that  all  tested parameters were within the acceptance criteria when the drug product was stored at 5°C. During six months at 25 °C/60 % RH all parameters were also within the defined specification. However, after  6  months  the  color  changed  due  to  the  effect  of  the  temperature,  but  this  is  known  and  no correlation with purity profile was found.

In addition, one clinical batch exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. A second photostability study was performed on samples from a clinical batch which had been stored at 5°C for a period of 32 months to assess the photostability nearly at the end of shelf-life. The results from these studies confirmed that VANTOBRA 170 mg is photostable under the tested conditions as required in ICH Q1B and thus not sensitive to light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An in-use stability study was conducted to simulate possible short-time storage of the ampoules outside the pouch as used by the patient and confirmed that the product is stable for at least 4 weeks of storage without pouch in a stability cabinet (25°C/60%RH, darkness) or at ambient temperatures.

Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are acceptable.

2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Overall  information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the proposed SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development Not applicable. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction Tobramycin, the active substance of VANTOBRA  170  mg  nebuliser  solution, belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of aminoglycoside antibacterials (ATC Code: J01GB01), originally obtained from cultures of Streptomyces tenebrarius . Tobramycin, the active substance of VANTOBRA, is a water-soluble aminoglycoside antibiotic, which acts primarily  by  disrupting  protein  synthesis  leading  to  altered  cell  membrane  permeability,  progressive disruption of the cell envelope and eventual cell death. Tobramycin inhibits protein synthesis of numerous Gram-negative (including Escherichia coli , the species Proteus , Enterobacter , Klebsiella , Acinetobacter , Pseudomonas , Serratia , Providencia) and Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. It is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The clinical trial data and the post-marketing experience available for the approved reference product TOBI were considered sufficient by the CHMP for establishing primary pharmacodynamic properties of VANTOBRA and no further studies were deemed necessary. In addition, recent European data collected by EARS-Net showed that the resistance against tobramycin does not appear to be increasing in Europe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cross-resistance to other aminoglycosides is nevertheless possible, dependent on the mechanism of resistance that is involved.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No new studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP, in view of the existing evidence provided for the approved reference product. Safety pharmacology programme The lack of safety pharmacology studies was justified by the fact that there is no mention of any particular adverse effects having been identified in the reference medicinal product, TOBI SmPC, and this was considered sufficient by the CHMP. No further studies were deemed necessary. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions As known for tobramycin containing medicinal products, concurrent and/or sequential use of tobramycin with other medicinal products with neurotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoided. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Tobramycin should  not  be  administered  concomitantly  with  ethacrynic  acid,  furosemide,  urea,  or  intravenous mannitol. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics The  already  publicly  available  information  on  the  PK  of  tobramycin  is  summarized  below  and  was considered sufficient by the CHMP, no further studies were deemed necessary: Absorption The oral bioavailability of tobramycin is very low. Following administration by inhalation in humans, the median serum concentration of tobramycin 1 hour after inhalation of a single 300 mg dose of TOBI is 1 µg/ml. This is in contrast to the situation in rats, where considerably higher serum concentrations (20-45 µg/ml) were achieved when a concentration of 60 mg/ml tobramycin was administered by inhalation for 180 minutes per day in a 6-month study. The terminal plasma half-life is comparable between humans, rabbits and dogs (1.6, 1.23, and 0.9 hours respectively). Distribution Tobramycin has no plasma protein binding. VANTOBRA is expected to have no or little plasma protein binding after absorption. The distribution of VANTOBRA after absorption is likely to be the same as for tobramycin  administered  subcutaneously,  i.e.  widespread  distribution into tissues with highest concentrations in the kidney. In addition, high local concentrations in the lung are expected following inhalation of tobramycin. The high concentrations in the kidney are linked to nephrotoxicity (see also the toxicology section of this CHMP AR). Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tobramycin has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrate in the kidney and urine of the foetus. No information was available regarding exposure via mother milk. The Applicant stated that systemic tobramycin was excreted in the breast milk. According to the TOBI SmPC, the amount of tobramycin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

excreted in breast milk after administration by inhalation is unknown, but is estimated to be very low in view of the low systemic exposure.  CHMP considered this to be a reasonable assumption.

## Metabolism

Tobramycin is not metabolized in the human body; thus no studies on the metabolism of VANTOBRA were considered necessary by the CHMP. Excretion Tobramycin is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine of humans, through glomerular filtration. There  is  no  information  regarding  excretion  of  tobramycin  in  laboratory  animals;  however,  since tobramycin has been shown to concentrate in the kidney of rats it seems likely that urinary excretion is also the major excretory pathway in rodents. After inhalatory administration, the excretion of VANTOBRA is expected to follow the same mechanisms as systemically administered tobramycin. 2.3.4. Toxicology Single dose toxicity The publicly available tests description on the acute toxicity studies of the reference medicinal product were considered adequate and sufficient by the CHMP. These studies were conducted in rats and mice in support of another tobramycin product, using the intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. No information as to direct cause of death is available; however, clinical signs of tobramycin toxicity included clonic convulsions, decreased and labored respiration, hypoactivity, ataxia and prostration. LD50 values for mice were 53-107 mg/kg with intravenous (i.v.) and 416-484 mg/kg with subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. In rats, the LD50 values were 131-134 mg/kg with i.v. and 928-1020 mg/kg with s.c. administration. CHMP agreed that no further studies should be required. Repeat dose toxicity Three  inhalation  studies  in  rats  (one  of  these  also  included  guinea  pigs)  were  performed  with  the reference product TOBI.

1  Estimated deposited doses were calculated using the equation applied by the CDER reviewer (CDER 1997a). 2 The doses in mg/kg have been calculated for rats only. 3 In the non-clinical overview, the mean lung deposited doses are stated as 4.9, 14.3 and 57.5 mg/kg, respectively. However, the CDER reviewer re-calculated these values, adjusting the figures to 1.24, 3.72, and 11.16 mg/kg (CDER 1997a) Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two of these studies were of 14 days and one of 6 months duration, with a 4 week recovery period. Target organs for toxicity were the kidney and respiratory tract.

Kidney effects, in the form of an increased incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy (a spontaneous age-related condition in Sprague-Dawley rats) were only observed in the 6-month study. Treatment with TOBI is considered to have shortened the time to appearance of this condition, thus indicating some systemic toxicity. Nephrotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of parenteral aminoglycoside therapy both in animals and humans. Renal lesions result from accumulation and retention of aminoglycoside in the  proximal  tubular  cells,  causing  a  defect  in  renal  concentrating  ability,  mild  proteinuria,  and appearance of hyaline and granular casts. The impairment in renal function is usually reversible, as the proximal tubular cells have the capacity to regenerate.

With regard to the administration by inhalation, systemically absorbed tobramycin is assumed to behave the  same  way  as  any  other  tobramycin  product.  Accordingly,  any  systemic  effects  will  depend  on exposure. Whether VANTOBRA will cause any increased risk for nephrotoxicity as compared with TOBI depends on systemic exposure, which was evaluated clinically in one of the conducted BE studies and was deemed unproblematic. In addition, in the VANTOBRA SmPC, the risk for nephrotoxicity is appropriately highlighted under 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'. Local degenerative and inflammatory changes in the upper respiratory tract and lungs were seen in the preclinical inhalation studies with TOBI. Such changes are commonly seen in inhalation toxicity studies and are likely to result from high local concentrations of the drug in lung tissue following extended inhalation in animals. Although complete reversibility was not demonstrated for respiratory effects in the 6-month  inhalation  study  in  rats,  given  enough  time  these  types  of  lesions  are  judged  to  be  fully reversible. In addition, lesions in the nose are not considered relevant for humans, since inhalation occurs by  mouth.  CHMP  therefore  did  not  consider  necessary  to  include  any  information  about  preclinical respiratory adverse effects in the SmPC for VANTOBRA. In addition to nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of aminoglycosides. Although this effect was mentioned by the applicant in the provided non-clinical overview, no preclinical data were presented or discussed; nevertheless in the clinical overview, a brief mention of a published study in cats where  tobramycin  at  doses  of  40-80  mg/kg/day  produced  degeneration  of  cochlear  hair  cells  and supporting sensory structures was made. In the SmPC for TOBI, ototoxicity is described and highlighted in 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'. This was considered to be sufficient by the CHMP, which agreed that no further data were deemed necessary. Genotoxicity A  complete  package  of  genotoxicity  studies,  including  tests  for  gene  mutations  and  chromosomal aberrations in vitro and chromosomal aberrations in vivo , has been performed with the reference product TOBI.

The results of these studies were negative. It should be noted that there is no information available concerning the exposure in the in vivo mouse micronucleus study. The CHMP concluded based on these test results, that tobramycin does not have any genotoxic potential and no further studies were deemed necessary. Carcinogenicity The Applicant refers to a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study with the aerosolised TOBI inhalation solution formulation, where no evidence of a carcinogenic potential was seen. No short or medium-term studies have been submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP and no further studies were deemed necessary. Reproduction Toxicity The Applicant refers to studies conducted in the 1970s, in support of another tobramycin product. These studies were later submitted in the application of the reference product TOBI. Table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant considered that the same studies could be used in support of VANTOBRA. This approach was accepted by the CHMP. It was noted that the reproductive toxicity studies referred to in the application were conducted before the adoption of GLP standards for toxicity studies, but it was acknowledged that the guidelines in place at the time were followed. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP and no further studies were deemed necessary.

In the 6-month rat study, serum levels in the high dose group immediately after dosing were 20 µg/ml on average. The comparison with the average serum level of 1 µg/ml observed in humans one hour after inhalation  of  170  mg  VANTOBRA,  suggests  that  rats  get  considerably  higher  systemic  exposure  to tobramycin than humans following inhalatory administration. There was no accumulation in serum in the 6-month study. In terms of safety margin, the renal NOAEL in the 6-month study is 9-fold above the average human serum level (1 µg/ml).

Tobramycin did not impair fertility in male or female rats at s.c. doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, nor were these doses associated with any increased pre- or post-implantation loss. In rats and rabbits, s.c. doses of  tobramycin up to 100 mg/kg (rats) or 20 mg/kg (rabbits) given during organogenesis were not associated with visceral or skeletal malformations in the offspring. Doses &gt;40 mg/kg were toxic to the rabbit  dams,  leading  to  abortion  or  death  in  many  animals  and  precluding  the  evaluation  of teratogenicity.  In  rats,  the  100  mg/kg dose  was  not associated  with clinical  signs  of  toxicity,  but microscopic changes (nephrosis) were observed in the kidneys of the dams. Tobramycin did not appear to affect late gestation or parturition in a peri/postnatal study in rats. Fetal body weights and survival were similar across the treatment groups and no external malformations were observed. Ototoxicity was not evaluated. Although the exposure to tobramycin was not measured in the reproductive toxicology studies, the doses given were 10-100 times higher than those in the 6-month inhalation study. In view of this, and taking into consideration the much lower systemic bioavailability after administration by inhalation, the risk for adverse effects on fertility, and for teratogenic effects, with VANTOBRA is regarded as low. On the other hand, since tobramycin has been shown to cross the placenta in humans and concentrate in the kidney and urine of the fetus, a risk for nephrotoxicity in the fetus cannot be excluded. This risk has been appropriately described and highlighted in section 4.6 of the VANTOBRA SmPC. Toxicokinetic data The Applicant presents limited toxicokinetic data on the three inhalation toxicity studies with TOBI. Mean serum levels of tobramycin immediately after exposure on Day 1 are shown in the following table: Table 4. Mean serum level on Day 1 in inhalation rat toxicity studies with TOBI Study ID N00I328A (rat) SC950011 (rat) N001328B (rat) Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Local Tolerance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  local  tolerance  of  inhaled  tobramycin  was  evaluated  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  As discussed above, the findings in the respiratory tract are considered typical of non-specific inflammatory responses to extended inhalation of the drug in animals and thus CHMP agreed that the risk for local respiratory adverse effects in humans is low and no further studies were deemed necessary.

The non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data can be bridged from that of the reference medicinal product. This is the approach adopted by the applicant, who refers to toxicity data generated with the approved reference product TOBI, as well as to the fact that tobramycin has been widely used in the clinic for  the  last  decades  and  its  human  safety  profile  is  well  known.  Therefore  this  justification  for  non performing new studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Other toxicity studies No  other  antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence  or  metabolites  studies  were  submitted  by  the applicant. CHMP agreed that no further data were deemed necessary. Juvenile toxicity studies No studies on juvenile animals were submitted for the present application. The applicant justified this by referring to already existing clinical experience with tobramycin in children. This approach was considered acceptable by CHMP and no further studies were deemed necessary. Impurities The levels of organic impurities contained in VANTOBRA nebuliser solution were below the qualification thresholds given in the ICH Q3A (R2) and ICH Q3B (R2) guidelines. Accordingly, the CHMP agreed that no toxicological qualification was needed. 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment Table 5. Substance (INN/Invented Name):tobramycin (VANTOBRA) Conclusion OECD 107 (non-GLP) log K ow = -3.11 to -1.85 Potential PBT ( N ) Value Unit Conclusion PEC surfacewater, refined (literature) µ g/L VANTOBRA PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Log Dow is &lt;4.5 at both pH 7 and pH 11. Tobramycin is positively charged at multiple sites at lower and neutral pH and becomes fully neutral only at very high pH values (around pH 11). Tobramycin was therefore considered not persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), nor very persistent and bioaccumulative (vPvB). CHMP agreed to this conclusion. 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

The non-clinical data package provided on VANTOBRA was considered sufficient by the CHMP. The main toxic side effects, i.e. nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, including risks for the foetus, are appropriately described and highlighted in the VANTOBRA SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The pharmacological and toxicological profiles of tobramycin are well known. The non-clinical toxicity studies  conducted  with  the  approved  tobramycin  reference  product  are  considered  adequate  and sufficient by the CHMP and no further studies are needed.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic properties of tobramycin have been evaluated over time in children, adult and elderly subjects with CF. They are summarised below:

<!-- image -->

Absorption Tobramycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and hence the systemic exposure after inhalation is expected to result primarily from the pulmonary absorbed portion of the dose. Following tobramycin inhalation, serum concentrations are expected to be low; values around 1 μg/ml are reported in the literature. Concentrations in sputum are approximately 1000 times higher compared to serum concentrations. Binding of tobramycin to plasma proteins is less than 10%. Distribution Tobramycin is distributed in the extracellular fluid. The apparent volume of distribution is 0.3 L/kg body weight. Elimination Tobramycin  is  not  metabolised  and  is  primarily  eliminated  unchanged  in  the  urine  via  glomerular filtration. The elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 h. Pharmacokinetic studies Four clinical/pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted: · Study  G007.03:  a  single-dose  lung  deposition  study  of  Tobramycin  100  PARI/eFlow  versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS in adult and adolescent CF patients · Study  G007.05:  a  28-day  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of  Tobramycin  100  PARI/eFlow versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS in CF patients · Study  12012.101:  a  14-week,  2-period,  multi-centre,  crossover  bioequivalence  as  well  as efficacy and safety study of VANTOBRA/Tolero (eFlow) versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS · Study 12012.102: a single-dose, 2-period, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers of VANTOBRA/Tolero (eFlow) versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS Studies G007.03 and G007.05 are mainly explorative as a dose lower than the proposed to be marketed dose was administered to the enrolled patients. In the pivotal bioequivalence studies 12012.101 and 12012.102 the final VANTOBRA dose of 170 mg/1.7 ml dose was administered and compared to inhalation of TOBI 300 mg. The primary objective of these studies was to evaluate bioequivalence between VANTOBRA and TOBI. In addition, efficacy and safety of VANTOBRA and TOBI were evaluated. Study G007.03 In this lung deposition study a lower dose of 150 mg/1.5 ml of the test product was administered. Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Methods

This was a randomised, open-label, 2-way cross-over trial in which the lung deposition of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg/1.5 ml delivered by the eFlow electronic nebuliser and TOBI 300 mg/5 ml using the PARI LC PLUS jet nebuliser, was compared after a single-dose administration.

A total of 17 male patients with cystic fibrosis were enrolled: 9 subject aged 10-17 and 8 subjects &gt;17 years. Subjects received inhaled tobramycin spiked with the radiolabel 99m Tc-DTPA (diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid). Tobramycin lung deposition was measured using gamma camera imaging. The primary efficacy variable was the difference between the estimated lung deposition of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg delivered with the eFlow device run to dryness compared to TOBI delivered with the PARI LC PLUS device until sputtering, or 10 minutes (whichever occurred first). Given that similar particle size distribution of tobramycin and 99m Tc-DTPA after nebulisation into a particle sizing  device  (Next  Generation  Pharmaceutical  Impactor)  was  obtained,  it  was  assumed  that  the deposition of the radiolabel would be an accurate representation of the deposition of tobramycin. The lungs were imaged at 5 minute intervals for 20 minutes following the deposition; it was possible to calculate the clearance rate of the radiolabel and then mathematically adjust the image to reflect what had been deposited during the entire period of nebulisation. Results The results are presented in the below table: Table 6. Lung deposition (mg) of Tobramycin based on  99 Tc-DTPA counts (Study G007.03). The mean lung deposition was similar between treatments and the p-value indicates no evidence of treatment difference. Similar  results  were  obtained when  the  primary  results  were  stratified  by  age group, except that the confidence intervals were wider due to smaller sample sizes. The lung deposition relative to the total drug amount was higher for Tobramycin PARI 150 mg (31%) compared to TOBI (17%). The extra-thoracic deposition in the mediastinum and stomach was not significantly different for the different formulations.

## Study G007.05

In this explorative comparative bioavailability study the same lower dose of 150 mg/1.5 ml of the test product was administered-as in the lung deposition study G007.03.

## Methods

This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, active controlled, parallel safety and bioavailability study of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg (150 mg/1.5 ml) nebulised with eFlow versus TOBI (300 mg/5 ml) nebulised with PARI LC PLUS in cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. A total of 78 patients, 21 aged 8-17 years and 18 adults per treatment group were randomised for either treatment A (Tobramycin PARI 150 mg/eFlow) or treatment B (TOBI 300 mg/PARI LC PLUS). The dose of the reference product (300 mg tobramycin bid) was in accordance with the SmPC for TOBI. The dose of the test product (150 mg bid) was chosen as it had proven an equivalent in vitro aerosol characterisation of the respirable dose and delivered dose as the reference. After a 7-day wash-out phase, in which no tobramycin was allowed, the patients were treated with their assigned medication and devices for 28 consecutive days. Blood and sputum samples were taken at days 1, 7 and 28. Pre-dose blood samples were taken at day 1 and 28. At day 7 blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8  hours  post-dose.  Sputum  samples  were  taken  10  minutes  after  inhalation  at  days  1,  7  and  28. Concentrations of tobramycin in plasma and sputum were analysed using an LC-MS/MS assay. The primary efficacy variable was Cmax on day 7. Secondary efficacy variables were AUC at day 7, sputum levels at days 1, 7 and 28 and plasma trough levels at days 1, 7 and 28. Results - plasma Plasma tobramycin Cmax on day 7 and plasma tobramycin AUC on day 7 are shown in the following tables: Table 7. Plasma tobramycin Cmax on Day 7 (Study G007.05). Table 8.

CHMP agreed that after the administration of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg, tobramycin plasma exposure did not  exceed  the  exposure  obtained  after  administration  of  TOBI  300  mg.  Tobramycin  sputum concentrations were similar between formulations. The fact that the plasma sampling period was rather short (8h) and that the sputum evaluation were based on one sample per subject and period (10 min post inhalation) only was considered acceptable by the CHMP for this supportive study. Study 12012.101 This was a comparative, randomised, two period, multi-centre, cross-over, 14-week bioequivalence study of VANTOBRA (170 mg/1.7 ml) delivered by the eFlow electronic nebulizer versus TOBI (300 mg/5 ml) using  the  PARI  LC  PLUS  jet  nebulizer  in  cystic  fibrosis  patients  with  bronchopulmonary  chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  bioequivalence  of  VANTOBRA  and  TOBI  in  children  and adolescents/adults using eFlow or PARI LC PLUS devices, respectively. In addition, efficacy and safety of the two different medicinal products were evaluated as secondary objectives. Methods The clinical part of the study was conducted at four EU study centres. The bioanalytical part collected plasma and sputum samples. No issues regarding GCP have been identified. Study design This  was  a  multicentre  open  label,  randomised,  2-period,  2-sequence,  crossover  study  following administration of Tobramycin with two different inhalation systems and different doses in 58 patients treated  either  with  VANTOBRA  (170  mg/1.7  ml)  /  eFlow  or  TOBI  (300  mg/5  ml)  /  PARI  LC  PLUS. Tobramycin was administered twice daily (in the  morning and in the evening),  until dryness of the nebuliser.  Each  treatment  period  was  4  weeks,  separated  by  a  washout-phase  of  4  weeks  between periods 1 and 2. At  the  end  of  each  treatment  cycle,  blood-  and  sputum-samples  were  collected  and  analysed  for tobramycin using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Blood-samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after end of inhalation. Sputum samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 10 min, 30 min, 1.5, 2 and 8 h after end of inhalation.

## Populations studied

A total of 58 cystic fibrosis patients with bronchopulmonary chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (25 male and 33 female) were enrolled. Of the 58 enrolled patients, 28 were aged 7-13 years and 30 patients 13-36 years. All subjects were Caucasian. Fifty-four patients received both study treatments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three patients stopped the treatment during the wash-out phase and one patient was withdrawn from the study participation 3 days after the start of TOBI treatment. The reasons were impairment or worsening of the disease in one case and in three cases because of (serious) adverse events. Five additional patients were excluded from the PK-analysis due to insufficient PK-sampling.

Hence, 49 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacokinetic Variables Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods. The primary endpoint was plasma AUC0-12h. Secondary PK-endpoints included Cmax, C0 in plasma and sputum and Tmax. Statistical methods The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  log-transformed  plasma  AUC0-12h  and  Cmax  using  ANOVA. Consistent with the two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90%-confidence intervals for the difference between  drug  formulation  least-squares  means  (LSM)  were  calculated  for  the  log-transformed parameters plasma AUC0-12h and plasma Cmax. The acceptance range for the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the back-transformed LSMEANS of tobramycin was determined as 80% to 125% for the parameters plasma AUC0-12h and 70% to 133% for plasma Cmax. The parameter plasma tmax was evaluated descriptively. Results Plasma concentration versus time profiles (AUC0-12h), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (tmax) and trough levels (C0) of the test treatment VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI were determined at the end of each treatment phase. The results are presented below: Table 10.

After a 28-days treatment period, the systemic exposure and peak concentrations of VANTOBRA was about 15% and 17% lower compared to TOBI (total data for both age groups) and the 90% CI was outside the conventional bioequivalence limits of 80.00-125.00. In the age group 7-13 years, the upper limit of the 90% CI for Cmax was also slightly above the conventional acceptance limit of 1.25, but below the prospectively defined widened limit of 1.33. Median tmax was comparable between the test and the reference formulation. A high variability in AUC and Cmax for both products was observed. When data was distinguishing between children (7-13 years) and adolescents (&gt;13 years) a slightly lower AUC and Cmax in the older age group compared to the younger was observed. Sputum concentrations versus time profiles (AUC0-8), maximum concentrations (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (tmax) and trough levels (C0) of the test treatment VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI were determined at the end of each treatment phase. The results are presented below: Table 11.

Variability in sputum concentrations was high. A formal bioequivalence evaluation was not performed, but mean tobramycin exposure in sputum was approximately 35% higher for VANTOBRA compared to TOBI.

During the CHMP discussion of these results, it was acknowledged that, although the findings on lung function  and P.  aeruginosa suppression  seemed suggestive of efficacy and did not indicate relevant differences in efficacy between VANTOBRA and the reference product, it was not possible to conclude whether the difference in pharmacokinetic parameters affected the efficacy of VANTOBRA, because of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high variability of the results. A potential under-dosing could not be ruled out entirely, based only on the results  of  this  study.  To  further  support the  efficacy  and  safety  of  VANTOBRA,  the  applicant  also conducted a bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (study 12012.102).

This  was  an  open-label,  single-dose,  randomized,  two-way  crossover  study  to  investigate  the bioequivalence  and  compare  the  safety  profiles  following  inhalation  of  VANTOBRA  170  mg/1.7  mL nebulizer solution to TOBI 300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution. Plasma concentrations of tobramycin was analysed using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Objectives : The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  investigate  the  bioequivalence  (in  terms  of  relative  systemic bioavailability  based  on  pharmacokinetic  plasma  profiles)  of  VANTOBRA  170  mg/1.7  mL  nebulizer solution as compared to TOBI300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in healthy subjects and to assess and compare the local and systemic safety and tolerability of the test and reference treatment. Methods : Bioequivalence in healthy subjects was planned to be investigated by analysing plasma concentrations of tobramycin following inhalation of VANTOBRA 170 mg/1.7 mL nebulizer solution and TOBI 300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in two treatment periods in randomized order. Safety and tolerability were to be assessed on the basis of the following variables: adverse events, pregnancy  test,  vital  signs,  safety  laboratory,  drug  and  alcohol  screening,  serology,  ECG,  physical examination, local tolerability, and overall tolerability. Study population: 72 healthy subjects were randomized; 69 completed the trial. Results : Plasma  concentration  versus  time  profiles  (AUC0-12h),  maximum  concentration  (Cmax)  and  time  to maximum concentration (tmax) of the test treatment VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI were determined in each period. The results are presented below: Table 12. Pharmacokinetic parameters (non-transformed values; arithmetic mean ± SD, tmax median, range) for tobramycin, n=69 (Study 12012.102).

Tobramycin has a broad antibacterial spectrum including many Gram-positive species and most aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas spp. The antibacterial effect of aminoglycosides correlates best with peak serum concentrations in relation to MIC (Cmax / MIC).

After single-dose administration in healthy volunteers the systemic exposure and peak concentrations of VANTOBRA  was  about  24%  and  21%  higher  compared  to  TOBI  and  the  90%  CI  was  outside  the conventional bioequivalence limits of 80.00-125.00. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action The  mode  of  action  of  tobramycin  is  virtually  the  same  as  that  of  other  aminoglycosides  such  as gentamicin. It is first actively transported across the bacterial cell membrane by an oxygen-dependent system.  Hence,  aminoglycosides  are  inactive  under  anaerobic  conditions.  Aminoglycosides  primarily affect bacterial protein synthesis and result in rapid concentration-dependent killing. The molecule binds irreversibly to the A site of the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome where it blocks protein synthesis by inhibiting  the  movement  of  peptidyl-tRNA  associated  with  translocation  as  well  as  increasing  the frequency of misreading of the genetic code as a result of incorrect codon-anticodon interaction. The cell membrane permeability is affected, resulting in the disruption of the cell wall, and ultimately in cell death. The effect of tobramycin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations.

There is an extensive clinical experience of both intravenously administered tobramycin as well as inhaled tobramycin to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Local concentrations in the lungs after inhalation of tobramycin is considerably higher compared to concentrations obtained after systemic administration, leading to that conventional susceptibility breakpoints are not applicable. However, sputum from patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  CF  exhibits  an  inhibitory  action  on  the  local  biological  activity  of  inhaled  aminoglycosides.  This necessitates  sputum  concentrations  of  tobramycin  after  inhalation  to  be  about  ten-fold  above  the minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  or  higher  for P.  aeruginosa suppression.  The  unique characteristics of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients, such as anaerobic conditions and high  frequency  of  genetic  mutations,  may  also  be  important  factors  for  reduced  susceptibility  of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. Tobramycin, like other aminoglycosides, is associated with renal toxicity and ototoxicity.  In  general,  toxicity  is  seen  at  higher  systemic  tobramycin  levels  than  are  achievable  by inhalation at the recommended clinical dose.

2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology Pharmacokinetics The main objective was to analyse the bioequivalence between VANTOBRA and TOBI in order to bridge to the efficacy and safety data obtained with TOBI. In the pivotal bioequivalence study (Study 12012.101), the administration of VANTOBRA and TOBI was compared in CF patients. The results showed slightly lower systemic exposure (15% lower) with VANTOBRA compared to TOBI. In order to further support the efficacy profile evaluation of VANTOBRA, an additional bioequivalence study in healthy subjects (Study 12012.102) was conducted. In this study the systemic exposure of VANTOBRA was, on the contrary, slightly higher compared to TOBI. Discussion of the design of the studies Study 12012.101 was conducted in CF patients and had a multiple-dose cross-over design where plasma and sputum samples were analysed on day 28 in each period. For immediate release products it is usually recommended to evaluate bioequivalence after single-dose administration since a multiple-dose study is less sensitive to detect differences in Cmax due to accumulation. Given the relatively short half-life of tobramycin (2-3 h), the risk of accumulation is however minor and the choice of sampling at day 28 is acceptable.  Almost  half  of  the  subjects  (46%)  reached  tmax  at  the  first  sampling  point  (30  min), indicating  that  a  more  frequent  early  sampling  would  have  been  recommendable.  Hence  there  are uncertainties in the estimation of Cmax. Inhalation of a larger volume for a longer time period, as for TOBI, might lead to larger volumes of sputum. The total amount of tobramycin in sputum could therefore have been additionally measured. Sputum samples are hence a mixture of sputum ranging from the upper respiratory tract to deeper parts of the lungs. It is therefore difficult to draw firm conclusions about the  clinical  relevance  of  the  possibly  higher  tobramycin  concentration  found  in  sputum  after administration of VANTOBRA. Study 12012.102 was a well-designed single-dose study in healthy volunteers. In  both  studies,  TOBI  (300  mg/5  ml)  was  used  as  comparator.  The  bioanalytical  methods  for determination of tobramycin in plasma and sputum were adequately validated. Discussion of the results The absorption of tobramycin was faster in patients compared to healthy volunteers with a median tmax of 1  h  and  4  h,  respectively.  The  overall  systemic  exposure  also  appeared  to  be  lower  in  patients (between-study comparison). In CF patients the systemic exposure was slightly lower with VANTOBRA while in healthy subjects the systemic exposure was slightly higher with VANTOBRA compared to TOBI.

According to the guideline on the requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products (OIP) including the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products for use in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents (CPMP/EWP/4151/00  Rev. 1),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetic data could be used as a surrogate of pulmonary deposition, and hence efficacy, for an orally  inhaled  product  used  in  the  treatment  of  asthma  and  COPD,  under  the  condition  that gastro-intestinal absorption is negligible or blocked by charcoal. Since tobramycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration the systemic exposure after inhalation is expected to result primarily from the pulmonary  absorbed portion of the dose. However, given the disease-associated effects on the airways including presence of mucous in patients with CF the situation is more complex. In CF patients, the relationship between plasma exposure and pulmonary deposition is therefore not obvious and the use of PK-data as a surrogate of efficacy may be questioned in this patient population. However, the results from the pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers provide useful complementary  information  about  the  in  vivo  performance  of  VANTOBRA,  avoiding  the  bias  in  CF patients, which have a heterogenous and variable obstruction.

Local  concentrations  in  the  lungs  after  inhalation  of  tobramycin  is  considerably  higher  compared  to concentrations  obtained  after  systemic  administration,  leading  to  that  conventional  susceptibility breakpoints are not applicable. However, sputum from patients with CF exhibits an inhibitory action on the  local  biological  activity  of  inhaled  aminoglycosides.  This  necessitates  sputum  concentrations  of tobramycin after inhalation to be about ten-fold above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or higher for P. aeruginosa suppression. The unique characteristics of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in  CF  patients,  such  as  anaerobic  conditions  and  high  frequency  of  genetic  mutations,  may  also  be important  factors  for  reduced  susceptibility  of  P.  aeruginosa  in  CF  patients.  No  thorough  data  on susceptibility to tobramycin of the P. aeruginosa strains isolated during the study period was submitted. The limited information regarding susceptibility to tobramycin is acceptable for this hybrid application. CHMP agreed that the pharmacodynamic properties of tobramycin were well known and that no further studies were needed.

In patients the exposure was approximately 15% lower after administration of VANTOBRA compared to TOBI while in healthy subjects the exposure was approximately 24% higher with VANTOBRA than with TOBI. The lower systemic exposure in CF patients did however raise questions pertaining to the fact that less tobramycin could have reached the lungs and that VANTOBRA might have been less efficacious compared to TOBI. However, in healthy subjects the airways are not affected by mucous etc. and the systemic exposure is therefore expected to better reflect pulmonary deposition. The higher systemic exposure obtained  with  VANTOBRA  compared  to  TOBI  in  healthy  volunteers  does  therefore  indicate  that  the amount of tobramycin deposited in the lung was not lower, but actually slightly higher with VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI. A higher pulmonary deposition is relevant from an efficacy point of view and the efficacy of VANTOBRA is thus expected to be comparable with that of TOBI. Although the evaluation of sputum concentration had some limitations, the higher sputum concentrations obtained with VANTOBRA compared to TOBI is indicative of a somewhat higher lung deposition. CHMP concluded that the overall results of the in vitro characterisation and the pharmacokinetic studies showed  that  despite  the  fact  that  VANTOBRA  was  not  completely  equivalent  to  TOBI,  the in  vivo differences were rather small and were not expected to impact on the efficacy or safety of VANTOBRA. Furthermore, the clinical efficacy data in CF patients, although limited, did not indicate clear differences between the two medicinal products. Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action and mechanisms of resistance of tobramycin are well known and there is an extensive  clinical  experience  of  both  intravenously  administered  tobramycin  as  well  as  inhaled tobramycin to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The target site for inhaled tobramycin is the lungs where the active substance exerts its effect. Systemic absorption is not desirable, low systemic exposure reduces the potential for systemic toxicity. Given that the  oral  bioavailability  of  tobramycin  is  negligible,  the  systemic  exposure  will  primarily  result  from pulmonary absorbed tobramycin.

Tobramycin  was  administered  twice  daily,  in  the  morning  and  in  the  evening,  until  dryness  of  the nebuliser. Each treatment period was 4 weeks separated by a washout-phase of 4 weeks between periods 1 and 2. At the end of each treatment cycle, blood- and sputum-samples were collected. Blood-samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after end of inhalation. Sputum samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 10 min, 30 min, 1.5, 2 and 8 h after end of inhalation.

The  pharmacokinetics  of  VANTOBRA/eFlow  has  been  evaluated  in  four  comparative  studies  with TOBI/PARI LC PLUS as reference. In the first two studies a lower dose than the proposed to be marketed dose was given and these are only considered as explorative. The overall results of the in vitro characterisation and the pharmacokinetic studies show that VANTOBRA is not behaving exactly in the same way as TOBI. However, the in vivo differences were rather small and are not expected to have an impact either on efficacy or on safety. Furthermore the clinical efficacy data in CF patients (e.g. FEV1%) -although limited-did not indicate clear differences between the products. The pharmacodynamic properties of tobramycin are well known and no further studies are needed. 2.5. Clinical efficacy As this is a hybrid application, the clinical efficacy data derive from the pivotal clinical study (phase 1b) performed with VANTOBRA/eFlow (here referred to as VANTOBRA) in comparison to TOBI/PARI LC PLUS (here referred to as TOBI) and relevant available bibliographical data from studies performed with the reference medicinal product TOBI. 2.5.1.

Results The main efficacy results of this BE study are presented below: Figure 6. Colony  Forming  Units  (CFU):  Overall  reduction  of  PA  (All);  normalized  on  Visit  2  as Baseline Treatment with tobramycin resulted in an overall reduction in CFU density of P. aeruginosa , irrespective of the specific medicinal product/nebulizer used. In general, the treatment effect was more pronounced in the first than in the second treatment period. During the first treatment phase a similar log10 CFU reduction was achieved with VANTOBRA and TOBI (-1.77 ± 2.74 vs. -1.70 ± 2.93, p &lt; 0.005), in the second treatment phase the reduction was -1. 30 ± 2.55 and 0.12 ± 1.78, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment period revealed an overall reduction of PA CFU density of -3.07 ± 5.26 and -1.62 ± 5.14 for VANTOBRA and TOBI, respectively.

The changes in the different lung function parameters under investigation were consistently indicative for an improvement under both therapies with a tendency of better improvement under VANTOBRA therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The treatment effects of FEV1 % predicted were very similar for both groups, VANTOBRA and TOBI, in the first treatment period. However, a positive treatment effect was also observed for VANTOBRA in the second treatment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in FEV1 was achived with VANTOBRA and TOBI (8.20 ± 9.49 vs. 24.80 ± 9.58), in the second treatment phase the change was 2.40 ± 10.64 and -0.44 ± 8.10, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment period revealed an overall increase in FEV1 of 10.59 ± 20.81 and 4.48 ± 18.24 for VANTOBRA and TOBI, respectively.

The treatment effects on the forced vital capacity (FVC) were comparable between VANTOBRA and TOBI. However, a positive treatment effect was also recognized in patients who received T100 in the second treatment phase, whereas in patients who received TOBI during the second treatment period the positive effect could not be preserved. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in FVC was achieved with VANTOBRA and TOBI (6.53 ± 9.78 vs. 4.74 ± 11.45), in the second treatment phase the change was 0.03 ± 9.56 and -0.07 ± 6.99, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment period revealed an overall increase in FVC of 6.56 ± 20.25 and 4.75 ± 19.40 for VANTOBRA

Figure 10. Absolute changes in FEV1 % predicted (&gt;13 a), normalized to Visit 2 as Baseline The treatment effects of FEV25-75 (predicted) were very similar for both groups, VANTOBRA and TOBI, in the first treatment period. However, a positive treatment effect was also observed for VANTOBRA in the second treatment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in FEV25-75 was achieved with VANTOBRA and TOBI (9.15 ± 13.76 vs. 10.28 ± 14.32), in the second treatment phase the change was 2.35 ± 16.08 and -1.54 ± 15.20, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment  period  revealed  an  overall  increase  in  FEV25-75  of  11.50  ±  30.43  and  9.01  ±  31.29  for VANTOBRA and TOBI, respectively.

and TOBI, respectively.

The treatment effects of PEF are not statistically different between the both groups VANTOBRA and TOBI. However, a positive treatment effect is seen in patients who received VANTOBRA in the second traetment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in PEF was achieved with VANTOBRA and TOBI (3.92 ± 16.60 vs. 5.44 ± 13.41), in the second treatment phase the change was 3.00 ± 12.30 and -0.95 ± 11.23, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment period revealed  an  overall  increase  in  PEF  of  6.92  ±  28.96  and  4.65  ±  25.19  for  VANTOBRA  and  TOBI, respectively.

No large drop-out rates were observed and compliance was high for both treatments. No large differences were observed at baseline for both groups. Overall, the observed treatment effects of VANTOBRA were supportive of efficacy. For both products a significant improvement of lung function relative to baseline was observed. This effect was, furthermore, consistent over the various parameters, as well as with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. Although there was a large variability in the data as apparent from the large standard deviations (also due to the small numbers), the improvement seemed slightly more pronounced for VANTOBRA treatment. Despite the fact that the treatment effect diminished during the treatment phase 2, the  treatment effect with VANTOBRA still seemed beneficial, while a reduction in lung function was observed with TOBI, in particular in participants &gt;13 years.  Because of the small sample size, the relevance of these findings cannot be fully concluded upon. It may be speculated that the lack of efficacy in adolescents and adult patients receiving TOBI in the second cycle, may be due to

2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy The main differences between the two medicinal products are the concentration and total amount of inhaled tobramycin, related to different inhalation device systems. Efficacy data were primarily derived from the comparative, randomized, open-label, two period bioequivalence study 12012.101, in which clinical efficacy data was collected as a secondary endpoint. Design and conduct of clinical studies The pivotal study was designed in accordance with protocol assistance from the CHMP to analyse the bioequivalence between VANTOBRA and TOBI. Of note, the study was not designed or powered for efficacy endpoints, which were secondary endpoints. The  open-label  design  was  deemed  acceptable,  because  the  differences  in  nebulisers  used  for  both treatments complicated a double-blind design. The included participants (not treatment-naïve) can largely be regarded representative for the target population for which the applicant received an orphan designation. The youngest patient included was 7 years old. TOBI is the current 'gold standard' in the inhalational therapy for management of pulmonary infections in CF and, therefore, an adequate comparator. The measured secondary efficacy endpoints (clinical: lung function parameters FEV1 %, FVC, FEV25-75, PEF; microbiological: P.  aeruginosa suppression) were  considered relevant and  in accordance  with recommendations in the CHMP CF guideline (CHMP/EWP/9147/2008).  According to the report of a recent workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/69571/2012) lung function parameters, in particular FEV1, are recommended as the core outcome parameters. Microbiology outcome should focus on  CFU/g  in  respiratory  samples  and  should  be  regarded  as  supportive,  but  it  is  stressed  that microbiological impact generally does not predict the clinical response or magnitude of response.

compliance issues, considering the longer administration time compared to the previous treatment in this subgroup  with  VANTOBRA.  Although  compliance  was  recorded  as  high  in  both  groups,  the  figures reported for TOBI may not be fully reliable, considering that they were only reported in patients' diaries. CHMP acknowledged that the available data indicate that the clinical efficacy of VANTOBRA is comparable with that of TOBI, notwithstanding that some differences between VANTOBRA and TOBI with regard to effect on lung function and P. aeruginosa suppression could still exist. Provided results from the Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) records did not provide divergent results.

2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy Pharmacokinetic data provided showed a slightly higher lung deposition of VANTOBRA compared to TOBI. A higher pulmonary deposition is expected to be beneficial from an efficacy point of view and VANTOBRA is thus expected to be at least as efficacious as TOBI. In the pivotal study in patients (12012.101) the observed treatment effects were overall favourable without clear differences between the products. For both products, a significant improvement of the lung function relative to baseline was observed for the first treatment phase. This effect was consistent over the various parameters (FEV1 %, FVC, FEV25-75, PEF), as well as with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. The treatment effect of VANTOBRA was beneficial in terms of the lung function, in particular during the second treatment period. Taking into account the results of both conducted BE studies 101 and 102, the CHMP concluded that they constitute a relevant bridge for safety and efficacy between VANTOBRA and TOBI in patients 6 years and older with chronic P.aeruginosa lung infection and cystic fibrosis. 2.6. Clinical safety Exposure in healthy volunteers Study 12012.102 was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study to investigate the bioequivalence and compare the safety profiles following inhalation of VANTOBRA 170 mg/1.7 mL nebulizer solution to TOBI 300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in 72 (69 completed) healthy subjects. All patients who terminated the study according to protocol received a total of about 470 mg tobramycin. Three subjects, who terminated the study early, received about 300 mg tobramycin. Patient exposure A total of 153 patients were included in the safety database from three phase 1 study populations: Study G007.03 (17 patients),  Study G007.05 Safety and bioavailability study (78 patients)  and a phase 1b study, 12012.101, Bioequivalence as well as safety assessment of VANTOBRA/eFlow versus TOBI PARI LC/PLUS (58 patients). Study 12012.101 was considered pivotal. In this study, the dose that is currently applied for, 170 mg/1.7 ml, was used. The other two studies (G007.03 and G007.05) investigated lower doses. Study G007.03 Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

Three of the 17 subjects (17.6%) experienced a total of 5 AEs, all of which occurred after the nebulisation of T100 (125 mg or 150 mg). AEs were labelled most commonly as ´mild´ (4/5 AEs 80%) and had resolved by the end of the study. According to the investigator´s assessment the causal drug-reaction relationship was ´highly probable´ for 1 AE (cough) and ´unlikely´ for 3 AEs (abdominal pain, nausea, cough).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Four other subjects experienced cough of low intensity, which was not deemed as an AE after nebulisation of tobramycin 150 mg (T100). Bronchospasm, voice alteration, tinnitus or dyspnoea were not reported.

One serious AE of moderate intensity (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) was reported, judged ´definitely not related' to study treatment by the investigator.

Study G007.05 Of the 246 AEs reported, 179 AEs (72.8%) were considered unrelated to the study medication, whereas 67 (27.2%) were considered related and thus qualified as ADRs. In the reference group (TOBI/PARI LC PLUS),  41  of  the  143  AEs  (28.7%)  were  considered  therapy-related,  in  the  Tobramycin  PARI  150 mg/eFlow group these were 26 of the 103 AEs (25.2%). Of the 246 AEs in randomised patients, 147 (59.8%) events were of mild and 75 (30.5%) of moderate severity; 24 (9.8%) were severe.  Severe AEs were more frequent in the TOBI/PARI LC PLUS group (17/143 AEs, i.e. 11.9%) compared to the Tobramycin PARI 150 mg/eFlow group (7/103 AEs, i.e. 6.8%). There were no SAEs reported in this study. Two patients treated with TOBI experienced seven respiratory AEs which were considered significant. Study 12012.101 In this study 1.7 ml of the 100 mg/ml solution was used, i.e. 170 mg which is the dose proposed for approval  of  market  authorisation  (VANTOBRA).  Thus  the  total  dose  is  considerably  lower  (170  mg) compared to the reference product TOBI (300 mg). However, according to in vitro data, the delivered dose and the respirable doses seems to be quite similar between the two products. Adverse events Healthy subjects Safety assessment amongst VANTOBRA and TOBI using eFlow and PARI LC PLUS devices, respectively, was considered as secondary endpoint in the bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (12012.102). In total, 70 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 49 out of 72 patients (68.1%). Reported AEs were generally mild in intensity and distributed into the System Organ Class (SOC) 'respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' and 'nervous system disorders'. The most frequent AEs for VANTOBRA were reported from the SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (25 events in 22 subjects), the most frequently reported preferred term was 'cough', reported from 17 subjects. The most frequent AEs for TOBI were reported from the SOC nervous system disorders with preferred term 'headache' (11 events in 10 subjects). All other SOC were reported with a frequency of five or less events with a similar rate between the treatment groups. Of  the  70  AEs,  16  (22.9%)  were  rated  as  not  related  and  54  (77.1%)  were  rated  as  related  with tobramycin  inhalation.  The  distribution  of  related  events  over  the  treatment  groups  was  64.8% (VANTOBRA) and 35.2% (TOBI). Reported AEs were generally mild in intensity. Events were categorized as mild in 92.7% and 65.5%, moderate in 7.3% and 27.6%, and severe in 0% and 6.9% for VANTOBRA and TOBI, respectively.

## CF Patients

As expected from active ingredient properties AEs were mainly represented by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  Overall, 76 adverse events were reported in 29 patients (50 % of all patients) of the safety population under investigation (n = 58). 29 patients experienced no AEs. Three AEs were severe in intensity, and all others were classified to be mild to moderate. 32 adverse events (approx. 42%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of all AEs) were considered to be related to the study drug, i.e. they were defined as ADRs. All of them were classified as mild to moderate in intensity.

There were no clinically relevant pre- vs. end-of-study changes in vital signs. Neither were there any prevs. end-of-study changes in physical examination observed.

Bronchospasms as defined in the protocol occurred only in 2 patients under TOBI (3.4% of the patients) and were considered by the investigator as an ADR. Audiology testing revealed two cases of tinnitus in patients under VANTOBRA treatment (3.4% of all patients). Both cases were mild in severity and transient as resolving shortly after inhalation. One patient in  the  VANTOBRA  group  showed  pathological  signs  in  pure  tone  audiometry  measured  by  bone connectivity (highest value for left ear at 2 KHz was 35 dB). Pulmonary exacerbation was observed in one patient (1109) only during the wash-out phase after TOBI treatment. This patient required treatment with antibiotics which were prohibited as per study protocol and thus was withdrawn from further study participation. Investigations on the occurrence of resistant P. aeruginosa revealed only inconclusive results as cultures of sputum samples showed no growth of the pathogen in approx. half of the assays. Analysis of the CFQ-R revealed only inconclusive results. Neither relevant differences nor even trends were found between the treatment groups or age strata. The time per inhalation was markedly reduced in the drug/device combination of VANTOBRA / eFlow (mean: 4.4 min) as compared to the combination TOBI / PARI LC PLUS (mean: 24.3 min). Compliance to therapy of the patients was generally high in both groups with 99% for VANTOBRA patients (as recorded by an electronic Monitoring System of the device) and 99% for TOBI patients (as recorded in patient diaries). Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events In study 12012.102 in healthy volunteers, no death occurred during the study. One serious adverse event (SAE) occurred in the current study (ankle fracture), considered as not related to study drug. In total, five SAEs due to hospitalization occurred in 4 CF patients during the washout period; however, none of them was considered drug-related. No fatality was observed. Laboratory findings Six events were described as clinically relevant increases in laboratory values (4 in one patient, who discontinued TOBI-treatment and increase of LDH in another two patients, one patient in the VANTOBRA, one patient in the TOBI group, both continued the treatment). All of those abnormal parameters were recorded as AEs, i.e. none of these were drug related. All other changes of laboratory values outside of the normal range were assessed by the investigators as 'not clinically significant'. Safety in special populations Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study was performed in patients aged 7-36 years of age, mean age 15 years. This represents the target population. In study 12012.101 the number of AEs in the age stratum 6-13 years was twice as frequent as in the stratum group &gt;13 years (40 vs. 19 events), but the system organ class (SOC) pattern was similar between the age strata.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 12012.102 in healthy volunteers, two subjects of the total of 72 subjects in the safety population terminated the study early because of a SAE (ankle fracture and common cold). Among studies in CF patients, in no case study medication had to be discontinued temporarily or permanently due to an ADR.

There were 5 serious adverse events (SAEs) recorded in 4 patients; the reason for seriousness was hospitalisation in all cases. None of the SAEs was drug-related.

Taking into account the results of both conducted BE studies 101 and 102, the CHMP concluded that they constitute a relevant bridge for safety and efficacy between VANTOBRA and TOBI in patients 6 years and older with chronic P.aeruginosa lung infection and cystic fibrosis. The safety findings of the submitted studies support this conclusion. Available data generated from the submitted studies indicate a similar safety profile as for the reference product in the general CF population. AE reported are mainly associated with drug administration, primarily respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety Safety  data  were  available  from  all  four  conducted  clinical  studies.  However,  study  12012.102  was performed in healthy subjects and only study 12012.101 provided safety data obtained from patients exposed to the proposed dose. Overall, study 12012.102 did not detect any events justifying safety concerns in healthy volunteers. No signs  of  local  intolerability  (paradoxical  bronchospasm)  were  recorded  after  administration  of  both tobramycin products. The  results  from  study  12012.101  showed  that  the  systemic  exposure  of  tobramycin  is  lower  after administration  of  VANTOBRA/eFlow  compared  TOBI/PARI  LC  PLUS.  Thus,  the  systemic  safety  of VANTOBRA is not expected to be different or worse than for TOBI and is therefore reassuring. The most frequent observed drug-related AEs were in the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal system organ  classes,  with  cough  being  most  frequently  reported.  No  unexpected  safety  issues,  including laboratory findings, were identified in the safety population in the different studies. The observed safety profile was largely similar for both treatment groups, although a slightly higher frequency of drug-related AEs  were  observed  for  VANTOBRA  compared  to  TOBI,  but  because  of  the  small  size  of  the  safety population, this cannot be fully concluded upon. Special attention was aimed at the audiometry assessment, but no evidence was found indicating that patients  treated  with  VANTOBRA  were  at  higher  risk  for  alterations  due  to  higher  local  drug concentrations that derive from higher strength of the tobramycin concentration in VANTOBRA or the enhanced drug delivery rate using the Tolero device. No safety signals could be observed which where indicative for effects resulting from faster drug delivery. Inhaled tobramycin is widely used in CF patients and has a well-known safety profile and quality and PK assessment did not indicate any relevant findings that might affect safety. However, the small safety population  due  to  small  sample  sizes  of  the  various  studies  and  differences  in  the  doses  of  the investigational  product  patients  were  exposed  to  complicate  interpretation  and  determination  of  the relevance of the observed AEs. The CHMP agreed that since VANTOBRA was a hybrid of TOBI and since the safety profile of nebulised tobramycin for inhalation was well-known, the first PSUR for Vantobra should be submitted within 12 months after the marketing authorisation. 2.6.2.

Bronchospasm should be treated as medically appropriate. The first dose of VANTOBRA should be used under supervision, after taking a bronchodilator if this is part of the current regimen for the patient. FEV1 should be measured before and after nebulization. If there is evidence of therapy-induced bronchospasm, the physician should carefully evaluate whether the benefits of continued use of VANTOBRA outweighs the risks to the patient. If an allergic response is suspected, VANTOBRA should be discontinued. - SmPC section 4.8 - Undesirable effects: Table 'Adverse reactions': Frequency of 'rare' ( ≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000) for bronchospasm longer authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | None proposed                           |

| Important potential risk: Nephrotoxicity Medicinal | - SmPC section 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use: Nephrotoxicity: Nephrotoxicity has been associated with parenteral aminoglycoside therapy. There was no evidence of nephrotoxicity during clinical trials with inhaled tobramycin and VANTOBRA. Caution should be exercised when prescribing VANTOBRA to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. According to current clinical practice baseline renal function should be assessed.

If oto- or nephrotoxicity occurs in a patient receiving VANTOBRA, tobramycin therapy should be discontinued until serum concentration falls below 2 µg/ml. Serum concentrations greater than 12 µg/ml are associated with tobramycin toxicity and treatment should be discontinued if concentrations exceed this level. The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored using validated methods. Finger prick blood sampling is not recommended due to the risk of contamination of the sample. - SmPC section 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use: Other precautions: Patients receiving concomitant parenteral aminoglycoside therapy (or any medicine affecting renal excretion, such as diuretics) should be monitored as clinically appropriate taking into account the risk of cumulative toxicity.

Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of VANTOBRA, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken. Assessment of tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdose. In the case of any overdose, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in the elimination of VANTOBRA or other medicinal products should be considered. -SmPC section 5.3 - Preclinical safety data: Non-clinical data reveal that the main hazard for humans, based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development, consists of renal toxicity and ototoxicity. In repeated dose toxicity studies, target organs of toxicity are the kidneys and vestibular/cochlear functions. In general, toxicity is seen at higher systemic tobramycin levels than are achievable by inhalation of the recommended clinical dose. No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with tobramycin administered by inhalation, but subcutaneous administration at doses of 100 mg/kg/day in rats and the maximum tolerated dose of 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, during organogenesis, was not teratogenic. Teratogenicity could not be assessed at higher parenteral doses in rabbits as they induced maternal toxicity and abortion.

There are no adequate data from the use of tobramycin administered by inhalation in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate a teratogenic effect of tobramycin (see section 5.3). However, aminoglycosides can cause foetal harm (e.g., congenital deafness and nephrotoxicity) when high systemic concentrations are achieved in a pregnant woman. Systemic exposure following inhalation of VANTOBRA is very low, however VANTOBRA should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. when the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the foetus or baby. If VANTOBRA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking VANTOBRA, she should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. VANTOBRA should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the foetus or baby. - SmPC section 5.3 - Preclinical safety data: Non-clinical data reveal that the main hazard for humans, based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development, consists of renal toxicity and ototoxicity.

| Important potential risk: Pathogen resistance: Decreased PA susceptibility to tobramycin Medicinal | female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. - SmPC section 4.4- Special warnings and precautions for use: Development of resistance: The development of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa and superinfection with other pathogens represent potential risks associated with antibiotic therapy. Development of resistance during inhaled tobramycin therapy could limit treatment options during acute exacerbations; this should be monitored. - SmPC section 5.1 - Pharmacodynamic properties: Mechanism of action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius. It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope and eventual cell death. It is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. Breakpoints: Established susceptibility break-points for parenteral administration of tobramycin are inappropriate in the aerosolised administration of the medicinal product. Sputum of cystic fibrosis patients exhibits an inhibitory action on the local biological activity of nebulised amino-glycosides. This necessitates sputum concentrations following treatment with aerosolised tobramycin to be ten to twentyfive-fold above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for both P. aeruginosa growth suppression and control of bactericidal activity. In controlled clinical trials, 97% of patients receiving tobramycin nebuliser solution achieved sputum concentrations 10-fold of the highest P. aeruginosa MIC cultured from the patient and 95% of patients receiving tobramycin nebuliser solution achieved 25-fold of the highest MIC.

Physicians should consider the potential for aminoglycosides to cause vestibular and cochlear toxicity and carry out appropriate assessments of auditory function during VANTOBRA therapy. In patients with a predisposing risk due to previous prolonged, systemic aminoglycoside therapy it may be necessary to consider audiological assessment before initiating VANTOBRA therapy. If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during aminoglycoside therapy the physician should consider referring them for audiological assessment. - SmPC section 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use: Other precautions: Patients receiving concomitant parenteral aminoglycoside therapy (or any medicine affecting renal excretion, such as diuretics) should be monitored as clinically appropriate taking into account the risk of cumulative toxicity. This includes monitoring of serum concentrations of tobramycin. - SmPC section 4.5 - Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the interaction profile for tobramycin following intravenous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of VANTOBRA is not recommended with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential, such as: amphotericin B, cefalotin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, polymyxins (risk of increased nephrotoxicity); platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity). Concurrent use of VANTOBRA with diuretic compounds (such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea or mannitol) is not recommended. Such compounds can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue (see section 4.4). Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterally administered aminoglycosides include: anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects). In clinical studies patients using inhaled tobramycin continued to take dornase alfa, bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and macrolides.

However, aminoglycosides can cause foetal harm (e.g., congenital deafness and nephrotoxicity) when high systemic concentrations are achieved in a pregnant woman. Systemic exposure following inhalation of VANTOBRA is very low, however VANTOBRA should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. when the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the foetus or baby. If VANTOBRA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking VANTOBRA, she should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus.

Physicians should consider the potential for aminoglycosides to cause vestibular and cochlear toxicity and carry out appropriate assessments of auditory function during VANTOBRA therapy. In patients with a predisposing risk due to previous prolonged, systemic aminoglycoside therapy it may be necessary to consider audiological assessment before initiating VANTOBRA therapy. If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during aminoglycoside therapy the physician should consider referring them for audiological assessment. - SmPC section 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use: Other precautions: […]In patients with a predisposing risk due to previous prolonged, systemic aminoglycoside therapy it may be necessary to consider renal and audiological assessment before initiating VANTOBRA therapy. authorised | None proposed |

In vitro, VANTOBRA has shown to have a narrower size distribution of droplets compared to the broader distribution  for  TOBI/PARI  LC  PLUS  and  a  slightly  lower  mean  mass-related  medial  aerodynamic diameter, MMAD (3.8 and 4.5 μm, respectively) in drug mass distribution measurements with impactor stages.

User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Beneficial effects With its well-established anti-pseudomonal activity, inhaled tobramycin is a well-known, widely used antibiotic for the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa in patients suffering from CF. The changes in the strength of the formulation proposed for VANTOBRA and the new nebuliser used (Tolero/eFlow) have resulted in a substantial decrease in inhalation time compared to the use of TOBI (approximately 4-5 minutes vs. 14 - 18 min, respectively) through reduction of the volume of tobramycin solution that needs to be nebulised and by more rapid and efficient nebulisation using a new technology with a perforated vibrating membrane.   This is considered to have an important impact on patient care. Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

The different particles size distribution is reflected in the conducted pharmacokinetic studies. In healthy subjects a slightly higher systemic exposure was observed with VANTOBRA compared to TOBI which is an indication of a higher lung deposition of tobramycin with VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI. A higher lung

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deposition is considered relevant from an efficacy point of view and the efficacy profile of VANTOBRA is deemed to be comparable to that of TOBI.

Although in the pivotal BE study conducted in CF patients the evaluation of efficacy was a secondary objective,  the  observed  treatment  effects  were  overall  beneficial,  without  clear  differences  between VANTOBRA and TOBI. For both products, a significant improvement of lung function relative to baseline was observed for the first treatment phase. This effect was consistent over the various parameters (FEV1 %, FVC, FEV25-75, PEF), as well as with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. Generally, VANTOBRA was shown to be beneficial, in particular during the second treatment period.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects The use of systemic pharmacokinetic data as a surrogate for efficacy for an orally inhaled product in patients with cystic fibrosis presents some limitations, considering the local efficacy and the disease associated effect on the airways. However, the CHMP considered in this case of two similar formulations of  the  same  active  substance  that  this  option  was  more  sensitive  to  compare  the  two  tobramycin nebulised solutions. Altogether the results from the two pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients and in healthy volunteers provided useful information about the in vivo performance of VANTOBRA. In CF patients the systemic exposure was slightly lower for VANTOBRA compared to TOBI. Based on these data only, it was not possible to determine whether the lower systemic exposure was attributable to product- and/or device-related differences or to patient-related differences. The study was performed in CF patients, with inherent difficulties to inhale and limited normal lung distribution that may change over time, potentially affecting study outcome. A lower systemic exposure might reflect that less tobramycin have reached the lungs and therefore not been available for absorption. Another possibility is that more tobramycin actually remains at the target site of action, i.e. in sputum in the lungs. The higher systemic exposure obtained with VANTOBRA compared to TOBI in healthy volunteers did however indicate that the amount of tobramycin deposited in the lung was in fact slightly higher with VANTOBRA in comparison to TOBI, which is expected to be beneficial from an efficacy point of view. Sputum concentrations were higher for VANTOBRA compared to TOBI, which could be an advantage. However, no definitive conclusions on the clinical relevance of the higher tobramycin concentration found in sputum after administration of VANTOBRA can be drawn. In vitro data on aerosol characteristics of VANTOBRA nebulised with the Tolero nebuliser, compared with that of TOBI nebulised with PARI LC PLUS and TOBI Podhaler (DPI) in different impactor stages, possibly indicate a higher respirable dose and a lower throat deposition for VANTOBRA compared to TOBI and the DPI. From the deposition data using labelled 99mTc it could not be definitively concluded that tobramycin from VANTOBRA was similarly distributed to the central, intermediate and peripheral lung regions compared to TOBI due to lack of data.

The systemic exposure of tobramycin in CF patients was lower or in the same range after administration of VANTOBRA/eFlow compared TOBI/PARI LC PLUS. Thus, systemic safety is not expected to be worse than for TOBI in the intended patient population. In healthy volunteers the systemic exposure was on the other hand slightly higher after administration of VANTOBRA compared to TOBI. The systemic exposure was however still very low in comparison to IV administered tobramycin.

Available data generated from the submitted studies indicate a similar safety profile as for the reference product  in  the  general  CF  population.  AE  reported  are  mainly  associated  with  drug  administration, primarily respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

Special  attention  was  aimed  at  audiometry  assessment,  but  no  evidence  was  found  indicating  that patients  treated  with  VANTOBRA  were  at  higher  risk  for  alterations  due  to  higher  local  drug concentrations that derive from higher strength of the tobramycin concentration in VANTOBRA or the enhanced drug delivery rate using the eFlow device. No safety signals could be observed which were indicative for effects resulting from faster drug delivery.

The applied VANTOBRA indication is: management of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF). Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects The Applicant has provided a discussion and references concerning the differences between TOBI and VANTOBRA (higher tobramycin concentration, shorter administration time and different device). The important  factors  that  may  have  impact  on  tolerability  of  nebuliser  solutions  include  the  use  of  a preservative, pH, osmolality, and chloride content. None of these factors differ between VANTOBRA and other tobramycin nebuliser solutions. The tobramycin concentration is higher for VANTOBRA. However, there are references supporting that the concentration is not likely to have impact on tolerability. The delivery rate of VANTOBRA is rather similar to other products but the administration time is shorter. A study  of  TOBI  administered  by  different  devices  (short  and  longer  delivery  time)  did  not  show  any differences with respect to bronchospasm. Long-term use of inhaled antibiotics in the management of chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections in CF patients is associated with selection of resistant P. aeruginosa strains. The submitted deposition data did not fully elucidate how VANTOBRA was distributed in the lungs. An uneven distribution may carry the risk that not everywhere in the lungs sufficient anti-Pseudomonal activity can be acquired, potentially inducing resistance. Benefit-risk balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Tobramycin  nebulisation  is  presently  the  current  'gold  standard'  in  the  management  of  chronic bronchopulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa in CF patients. The long inhalation time associated with nebulisation is a burden for patients, in particular since they require long-term treatment. Therefore, a shortened inhalation time for the tobramycin nebulisation (as is the case for VANTOBRA), making it comparable to the time needed for dry powder inhalation is beneficial to patients. It may improve the user convenience and its therapy adherence and thus clinical efficacy. Inhaled tobramycin is a widely used medicinal product with a well characterised safety profile and the quality and PK data generated did not indicate any relevant findings that might affect safety. Benefit-risk balance and discussion Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised

The reference product for this application is TOBI, with the following approved indication:

'Suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The submitted clinical package composed of PK, efficacy and safety data generated by the performed studies comparing VANTOBRA with the reference product TOBI as well as literature references, is considered to constitute a relevant bridge between VANTOBRA and the reference product TOBI, for which preclinical and clinical trial data are available.

Efficacy and safety data for TOBI can therefore be extrapolated to VANTOBRA. In line with prescription status for other centrally approved inhaled antibiotics for CF patients, the CHMP considers that the prescription status for VANTOBRA should be 'subject to medical prescription'. TOBI Podhaler is also an approved, inhaled tobramycin product. This is a dry powder inhaler and is approved with a wording of the indication identical to TOBI. TOBI Podhaler is an orphan medicinal product and received a positive opinion from CHMP (European Commission Decision: 20 July 2011) and significant benefit was established versus TOBI based on shorter inhalation time. At the time of approval, CHMP acknowledged that approximately 10% of patients treated with TOBI Podhaler develop intolerance to the product. This is reflected in the SmPC for TOBI Podhaler, albeit not in the wording of the indication, as these patients cannot a priori be identified. CHMP concluded in its similarity assessment that VANTOBRA and TOBI Podhaler are similar. The overall benefit-risk of VANTOBRA 170 mg nebuliser solution in the proposed indication is considered positive. 4. Recommendations Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that VANTOBRA is not similar to Cayston but is similar to TOBI Podhaler within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. (See appendix1) Derogation from market exclusivity The CHMP considered by consensus that pursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the following derogation laid down in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 apply: · the applicant could establish in the application that VANTOBRA, although similar to TOBI Podhaler, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior (as defined in Article 3(3)(d) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) for the same therapeutic indication (see appendix 2). Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of VANTOBRA for the indication 'management of chronic pulmonary infection due  to Pseudomonas  aeruginosa in  patients  aged  6  years  and  older  with  cystic  fibrosis  (CF). Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents' is favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the following conditions: Medicinal product no longer authori Medicinal product no longer authorised
