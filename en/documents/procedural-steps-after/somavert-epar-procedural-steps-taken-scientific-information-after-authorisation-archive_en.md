| II/0084 | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC to recommend an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests (LTs) [serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] prior to initiation of treatment with Somavert as well as monitoring of LTs during treatment, following analysis of the interim result of study 'A6291010 (ACROSTUDY) - A multicenter, post marketing surveillance study of pegvisomant therapy in patients with acromegaly - extension' as requested in procedure EMEA/H/C/000409/MEA 061.1. The PL has been updated accordingly. C.I.3.z - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Other variation | 13/09/2018 | 16/09/2019 | SmPC and PL            | Prior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests (LTs) [serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)]. Evidence of obstructive biliary tract disease should be ruled out in patients with elevations of ALT and AST or in patients with a prior history of treatment with any somatostatin analogue. Administration of pegvisomant should be discontinued if signs of liver disease persist.

| II/0051 | This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC, upon request by the CHMP following the assessment of PSUR 10, in order to update the safety information regarding the ADR 'systemic hypersensitivity reactions'. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to amend the listed terms in sections 4.8 and 4.9 to MedDRA terms, to reorder the events into MedDRA system organ class sequence, to change the frequencies of two listed ADRs and to implement changes to sections 4.8 and 4.9 in line with the SmPC guideline (Sept 2009). The Package Leaflet has been updated in accordance. Finally, the contact details of the local representative in Spain have been updated in the Package Leaflet and a statement has been added that the vial adapter (Mixject) is not marketed in all EU member states. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 17/11/2011 | 19/12/2011 | SmPC and PL | Systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, laryngospasm, angioedema, generalized skin reactions (rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria) have been reported in post marketing use. Some patients required hospitalization. Upon re- administration, symptoms did not re-occur in all patients. In support of this variation application, the MAH provided a cumulative review of all 'possible hypersensitivity-related events' reported in its database. Through 31 May 2010, a total of 79 cases were identified (8.3% of the total number of pegvisomant reported cases) that encoded to at least one PT included in the search criteria. Out of these 79 cases, 42 cases reported events that did not appear to be related to a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to pegvisomant therapy. Among the 37 remaining cases (1 duplicate), 13 were assessed as serious without any fatal outcome. The nature of the reported serious AEs, mostly with short latency, the mostly favourable outcome after pegvisomant discontinuation and the absence of other more compatible aetiologies - even if six of the 36 cases reported a potentially relevant medical history associated with a high risk of a systemic hypersensitivity-related event - are all in favour of the responsibility of pegvisomant therapy in these hypersensitivity-related events. Some physio-pathological explanations have been proposed by the MAH, but no formal conclusion can be drawn regarding the aetiological |

Taking into account the time course of the reporting rate of systemic hypersensitivity-related events compared to the time of discontinuation of latex-containing stoppers, this does not seem to imply that these are latex related allergic reactions. The MAH had previously raised the hypothesis that improper storage of the vials or of the reconstituted solution may lead to chemical degradation and/or soluble aggregates formation and thus to potential occurrence of systemic hypersensitivity reactions. However, as stated by the MAH, the Somavert formulation has been shown to protect the active molecule against stresses, e.g. shaking/agitation, exposure to high temperatures, exposure to freezing temperatures, and undue exposure to light, both in the lyophilized state and also in the liquid state. The available stability data over multiple lots manufactured over many years supports the conclusion that the product quality, as measured by chemical degradation as well as aggregate levels, is maintained over the shelf-life of the product. The risk to the lyophilized product quality through the formation of chemical and physical (i.e. aggregation) degradation products is minimal. Furthermore, appropriate instructions for storage and reconstitution that cover the risk of mishandling are already provided in the SmPC and in the Package Leaflet. No data on antibodies (to GH or to pegvisomant) titers in patients having experienced systemic hypersensitivity   |

| II/0021   | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) with respect to injection site reaction adverse events. The MAH took the opportunity to introduce one combined PL for all presentations and to update the contact number of the Irish local representative in the section 6 of the PL. Some minor changes were also introduced in the set of Annexes. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet   | 15/11/2007   | 21/12/2007   | SmPC, Labelling and PL           | In the assessment report of the Periodic Safety Update Report Number 6, the CHMP requested the MAH to submit a cumulative review of injection site reactions for Somavert. Based on this review, the MAH was requested to consider appropriate changes under the section 4.8 of the SPC, in particular with respect to \"hypersensitivity, lipodystrophy/lipohypertrophy\".The MAH therefore submitted a proposed wording for the section 4.2, 4.8 of the SPC and relevant sections of the PL with respect to injection site reaction adverse events. The following information was therefore included in the SPC: \" Section 4.2 \"Posology and Mehod of Administration\": The site of injection should be rotated daily to help prevent lipohypertrophy. \" Section 4.8 \"Undesirable Effects\": \" General disorders and administration site conditions\": Common: influenza-like illness, fatigue, injection site bruising or bleeding, injection site reaction (including injection site hypersensitivity), injection site hypertrophy (e.g. lipohypertrophy)*. The MAH took the opportunity to introduce one combined PL for all presentations and to update the contact number of the Irish local representative in the section 6 of the PL. Some minor changes were also introduced in the set of Annexes.   |
