## 1. Background information on the annual renewal

The European Commission issued on 17 February 2015, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Holoclar This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA.

Holoclar, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/08/579 on 07 November 2008.

The first approval of Holoclar was granted on 17 February 2015 through Centralised Procedure. The product is therefore approved in the 27 European Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The product has been granted with a conditional MA in accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Holoclar is approved with a unique dose which is 79,000 - 316,000 cells/cm² living tissue equivalent for treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) (defined  by  the  presence  of  superficial  corneal  neovascularization  [CNV]  in  at  least  two  corneal quadrants, with central corneal involvement, and severely impaired visual acuity), unilateral or bilateral, due to physical or chemical ocular burns. A minimum of 1 - 2 mm 2  of undamaged limbus is required for biopsy.

In June 2020 the European Conditional Marketing authorization was transferred from the former MAH, Chiesi Farmaceutici, to the new one Holostem Terapie Avanzate s.r.l. with the European Decision C(2020) 4054 adopted on 12 June 2020. Holoclar is approved for treatment of adult patients with moderated to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), defined by the presence of superficial corneal neovascularization  [CNV]  in  at  least  two  corneal  quadrants,  with  central  corneal  involvement,  and severely  impaired  visual  acuity),  unilateral  or  bilateral,  due  to  physical  or  chemical  ocular  burns.  A minimum of 1 - 2 mm 2  of undamaged limbus is required for biopsy.

A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Holostem Terapie Avanzate s.r.l., submitted to the Agency on 26 July 2023 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for Holoclar. The expiry date of the MA is 19 February 2024.

The period covered by this annual renewal is 03 May 2022 to 02 May 2023 (data lock point: 12 July 2022).

The MAH informs that the Specific Obligation (SOB) has been fulfilled with submission of the final Clinical Study Report within this procedure. Changes to the Product information has been submitted concerning to SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1-3, 6.6, Annex II E, and PIL, accordingly.

In response to the RfSI, the MAH provided a new revised version of the SmPC. The changes made consider the results presented in the final CSR of the HOLOCORE-FU (PAM) - also submitted in the context of the present procedure - and are considered acceptable.

The initial data set provided for the annual renewal lead to the formulation of questions to the MAH regarding the long-term benefit of Holoclar for treatment of adult LSCD due to ocular burn. However, after the evaluation of the Applicant's responses, the CAT/CHMP supports the Applicant's proposal to remove the SOB, and to convert the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization.

As part of this annual renewal the CAT/CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex II:

## 2.2. Benefit-risk Balance

During the period covered by this annual renewal, some new data have emerged.

The data are considered adequate to support the positive risk-benefit profile of Holoclar for treatment of adult with moderate to severe limbal stem cell deficiency due to ocular burn.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, the benefit-risk balance for Holoclar in its approved indication (see below) continues to be favourable. The specific obligations have been fulfilled; therefore, the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to specific obligations is recommended.

'Treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (defined by the presence of  superficial  corneal  neovascularisation  in  at  least  two  corneal  quadrants,  with  central  corneal involvement, and severely impaired visual acuity), unilateral or bilateral, due to physical or chemical ocular burns. A minimum of 1 - 2 mm 2  of undamaged limbus is required for biopsy.'

## PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Based on the assessment of the data, the CAT/CHMP is of the opinion that the PSUR cycle should continue to follow a 6 monthly cycle.

## 4. EPAR changes

The table in the 'Steps after' module of the EPAR will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Renewal of conditional marketing authorisation

## Summary

The CAT/CHMP, having reviewed the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product continue to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP considered that, as all Specific Obligations have been fulfilled, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing authorizations to remain conditional and therefore recommends the granting of the MA no longer subject to Specific Obligations for Holoclar.

## SmPC new text

## In 4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## […]

## Autologous use

Holoclar is intended solely for autologous use and must not, under any circumstances, be administered to other patients. Holoclar must not be administered if the information on the product labels and lot number do not match the patient's identity.

[…]

## Transmission of an infectious agent

Holoclar could contain potentially infected biological material. Although Holoclar is tested for sterility and mycoplasma, a risk of transmission of infectious agents exists. Healthcare professionals administering Holoclar must, therefore, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections after treatment and treat appropriately, if needed. Although the risk is considered to be very low and routinely controlled in the manufacturing.

[…]

## Precautions for use

A thorough evaluation of the patient should be done taking into consideration not only the clinical need of the candidate, but also the biological and pathophysiologic alterations in the wound bed environment, to define the timing of any procedure and allow the proper engraftment and growth of the stem cells of the living tissue that constitute Holoclar. Concomitant surgeries should be excluded and anticipated or deferred to Holoclar implantation.

Concomitant  eyelids  malposition,  conjunctival  scarring  with  fornix  shortening,  corneal  anaesthesia and/or conjunctival anaesthesia or severe hypoaesthesia, pterygium and severe dry eye are potential complicating factors. When possible, Concomitant eye problems should be corrected prior to Holoclar implantation.

At any of the steps of the treatment with Holoclar, topical lidocaine or anaesthetics containing adrenaline must be avoided.

## In 4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction:

The concomitant use of topical lidocaine or anaesthetics containing adrenaline must be avoided as they reduce the colony forming efficiency.

For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Rapporteur comment

As the PRAC Rapporteur recommends the PSUR requirement should be kept as it is, which are currently every 6 months.

Since the granting of the conditional MA, the MAH has submitted the following SOBs:

## 5.2. Outstanding Specific Obligations - status report for period covered

## SOB 001: Description

The interventional  study  HOLOCORE (ID: CCD\\_GLPSCD01-03) and its follow-up HOLOCORE-FU (ID: CCD-GLPSCD01-03-FU) are subjects to SOBs and both were ongoing during the reference period, while enrolment in the HOLOCORE study has been completed by 26 th  November 2018. On 6th of April 2021 an  audit  was  performed  in  The  Netherland  at  site  52801  by  the  Local  Competent  Authority  for HOLOCORE, HOLOCORE FU and HOLOSIGHT (ID: CCD-GLPLSCD01-05), which is a non-interventional post-authorisation registry study (PASS) and not subject to SOBs. The reason of the inspection was the procurement licences extension. The inspector mainly focused on the biopsy and implants. During the audits, no critical issues and no major deviations were detected. The company confirms that according to the status of the trial, the final CSR to be available by March 2023.

## Discussion

Rapporteur assessment/comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the final CSR for the HOLOCORE study provided there are currently uncertainties, which need to be resolved.

## 5.3. Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding SOB1 have emerged. The new data  emerged  are  compliant  in  terms  of  adherence  to  deadlines  and  are  not  compliant  in  terms  of acceptability of data submitted.

## 6. Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment of the benefit/risk balance

## 6.1. Quality

No specific obligations regarding quality have been raised for the conditional MA. Since granting of the MA, several changes had been introduced with regard to quality (see below). Furthermore, in May 2020, the MAH changed from Chiesi FARMACEUTICI S.p.A. to Holostem Terapie Avanzate S.r.l. /eCTD 0052). The manufacturer and the quality provisions remained not affected. In this cover letter, the MAH informs that Holostem Terapie Avanzate s.r.l. has started at the end of 2022 a liquidation process that involves the assignment to a third wholly owned legal entity of its business. As consequence, in parallel to the renewal procedure a request of Marketing Authorization Transfer for Holoclar MA (EU/1/14/987/001) from Holostem Terapie Avanzate s.r.l. to a new company set up for this purpose is going to be filed. Further information has not yet implemented in this renewal procedure.

The MAH included a comprehensive tracking table listing all changes in Modul 1, Annex 1. For the annual review, no new changes in Modul 3 have been declared. Variations regarding quality:

## For the renewal period 2022-2023, eCTD sequence 0091, the following variations have been processed:

- Sequence 0090 (Type IAIN): On 12 th  June 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the update of the PMF for fibrinogen and thrombin from the approved vendor. The updated EMA PMF was provided in Annex 5.21. The change raised no concern and was approved.
- Sequence 0088 (Type IAIN): On 12th April 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the update of the PMF for fibrinogen and thrombin from the approved vendor. The updated EMA PMF was provided in Annex 5.21. The change raised no concern and was approved.
- Sequence 0087 (Type IAIN): On 12th April 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the deletion of the ADP-ribosylation activity test procedure for the reagent Cholera Toxin by the vendor. Cholera toxin is used in the formulation of the culture media used in the manufacturing process of the active substance. To evaluate the activity of Cholera Toxin, two different tests were implemented: The 'ADP ribosylating activity' and the 'Haemoagglutination activity' tests. The existence of two activity assays was considered redundant, therefore it was proposed to keep only the 'Haemoagglutination activity test' as  specification  parameter  'activity'  for  the  raw  material.  The  new  CoA  was  provided  in  Section 3.2.S.2.3. The change was approved.
- Sequence 0086 (Type IB, B.I.b.z): On 14th March 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the reduction of information for incoming goods testing performed by the active substance manufacturer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on receipt of batches of raw materials. The change affects information about the raw materials fibrinogen and thrombin from the approved supplier which are used to produce fibrin, the excipient constituting the matrix - based excipient of Holoclar. The change was approved.

- Sequence 0085 (Type IAIN): On 03th March 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the update of the PMF for fibrinogen and thrombin from the approved vendor. The updated EMA PMF was provided in Annex 5.21. The change was approved.
- Sequence  0084  (Type  IA):  On  13th  Feb  2023,  the  MAH  filed  a  variation  concerning  the replacement of secondary packaging manufacturer of the excipients Fibrinogen Powder and Thrombin Powder. The change was approved.
- Sequence 0083 (Type IA): On 24th Jan 2023, the MAH filed a variation concerning the update of EDQM TSE Certificate of Suitability  for the  reagent Foetal Bovine Serum from an already approved manufacturer. The Certificate was provided in section 3.2.R. Appendix 4. The change raised no concern and was approved.

## Notification of administration of out of specification (OOS) products:

- For the renewal period 2022-2023, no OOS have been reported.

## 6.2. Non-clinical

N/A

## 6.3. Clinical pharmacology

N/A

## 6.4. Clinical efficacy

During the reference period, the clinical trial 'HOLOCORE' was completed. The submitted final CSR is subject to this renewal and subject to the MAH'S request for fulfilment of the outstanding SOB. The follow-up clinical trial for the product (study 'HOLOCORE-FU') was finalized in the reporting period (LPLV 31  March  2023,  CSR  planned  by  end  of  October  2023)  and  a  non-  interventional  study  (registry 'HOLOSIGHT' of commercially transplanted patients) was ongoing. At the DLP of this renewal, which is 02 May 2023, the current status of HOLOCORE and HOLOCORE-FU was as follows:

## HOLOCORE Interventional Study (CCD-GPLSCD01-03)

There is no change in the status of this trial since 2019. According to the MAH this trial was run over the whole critical time of the COVID pandemic. Therefore, the missing data are not negligible. Final results will  be  available  in  the  HOLOCORE  FOLLOW  UP  study  and  the  registry-like  HOLOSIGHT.  For  further details, please see the assessment below.

## HOLOCORE-Follow-UP (CCD-GPLSCD01-03-FU)

A total of 47 subjects were enrolled (out of 68 who completed HOLOCORE study; 69%) and a total of 44 (65%) completed the study (one year follow-up), including two paediatrics. Three patients were early

terminated, 1 for SAE (mediastinum neoplasm resulted in death), 1 lost to follow- up and 1 for other reason. The LPLV for this study was carried out on 31 March 2023. No safety issues were reported in the clinical trial. The first patient was included on 13 December 2017. The LPLV was 31 March 2023 and the study was closed, with the statistical analysis currently ongoing, and CSR final planned by end October 2023. The database lock occurred on 28 June 2023 and key results provided on 03 July 2023. According to the MAH, no safety issues were reported in the clinical trial.

This study is part of the Additional Pharmacovigilance activities put in place for the product.

## Total exposure in clinical trials

In total, 223 patients received the transplantation with Holoclar in HLSTM01, HLSTM02, HLSTM04 and HOLOCORE clinical trials. This is the largest cohort of patients with LSCD so far. Cumulatively, 14 patients received the second implantation with Holoclar.

## Holocore Study (CCD-GPLSCD01-03)

During the reference period this study has been completed. At the time of this report there are no patient ongoing enrolment as there is a temporary shortage of the product. The last 3 adult patients completed the study on March 2022 once they reached 6 month follow up after the 2 ACLSCT. The recruitment in HOLOCORE study was completed on 26 November 2018 for a total of 95 (including 4 paediatric patients) patients screened and 80 confirmed by the Independent Assessors evaluation based on 2D pictures (15 were assessed as screening failures after initial recruitment by Investigators).

## Study design

Multinational, multicentre, prospective, open label, phase IV clinical trial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Main study objective

## Primary objective

To demonstrate the efficacy of Holoclar at one year after the first treatment in patients suffering from moderate  (at  least  two  corneal  quadrants,  central  corneal  involvement  resulting  in  severe  visual impairment) to severe LSCD secondary to ocular burns, in terms of percentage of patients with a success of transplantation at approximately 12 months from the first Holoclar treatment.

## Key Secondary Objectives

- To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  one  or  two  treatments  with  Holoclar  at  one  year  after  the  last treatment.

## Other important Secondary Objectives

- To evaluate the degree of corneal re-epithelialization during follow up.
- To evaluate the degree of severity of superficial corneal neo-vascularization during follow up.
- To evaluate the improvement in the presence and severity of clinical symptoms (pain, burning and photophobia) after last treatment with Holoclar during follow up.
- To  evaluate  the  improvement  in  best  corrected  visual  acuity  (VA)  after  last  treatment  with Holoclar during follow up.
- To evaluate the improvement in patient's quality of life after last treatment with Holoclar during follow up.
- To evaluate the success of ACLSCT by number of Holoclar applications (either one or two).
- To evaluate the clinical safety profile of ACLSCT, including limbal biopsy, Holoclar transplantation procedure and post-transplantation treatment.

## Investigational drug, dose and mode of administration

Holoclar consisted of a transparent circular sheet of 300,000 to 1,200,000 viable autologous human corneal epithelial cells (79,000 - 316,000 cells/cm 2 ), including on average 3.5% (0.4 to 16%) limbal stem cells, and stem cell-derived transient amplifying and terminally differentiated cells, attached on a supportive 2.2 cm diameter fibrin layer and maintained in the transport medium. After biopsy, ACLSCT included a single administration of Holoclar through a dedicated surgical procedure of corneal surface scraping and product application under local (para- or -retrobulbar) or general anaesthesia. The dose of Holoclar  was  79,000  -  316,000  cells/cm²,  corresponding  to  1  cm²  of  product/cm²  of  defect.  Each preparation of Holoclar was intended as a single treatment. The treatment was repeated according to the physician's prescription, whereby each treatment consisted of a single application of Holoclar during ACLSCT. In case of failure during first transplant, a second transplantation with Holoclar was offered within 2- 6 months from declaration of failure after first Holoclar implantation, if eligibility was confirmed by the local Investigator (after re-check of inclusion and exclusion criteria) and if patients re- consented.

## Post Marketing Experience

At  this  ACO  DLP,  the  product  is  currently  temporarily  under  partial  shortage,  as  Holostem  has  not collected biopsies since December 8, 2022 in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Czech Republic and United Kingdom (UK).

According the MAH, the Holoclar production and distribution has been continued for all the biopsies already in house. These biopsies have been used as starting material to produce and distribute Holoclar in Europe and UK up to the 8 June 2023, date of the last implantation in UK. This shortage will be ceased

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from 30 September, 2023, when the compulsory maintenance of the manufacturing site (due two times per year), shifted to July - August 2023, will be completed and the activities can be resumed again.

After approval of Holoclar, excluding the subjects in the HOLOCORE clinical trial (see below), additional n=105 patients started the treatment, with 110 biopsies for tissue procurement (5 patients underwent to 2 biopsies) conducted with the marketed product so far. Cumulatively, n=98 patients (88 included in HOLOSIGHT study) have been implanted with Holoclar according to clinical practice. Four (4) patients were  treated  with  out  of  specification  product  (last  chance),  according  to  the  section  11.5  of  the 'Guideline on Good Manufacturing practice specific to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products' and two (2)  patients  received  the  sub-potent  batches  under  exceptional  circumstances  on  surgeon's  request according to ATMP GMP guidelines.

Overall, considering patients included in the clinical trials (HLSTM01, HLSTM02, HLSTM04 and HOLOCORE; n=223) and patients treated in the commercial setting according to clinical practice (98), a total of 321 patients have been exposed to the medicinal product for a total of 336 transplantations of autologous cultivated limbal stem cells (Holoclar) so far.

## Rapporteur assessment/comments/conclusion - clinical efficacy:

## HOLOCORE Study

Due to the statistical analysis plan the study populations for efficacy parameters were defined as follows (see Table 7 Final CSR):

1. Modified Intention-to-Treat population A (mITTa): all adult patients (n=76) who underwent the ACLSCT procedure: n=69.
2. Modified Intention-to-Treat population B (mITTb): all adult patients (n=76) who underwent the ACLSCT procedure excluding patients treated with out of specification grafts (sub- potent batches): n=65.
3. Per-protocol population (PP): all patients from the mITTa population (n=76) without any major protocol deviations (i.e., wrong inclusions and non-permitted medications): n=64

The 4 pediatric subjects are not included in the efficacy analysis set which is supported.

## Primary efficacy

A successful transplantation was calculated as the proportion of patients with less than 2 superficial neovascularization corneal quadrants with no central corneal involvement by CNV and absence of epithelial defects (none or trace) at Day 360 ±14 days after first Holoclar treatment in the mITTa population. According to Table 14 final CSR, evaluable results for a successful transplantation in accordance with the Independent  Assessor  Judgement  was  documented  for  n=25/n=69  subjects,  which  results  in  a percentage  rate  of  36,2  %  (95%  CI).  In  terms  of  the  mITTb  and  PP  populations,  successful transplantation  was  reported  as  33.8%  (95%  CI:  23%-47%)  and  39.1%  (95%  CI:  27%-52%), respectively. Figures for success of transplant at month 12 after last Holoclar treatment at the end of roll-in phase in the mITTa and mITTb population slightly differ (see tables 19 and 20 of the final CSR). After one Holoclar treatment in the PP population, transplantation was judged to be successful in 43.1% (30%-57%).  No  patient  in  the  PP  population  had  a  successful  transplantation  after  two  Holoclar treatments. Important to note is that the success rate was higher in patients with zero prior surgical treatment in the medical history (about 60% of the subjects had prior surgical procedures).

## Key secondary and other secondary efficacy

Superficial  neo-vascularisation  after  treatment  with  Holoclar:  25  (39.1%)  patients  who  had  severe superficial corneal neo-vascularisation at baseline showed either moderate (n = 12, 18.8%), mild (n = 8, 12.5%), or no (n = 5, 7.8%) neo-vascularization at 12 months. No change in the status of neorevascularization  was  still  reported  in  24  (37.5%)  patients  with  either  severe  (n  =  14,  21.9%)  or moderate (n = 10, 15.6%) neo-vascularization at baseline.

Central corneal class evaluation: There was a change from severe at baseline to moderate at month 12 after treatment with Holoclar in 24.4% in the mITT population and in 25% of the mITTb population. However, in 21.9% of the mITT population and in 21.7% of the mITTb population, the central corneal class continued to be rated as severe.

Epithelial defects: For the majority of the patients in the mITTa and mITTb population there were no epithelial  defects  reported  at  baseline  and  each  post-transplantation  visit  after  the  last  Holoclar treatment. The MAH states that for participants with observed traces of epithelial defects at baseline, there  were  no  epithelial  defects  reported  in  these  subjects  at  the  post-transplantation  visit.  This supposed shift, however, is considered not clinically important.

Ocular symptoms and scores:  As presented in Table 26 of the final CSR, at least one ocular symptom was reported for n=57 subjects (87.7%), which seems having been reduced to n=33 (57.9%) by Day 360 post-transplant.

BCVA:  In the mITT population there was an improvement observed from baseline values at visits Day 90, Day 180, Day 270 and Day 360, which overall was judged as statistically significant (p&lt;0.001; see Table 29 Final CSR).

Patient questionnaires (NEI VFQ-25, EQ-5D-3L, EQ-5D-3L VAS and HIS): The questionnaires used can be considered in accordance with clinical standard in the ophthalmology for the evaluation of the patients' perceptive of the benefit of a treatment on their life and daily routine. Overall, changes were reported for specific parameters in the relevant questionnaires between baseline and post -transplant at Day 360, indicating a benefit of Holoclar.

## Safety profile (refer to the PRAC Rapporteur assessment for detailed evaluation)

A total of 131 TEAEs were reported in 44 (57.9%) patients. The number of serious and severe TEAEs were 16 and 25, respectively, reported in 12 (15.8%) patients and 16 (21.1%) patients, respectively. A total of 71 TRAEs were reported in 27 (35.5%) patients, of which the majority (59 TRAEs in 20 [26.3%] patients) were judged to be possibly related to the ACLSCT surgical procedure. Overall, 10 serious TRAEs were reported in 6 (7.9%) patients. The most commonly reported serious TRAEs were Eye Disorders, with 7 serious TRAEs in 4 (5.3%) patients. In these, the most common serious TRAEs was corneal epithelium  defect  (4  serious  TRAEs  in  3  [3.9%]  patients).  There  were  also  two  incidents  of  rise  in intraocular pressure in 2 (2.6%) and one AESI of blepharitis. Due to narratives provided for the patients with SAEs or AESIs, causality unknown was reported for n=11 subjects, causality known, but not related to study and/or IMP for n=1 subjects, causality known as AESI blepharitis for n=1 subject, and for n=10 the causality was reported as related to the study procedure or the IMP (one subject experienced two related SAEs).

Long-term  safety  follow  up  data  are  available  either  retrospectively  with  HLSTM01,  HLSTM02  and HLSTM04 studies and also prospectively with the observational study HOLO-UP (HLSTM07) and with the interventional  study  HOLOCORE  FOLLOW-UP.  Further  long-term  follow-up  data  collection  is  ongoing through the HOLOSIGHT PAS study. Followup safety data are available for ≥ 1 year duration in 93.8% of  ACLSC implants (106 of 113 implants) in study HLSTM01. In the same study 43.4% (49 of 113

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

implants) have followup data pertaining ≥ 3 years. From study HLSTM02, 82.8% (24 of 29 implants) included followup data covering a ≥ 1 year period while 41.4% (12 of 29 implants) covered durations of ≥ 3 years. A limited follow -up was available for study HLSTM04 (10.72 ± 7.99 months).

## Rapporteur conclusion:

There are no major concerns with regard to the acceptance of the data package presented for the annual renewal procedure. Though the HOLOCORE study is completed and the status of subjects enrolled and treated did not change since 2019 due to the COVID pandemic and IMP shortage as stated by the MAH, the presented data package on efficacy and safety criteria of Holoclar in the approved indication may be considered  adequate  for  maintenance  of  the  overall  positive  risk-benefit  evaluation  of  the  product. However, an interim efficacy analysis of subjects included in the HOLOCORE-FU study is required for a final conclusion.

Regarding the final CSR submitted for the HOLOCORE Study for fulfilment of the SOB, from a formal perspective  the  MAH's  request  may  be  acceptable.  Where  the  content  of  the  final  study  report  is concerned, however the following aspects need to be taken into consideration for a final decision:

There is no doubt that the results for primary and secondary efficacy (and for safety) are presented in the final study report in a comprehensive way. However, there are no relevant changes in the numbers of subjects treated and results available since 2020 and the last renewal procedures, respectively, as no further patients were enrolled, and the trial is now completed. During the last renewal procedures, the MAH argued the recruiting process to be substantially negatively affected by the COVID pandemic. The regulatory agencies considered this for the first to be acceptable with regard the renewal procedures. For fulfilment of the SOB, however enrolment of more patients after the data lock point for the 2020 renewal was expected in order to have more solid results available in the final study report. It has to be noted that the primary efficacy analysis, i. e. the marketing authorisation is based on retrospective noncontrolled  case-series  studies  only.  Thus,  the  HOLOCORE  study  as  a  prospective,  multicentre, interventional  study  is  important  for  an  objective  assessment  of  results  gained  by  non-controlled retrospective  trials  and  for  re-evaluation  of  the  marketing  authorisation.  From  the  Rapporteur perspective the SOB is not considered fulfilled with regard to the content. While the patents' safety is under  constant  surveillance,  the  available  data  on  the  long-term  efficacy  of  the  whole  treatment procedure, comprising potential repeated biopsies and transplant procedures for an effective treatment are considered rather limited.

## 6.5. Clinical safety

## Actions taken for safety reasons

There have been no safety related actions taken in relation to Holoclar during the reference period.

## Changes to Reference Information

No significant safety related changes were made to the RSI during the reporting interval.

## Exposure

## Clinical trial exposure

80 patients (67 males and 13 females, 76 adults and 4 paediatrics) started the treatment with Holoclar (first biopsy received) during the study HOLOCORE.

With regards to the clinical trial 'HOLOCORE-FU', forty-seven (47) patients previously participating to the  HOLOCORE  have  been  enrolled  and  forty-four  (44)  have  completed  the  study.  No  exposure  to Holoclar was foreseen during this clinical trial.

In total, 223 patients received the transplantation with Holoclar in HLSTM01, HLSTM02, HLSTM04 and HOLOCORE clinical trials. This is the largest cohort of patients with LSCD so far. Cumulatively, 14 patients received the second implantation with Holoclar.

## Post-marketing exposure

After approval of Holoclar, excluding the patient enrolled in the HOLOCORE clinical trial, an additional one hundred and five (105) patients started the treatment, with 110 biopsies for tissue procurement (5 patients underwent to 2 biopsies) conducted with the marketed product so far.

Cumulatively, ninety-eight (98) patients (88 included in HOLOSIGHT study) have been implanted with Holoclar according to clinical practice. Four (4) patients were treated with out of specification product (last chance), according to the section 11.5 of the 'Guideline on Good Manufacturing practice specific to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products' and two (2) patients  received  the  sub-potent  batches  under exceptional circumstances on surgeon's request according to ATMP GMP guidelines.

Overall, considering patients (223) included in the clinical trials (HLSTM01, HLSTM02, HLSTM04 and HOLOCORE) and patients treated in the commercial setting according to clinical practice (98), a total of 321 patients have been exposed to the medicinal product for a total of 336 transplantations of autologous cultivated limbal stem cells (Holoclar) so far.

## PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

80 patients have been exposed to Holoclar in the HOLOCORE study. Post-marketing 98 patients have been implanted with Holoclar. Long term safety is considered missing information in the Holoclar RMP.

## Data in summary tabulations

Appendix 2 provides a cumulative summary tabulation of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in companysponsored clinical from Development International Birth Date (DIBD) to the Data Lock Point (DLP) of this document.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Appendix 3 provides cumulative summary tabulations of adverse reactions from post-marketing data sources, from the International Birth Date (IBD) to the DLP of this document.

## PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

According to the cumulative summary tabulation in appendix 2 of the ACO (Addendum to Clinical Overview) there are a total of 23 SAEs from clinical trials. Of these, 12 are in the SOC 'eye disorders'. Ninety-eight (98) patients have been exposed to the commercial product with 10 serious ADRs reported from post-marketing sources cumulatively (of these, 8 are in the SOC 'eye disorders').

Summary of significant safety findings from clinical trials and non-interventional studies

## Completed clinical trials

One clinical trial has been completed during the reporting interval, with the CSR finalised the 20th of March: 1) HOLOCORE; ID: CCD-GLPSCD01-03.

HOLOCORE; ID: CCD-GLPSCD01-03 involving eight (8) countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, The Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom) has been carried out in Europe. In the HOLOCORE study, a total of at least 68 patients (including at least 3 paediatrics, according to the EMEA-001082PIP02-11-M02) was planned to be treated with Holoclar. The HOLOCORE study is the subject of the specific obligation of the Conditional MA of Holoclar.

At the end of the study, all consenting patients were eligible to enter the safety and efficacy long-term follow-up study (HOLOCORE-FU study).

At the time of this report there are no patient ongoing enrolment as there is a temporary shortage of the product. The last 3 adult patients completed the study on March 2022 once they reached 6 month follow up after the 2nd autologous cultivated limbal stem cell transplantation (ACLSCT). According to the current status of the HOLOCORE study, the final CSR was finalized by March 2023.

PRAC  Rapporteur´s  comment:  The  completed  clinical  trial  HOLOCORE  is  a  prospective,  open-label, uncontrolled interventional study to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous cultivated limbal stem cells grafting for restoration of corneal epithelium in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency due to ocular burns, was implemented as a specific obligation to complete post-authorisation for the conditional marketing authorisation. As this is an interventional trial, assessment of the safety and efficacy results have been carried out by the CHMP Rapporteur. A discussion on the results of the trial is provided in section 5.

## Ongoing clinical trials

- One clinical trial was ongoing and terminated during the reference period (CSR not finalized at the DLP): 1) HOLOCORE-FU; ID: CCD-GLPSCD01-03-FU. This follow-up clinical trial was planned as an  extension  study  for  patients  terminating  the  HOLOCORE  study  (i.e.,  CCD-GPLSCD01-03; HLSTM03). This clinical trial is completed (LPLV 31MAR2023) and the statistical analysis as well as the CSR writing are ongoing. The objective of the follow up trial was to observe the patients included and treated in the main HOLOCORE study collecting safety and efficacy data in the long-term period and focusing on results of keratoplasties that the patients might receive after implantation with Holoclar  to  treat  deep  opacity.  On  6  April  2017  this  clinical  trial  was  submitted  to  the  Italian Competent Authority/Ethic Committees and was approved in June 2017. Overall, 47 patients (45

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adults and 2 minors) have been enrolled and are included in the clinical database, and 44 have completed the study. Sixty-one (61) treatment emergent adverse events occurred in 20 patients (42.6%) overall. At study end two (2) SAEs were reported: one (1) SAE of suture rupture, and one (1) SAE of mediastinum neoplasm. Both events were considered not related to the administration of Holoclar.

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment: The Holocore-FU study is completed with the LPLV on 31 MAR 2023 . This study is part of the Additional Pharmacovigilance activities put in place for the product. No ADRs were reported during this renewal period. The final CSR is planned by October 2023 and the RMP milestones have been updated accordingly.

## Non-interventional studies

A PASS study (HOLOSIGHT) entitled 'Long-term safety after Holoclar implant for restoration of corneal epithelium in patients with LSCD due to ocular burns: observational study of routine clinical practice' (HOLOSIGHT) is ongoing. The goal of this PASS is to enroll and observe the first hundred patients who receive Holoclar in a commercial setting. On 20 October 2016 the first patient was included in Italy. Biopsy was performed on the same day and the first implantation of Holoclar was made on 24 May 2017. At this report DLP, the study protocol was submitted in 9 European Countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom) including a total of 28 sites evaluated. Among them, 14 sites are currently active (1 in Austria, 2 in Belgium, 1 in Czech Republic, 1 in Denmark, 3 in Germany, 3 in Italy, 1 in The Netherlands and 2 in UK). During the reporting interval,  nineteen  (19)  new  patients  accepted  to  participate  into  the  HOLOSIGHT  study  signing  the Informed Consent. At the ACO DLP, ninety-six (96) subjects entered in the study. Among the 96 enrolled patients, 9 patients discontinued the study: 2 patients due to SAEs leading to study discontinuation; 3 patients withdrew the informed consent; 1 patient was lost to follow-up and the remaining for other causes (screen failures, excluded by the Investigator). Overall, 94 patients included in HOLOSIGHT were biopsied and 88 patients received Holoclar (20 in the reporting period). At this report DLP one patient completed  the  5  years  observation  period  after  the  implantation  (primary  endpoint).  This  study  is ongoing. Two (2) candidates for receiving the treatment with Holoclar were never biopsied and resulted as screening failure. The enrolment is closed with the last patient treated in May 2023 and the final number of patients who started the treatment with Holoclar and included in the study is 94. No safety issues were reported in this study. This study is part of the Additional Pharmacovigilance activities put in place for the product.

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment: Enrolment into the above non-interventional study, HOLOSIGHT, is closed with the last patient treated in May 2023. The final number of patients who started the treatment with Holoclar and were included in the study is 94. One patient has completed the 5 years observation period after the implantation (primary endpoint).

Cumulatively, a total of 76 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 42 patients. Overall, the majority of identified TEAEs and TRAEs have been classified within the SOC category 'Eye disorder'  with  'corneal  epithelium  defect'  being  the  most  commonly  reported  event  and  they  are typically  related  to  'lack  of  efficacy'.  During  the  interval  period,  one  serious  TEAEs  was  registered (Trauma Left eye) and considered not related by Site Investigator. Based on the data provided, no further risk minimisation measures are considered warranted at this time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medication errors

No cases of medication error were received during the reporting interval.

## Literature

None of the published articles during the reporting period revealed new safety or efficacy evidence that could impact the risk/benefit balance of Holoclar in the approved indications.

## Overview of signals

No validated signals were identified, ongoing or closed for Holoclar during the reporting interval.

## Late-breaking information

The following progresses occurred during the late breaking information reference period (03 May 202305 July 2023:

With reference to the commercial setting, 2 patients have been treated after 02 May 2023 (1 HOLOSIGHT and 1-Non-HOLOSIGHT) for a total of 99 commercial patients treated with Holoclar and 2 implanted with subpotent batches.

The  scope  of  the  HOLOSIGHT  PASS  was  to  include  the  first  100  commercial  patients  treated  with Holoclar: 10 patients treated with Holoclar didn't accept to be enrolled in the HOLOSIGHT study or could not be collected for logistics reasons and they are not included in the study having not signed the ICF. The study enrolment is considered completed, the last patient signed the ICF on 14 November 2022. Of the 94 patients enrolled, after the DLP:

- 0 patients received the biopsy;
- 1 patients received the 1 st  implant on 23 rd  May 2023 (last implant in HOLOSIGHT).

Overall, 90 patients included in HOLOSIGHT have been treated with Holoclar, and 4 early terminated before implantation for any reason.

The HOLOCORE-FU study is closed (LPLV 31 March 2023) and the statistical analysis is ongoing. The database was locked on 28 June 2023 and 45 patients analysed.

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment: No significant late-breaking information, with reference to Holoclar safety has been received after the DLP.

## Risk Evaluation

Summary of safety concerns at the beginning of the reporting interval:

| Important identified risks   | - Glaucoma - Lack of effect manifesting as corneal epithelium defect            |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| e.g. Mi ssing information    | - Pregnancy and lactation - Use in children - Use in elderly - Long term safety |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

No changes to the list of the safety concerns in the RMP were implemented during and after the reporting period  of  this  renewal.  Based  on  the  data  submitted  with  the  renewal  application,  no  changes  are warranted.

## 6.6. Pharmacovigilance inspections

During  the  reference  period  of  this  annual  renewal,  the  Company  altogether  (Corporate  offices  or affiliates) did not receive any Inspection of its Pharmacovigilance System from the Heath Authorities.

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

During the reference period, no PV inspection findings relevant to Holoclar were identified.

## 6.7. Discussion

The safety data reported in the renewal do not suggest any new safety concerns for Holoclar at this time. The completed clinical trial HOLOCORE is a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled interventional study to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous cultivated limbal stem cells grafting for restoration of corneal epithelium in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency due to ocular burns, implemented as a specific obligation to complete post-authorisation for the conditional marketing authorisation. As this is an interventional trial, assessment of the safety and efficacy results have been carried out by the CHMP Rapporteur. A discussion on the results of the trial is provided in section 5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 7. Risk management plan

PRAC  Rapporteur´s  comment:  The  MAH  has  submitted  an  updated  RMP  within  the  annual  renewal procedure. Outlined in the table below are the detailed changes proposed by the MAH as part of this RMP update. The updated RMP was submitted primarily to include new data from the finalised study CCD-GPLSCD01-03  (HOLOCORE),  which  is a specific obligation of the conditional marketing authorisation. Updates have also been made throughout the document to align with the requirements and format of EMA/164014/2018 Rev.2.0.1 template. No changes to the list of safety concerns for the RMP have been proposed by the MAH. In addition, no new pharmacovigilance studies or additional risk minimisation measures have been proposed by the MAH. The updates to Part 1 and Part II of the RMP are primarily as a result of the completion of Study CCD-GPLSCD01-03 (HOLOCORE) and are considered acceptable. In PART II Module SVII Identified and Potential Risks, the MAH has included information on the important identified risk 'Lack of effect manifesting as corneal epithelium defect' and the potential risk of 'Medication errors' concerning the use of topical lidocaine or anaesthetics containing adrenaline, which should be avoided for any of the steps of the treatment with Holoclar, as they reduce the colony forming efficiency. This is in line with the information provided in the educational material in the annex of the RMP since granting of the CMA and also with the protocols used in studies (HLSTM01, HLSTM02, HLSTM03, HLSTM04) and is considered acceptable by the PRAC Rapporteur. Of note, this information has not been included in the product information of Holoclar and has been proposed to be included in the PI as part of this renewal procedure. The PRAC Rapporteur also considers that Annex IID of the product information should be updated to reflect that concomitant use of topical lidocaine or anaesthetics containing adrenaline must be avoided. As part of the RSI, the MAH has submitted an updated RMP to change the study GPLSCD01-03-FU (HOLOCORE Follow-up) from ongoing to completed, and to include data from the study. This study has been assessed by the CAT Rapporteur as part of the RSI. The significant changes to the RMP as a result to this update are highlighted further below.

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment: Considering the data in the safety specification, the safety concerns listed by the MAH are appropriate. No changes to the current list of safety concerns has been proposed by the MAH. This is considered acceptable by the PRAC Rapporteur. There are ongoing PASS studies to further characterise the list of safety concerns as well as additional risk minimisation measures in place.

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product.

Category 2 are Specific Obligations in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances under Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 or in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation under Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004.

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

The proposed changes to the post-authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan are considered acceptable.  The  PhV  plan  has  been  updated  to  remove  Study  CCD-GPLSCD01-03  (HOLOCORE)  and update the status of the ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities and dates of milestones. The final CSR for the HOLOCORE follow-up study was finalised by March 2023 and the date of submission for the final report is 31/10/2023. As part of the RSI, the MAH has provided the final CSR for the HOLOCORE follow-up  study  which  has  been  assessed  by  the  CAT  Rapporteur.  With  regard  to  the  PASS  study, Holosight, the final study report submission date has been updated to 31/12/2028. The enrollment in this study is closed with the last patient treated in May 2023 and the final number of patients who started the treatment with Holoclar and included in the study is 94. One patient has completed the 5 years observation period after the implantation (primary endpoint).

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment:

Part V of the RMP has been updated to include addition of routine risk communication activities in line with the changes proposed in the updated SmPC and PL as well as the addition of other routine risk minimisation  measures  beyond  the  Product  Information:  'Holoclar  must  be  administered  by  an appropriately trained and qualified surgeon and is restricted to hospital use only.' Part V has also been updated to include more detail on the objectives and rationale for the Patient Information Guide. Part V of  the  RMP  has  also  been  updated  to  delete  reference  to  the  completed  Study  CCD-GPLSCD01-03 (HOLOCORE) and Study CCD-GPLSCD01-03 FU (HOLOCORE follow-up) in Pharmacovigilance activities. No new additional risk minimisation measures are proposed by the MAH which is considered acceptable. The risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the authorised indications.

- o Section 10.2: Deletion of a typographical error

PRAC Rapporteur´s comment: The changes made to the annexes of the RMP are primarily in line with completion of the Holocore study and Holocore FU study and considered acceptable. With regards to the educational material, no changes have been made to Annex IID. The changes proposed to Annex 6 and 7 educational materials are considered acceptable but must also be agreed by the relevant National Competent Authority in each Member State as necessary.

## 7.1. Overall conclusion on the RMP

The RMP version 12.2 is acceptable.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 8. Changes to the Product Information

Changes to the Product information have been submitted to SmPC, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1-3, 6.6, Annex II E, and PIL.

Changes to the Product Information (PI), based on the submitted data within the scope of this procedure, are introduced during the assessment of this renewal (see attached PI with comments).

## Quality:

In Section 4.4, the special warning for transmission of an infectious agent has been extended. This is regarded acceptable.

## Clinical:

Annex  IID  of  the  product  information  should  be  updated  to  reflect  that  concomitant  use  of  topical lidocaine or anaesthetics containing adrenaline must be avoided.

Section 5: The figures for the key primary and secondary efficacy endpoints need to be presented in alignment with the data reported in the final CSR of the HOLOCORE Study. For example, evaluable results for a successful transplantation in accordance with the Independent Assessor Judgement was documented for n=25/n=69 subjects, which results in a percentage rate of 36,2 % (95% CI: 0.25-0.49) vs. 41% as currently reported in the SmPC.

With responses to RSI (eCTD 0096) Product Information has been revised accordingly. Please refer to the Attachment.

## 9. Request for Supplementary Information - RfSI

The MAH should provide the following supplementary information in response to Day 60 RfSI:

## 9.1. Major objections

## Clinical

## Specific obligations

1. The MAH is requested to provide a solid justification, supported by comparable scientific literature data to demonstrate the SOB being fulfilled not only from a formal perspective, but also by content (thus providing an overall comprehensive data package and justifying the granting of a standard MA instead of a renewal of the CMA), considering the following criteria inter alia:

a) N=93 subjects and at least n=87 adults were planned to be enrolled and treated in the HOLOCORE Study, which is subject to the SOB. However, results available on the efficacy endpoints did not change significantly since data lock point for the 2020 renewal; up to now, n=63 subjects have been treated in the HOLOCORE Study.  Successful transplantation (primary efficacy endpoint) was reported as 33.8% in terms of the mITTb population. In terms of key secondary endpoints, central corneal evaluation at Day 360 remained severe in 22% of the participants, no change in the status of neo-revascularization was reported for 38% of the participants, and as the majority of participants presented with no epithelial defects at baseline, a potential shift could not be measured post-transplantation.

b) According to the SAP of the HOLOCORE Study, a proportion of successful transplantation of 66.7% was expected.

- c) The high number of study procedure/IMP related TEAs and SAEs (please refer to the clinical OC);
- d) No long-term efficacy data for the n=47 enrolled subjects enrolled in the HOLOCORE-Follow-Up study have been presented up to now (please refer to the corresponding OC below).

## 9.2. Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

1. As the final  study  report the  HOLOCORE-FU study (Chiesi  ID  CCD-GPLSCD01-03-FU) will be available to a later time Study procedure and/or IMP related serious adverse events have been reported up to now for n=10 subjects in the HOLOCORE study. The MAH is asked to provide a thorough discussion (apart from the narratives provided) on the underlying reasons for the occurrence of these SAEs and to evaluate the introduction of risk mitigation measures in order to avoid such events. This is considered particularly important as long-term safety is considered missing information (please see RMP assessment PRAC Rapporteur).

2. point according to the MAH (October 2023), the Applicant is asked to provide profound interim information  on  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  parameters  for  subjects  included  in  this  trial.  The availability and acceptance of the results provided may have an impact on the acceptance of the SOB (see clinical MO).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. The MAH is requested to submit a thorough presentation of post-marketing data for efficacy and safety.

In addition, the MAH should provide an evaluation of the impact of the product shortage since December 2022 in the EU and UK on the outstanding post-authorisation measures.

4. The SmPC needs to be revised in accordance with the points outlined in the assessment report; figures presented for the key primary and secondary efficacy endpoints below SmPC section 5 have to be in alignment with the data reported in the final CSR of the HOLOCORE Study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 10. Assessment of the MAH responses to the RfSI

## 10.1. Major objections

## Specific Obligations

## Clinical Question

## Summary of the MAH's response

The response data package to the RfSI for the clinical MO and OCs contains:

1. The MAH's Response Document on the MO and the OCs, i. a. including the justification of the HOLOCORE study and the evaluation of the Holoclar treatment success and failures based on the trial primary composite endpoint evaluated by Independent Assessors using CNV in Quadrant Methodology on 2D pictures. The issues regarding the in 2020 identified little relevance of the key efficacy endpoints were mitigated by the new MAH Holostem with an amendment of the trial protocol  (introduction  of  a  blinded  re-evaluation  of  all  the  2D  photos  by  the  Independent Assessors), submitted to the Authorities.
2. A literature-based discussion on surgical options for the target population.
3. Further long-term efficacy and safety data, comprising:
- a. The final study report of the non-pharmacological Phase 4 HOLOCORE-FU Study (CCDGPLSCD0103-FU Version 1.0, 31 OCT 2023), a 'multinational, multicenter, prospective, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study after ACLSCT for restoration of corneal epithelium in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency due to ocular burns' . The study was initiated on 13 Dec 2017 and completed on 31 Mar 2023. Overall, 47 patients (45 adults and 2 minors) have been enrolled, and 44 have completed the study, with a follow-up from 2 to 6 years after Holoclar implantation. Results are provided as pooled analysis.
- b. Update on the Holosight Study, the ongoing long-term PAS study (final study report due date December 2027).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to the MO part a) and b), the MAH argues, the SOB concerning the number of evaluated subjects is met, which has not been questioned per se. As per the HOLOCORE study protocol agreed with the EMA in the context of the granting a CMA, approximately 87 adult patients were planned to be included into the study, in order to have 65 adult patients treated with Holoclar, taking into consideration a possible drop-out rate of 25% before the Holoclar treatment. The final target was achieved: 80 patients were enrolled; they underwent the biopsy withdrawal for the product preparation, and out of 80, 73 (69 adults plus 4 paediatrics) received Holoclar implantation. Out of 73 patients, all the paediatrics completed the study (4 patients) while 64 adults completed the study (the remaining 5 are withdrawals before the 12-month final evaluation due to AE (2 patients), withdrawals of the informed consent form (2 patients) and withdrawal for other reasons (1 patient - transfer to another country). According to the MAH, the SOB is also fulfilled in content, as the results on mid- and long-term safety and efficacy presented confirm the Holoclar benefits and safety profile observed in previous retrospective studies. The overall success rate from a minimum of 51% in the Study HOLOCORE (measured according to Global Consensus standard guidelines) up to 77% (measured by ophthalmologists) with an overall improvement of 60% the population affected by LSCD since 153 months on average is sufficiently meaningful, as clinical assessments by ophthalmologist would be the most reliable parameter to define treatment success. The MAH also argues, in the long-term efficacy HOLO-UP study, conducted in 2017 (CCD-GPLSCD01-07) on 49 patients participating to the previous HLSTM01 study, with a mean follow-up of 153 months after Holoclar  transplantation,  the  persistence  of  successful  transplantations  was  judged  as  50.0%  (24 subjects; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.65; p=0.443) according to the overall clinical judgement of the Investigator. The evidence of safety and efficacy of Holoclar gained by real world data would be the best approach for the marketing authorisation of the product, i. e. the conversion of the current CMA for Holoclar to a full approval.  Moreover,  the  introduction  of  proper  evaluation  of  2D  pictures  by  external  independent assessors in alignment with LSCD Global Consensus Guidelines as mitigation action eliminates existing bias and ensures evidence based clinical assessment (for comparison between the trials see CSR Table 3).

## Literature based discussion

According to the MAH, surgical options depend on patient selection:

- Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAu), 40% of the limbus from the fellow healthy eye is taken. This approach requires one fully intact eye, and it is not well accepted by patients and by surgeons, as gives one chance only (Deng SX et al. 2020).

- Conjunctival limbal allograft (CLAL), in which stem cells are taken from a living, related donor or dead donor  and  transplanted  into  the  diseased  eye  of  the  recipient.  This  approach  requires  a  long-term immunosuppression as epithelia are strongly antigenic (Santos MS, 2005; Movahedan A, et al, 2017)

- Keratolimbal allograft (KLAL), transplants the entire limbus from a dead donor using the corneoscleral carrier  to deliver  a  large number of stem cells to the recipient. This approach, even more invasive, requires  a  long-term  immunosuppression  as  epithelia  are  strongly  antigenic  (Santos  MS,  2005; Movahedan A, et al, 2017);

- Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET), reduces the tissue withdrawal of CLAu, but it treats milder severity (superficial lesions only) than CLET (Holoclar). In the SLET procedure, re-epithelialization requires months (it takes at least 5-6 weeks) (Sangwan S.V., 2012; Swapna SS. 2019) with prolonged pain, and increased risk of inflammation and complications (Magrelli F.M 2020, Deng SX 2020).

- Cultured limbal epithelial transplantation (Holoclar) procedure can treat both eyes, it starts from a smaller amount of limbal tissue (1-2 mm 2 ), minimize the risk of injury to the healthy eye, if any. Holoclar does not require lifelong immunosuppression and in cases of failure, the treatment can be repeated multiple times without damage of the fellow eye, if any. In addition, the epithelialization is fast, as the full epithelium (with stem cells) quickly engrafts without suturing, with reduced risk of inflammation, infections and pain, burning photophobia (Magrelli F.M 202, Rama P 2010). The development of this technique  has  frequently  resulted  from  collaboration  between  stem  cell  translational  scientists  and ophthalmologists. Direct transplantation of autologous limbal tissue from a healthy donor eye is regarded by scientific papers as the technique of choice, as it quickly restores the corneal limbal milieu (Deng SX, 2019, Sacchetti M. et al, 2018; Calonge M. et al, 2021, Guerin LP. et al, 2022).

## Assessor's evaluation of the presented results in the HOLOCORE-FU final CSR

## Efficacy (secondary EPs):

Successful  transplantation  has  been  evaluated  by  two  different  methods:  level  of  corneal  neovascularisation based on the number of vessels invading the quadrants and the central cornea, and the Investigators  judgement  based  on  clinical  eye  observation  at  the  slit  lamp,  which  is  a  method  of significant importance in the patient population without keratoplasty.

For the majority of patients (n=41/47; 87.2%) of the safety population the etiology of LSCD due to burn was chemical. Of the 45 patients in the adult safety population (N = 18, with keratoplasty; N = 27, without  keratoplasty)  34  (N  =15,  with  keratoplasty;  N  =  19,  without  keratoplasty),  patients  were assessed at Day 360 in the FU-study. The evaluation of the differences in outcome measurements in patients with/without keratoplasty was a focus of the HOLOCORE and HOLOCORE-FU studies, for which the MAH delivers comprehensive information in the HOLOCORE-FU Final CSR. The MAH's explanation for the  difference  in  the  evaluation  of  outcomes  of  patients  without  keratoplasty vs patients  with keratoplasty  is  'the  persistence  of  ghost  non-active  and  stromal  vessels  when  keratoplasty  is  not performed, which drives the classification to failure. The restoration of stroma by keratoplasty shows the absence of recurrence of those vessels, therefore, the real success rate by tissue function and wound healing capability without confounding elements from previous residual damage.' The MAH's estimation provided is considered in accordance with scientific standard in the ophthalmology, based on available

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

literature in the on etiology and pathophysiology of ghost vessels, which are regressed vessels in the corneal stroma (e.g. Powner et al., Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, September 2016 ).

After adjustment of missing patients, the success of transplantation in the adult safety population at day 360  was  calculated  as  60.7%  (n/N  =  17/28)  by  corneal  involvement/corneal  neo-revascularisation (anatomical restoration) and 83.3% (n/N = 25/30) by overall investigator's judgement. Subsequently, 10/15 (66.7%), 8/21 (38.1%), 8/15 (53.3%) and 4/5 (80.0%) patients had success of transplantation at Day 720, 1080, 1440, and 1800, respectively. According to overall investigator's judgement, 16/20 (80.0%), 19/22 (86.4%), 12/15 (80.0%), and 5/5 (100%) patients had success of transplantation at Day 720, 1080, 1440, and 1800.

Taking specific subpopulations, the overall success rate at Day 360 was significantly higher in patients with the etiology of alkali burn, in patients with no previous surgical procedure and in patients, whose biopsy collection area was 11-12-1-5-6-7, respectively. For example, the transplantation success rate in the population, who underwent more than one surgery before Holoclar, was 28% only in the HOLOCORE main  study.    These  3  subpopulations,  however,  represented  the  minority  of  the  trial  participants; therefore, meaningful conclusions as regards potential limitation of the therapeutic indication and/or number of previous eye surgery are not possible.

With regard to the EP neo-vascularisation and central cornea involvement after Day 360 in the adult safety population (see CSR Table 19), in the group with and without keratoplasty, n=3 (16.7%) had 3 corneal  quadrants  and n=15 (83.3%) 4 corneal quadrants, and n=8 (29.6%) and n=18 (66.7%) 4 corneal quadrants involved at baseline. Figures are available up to Day 1800 (Day 1440: n=15 evaluable patients; Day 1800: n=5 evaluable patients); they suggest that the results at least up to Day 1440 seem relatively  stable  compared  to  Day  360.  Although  the  figures  are  very  small,  the  number  of  corneal quadrants at Day 1800 was 0 in n=3/5 patients (60.0%), and n=5/5 patients (100%) had no central cornea involvement.

The proportion of patients with no epithelial defects at Day 360 was 73.5% (n/N = 25/34) in comparison to 60.0% (n/N = 27/45) at baseline. The proportion of patients with or without keratoplasty with no epithelial defects was 93.3% (n/N = 14/15) and 57.9% (n/N = 11/19), respectively.

Regarding the EP degree of re-epithelialisation, 25/34 patients (73.5%) had no defects on Day 360. The figures at Days 1440 and 1800 are comparable: 12/15 (80%) and 5/5 (100%) respectively, however, as stated already, the number of evaluable subjects significantly reduces over the time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of patients with no clinical symptoms of photophobia, burning and pain at Day 360 seems increased to 52.9% (n/N = 18/34), 70.6% (n/N = 24/34), and 79.4% (n/N = 27/34), respectively, from 26.7% (n/N = 12/45), 46.7% (n/N = 21/45), and 60.0% (n/N = 27/45) at baseline.  E. g., among patients who had moderate burning symptom at baseline, 5/34 (14.7%), 3/20 (15.0%), 0/22 (0.0%), 1/15 (6.7%), and 2/5 (40.0%) patients presented no symptom at Day 360, Day 720, Day 1080, Day 1440 and Day 1800, respectively.

Presence of conjunctival inflammation was reported in 31/45 (68.9%) patients at baseline. The incidence at subsequent annual visits was as follows: 14/34 (41.2%) patients at Day 360, 8/20 (40.0%) at Day 720, 13/22 (59.1%) patients at Day 1080, 8/15 (53.3%) patients at Day 1440 and 1/5 (20.0%) patients at Day 1800.

With regard to the EP BCVA, the following number of patients had BCVA improvement compared to baseline: 21/28 (75.0%), 13/17 (76.5%), 15/21 (71.4%), 11/15 (73.3%), and 5/5 (100.0%) at Day 360, Day 720, Day 1080, Day 1440, and Day 1800, respectively. The figures for BCVA improvement compared to baseline by keratoplasty were even higher: 14/14 (100.0%), 11/12 (91.7%), and 6/7 (85.7%), at KDay 360, KDay 720, and KDay 1080, respectively (see CSR Table 34).

Regarding the efficacy endpoint corneal opacity and conjunctival sensitivity, the number of patients with corneal opacity at baseline was 45/45 (100.0%), and at each subsequent annual visit: 19/34 (55.9%) at Day 360; 9/20 (45.0%) at Day 720; 17/22 (77.3%) at Day 1080; 12/15 (80.0%) at Day 1440 and 2/5 (40.0%) at Day 1800. Similar stability in improvement over the time is described for conjunctival sensitivity.

## Safety (primary EP):

There was 1 adverse event of corneal opacity related to Holoclar reported in the HOLOCORE-FU study. Taking the pooled analysis of the HOLOCORE and HOLOCORE-FU studies a total of 175 AEs were reported in  33  (70.2%)  patients.  N=22  AEs  have  been  reported  in  the  pre-first  transplantation  phase  in  18 (38.3%) patients. In Year 1, 81 AEs were reported in 28/47 (59.6%) patients, in Year 4 17 AEs in 8/45 (17.8%) and in Year 6 1 AE in 1/25 (4.0%) patient. A total of 2 serious TEAEs has been reported in 2 patients (4.3%): 1 TEAE was associated to injury and procedural complications, and 1 TEAE related to a mediastinal neoplasm with fatal outcome, not considered related to Holoclar or study procedures (see CSR Table 48 and Narratives). The narratives provided for the patient with the SAE Suture Rupture Left Eye, which required a surgery for re-suturing on 20 May 2020 indicates, the event being not judged related to study treatment, biopsy or ACLSCT by the investigator. The resolve of the event is reported on  06Aug2020.  The  most  common  cause  of  TRAEs  was  the  ACLSCT  surgical  procedure;  41  TRAEs reported in 23.4% (n/N = 11/47) of the patients. Only 1 TRAE (corneal opacity) in 1/47 (2.1%) patient was deemed related to the Holoclar treatment. A total of 4 AESIs were reported in 8.5% (n/N = 4/47) of the patients and none were deemed to be related to the Holoclar treatment; the TEAESI Blepharitis was reported in 3/47 patients (6.4%).  Overall, 6 TRAEs in 5 (6.6%) patients were judged to be related to Holoclar treatment. The reported TRAEs thought to be related to Holoclar were Eye Disorders: corneal epithelium defect (3 TRAEs in 3 [3.9%] patients), ulcerative keratitis (2 TRAEs in 2 [2.6%] patients) and corneal thinning (1 TRAE in 1 [1.3%] patient) that should be all considered as lack of efficacy. No other adverse effects caused by Holoclar were reported during the HOLOCORE study ( source: CSR Table 4 and Appendix 4 ).

## Assessor evaluation and conclusion of the MAH's response on the clinical MO 1a)-d)

The clinical assessors emphasized in previous reports on Holoclar renewal procedures major uncertainties with  regard  to  the  HOLOCORE  main  study,  which the  MAH  also  recognized.  These  uncertainties  are related i. a. to the high number of recruiting centers (18) in 8 countries and assumed differences in clinical standards, evident by the number of major protocol variations (document Applicant Answers to the RfSI: '…the large majority of the centres (15/18; 83%) was involved…for the first time…learning curve…'), and the impacts of the COVID19pandemic on quality and consistency of the study results (document Applicant Answers to the RfSI: 'Interruption of activities at Investigational sites during the COVID19pandemic …prevented to collect the proper images for the primary endpoint assessment…and decreased the number of evaluable subjects…'). The high number of adverse events are i. a. the result of a 'learning curve of surgeons and treatment failures', a statement of the Applicant, which underlines the concerns of Authority described. This may explain the observation that the allover results on safety parameters during the studies HOLOCORE and HOLOCORE-FU indicate a clear decrease in the number of adverse events occurred over the time up to Day 360. The majority of TEAEs was attributed to the surgical procedure. With regard to the MO part b), the success rate of 66.7% had been calculated by the previous  MAH  (CHIESI),  based  on  results  of  the  clinical  study  HLSTM01.  The  HOLOSTEM  company inherited the HOLOCORE study in 2020 and became aware that the protocol recommendations for the evaluation of the primary endpoint were not implemented, thus leading to 'significant discrepancies' and 'inconsistent  judgment  of  successes  and  failures'.  Therefore,  HOLOSTEM  introduced  mitigation measures, in order to ensure independent and evidence based clinical assessment of efficacy endpoints. The primary endpoint in the HOLOCORE Study was calculated based on 2D photos, evaluated by external independent assessors with quadrant methodology according to Global Consensus Criteria and focus on corneal neo-revascularisation.

The major objection regarding the reported rate on the primary endpoint successful transplantation of 33.8% in the mITTb population of the HOLOCORE study can be considered resolved based on the longterm results submitted in the HOLOCORE-FU final CSR for patients in the HOLOCORE main study, and interim  results  submitted for  the  HOLOSIGHT  PASS  for  patients treated  in  the  HLSTM01  study  (see below). The figures on long-term efficacy and safety of once or twice treatment with Holoclar provided for the Study HOLOCORE-FU, the follow-up of subjects treated in the HOLOCORE main study comprise a mean follow-up period for patients of 3.3 years. The focus of this study was observation of the disease and to gather information on the efficacy and safety of Holoclar in subjects, candidate for keratoplasty, as the retrospective studies HLSTM01, HLSTM02 and HLSTM04 did not provide this information. Overall, the outcome of successful transplantation (irrespective of keratoplasty), i. a. judged by assessors in accordance  with  global  standard  criteria  (based  on  2-D  pictures  and  assessed  by  CNV  methods  in quadrants), and the improvement of clinical important parameters such as BCVA and clinical symptoms reported to the HOLOCORE main study after treatment with Holoclar continued during the HOLOCORE study. Though the number of evaluable subjects decreased considerably from n=14 at Day 360 to n=2 at Day 1800, the long-term outcome of treatment with Holoclar in patients with LSCD appears to be comparable with e.g. patients, who received CLAu ( Eslani et al, Long-Term Outcomes of CLAU in Patients with LSCD, The Ocular Surface, 2019). The potential major advantage of treatment with Holoclar may be the possibility of repeated use without necessity of accompanying immunosuppression, required in therapy  methods  with  allografts.  Ocular  hypertension  secondary  to  corticosteroid  use  is  a  known complication of allograft ocular stem cell transplantation.

The second follow-up study for patients treated with Holoclar is the HOLOSOGHT PAS study. The interim report was part of the data package of the original renewal, submitted on 26 July 2023, and the results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submitted for the efficacy endpoints in 56 participants, who completed the 1-year follow-up has been already assessed. In principle, the results at Year 1, calculated on non-missing data can be considered comparable with the data presented for the HOLOCORE-FU study with regard to the Ep CNV (superficial and in central cornea ). However, an estimation of a shift of severe epithelial defects from baseline to Year 1 is not possible due to missing data at Year 1. According to the MAH the study is ongoing, and missing data (see Interim Report Table 33) are due to backlog in CRF completion sites.

There might be a potential impact on the endpoint evaluation in the HOLOCORE main study, however, difficult to judge, considering the following: The first subject screened in the HOLOCORE Study was on the 28 Oct 2015, and the last subject completed on 11 Mar 2022. When HOLOSTEM took the study over in 2020, patient enrolment, treatment and data acquisition for endpoints had been already carried out in accordance with trial protocol versions prior to the changes of the endpoint evaluation mentioned, even if the re-evaluation of patients in the study according to Global Consensus Criteria was done during the study, starting late 2020. In addition, considering certain subpopulations in the HOLOCORE main study such as patients with/without prior surgery and/or patients with LSCD due to chemical/alkali burn, there seem to be major differences in the efficacy outcome, which, at least for the patients with LSCD due to alkali burn is currently not understandable. To what extend those clinically relevant differences in  subpopulations  may  be  a  rationale  to  request  the  conduction  of  a  randomized  clinical  trial,  is controversial based on the long-term efficacy and safety results presented up to Day 360 for a limited number of patients (n=14), however. Regarding the MAH's request on conversion of CMA to full approval, the critical point may be that there was no controlled clinical study performed with Holoclar up to now. The pivotal study for the original CMA was Study HLSTM01, an observational study including 106 LSCD patients  (n=113  transplantations)  from  2  centers  in  Italy,  conducted  between  1998  and  2007;  the supportive study was HLSTM02, an observational study, including 29 LSCD patients (29 transplantations) from 7 Italian centers (EPAR, EMA/25273/2015).

From a regulatory perspective, a controlled clinical trial for treatment of a representative number of patients with LSCD due to ocular burn, may be preferred in order to eliminate existing uncertainties. However, there seems no reasonable comparative trial possible, evaluating the therapy concept with Holoclar  and  other  similar  ophthalmological  surgery  with  exception  maybe  of  conjunctival  limbal autograft (CLAu). Furthermore, according to the literature data basis, long-term efficacy and safety data of Holoclar provided seem to be comparable with those reported in patients treated with CLAu.

## Conclusion

The MO is resolved.

## Question 1 and Question 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The final CSR of HOLOCORE-FU study (Chiesi ID CCD-GPLSCD01-03-FU) is part of the data package submitted  for  the  RfSI  nad  considered  acceptable.  For  details,  please  see  the  assessment  of  the responses on the clinical MO.

## Conclusion

The issues (clinical OC1 and OC2) are resolved.

## Question 3

The MAH is requested to submit a thorough presentation of post-marketing data for efficacy and safety. In addition, the MAH should provide an evaluation of the impact of the product shortage since December 2022 in the EU and UK on the outstanding post-authorisation measures.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Beyond patients who received the marketed product and participating to the HOLOSIGHT PAS study, additional 9 subjects were treated with Holoclar in EU and UK ( Ali E. Ghareeb. Majlinda Lako, Francisco C.  Figueiredo,2020 ).  No  pharmacovigilance  notification  nor  product  complaints,  neither  request  for reimbursement (where applicable) were received from the treating centres so far.

Concerning the Holoclar shortage since December 2022, no impact occurred on the post-authorisation measures, specifically on the HOLOCORE, HOLOCORE FOLLOW-UP and HOLOSIGHT studies.

· HOLOCORE: the clinical trial was already closed before, and no treatment was outstanding at the � me of product shortage.

• HOLOCORE FOLLOW-UP: no further treatment was planned in the study.

· HOLOSIGHT (PASS): as described in the most recent Interim Report included in the ACO submitted on 28JUL2023,  the  enrolment  is  closed  and  treatment  for  all  patients  included  were  secured.  The  last treatment of the last patient was administered in MAY2023.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The answers provided are acceptable. The issue is resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 4

The SmPC needs to be revised in accordance with the points outlined in the assessment report; figures presented for the key primary and secondary efficacy endpoints below SmPC section 5 have to be in alignment with the data reported in the final CSR of the HOLOCORE Study.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Based on the discussion about the final data of the HOLOCORE study the Applicant revised the SmPC on the basis of the clarification presented in the present document.

The following sentence: 'At the final visit, the 82% of patients who attended had no epithelial defects, 49.2% had normal limbal hyperaemia and 44.3% had normal corneal sensitivity' has been kept as these parameters provide evidence of the Holoclar efficacy in reconstructing the original corneal epithelium after conjunctival pannus removal.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The revised SmPC is considered acceptable. The issue is resolved.

## Rapporteur overall conclusion after review of data provided on the RfSI:

The final results presented on long-term efficacy and safety data for patients treated with Holoclar might be considered not fully satisfactory in view of the number of patients and the conditions of the clinical trials. However, the data suggest that treatment with Holoclar seems to be safe and may provide a longterm benefit for adult patients with LSCD due to ocular burn when administered in professional clinical centres. Therefore, the Rapporteur supports the Applicant's proposal to remove the following SOB and PAM, and to convert the conditional marketing authorisation to full marketing authorisation:
