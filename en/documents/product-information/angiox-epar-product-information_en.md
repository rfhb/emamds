<!-- image -->

The recommended dose of bivalirudin for patients undergoing PCI is an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour for at least the duration of the procedure. The infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour may be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight/hour for an additional 4 - 12 hours as clinically necessary. In STEMI patients the infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour should be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and continued at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight/hour for an additional 4 - 12 hours as clinically necessary (see section 4.4).

For the full list of excipients see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder for concentrate for solution for injection or infusion (powder for concentrate). White to off-white lyophilised powder. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Angiox is indicated as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI. Angiox is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) planned for urgent or early intervention. Angiox should be administered with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Angiox should be administered by a physician experienced in either acute coronary care or in coronary intervention procedures. Posology Patients undergoing PCI, including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI)

The recommended starting dose of bivalirudin for medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h. Patients who are to be medically managed may continue the infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for up to 72 hours.  If the medically managed patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of bivalirudin should be administered before the procedure and the infusion increased to 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure. Following PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h may be resumed for 4 to 12 hours as clinically necessary.

For patients who proceed to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery off pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until the time of surgery. Just prior to surgery, a 0.5 mg/kg bolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion for the duration of the surgery. For patients who proceed to CABG surgery on pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until 1 hour prior to surgery after which the infusion should be discontinued and the patient treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH). To ensure appropriate administration of bivalirudin, the completely dissolved, reconstituted and diluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration (see section 6.6). The bolus dose should be administered by a rapid intravenous push to ensure that the entire bolus reaches the patient before the start of the procedure. Intravenous infusion lines should be primed with bivalirudin to ensure continuity of drug infusion after delivery of the bolus. The infusion dose should be initiated immediately after the bolus dose is administered, ensuring delivery to the patient prior to the procedure, and continued uninterrupted for the duration of the procedure. The safety and efficacy of a bolus dose of bivalirudin without the subsequent infusion has not been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned. An increase in the activated clotting time (ACT) may be used as an indication that a patient has received bivalirudin. ACT values 5 minutes after bivalirudin bolus average 365 +/- 100 seconds. If the 5-minute ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be administered. Once the ACT value is greater than 225 seconds, no further monitoring is required provided the 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion dose is properly administered. Where insufficient ACT increase is observed, the possibility of medication error should be considered, for example inadequate mixing of Angiox or intravenous equipment failures. The arterial sheath can be removed 2 hours after discontinuation of the bivalirudin infusion without anticoagulation monitoring. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Use with other anticoagulant therapy

In STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, standard pre-hospital adjunctive therapy should include clopidogrel and may include the early administration of UFH (See section 5.1).

Patients can be started on Angiox 30 minutes after discontinuation of unfractionated heparin given intravenously, or 8 hours after discontinuation of low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously.

Angiox can be used in conjunction with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. For further information regarding the use of bivalirudin with or without a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, please see section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal insufficiency

Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR&lt;30 ml/min) and also in dialysis-dependent patients (see section 4.3).

In patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency, the ACS dose (0.1 mg/kg bolus/0.25 mg/kg/h infusion) should not be adjusted.

Patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min) undergoing PCI (whether being treated with bivalirudin for ACS or not) should receive a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose should not be changed from the posology described under ACS or PCI above.

Patients with renal impairment should be carefully monitored for clinical signs of bleeding during PCI, as clearance of bivalirudin is reduced in these patients (see section 5.2) If the 5-minute ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/kg should be administered and the ACT re-checked 5 minutes after the administration of the second bolus dose. Where insufficient ACT increase is observed, the possibility of medication error should be considered, for example inadequate mixing of Angiox or intravenous equipment failures. Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that hepatic metabolism of bivalirudin is limited, therefore the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin have not been specifically studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Elderly population Increased awareness due to high bleeding risk should be exercised in the elderly because of age-related decrease in renal function. Dose adjustments for this age group should be on the basis of renal function. Paediatric patients There is currently no indication for the use of Angiox in children less than 18 years old and no recommendation on a posology can be made.  Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2. Method of administration Angiox is intended for intravenous use. Angiox should be initially reconstituted to give a solution of 50 mg/ml bivalirudin. Reconstituted material should then be further diluted in a total volume of 50 ml to give a solution of 5 mg/ml bivalirudin. Reconstituted and diluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.3 Contraindications

Angiox is contraindicated in patients with:

-  a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to hirudins
-  active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/or irreversible coagulation disorders
-  severe uncontrolled hypertension

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  subacute bacterial endocarditis
-  severe renal impairment (GFR&lt;30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Angiox is not intended for intramuscular use. Do not administer intramuscularly.

## Haemorrhage

Patients must be observed carefully for symptoms and signs of bleeding during treatment particularly if bivalirudin is combined with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5). Although most bleeding associated with bivalirudin occurs at the site of arterial puncture in patients undergoing PCI, haemorrhage can occur at any site during therapy. Unexplained decreases in haematocrit, haemoglobin or blood pressure may indicate haemorrhage. Treatment should be stopped if bleeding is observed or suspected.

Acute stent thrombosis (&lt;24 hours) has been observed in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI and has been managed by Target Vessel Revascularisation (TVR) (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The majority of these cases were non-fatal. This increased risk of acute stent thrombosis was observed during the first 4 hours following the end of the procedure among patients who either discontinued the infusion of bivalirudin at the end of the procedure or received a continued infusion at the reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h (see section 4.2). Patients should remain for at least 24 hours in a facility capable of managing ischaemic complications and should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia.

There is no known antidote to bivalirudin but its effect wears off quickly (T ½ is 25 ± 12 minutes). Prolonged post PCI infusions of bivalirudin at recommended doses have not been associated with an increased rate of bleeding (see section 4.2). Co-administration with platelet inhibitors or anti-coagulants Combined use of anti-coagulant medicinal products can be expected to increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). When bivalirudin is combined with a platelet inhibitor or an anti-coagulant medicine, clinical and biological parameters of haemostasis should be regularly monitored. In patients taking warfarin who are treated with bivalirudin, International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be considered to ensure that it returns to pre-treatment levels following discontinuation of bivalirudin treatment. Hypersensitivity Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions were reported uncommonly (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100) in clinical trials. Necessary preparations should be made to deal with this. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. In the case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be applied. Anaphylaxis, including anaphylactic shock with fatal outcome has been reported very rarely (≤1/10,000) in post-marketing experience (see section 4.8). Treatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibodies are rare and have not been associated with clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Caution should be exercised in patients previously treated with lepirudin who had developed lepirudin antibodies. Acute stent thrombosis Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Brachytherapy

Intra-procedural thrombus formation has been observed during gamma brachytherapy procedures with Angiox.

Angiox should be used with caution during beta brachytherapy procedures.

## Excipient

Angiox contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Interaction studies have been conducted with platelet inhibitors, including acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, abciximab, eptifibatide, or tirofiban. The results do not suggest pharmacodynamic interactions with these medicinal products. From the knowledge of their mechanism of action, combined use of anti-coagulant medicinal products (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or antiplatelet agents) can be expected to increase the risk of bleeding. In any case, when bivalirudin is combined with a platelet inhibitor or an anticoagulant, clinical and biological parameters of haemostasis should be regularly monitored. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no or limited data from the use of bivalirudin in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Angiox should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with bivalirudin. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether bivalirudin is excreted in human milk. Angiox should be administered with caution in breast-feeding mothers. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Angiox has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  The most frequent serious and fatal adverse reactions are major haemorrhage (access site and non access-site bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage) and hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic shock. Coronary artery thrombosis and coronary stent thrombosis with myocardial infarction, and catheter thrombosis have each been reported rarely. Administration errors may lead to fatal thrombosis.
-  In patients receiving warfarin, INR is increased by administration of bivalirudin.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Haemorrhage

In all clinical studies bleeding data were collected separately from adverse reactions and are summarised in Table 6 together with the bleeding definitions used for each study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The HORIZONS Trial (Patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI)

## Platelets, bleeding and clotting

In the HORIZONS study both major and minor bleeding occurred commonly (  1/100 and &lt;1/10). The incidence of major and minor bleeding was significantly less in patients treated with bivalirudin versus patients treated with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The incidence of major bleeding is shown in Table 6. Major bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath puncture site. The most frequent event was a haematoma &lt;5 cm at puncture site.

In the HORIZONS study, thrombocytopenia was reported in 26 (1. 6%) of bivalirudin-treated patients and in 67 (3.9%) of patients treated with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. All of these bivalirudintreated patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid, all but 1 received clopidogrel and 15 also received a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The ACUITY Trial ( Patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI)) The following data are based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 13,819 patients with ACS; 4,612 were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4,604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor and 4,603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Adverse reactions were more frequent in females and in patients more than 65 years of age in both the bivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator groups compared to male or younger patients. Approximately 23.3% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and 2.1% experienced an adverse reaction. Adverse event reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system organ class in Table 1. Platelets, bleeding and clotting In ACUITY, bleeding data were collected separately from adverse reactions. Major bleeding was defined as any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, access site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, ≥5 cm diameter haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥4 g/dl without an overt source of bleeding, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥3 g/dl with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding or use of any blood product transfusion. Minor bleeding was defined as any observed bleeding event that did not meet the criteria as major. Minor bleeding occurred very commonly (  1/10) and major bleeding occurred commonly (  1/100 and &lt;1/10). Major bleeding rates are shown in Table 6 for the IIT population and Table 7 for the per protocol population (patients receiving clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid). Both major and minor bleeds were significantly less frequent with bivalirudin alone than the heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor and bivalirudin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor groups. Similar reductions in bleeding were observed in patients who were switched to bivalirudin from heparin-based therapies (N = 2,078). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Major bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath puncture site. Other less frequently observed bleeding sites with greater than 0.1% (uncommon) bleeding included 'other' puncture site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.

Thrombocytopenia was reported in 10 bivalirudin-treated patients participating in the ACUITY study (0.1%). The majority of these patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, and 6 out of the 10 patients also received a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Mortality among these patients was nil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The REPLACE-2 Trial (Patients undergoing PCI)

The following data is based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 6,000 patients undergoing PCI, half of whom were treated with bivalirudin (REPLACE-2). Adverse events were more frequent in females and in patients more than 65 years of age in both the bivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator groups compared to male or younger patients.

Approximately 30% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and 3% experienced an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system organ class in Table 1.

Platelets, bleeding and clotting In REPLACE-2, bleeding data were collected separately from adverse events. Major bleeding rates for the intent-to-treat trial population are shown in Table 6. Major bleeding was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: intracranial haemorrhage, retroperitoneal haemorrhage, blood loss leading to a transfusion of at least two units of whole blood or packed red blood cells, or bleeding resulting in a haemoglobin drop of more than 3 g/dl, or a fall in haemoglobin greater than 4 g/dl (or 12% of haematocrit) with no bleeding site identified. Minor haemorrhage was defined as any observed bleeding event that did not meet the criteria for a major haemorrhage. Minor bleeding occurred very commonly (  1/10) and major bleeding occurred commonly (  1/100 and &lt;1/10). Both minor and major bleeds were significantly less frequent with bivalirudin than the heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor comparator group. Major bleeding occurred most frequently at the sheath puncture site. Other less frequently observed bleeding sites with greater than 0.1% (uncommon) bleeding included 'other' puncture site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat. In REPLACE-2 thrombocytopenia occurred in 20 bivalirudin-treated patients (0.7%). The majority of these patients received concomitant acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel, and 10 out of 20 patients also received a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Mortality among these patients was nil. Acute cardiac events The HORIZONS Trial (Patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI) The following data are based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI; 1,800 patients were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 1,802 were randomised to heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Serious adverse reactions were reported more frequently in the heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa group than the bivalirudin treated group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A total of 55.1% of patients receiving bivalirudin experienced at least one adverse event and 8.7% experienced an adverse drug reaction. Adverse drug reactions for bivalirudin are listed by system organ class in Table 1.The incidence of stent thrombosis within the first 24 hours was 1.5% in patients receiving bivalirudin versus 0.3% in patients receiving UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (p=0.0002). Two deaths occurred after acute stent thrombosis, 1 in each arm of the study. The incidence of stent thrombosis between 24 hours and 30 days was 1. 2% in patients receiving bivalirudin versus 1.9% in patients receiving UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (p=0.1553). A total of 17 deaths occurred after subacute stent thrombosis, 3 in the bivalirudin arm and 14 in the UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa arm. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of stent thrombosis between treatment arms at 30 days (p=0.3257) and 1 year (p=0.7754).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Cases of overdose of up to 10 times the recommended dose have been reported in clinical trials. Single bolus doses of bivalirudin up to 7.5 mg/kg have also been reported. Bleeding has been observed in some reports of overdose.

In cases of overdose, treatment with bivalirudin should be immediately discontinued and the patient monitored closely for signs of bleeding.

In the event of major bleeding, treatment with bivalirudin should be immediately discontinued. There is no known antidote to bivalirudin, however, bivalirudin is haemo-dialysable. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, Direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE06. Mechanism of action Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor that binds both to the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite of fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently crosslinked framework that stabilises the thrombus. Thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. Bivalirudin inhibits each of these thrombin effects. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its activity, is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin, Arg 3 -Pro4, bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site function. Thus, bivalirudin initially acts as a complete non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, but transitions over time to become a competitive inhibitor enabling initially inhibited thrombin molecules to interact with other clotting substrates and to coagulation if required. In vitro studies have indicated that bivalirudin inhibits both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin. Bivalirudin remains active and is not neutralised by products of the platelet release reaction. In vitro studies have also shown that bivalirudin prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) thrombin time (TT) and pro-thrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentrationdependent manner and that bivalirudin does not induce a platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia/Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT/HITTS). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalirudin exhibits dose- and concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced as prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT. Intravenous administration of bivalirudin produces measurable anticoagulation within minutes.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The pharmacodynamic effects of bivalirudin may be assessed using measures of anticoagulation including the ACT. The ACT value is positively correlated with the dose and plasma concentration of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bivalirudin administered. Data from 366 patients indicates that the ACT is unaffected by concomitant treatment with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

In clinical studies bivalirudin has been shown to provide adequate anticoagulation during PCI procedures.

## The HORIZONS Trial (Patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI)

The HORIZONS trial was a prospective, dual arm, single blind, randomised, multi-centre trial to establish the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin in patients with STEMI undergoing a primary PCI strategy with stent implantation with either a slow release paclitaxel-eluding stent (TAXUS™) or an otherwise identical uncoated bare metal stent (Express2™). A total of 3,602 patients were randomised to receive either bivalirudin (1,800 patients) or unfractionated heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (1,802 patients).  All patients received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel with twice as many patients (approximately 64%) receiving a 600mg loading dose of clopidogrel than a 300mg loading dose of clopidogrel.  Approximately 66% of patients were pre-treated with unfractionated heparin. The dose of bivalirudin used in HORIZONS was the same as that used in the REPLACE-2 study (0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour infusion). A total of 92.9% of patients treated underwent primary PCI as their primary management strategy. The analysis and results for the HORIZONS trial at 30 days for the overall (ITT) population is shown in Table 2.Results at 1 year were consistent with results at 30 days. Bleeding definitions and outcomes from the HORIZONS trial are shown in Table 6. Table 2 . HORIZONS 30-day study results (intent-to-treat population) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## ACUITY Trial (Patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI)

The ACUITY trial was a prospective, randomised open-label, trial of bivalirudin with or without GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Arms B and C respectively) versus unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Arm A) in 13,819 high risk ACS patients.

In Arms B and C of the ACUITY trial, the recommended dose of bivalirudin was an initial postrandomisation intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h during angiography or as clinically warranted.

For patients undergoing PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg bivalirudin was administered and the rate of intravenous  infusion increased to 1.75 mg/kg/h. In Arm A of the ACUITY trial, UFH or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the management of ACS in patients with UA and NSTEMI. Patients in Arms A and B were also randomised to receive a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor either upfront at the time of randomization (prior to angiography) or at the time of PCI. A total of 356 (7.7%) of patients randomised to Arm C also received a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. High risk patient characteristics of the ACUITY population that mandated angiography within 72 hours were balanced across the three treatment arms. Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischaemia, approximately 70% had dynamic ECG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, approximately 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of patients underwent angiography within 72 hours. Following angiographic assessment, patients were triaged to either medical management (33%), PCI (56%) or CABG (11%). Additional anti-platelet therapy utilised in the study included acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. The primary analysis and results for ACUITY at 30-days and 1 year for the overall (ITT) population and for the patients that received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel as per protocol (pre-angiography or pre-PCI) are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

## Bleeding Definitions

REPLACE-2 major bleeding was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: intracranial haemorrhage, retroperitoneal haemorrhage, blood loss leading to a transfusion of at least two units of whole blood or packed red blood cells, or bleeding resulting in a haemoglobin drop of more than 3 g/dl, or a fall in haemoglobin greater than 4 g/dl (or 12% of haematocrit) with no bleeding site identified. ACUITY major bleeding was defined as any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, access site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, ≥5 cm diameter haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥4 g/dl without an overt source of bleeding, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥3 g/dl with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding, use of any blood product transfusion. Major bleeding in the HORIZONS study was also defined using the ACUITY scale. TIMI major bleeding was defined as intracranial bleeding or a decrease in haemoglobin concentration ≥5 g/dl.

## Absorption

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-thrombosis syndrome (HIT/HITTS) Clinical trials in a small number of patients have provided limited information about the use of Angiox in patients with HIT/HITTS. Paediatric population In clinical study TMC-BIV-07-01, the pharmacodynamic response as measured by ACT was consistent with adult studies. The ACT increased in all patients - from neonates to older children as well as adults- with increasing bivalirudin concentrations. The ACT vs concentration data suggest a trend for a lower concentration response curve for adults as compared to older children (6 years to &lt; 16 years) and younger children (2 years to &lt;6 years), and for older children compared to infants (31 days to &lt;24 months) and neonates (birth to 30 days). Pharmacodynamic models indicated that this effect is due to a higher baseline ACT in neonates and infants than in older children. However, the maximal ACT values for all groups (adults and all paediatric groups) converge at a similar level near an ACT of 400 seconds. The clinical utility of ACT in neonates and children should be considered with caution considering their developmental haematological state. Thrombotic (9/110, 8.2%) and major bleeding events (2/110, 1.8%) were observed in the study. Other frequently reported adverse events were decreased pedal pulse, catheter site haemorrhage, abnormal pulse, and nausea (8.2%, 7.3%, 6.4% and 5.5%, respectively). Five patients had a post-baseline nadir platelet count of &lt;150,000 cells/mm 3 , representing a ≥50% decrease in platelets from baseline. All 5 events were associated with additional cardiac procedures employing heparin anticoagulation (n=3) or with infections (n=2). A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, and an Exposure and Adverse Event Assessment Model based on the data from this study determined that in paediatric patients, use of the adult dosing with plasma levels similar to that achieved in adults was associated with lower levels of thrombotic events with no impact on bleeding events (see section 4.2). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin have been evaluated and found to be linear in patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and in patients with ACS. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The bioavailability of bivalirudin for intravenous use is complete and immediate. The mean steadystate concentration of bivalirudin following a constant intravenous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h is 12.4 µg/ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Bivalirudin is rapidly distributed between plasma and extracellular fluid. The steady-state volume of distribution is 0.1 l/kg. Bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells.

## Biotransformation

As a peptide, bivalirudin is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino acids, with subsequent recycling of the amino acid in the body pool. Bivalirudin is metabolized by proteases, including thrombin. The primary metabolite resulting from the cleavage of Arg3-Pro4 bond of the Nterminal sequence by thrombin is not active because of the loss of affinity to the catalytic active site of thrombin. About 20% of bivalirudin is excreted unchanged in the urine.

| Renal function (GFR)                       |   Clearance (ml/min/kg) | Half-life (minutes)   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Normal renal function (≥ 90ml/min)         |                     3.4 | 25                    |
| Mild renal impairment (60-89 ml/min)       |                     3.4 | 22                    |
| Moderate renal impairment (30-59 ml/min)   |                     2.7 | 34                    |
| Severe renal impairment (10-29 ml/min)     |                     2.8 | 57                    |
| Dialysis dependent patients (off-dialysis) |                     1   | 3.5 hours             |

Elimination The concentration-time profile following intravenous administration is well described by a twocompartment model. Elimination follows a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25  12 minutes in patients with normal renal function. The corresponding clearance is about 3.4  0.5 ml/min/kg. Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment but are not expected to be altered because bivalirudin is not metabolized by liver enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 isozymes. Renal Insufficiency The systemic clearance of bivalirudin decreases with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The clearance of bivalirudin is similar in patients with normal renal function and those with mild renal impairment. Clearance is reduced by approximately 20% in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and 80% in dialysis-dependent patients (Table 8). Table 8. Pharmacokinetic parameters for bivalirudin in patients with normal and impaired renal function Elderly Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in elderly patients as part of a renal pharmacokinetic study. Dose adjustments for this age group should be on the basis of renal function, see section 4.2.

## Gender

There are no gender effects in the pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

In a clinical trial of 110 paediatric patients (neonates to &lt;16 years of age) undergoing percutaneous intravascular procedures, the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of bivalirudin was evaluated [TMC-BIV-07-01]. The approved adult weight-based intravenous bolus dose of 0.75 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/hour was studied and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis found a response similar to that of adults, although weight-normalized clearance (ml/min/kg) of bivalirudin was higher in neonates than in older children and decreased with increasing age.

## 5.3 Pre-clinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or toxicity to reproduction. Toxicity in animals upon repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure levels of up to 10 times the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to exaggerated pharmacological effects. Comparison of the single and repeated dose studies revealed that toxicity was related primarily to duration of exposure. All the undesirable effects, primary and secondary, resulting from excessive pharmacological activity were reversible. Undesirable effects that resulted from prolonged physiological stress in response to a non-homeostatic state of coagulation were not seen after short exposure comparable to that in clinical use, even at much higher doses. Bivalirudin is intended for short-term administration and therefore no data on the long-term carcinogenic potential of bivalirudin are available. However, bivalirudin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in standard assays for such effects. 6.

OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION  Periodic Safety Update Reports The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. D. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  Risk Management Plan (RMP) The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. An updated RMP should be submitted:  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  Additional risk minimisation measures In order to ensure the correct use of Angiox and to avoid medication errors, the MAH shall ensure that all prescribers who are expected to prescribe/use Angiox are provided with training on dosing and administration. Educational material includes a slide deck presentation, dosing cards as described in the risk minimization measures in the RMP, and a copy of the SmPC. The educational materials will be used in all member states for both initial training and re-education in the event of reports of bolus only dosing without subsequent infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The slide deck will contain the following key information:

-  Approved dose in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): The licensed and approved dosing regimen of Angiox is an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of 0.75 mg/kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at 1.75 mg/kg/hour for at least the duration of the PCI.
-  Angiox must be administered as a bolus dose followed immediately by an intravenous infusion, even if a short PCI procedure is planned. Do not use without dilution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  For patients undergoing PCI, bivalirudin MUST be administered initially as an intravenous bolus followed immediately by an infusion. This dosing regimen is required to achieve and maintain the plasma concentration required for effective ischaemic protection during PCI. Based on the short half-life of bivalirudin (25 minutes), failure to initiate an infusion following the Angiox bolus will result in a plasma concentration that is below the required level within minutes
-  In the ImproveR registry bolus dosing (without subsequent infusion) was observed in EU clinical practice. This dosing pattern was associated with increased in-hospital ischaemic events (MACE). The safety and efficacy of a bolus without subsequent infusion dose of ANGIOX has not been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.

 Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients.  In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/ min) the infusion rate should be reduced to 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose remains 0.75 mg/kg (or 0.5 mg/kg in patients who proceed to PCI after receiving bivalirudin pre-cath lab (UA/NSTEMI)). The dosing cards will contain the following key information:  Angiox must be administered as a bolus dose followed immediately by an intravenous infusion, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.  Do not use bivalirudin without first diluting it.  Tabulated information on dosing by body weight of patient.  Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients.  In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/ min) the infusion rate should be reduced to 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose remains 0.75 mg/kg; or 0.5 mg/kg in patients who proceed to PCI after receiving bivalirudin pre-cath lab (UA/NSTEMI).  Brief information on preparation and administration instructions. The MAH shall agree on the dosing card together with a communication plan, with the National Competent Authority in each Member State prior to distribution in the Member State. The use of the Angiox dosing card is recommended as a quick reference guide. Healthcare providers are recommended to refer to the Angiox Summary of Product Characteristics for full information on dosing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before using Angiox.

-  if bleeding occurs (if this happens, treatment with Angiox will be stopped). Throughout your treatment, the doctor will check you for any signs of bleeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  if you have been treated before with medicines similar to Angiox (e.g. lepirudin).
-  before the start of the injection or infusion, the doctor will tell you about the signs of allergic reaction. Such a reaction is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
-  if you are having radiation treatment in the vessels that supply blood to the heart (treatment called beta or gamma brachytherapy).

After being treated with Angiox for a cardiac event, you should stay in the hospital for at least 24 hours and you should be monitored for any symptoms or signs similar to the ones that remind you of your cardiac event and resulted in your hospitalisation.

## Children and adolescents

 if you are a child (less than 18 years of age), this medicine is not appropriate for you. Other medicines and Angiox tell your doctor  if you are taking, or have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  If you are taking blood thinners or medicines to prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or antithrombotics e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor). these medicines may increase the risk of side effects such as bleeding when given at the same time as Angiox. Your warfarin blood test result (INR test) may be affected by Angiox. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Angiox should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary. Your doctor will decide whether or not this treatment is appropriate for you. If you are breast-feeding, the doctor will decide whether Angiox should be used. Driving and using machines the effects of this medicine are known to be short-term. Angiox is only given when a patient is in hospital. It is, therefore, unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. Angiox contains sodium This medicine contains less than 23 mg of sodium per vial, which means that it is essentially 'sodiumfree'. 3. HOW TO USE ANGIOX Medicinal product no longer authorised

Your treatment with Angiox will be supervised by a doctor. The doctor will decide how much Angiox you receive, and will prepare the medicine.

The dose given depends on your weight and on the kind of treatment you are being given.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dosage

## For patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are treated medically the recommended starting dose is :

-  0.1 mg/kg body weight as an intravenous injection, followed by an infusion (drip) into vein of 0.25 mg/kg body weight per hour for up to 72 hours.

If, after this, you then need percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment, the dosage will be increased to:

 0.5 mg/kg body weight for the intravenous injection, followed by an infusion into vein of 1.75 mg/kg body weight, per hour for the duration of the PCI.  When this treatment is finished, the infusion may go back to 0.25 mg/kg body weight per hour for an additional 4 to 12 hours. If you need to have a coronary artery bypass graft operation, treatment with bivalirudin will either be stopped one hour before the operation or an additional dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight will be given by injection followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight per hour for the duration of surgery. For patients starting with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) the recommended dose is:  0.75 mg/kg body weight as an intravenous injection, followed immediately by an infusion (drip) into vein of 1.75 mg/kg body weight, per hour for at least the duration of the PCI. The intravenous infusion may continue at this dose for up to 4 hours after the PCI and for STEMI patients (those with a severe type of heart attack) it should continue at this dose for up to 4 hours. The infusion may be followed by an infusion at a lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight for an additional 4 to 12 hours. If you have kidney problems, the dose of Angiox may need to be reduced. In the elderly, if their kidney function is decreased, the dose may need to be reduced. The doctor will decide for how long you should be treated. Angiox is for injection, followed by infusion (drip), into a vein (never into a muscle). This is administered and supervised by a doctor experienced in caring for patients with heart disease. If you receive more of this medicine than you should Your doctor will decide how to treat you, including stopping the drug and monitoring for signs of ill effects. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you get any of the following, potentially serious, side effects:

- o while you are in hospital: tell the doctor or nurse immediately -
- o after you've left hospital: contact your doctor directly or go immediately to the Emergency Department of your nearest hospital -

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common, (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) serious side effect of treatment with Angiox, is major bleeding which could occur anywhere inside the body (e.g. stomach, digestive system (including vomiting blood or passing blood with the stools), abdomen, lungs, groin, bladder, heart, eye, ear, nose or brain). This may, rarely , result in a stroke or be fatal. Swelling or pain in the groin or the arm, back pain, bruising, headache, coughing blood, pink or red urine, sweating, feeling faint or sick or dizzy due to low blood pressure may be signs of internal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur when Angiox is used in combination with other anticoagulant or antithrombotic medicines (see section 2 'Taking other medicines').

-  Bleeding and bruising at the puncture site (after PCI treatment) may be painful. Rarely this may require surgery to repair the blood vessel in the groin (fistula, pseudoaneurysm) (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) the number of blood platelets may be low which can worsen any bleeding. Gum bleeding (uncommon, may affect up to 1 in 100 people) is usually not serious.
-  Angina or chest pain

 Allergic reactions,- are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) and usually not serious but can become severe under some circumstances, and in rare cases may be fatal due to low blood pressure (shock). They may begin with limited symptoms such as itching, redness of the skin, rash or small bumps on the skin. Occasionally, reactions can be more severe with throat itching, throat tightening, swelling of the eyes, face, tongue or lips, high pitched whistling during inhaling (stridor), difficulty breathing or exhaling (wheezes).  Thrombosis (blood clot) is an uncommon side effect (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) which may result in serious or fatal complications such as heart attack. Thrombosis includes coronary artery thrombosis (blood clot in the heart arteries or within a stent being felt as a heart attack which can also be fatal) and/or thrombosis in the catheter, both of which are rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). If you get any of the following, (potentially less serious), side effects: o while you are in hospital: tell the doctor or nurse o after you've left hospital: first seek advice from your doctor. If you cannot get access to your doctor go immediately to the Emergency Department of your nearest hospital Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  Minor bleeding Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  Anaemia (a low blood cell count)  Haematoma (bruising) Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting (being sick) Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people)  INR test (warfarin blood test result) increased (see Section 2, Other medicines and Angiox) Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Slow heartbeat
-  Rapid heartbeat
-  Shortness of breath
-  Reperfusion injury (no or slow reflow): impaired flow in the heart arteries after they have been reopened

## This leaflet was last revised in:

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Healthcare professionals should refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for full prescribing information. Angiox is indicated as an anticoagulant in adult patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI. Angiox is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) planned for urgent or early intervention. Angiox should be administered with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. Instructions for preparation Aseptic procedures should be used for the preparation and administration of Angiox. Add 5 ml sterile water for injections to one vial of Angiox and swirl gently until completely dissolved and the solution is clear. Withdraw 5 ml from the vial, and further dilute in a total volume of 5% 50 ml of glucose solution for injection, or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to give a final bivalirudin concentration of 5 mg/ml. The reconstituted/diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration.  Solutions containing particulate matter should not be used. The reconstituted/diluted solution will be a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Incompatibilities The following medicinal products should not be administered in the same intravenous line as bivalirudin since they result in haze formation, micro-particulate formation or gross precipitation; alteplase, amiodarone HCl, amphotericin B, chlorpromazine hydrochloride (HCl), diazepam, prochlorperazine edisylate, reteplase, streptokinase and vancomycin HCl. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The following six medicinal products show dose-concentration incompatibilities with bivalirudin. See section 6.2 for the summary of compatible and incompatible concentrations of these compounds. The medicinal products incompatible with bivalirudin at higher concentrations are: dobutamine hydrochloride, famotidine, haloperidol lactate, labetalol hydrochloride, lorazepam and promethazine HCl.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Contraindications

Angiox is contraindicated in patients with:

-  a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to hirudins
-  active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/or irreversible coagulation disorders
-  severe uncontrolled hypertension
-  subacute bacterial endocarditis



severe renal impairment (GFR&lt;30 ml/min) and in dialysis-dependent patients.

(

see section 4.3 of SmPC).

For patients who proceed to CABG surgery on pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until 1 hour prior to surgery after which the infusion should be discontinued and the patient treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Posology Patients undergoing PCI, including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI The recommended dose of bivalirudin for patients undergoing PCI is an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour for at least the duration of the procedure. The infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour may be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight/hour for an additional 4 - 12 hours as clinically necessary. In STEMI patients the infusion of 1.75 mg/kg body weight/hour should be continued for up to 4 hours post-PCI and continued at a reduced dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h for an additional 4 - 12 hours as clinically necessary (see section 4.4). Patients should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia. Patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevated myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) The recommended starting dose of bivalirudin for medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h. Patients who are to be medically managed may continue the infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for up to 72 hours. If the medically managed patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of bivalirudin should be administered before the procedure and the infusion increased to 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure. Following PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg/kg/h may be resumed for 4 to 12 hours as clinically necessary. For patients who proceed to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery off pump, the intravenous infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until the time of surgery. Just prior to surgery, a 0.5 mg/kg bolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75 mg/kg/h intravenous infusion for the duration of the surgery. Medicinal product no longer authorised

To ensure appropriate administration of bivalirudin, the completely dissolved, reconstituted and diluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration (see section 6.6). The bolus dose should be administered by a rapid intravenous push to ensure that the entire bolus reaches the patient before the start of the procedure.

Intravenous infusion lines should be primed with bivalirudin to ensure continuity of drug infusion after delivery of the bolus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The infusion dose should be initiated immediately after the bolus dose is administered, ensuring delivery to the patient prior to the procedure, and continued uninterrupted for the duration of the procedure. The safety and efficacy of a bolus dose of bivalirudin without the subsequent infusion has not been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.

An increase in the activated clotting time (ACT) may be used as an indication that a patient has received bivalirudin.

## Renal insufficiency

Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR&lt;30 ml/min) and also in dialysis-dependent patients (see section 4.3).

In patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency, the ACS dose (0.1 mg/kg bolus/0.25 mg/kg/h infusion) should not be adjusted. Patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml/min) undergoing PCI (whether being treated with bivalirudin for ACS or not) should receive a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg/kg/h. The bolus dose should not be changed from the posology described under ACS or PCI above. Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed. (For full information on posology see section 4.2 of SmPC) Shelf life 4 years Reconstituted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2-8 o C. Store in a refrigerator (2 o C -8 o C). Do not freeze. Diluted solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25 o C. Do not store above 25  C. Do not freeze.
