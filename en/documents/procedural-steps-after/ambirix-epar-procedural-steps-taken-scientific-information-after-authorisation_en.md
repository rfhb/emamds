| II/0077   | Update of section 6.6 of the SmPC in order to improve the re-suspension instructions following receipt of customers' complaints with regards to unusual vaccine appearance and based on user testing results. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.1, to include some corrections and to align the wording across combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines (i.e. Twinrix Adult, Twinrix Paediatric and Ambirix). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 10/11/2016   | 09/10/2017 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Following receipt of customers' complaints with regards to 'unusual vaccine appearance' for hepatitis A and B vaccines often described as 'cloudy vaccine' or 'particles in vaccine', the MAH initiated an investigation into these complaints. The aluminium salt used as adjuvant can settle during storage and form an insoluble pellet which can break into particles if not sufficiently re-suspended prior to administration of the vaccine. The MAH therefore proposed to improve the re-suspension instructions intended for health care professionals, based on the results of a user testing, in order to obtain a uniform hazy white suspension prior to administration. |

| II/0062   | Update of section 5.1 of Ambirix SmPC with new assay (CLIA) data for the persistence of the anti-HBs antibody response ten years after primary vaccination. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. Finally, minor editorial amendments are made throughout the PI. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                  | 24/07/2014   | 08/07/2015 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Although the results of the retesting with the anti-HBs CLIA showed that the percentage of subjects having an anti-HBs antibody concentration > 10mIU/ml tends to be lower than with the initial ELISA test (77.3% versus 81.7%), this 4.4% difference observed at Year 10 post-primary vaccination is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance, as an anamnestic response was obtained in all subjects following a challenge dose. The persistence of antibody 10 years after the primary vaccination is still demonstrated for the majority of subjects and the immunogenicity profile is considered unchanged. |

The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred around the age of 15 years, with females having more than twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with secondary injuries were reported most frequently in children and adolescents. Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC.
