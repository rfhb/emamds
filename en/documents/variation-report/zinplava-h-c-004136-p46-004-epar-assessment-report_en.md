## 1. Introduction

On 24 October 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Zinplava (Study P001), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that Study P001 (a Phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multisite, double-blind trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab in paediatric participants from 1 to &lt;18 years of age receiving antibacterial drug treatment for Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI)) is part of a clinical development programme. An extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by Q1/2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Paediatric participants in P001 were administered bezlotoxumab identical in formulation to commercially available bezlotoxumab:

Zinplava 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. Each mL of concentrate contains 25 mg bezlotoxumab. One 40 mL vial contains 1,000 mg of bezlotoxumab.

## CHMP comment

The planned variation will also include an update to the smaller volume single does vial containing 625 mg/25 mL (25mg/mL). The vial size contains the same concentration of the currently marketed vial (1000mg/ mL) [25mg/ mL)] with the only difference between the smaller and larger vials being the total volume held (25mL and 40mL, respectively).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for Study P001.

| Objective: To characterize bezlotoxumab PK in 2 age cohorts (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years; Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years) of pediatric participants to support dose selection in this population. Hypothesis: The area under the concentration-time curve from O to infinity (A UC0-inf) of bezlotoxumab after treatment of 2 age cohorts of pediatric participants (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years; Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years) with a single infusion of bezlotoxumab is similar when compared with the AUCO-inf of bezlotoxumab after treatment of adult participants with a single infusion of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab, a dose demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in adults. That is, the true geometric mean ratios (GMRs, pediatric participants/adults) for AUCO-inf of bezlotoxumab are contained in the clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) in each of the age cohorts. | The AUC0-inf will be determined for each age cohort from bezlotoxumab serum concentration data.                                                    |
| Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab as compared with a single infusion of placebo through 12 weeks following infusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Proportion of participants experiencing AEs Proportion of participants discontinuing study medication due to AEs                                   |

## Sample size

The planned sample size was 192 participants, which was reduced to a minimum of 140 participants based on a review of blinded safety data that supported the determination that enrolment of additional participants was not needed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MK-6072 in paediatric patients.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Eligible participants were stratified by age at randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to &lt;18 years of age, Age Cohort 2: 1 to &lt;12 years of age).

## Statistical Methods

The primary population for noncompartmental PK analysis was the per-protocol population (PP), which consisted of a subset of 91 participants who received bezlotoxumab and who had at least 4 post-dose PK samples. AUC0-inf data were natural log transformed and compared to historical adult data using an analysis of variance model with a factor for group (paediatric participants and adults). Separate models were used for each paediatric cohort. A point estimate of the GMR (pediatric participants/adults) of bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf with 90% confidence interval (CI) was generated from the model for each cohort. The 90% CIs of the GMRs were compared using prespecified clinical comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6), to determine if the AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab in each cohort was similar to the AUC0-inf in adults.

Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population, which included all randomized participants who received study intervention. The primary safety objective was addressed by the Tier 2 endpoints: proportion of participants with any adverse event (AE), any intervention-related AE, any serious adverse event (SAE), any intervention-related SAE, infusion-related reactions; the proportion of participants who discontinued study intervention due to an AE; AE (specific preferred terms), system organ classes with frequency ≥ 12 participants in the bezlotoxumab arm and or ≥ 2 participants in the placebo arm. These analyses were performed using the Miettinen and Nurminen asymptotic method (1985) and 95% CIs were provided.

Secondary efficacy analyses were performed using a 2-sided 95% CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by age cohort (12 to &lt;18 years of age, 1 to &lt;12 years of age) using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weight to evaluate the treatment differences for (1) CDI recurrence, (2) sustained clinical response, and (3) CDI recurrence among participants at high risk of CDI recurrence within 12 weeks of study medication infusion.

## Pharmacokinetics

To address the primary objective of the study, the PK of bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg was characterized in paediatric participants in 2 age cohorts.

Serum samples of bezlotoxumab were collected following a single IV dose from samples at Day 1, Day 10, Week 4 (±3 days), and Weeks 8 and 12 (±5 days) after the end of infusion and analysed using a validated assay to measure bezlotoxumab concentration. Exposure (AUC0-inf) in paediatric participants were considered to be similar to those in adults if the observed GMR (paediatric participants/adults) for AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab contained in the clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6). Other PK endpoints of interest were Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, Vd and CL. PK sampling was planned for all participants (Panels A and B) and confirmation of dose selection for paediatric patients (1 to &lt;18 years) was based on the final PK analysis population, including those evaluated in each of the IAs. The recommended adult dose of 10 mg/kg was initially evaluated for both age cohorts in Panel A of P001. Once Panel A was completed for each age cohort, an interim PK analysis was performed to confirm the dose for Panel B.

The results of this analysis supported the use of the 10 mg/kg dose in Panel B. The 90% CI of paediatric/adult GMR AUC0-inf was within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6) for each age cohort in Panel A. At the completion of the study, PK across Panels A and B was assessed relative to the clinical comparability bounds established for AUC0-inf in adults. The 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMRs serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf were within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for each of the paediatric age cohorts, supporting the primary hypothesis that AUC0-inf in paediatric participants is similar to that in adults following administration of a 10 mg/kg dosage regimen [Table 2.5: 2].

The recommended adult dose of 10 mg/kg was initially evaluated for both age cohorts in Panel A of P001. Once Panel A was completed for each age cohort, an interim PK analysis was performed to confirm the dose for Panel B. The results of this analysis supported the use of the 10 mg/kg dose in Panel B. The 90% CI of paediatric/adult GMR AUC0-inf was within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6) for each age cohort in Panel A. At the completion of the study, PK across Panels A and B was assessed relative to the clinical comparability bounds established for AUC0inf in adults. The 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMRs serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf were within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for each of the paediatric age cohorts, supporting the primary hypothesis that AUC0-inf in paediatric participants is similar to that in adults following administration of a 10 mg/kg dosage regimen [Table 2.5: 2]. PK data and noncompartmental PK analysis indicate a slightly lower exposure in each paediatric age cohort compared to the adult population. This is likely to be attributed to the higher weight-normalized clearance in children (see figures below).

## Immunogenicity:

Two participants (2%) had a low magnitude titre ( ≤ 25x) ADA positive response to bezlotoxumab and no samples were positive for Nab.

## Efficacy results

Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints in P001; the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons The efficacy analyses for this study were conducted using the mITT population [Table 2.5:1]. The main analysis for CDI recurrence was based on a subset of the mITT population consisting of participants who achieved an initial clinical response.

The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI recurrence was low and comparable between intervention groups [Table 2.5: 3].

No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the percentage of participants with CDI recurrence when analysed across subgroups (i.e., subgroups of age cohort, sex, race, primary treatment for baseline CDI episode, or adjunctive treatment [metronidazole IV] for baseline CDI episode) compared with the overall population.

## Further findings were:

- The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 11.2%); placebo: 14.7%).
- The percentage of participants in the mITT population who had sustained clinical response was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 83.7%; placebo: 82.9%). There were no clinically meaningful differences observed in sustained clinical response across the subgroups analysed compared with the overall population
- The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI recurrence and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab:12.1%; placebo: 15.2%).
- The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 82.5%; placebo: 82.4%).

## Assessor's comment

Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints in P001: the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons. Nevertheless, the outcome is unexpected and sheds some doubts on the efficacy in the target population and the validity of the assumed extrapolation concept that is based on exposure matching. The data will be scrutinised in the context of the forthcoming type II variation.

## Safety results

The evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab compared with placebo following a single infusion through 12 weeks was a primary objective of the study.

Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collection of AE data, clinical laboratory evaluations, and vital sign measurements. Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population. These analyses were performed using the M&amp;N asymptotic method (1985).

All participants who received study intervention completed a single infusion of either 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab or placebo, therefore the extent of exposure was the same for all participants.

## Adverse events

Most participants experienced AEs during the 12-week follow-up period and most of these AEs were considered not related to study intervention by the investigator [Table 2.5: 4].

A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. Most of these interventionrelated AEs were mild in intensity and resolved.

The most frequently reported AEs (reported for ≥ 20% participants in either intervention group) were: febrile neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 21.5%, placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (17.8%, 30.6%), headache (14.0%, 22.2%), and vomiting (13.1%, 22.2%) [Table 12-2].

Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column.

A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report tile, after romding.

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 25.0 was usedinthe reporting of this study. This table includes adverse events that occuwred from Day 1 through Week 12 (Day 85 ±5 days).

Source: [P001MK.6072: adam-adsl; adae]

Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week study period (5 in the bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). None of the deaths were considered related to study intervention by the investigator.

There were 2 intervention-related SAEs (both in the bezlotoxumab group); intussusception and nausea (each reported in 1 participant) and both events resolved.

Two participants (1 in each intervention group) experienced a protocol-defined infusion related AE; both AEs were of decreased blood pressure, were mild in intensity and resolved.

No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE.

## Laboratory findings

No participants had laboratory values that met the predefined ECI criteria for hepatic test abnormalities requiring additional evaluation of an underlying aetiology.

The percentage of participants who had chemistry and haematology laboratory findings that met predetermined criteria was generally comparable between intervention groups [ Table 14.3-14, 14.315]. There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital sign measurements for either intervention group.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The primary objective of the study was to characterize bezlotoxumab PK in children and adolescents (1 to &lt; 18 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed from study intervention through the 12-week follow-up (Day 85 ± 5 days). The study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons.

The exposure (AUC0-inf) of bezlotoxumab, following a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg in paediatric patients (1 to &lt;18 years of age) is comparable to that in adult patients. Non-compartmental PK analysis and statistical analysis indicate that the observed GMR (paediatric participants/adults) for AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab in different paediatric age groups was not exceeding the clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6). There was a trend in decreasing exposure with decrease in age, that might plausibly be attributed to the increase in weight-normalised clearance.  Thus, the MAH concluded that the results are supporting the determination that the efficacy conclusion in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population (1 to &lt;18 years of age). This conclusion cannot be shared. In principle, given the results of the pk evaluation it could be expected that the paediatric patients show the clinical results as the adult patients. However, all clinical endpoints showed comparable results between the groups. The study failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy of bezlotoxumab in paediatric patients with Clostridium difficile infection. Although the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons, the outcome is unexpected. This sheds some doubts on the efficacy in the target population and on the validity of the assumed extrapolation concept that is currently based on exposure matching and exposure/response similarity between adults and paediatric subjects at all age groups. The data will be scrutinised in the context of the forthcoming type II variation.

The evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab compared with placebo following a single infusion through 12 weeks was a primary objective of the study.

A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group (8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. There was a lower incidence of SAEs in the bezlotoxumab (53.3%) group compared with the placebo (80.6%) group, with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were considered not related to study intervention. SAEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator were reported for 2 participants (intussusception and nausea, 1 participant each, both in the bezlotoxumab group). Given the above, the favourable safety profile of bezlotoxumab is confirmed.

Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week study period (5 in the bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). The MAH claimed that none of the deaths were considered related to study intervention by the investigator.

No action is required, however the MAH intends to submit an EoI to include treatment of paediatric patients. The data will be scrutinised in the context of the extension of indication. Considering the unexpected efficacy outcome, the MAH might consider gaining further evidence to support the paediatric indication.
