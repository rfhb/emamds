## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 29 May 2025 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                              | Type              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| C.I.6.a                  | C.I.6.a Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Variation type II |

Extension of indication to include active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults 18 years of age and older for AREXVY, based on results from study 222253 (RSV OA=ADJ-025); this is a Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immune response and to evaluate the safety of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk of respiratory syncytial virus disease, compared to older adults ≥60 years of age. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 3.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) P/0508/2023 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0508/2023 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

Not applicable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific advice

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 24 March 2022 EMA/SA/000076659. The Scientific Advice pertained to (non-) clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Problem statement

## Disease or condition

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections in people of all ages. RSV infection does not confer long-term immunity. Therefore, reinfection with RSV occurs throughout life and is common in all age groups. Usually, re-infections manifest as common acute upper respiratory tract infections. However, in more vulnerable individuals (e.g. immunocompromised persons, persons with co-morbidities, and older adults), re-infections can also lead to more severe diseases, such as lower respiratory tract disease (LTRD). Although severe disease occurs more commonly in these aforementioned groups, in young healthy individuals an infection can also have a significant health impact. Approximately 22% of influenza-like illness in 2529-year-olds has been attributed to RSV (Zambon 2001), and such cases have been reported to result

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in persistent shortness of breath and fatigue up to 4 weeks following illness (Hall et al 1978). In healthy adults, it has been reported that 38% of the RSV infections result in work absence (Hall, 2000).

## State the claimed the therapeutic indication

Arexvy was authorised in June 2023 in adults 60 years of age and older based on efficacy data from an interim analysis of a single pivotal phase 3 trial, supported by multiple phase 3 clinical studies (EMEA/H/C/006054/0000). During a subsequent extension of indication (EMEA/H/C/006054/II/0008), study RSV OA=ADJ-018 was submitted, which was an immune bridging study to include adults 50 through 59 years of age who are at increased risk for RSV disease.

The current indication approved by the EMA for RSVPreF3 Arexvy is:

Arexvy is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus in:

- -adults 60 years of age and older
- -adults 50 through 59 years of age who are at increased risk for RSV disease.

The sought after indication for RSVPreF3 Arexvy is:

Arexvy is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults 18 years of age and older.

## Epidemiology

Incidence rates of RSV disease are frequently derived from population -based influenza surveillance systems in adults ≥65 YOA. Younger adult populations have more limited epidemiological data available. The available epidemiological data for this age group describes a lower incidence of RSV morbidity and mortality than in adults with higher age, and that most hospitalisations in this group occur in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such (e.g. obesity, diabetes, or chronic cardiopulmonary, renal, or immunocompromising conditions). However, the burden of RSV in this younger adult population is most likely underestimated due to a number of factors including undertesting, delayed testing, and lower viral load in adults. (Cong, BMC Med, 2023). Moreover, diagnostic testing is often not performed outside of a hospitalized setting as therapeutic options for RSV is purely supportive for adults.

A retrospective cohort study drew on data from six European databases in order to identify (among others) the hospitalization rates and mortality rates related to RSV (Darwin-EU Age-specific incidence rates of RSV-related disease in Europe). In the general population, the incidence rate of RSV-related hospitalisation was 35 (95% CI, 34 - 36) per 100,000 person-years (PY), with higher incidence rates observed in older adults(≥ 60 years) (28 per 100,000 PY, 95% CI, 27 - 29), and lower in those aged 18 to 59 years, with a rate of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9 - 2.2) per 100,000 PY.

In younger healthy adults, RSV may cause cold or influenza-like symptoms. Although hospitalization rates are significantly lower than those at opposite ends of the age spectrum, the estimates of RSV infection incidence remain substantial. Approximately 22% of influenza-like illness in 25-29-year-olds has been attributed to RSV (Zambon 2001), and such cases have been reported to result in persistent shortness of breath and fatigue up to 4 weeks following illness (Hall et al 1978). In healthy adults, it has been reported that 38% of the RSV infections result in work absence (Hall, 2000).

## Aetiology and pathogenesis

RSV is a single-stranded RNA virus mainly transmitted via contact with aerosols from an infected host. The virus initially replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and may subsequently migrate to the lower respiratory tract. The incubation period is usually between 3-7 days. Neutrophils infiltrate the airways, leading to complications such as bronchiolitis.

## Clinical presentation

Symptomatic RSV usually starts as an upper respiratory tract infection, that can lead to more serious disease by involving the lower respiratory tract. The most common symptoms include nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, sore throat, cough, sputum, dyspnoea, wheezing, rhonchi, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen saturation. In addition, systemic signs include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache and decreased appetite

## Management

## Treatment

Treatment for RSV in adults is limited to supportive care consisting of supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids and bronchodilators. In addition, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed in patients with asthma or COPD.

## Prevention

Since 2023, there have been substantial advances in the prevention of RSV due to the approval of Arexvy and two additional vaccines. mRESVIA is approved for prevention of RSV-LRTD in adults aged ≥ 60 years, and adults 18-59 years who are at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV. Abrysvo is approved in adults ≥ 18 years regardless of co -morbidity status. In addition, Abrysvo is approved for passive protection in infants following maternal immunization during pregnancy.

## Unmet need

Despite new vaccination possibilities for the prevention of RSV, the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease remains high.

## 2.1.2. About the product

The RSV PreFusion protein F3 Older Adult vaccine (referred to as RSVPreF3 OA, or Arexvy), was developed for prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV, A and B in older adults. The RSVPreF3 antigen is an engineered version of the RSV F surface glycoprotein, i.e., a trimeric RSV F protein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation. The finished product of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine is presented as a preservativefree powder and suspension for injection containing 120μg of RSVPreF3 antigen (powder) adjuvanted with AS01E (suspension).

## 2.1.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

## Compliance with CHMP guidance

The most relevant CHMP guidelines applied:

- 'Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines' (CHMP/VWP/164653/05, Rev.1)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 'Guideline on the clinical evaluation of medicinal products indicated for the prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease' (EMA/CHMP/257022/2017)

## Scientific Advice

In EMA/SA/000076659 (24/03/2022) the MAH revealed plans to conduct study RSV OA=ADJ-014, which used an immunobridging approach to support use in 18-59 YOA, both with and without comorbidities. Although the trial design proposed by the MAH at the time differs slightly from the trial in the current application, the following advice is relevant for ADJ-025.

- if vaccine efficacy is demonstrated in accordance with the predefined criterion in the pivotal efficacy study in subjects aged from 60 years, an approval for a younger adult population could be based on immunobridging accompanied by safety data.
- The focus of the assessment of non-inferiority based on the GMT ratios is appropriate in a population that is expected to have been primed by natural exposure(s) to RSV.
- Comparisons of the percentages with at least a 4-fold increase in NA titre from pre- to postvaccination should be added as secondary analyses (i.e. in each of HA and AIR and for each of RSV-A and B).

## 2.1.4. General comments on compliance with GCP

The MAH claims all clinical studies carried out in countries outside the European Union (EU) met the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. The clinical studies are conducted by or on behalf of GSK in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures, w hich conform to the requirements of international GCP guidelines (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines E6 for Good Clinical Practice, FDA 21CFR parts 50, 56 and 312). During the conduct and reporting of this/these study(s), two independent audits were carr ied out in accordance with appropriate regulatory requirements and guidelines in order to assess compliance with the study protocol, ICH GCP, FDA 21CFR parts 314.50 and 601.2, appropriate standard operating procedures and policies.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP guideline 'Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines' (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005).

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

Laboratory assays used for the assessment of the primary and secondary endpoints (i.e. RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization assays) were considered validated for the purpose of testing in the Phase 3 studies. According to the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK) assay stability monitoring process, the stability of an assay is routinely monitored over time using inprocess testing of quality control (QC) samples and a regular evaluation of a QC panel (proficie ncy panel) tested at least every 6 months. Compared to previous applications, the current SOP only had minor/editorial changes not impacting the assay experimental procedure.

The MAH provided QC charts for the RSV -A and RSV-B neutralization assays (Figure 1 ). QC samples are included in each assay run. Data of a given run are validated if all QC sample values are within their respective predefined acceptance ranges. If the criterion is not met for at least 1 QC sample, the run is rejected, and testing is rep eated according to the assay standard operating procedure (SOP). QC charts are built using all QC sample values generated, from both valid and invalid runs, during non -clinical and clinical testing. These charts allow evaluating assay stability over time and detecting any potential trends.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization assays have previously been found to be fit for purpose of comparative immunogenicity (EMEA/H/C/006054/II/0002/G). The SOP used in the current submission differs only by minor/editorial changes compared to the previous SOPs.

The assays have previously been found fit for purpose.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

Evidence of a single clinical study was submitted, ADJ-025.

## 2.4.1. Main study

A Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immune response and to evaluate the safety of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus disease, compared to ol der adults ≥60 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

Study ADJ-025 is a completed phase 3, non-blinded, non-randomized, study to evaluate the noninferiority of the immune response and safety of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 1849 years of age at increased risk (AIR) for RSV disease, compared to older adults ≥60 years of age from whom efficacy has previously been demonstrated. An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 2 for Part A and Figure 3 for Part B.

The study had three cohorts: Cohort 1 (1849 YOA AIR for RSV disease), Cohort 2 (≥60 YOA RSV -OA), and Cohort 3 (18-49 YOA AIR for RSV disease), and was divided into two parts (Part A and part B). The primary immunogenicity analyses were only performed for Part A (Cohorts 1 and 2); safety analyses were performed for both Part A and Part B (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3)

The results of the primary immunogenicity objectives were based on the blood samples collected up to Visit 2 (Day 31), with a DBL of 17 September 2024. This CSR also includes the results of the secondary and tertiary immunogenicity objectives, based on the blood samples collected up to 6 months postvaccination with a DBL of 26 March 2025.

## Study participants

Inclusion criteria differed per Cohort.

Cohort 1 &amp; 3 included males and females aged 18-49 years old with at least 1 of the following conditions if considered medically stable: Chronic cardiopulmonary disease, type I or type II diabetes; chronic kidney of liver disease, neurologic or neuromuscular conditions.

Cohort 2 included males and females ≥60 YOA with chronic stable medical conditions with or without specific treatment, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiac disease. Enrolment rules were applied to ensure adequate representation by age category within Cohort 2 for participants in 60-69 YOA group and ≥ 70 YOA group.

The main exclusion criteria included suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions, unstable chronic illness, history of dementia or any medical condition that may impair cognition, and a history of hypersensitivity which may be exacerbated by the vaccine. Receipt of any RSV vaccine was a further criterion for exclusion.

## Treatments

All participants received the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine (120 μg RSVPreF3/AS01E) on day 1 of the study by intramuscular injection in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm. The vaccine formulation and schedule are the same as those used to demonstrate safety and efficacy against confirmed RSVLRTD in adults ≥60 YOA in study RSV OA=ADJ -006.

AIR = at increased risk; CD = cluster of differentiation; CD40L = CD40 ligand; CMI = cell-mediated immunity; GMT = geometric mean titer; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; NI = non-inferiority; OA = older adults; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; RSVPreF3 = Respiratory Syncytial Virus PreFusion protein F3; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; YOA = years of age. *Co-primary endpoints

Seroresponse rate was defined as the proportion of participants with a ≥4 -fold increase in neutralizing titers (post-study intervention administration over pre-study intervention administration).

Non-inferiority margins were set at 1.5 for GMT ratio and 10% for difference in seroresponse rate (SRR) for ≥60 YOA compared to 18 -49 YOA.

## Sample size

The target sample size for part A of the study was approximately 850 participants: 425 participants in Cohort 1 (RSV-A-AIR [18-49 YOA group]) and 425 participants in Cohort 2 (RSVOA [≥60 YOA group]), to obtain at least 722 evaluable participants (361 participants in the RSV-A-AIR [18-49 YOA] cohort and 361 participants in the RSVOA [≥60 YOA] cohort) for the evaluation of the primary objectives, assuming that approximately 15% of the enrolled participants would not be evaluable.

This sample size provided 93% global power to demonstrate non-inferiority of immune response in the 1849 YOA group vs. the ≥60 YOA group for the RSV -A strain (across the co-primary endpoints of GMT ratio and SRR), assuming a standard deviation of 0.45 for the log10 transformed anti-RSV-A Ab GMT and an SRR of 81.6% in the ≥60 YOA group, with a non -inferiority margin of 1.5 for GMT ratio and 10% for SRR. If non-inferiority was demonstrated for RSVA (using a hierarchical testing sequence, see statistical methods), the sample size would also provide 90% global power for the RSV-B strain, assuming a standard deviation of 0.45 for the log10 transformed anti-RSV-B Ab GMT and an SRR of 78.7% in the ≥60 YOA group, with non -inferiority margins of 1.5 for GMT ratio and 10% for SRR.

For the evaluation of reactogenicity and safety, the sample size of 1025 participants in the combined Cohorts 1 and 3 (18-49 YOA groups) had 64% and 87% probability of observing at least one vaccinated participant with an AE if the true AE incidence rate is 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

## Randomisation

The study was uncontrolled, and no randomisation took place.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was conducted as an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Multiple analysis populations were defined:

- -the Exposed Set (ES) consisted of all participants who received the study intervention.
- -The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of all eligible participants who received the study intervention as per protocol, had immunogenicity results pre- and post-dose, complied with

blood draw intervals, without intercurrent conditions that may interfere with immunogenicity and without prohibited concomitant medication/vaccination.

CMI subset was recruited from a selected number of countries and selected number of clinical sites. In the selected sites, the investigator would allocate, if possible, at Visit 1, the first participants in each group to the CMI subset until the allocated target is reached (75 participants from the RSV-A-AIR subset and 50 participants from the RSV-OA subset). Primary immunogenicity analyses were performed in the PPS set of Part A of the study.

The primary analyses for RSV-A and RSV-B GMT ratio at 1-month post-vaccination were performed using ANCOVA, with log10-transformed titer as an outcome and including the factor age group (18-49 YOA vs. ≥60 YOA) and the baseline log10 -transformed titer as covariate.

Primary analyses for group differences in RSV-A and RSV-B SRR at 1-month post-vaccination were done by subtracting SRR in the 1849 YOA group from the SRR in the ≥60 YOA group, with 95% CI derived using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.

Missing data was not imputed. The primary estimand was defined as shown in Table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SRR is defined as the proportion of participants having a fold increase in neutralizing titers (1-month post-study intervention administration over prestudy intervention administration)≥4. AIR=At increased risk; CI=Confidence interval; ED60= Estimated dilution 60; GMT=Geometric mean titer; OA=Older adults; YOA=Years of age

Testing of primary endpoints was performed sequentially: in the first sequence, non -inferiority was tested for the GMT ratio and SRR (as co-primary endpoints) for RSV-A. Non-inferiority would be declared if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio was ≤1.5 and the upper limit of the 95% CI for the SRR difference was ≤10%. In the second sequence (only tested if the first sequence was successful), non-inferiority was tested for the RSV-B strain. Non-inferiority would be declared using the same criteria as for RSV-A.

As per the SAP, a second analysis based on the ES would be performed to complement the PPS analysis if the percentage of vaccinated participants with serological results excluded from the PPS was more than 5%. A secondary analysis was also performed using IU/ml for computation of the GMT ratio and SSR instead of titers.

## Results

## Participant flow

The study was conducted in 52 centres across 6 countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and the United States). Participants for all three cohorts were included in all countries.

Overall, 1528 participants were screened for parts A and B, and 1459 participants were included in the Enrolled Set, of whom 1458 were included in the Exposed Set. Of these, 426 participants were in cohort 1 (part A, 1849 YOA), 429 in cohort 2 (part A, ≥6 0 YOA), and 603 in cohort 3 (part B [safety only], 18-49 YOA). The reasons for withdrawal up to month 6 are presented in Table 4.

## Recruitment

The study was initiated on April 29 th , 2024 (first participant first visit). The last participant for last visit for efficacy at V2 (day 31, time of primary endpoint) was July 30, 2024. The last participant last visit (i.e. month 6 safety data) was March 18 th , 2025. Target enrolment was met, as 855 participants were included in the Exposed Set for part A and 1029 18-49 YOA participants were exposed across Part A cohort 1 and Part B cohort 3.

## Conduct of the study

## Amendments

The original protocol (dated December 18, 2023) of RSV OA=ADJ-025 was amended on May 3, 2024. The purpose of this amendment was to implement a new Cohort 3 as a Part B of this study to collect safety information in an extended sample size to better characterize the safety profile of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in a population of individuals at increased risk for RSV disease 18-49 years of age. This extra cohort of approximately 600 adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk for RSV disease, were to be monitored for reactogenicity and safety for a period of 6 months following the administration of one dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine at Visit 1. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as enrolment rules as for participants of Cohort 1 applied for Cohort 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At least 1 important protocol deviation was reported in 89 participants (8.6%) in the RSV-A-AIR group and 28 participants (6.5%) in the RSV-OA group Most of the protocol deviations were related to assessment or timepoint completion, followed by study procedures, and wrong study treatment/administration/dose.

## Baseline data

In general, the demographics of the participants, excluding age, were comparable between the RSV-AAIR and RSV-OA groups (Table 5). The median age of participants at the time of study intervention administration (Visit 1) was 40.0 years (range: 18 to 50 years) in the RSV-A-AIR group and 68.0 years (range: 59 to 89 years) in the RSV-OA group. In the overall study population, a total of 814 participants (55.8%) were female, and 644 participants (44.2%) were male. The percentage of participants with exactly 1 chronic disease of interest was 68.8% in the RSV-A-AIR group and 35.4% in the RSV-OA group.

## Numbers analysed

The analysis groups are provided in Table 6. The primary analyses of immunogenicity were performed on the PPS. As the percentage of vaccinated participants with serological results excluded from the PPS was &gt;5% in the 18-49 YOA group, a second analysis based on the ES was also performed.

Immunogenicity analyses were performed for only Part A of the study as planned in the protocol. The overall ES for Part A of the study included 855 participants (426 participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 429 participants in the RSV-OA group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At day 31, 417 (97.9%) participants in the RSV-A-AIR group had non-missing serological results for RSV-A and were included in the ES analysis for RSV-A while 416 (97.7%) had non-missing serological results for RSV-B and were included in the ES analysis for RSVB. Of the ≥60 YOA group, 428 (99.8%) had non-missing serological results for RSV-A and RSV-B and were included in the ES analysis. The PPS at day 31 consisted of 394 participants (for RSV-A) / 393 (for RSV-B) participants in the 18-49 YOA group and 41 7 participants in the ≥60 YOA group.

At month 6, 799 (93.5%) participants were included in the PPS for humoral immune response (393 participants [92.3%] in the RSV-A-AIR group and 406 participants [94.6%] in the RSV-OA group)

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary objectives

Non-inferiority of the immune response to RSVPreF3 OA in 1849 YOA compared to ≥60 YOA was demonstrated in terms of RSV-A neutralizing GMTs (upper limit of the 95% CI on group GMT ratio was 0.81, which was below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 1.5) and SRR (upper limit of the 95% CI on SRR difference was -4.14%, below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of + 10%).

Non-inferiority of the immune response to RSVPreF3 OA in 1849 YOA compared to ≥60 YOA was also demonstrated in terms of RSV-B neutralizing GMTs (upper limit of the 95% CI on group GMT ratio was 0.82, which was below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 1.5) and SRR (upper limit of the 95% CI on SRR difference was -4.83%, below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 10%). Results are shown in Table 7.

a. comparison is done using the group ratio of adjusted GMT (RSV-OA/RSV-A-AIR) (ANCOVA model applied to the log10- transformed titers). The ANCOVA model included the group as fixed effects and the pre-dose log-10 titer as covariate b. comparison is done using the difference of SRR (RSV-OA - RSV-A-AIR)

CI = Confidence interval; GMT = Geometric mean titer; SRR = Seroresponse rate; LL = Lower limit; UL = Upper limit

## Supplementary analyses

Similar results were also obtained in the ES for the primary objectives. For RSV-A the GMT ratio was estimated as 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64 - 0.82) and SRR difference was estimated as -9.25 (95% CI: -14.37 - -4.15). For RSV-B the GMT ratio was estimated as 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66 - 0.83) and SRR difference was estimated as -9.68 (95% CI: -14.85 - -4.52).

In a sensitivity analysis using IU/ml instead of titer to compute GMT ratio and SRR, similar results were also found. For RSV-A, the GMT ratio was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.63 - 0.81) and the SRR difference was -13.06 (95% CI: -18.61 - -7.48). For RSV-B, the GMT ratio was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65 - 0.82) and the SRR difference was -9.83 (-14.97 - -4.71).

Similar results were obtained when the non-inferiority analysis was performed on the PPS at the End of Study (EoS).

## Tertiary objective: CMI response

CMI response expressed as group geometric mean of the frequency of RSVPreF3 -specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells expressing at least 2 activation markers including at least 1 cytokine among CD40L, 41BB, IL-2, TNFα, IFN -γ, IL -13, IL-17, at pre-study intervention administration 1 month and 6 months after study intervention administration, in a subset of participants was determined as a tertiary endpoint.

A robust RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T cell response was elicited post-vaccination in the RSV-A-AIR group and the RSV-OA group as compared to their respective baselines. At Visit 1 (Day 1), results were available for 69 participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 48 participants in the RSV-OA group.

- -The GMF of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T cells at baseline, day 31, and month 6 for the RSV-AAIR versus RSV-OA group were 256.1 versus 121.3, 1883.2 versus 1188.6, and 877.0 versus 620.5.
- -The number and percentage of participants with at least 4fold increase in the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 markers including at least 1 cytokine of interest over baseline at day 31 and month 6 for the RSV-A-AIR versus RSV-OA group were 19 (32.8%) versus 4 (9.3%), and 2 (3.6%) versus 0.
- -No RSVPreF3-specific CD8+ T cell response was observed at either day 31 or 6-month postvaccination.

## Risk-factors

The MAH submitted a post-hoc subgroup analyses by baseline medical condition (cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases) for the primary endpoint analyses for Cohort 1. The subgroup analysis revealed consistent findings across all three RSV-A-AIR subgroups, suggesting no meaningful differences in the immune response based on the specific categories of baseline medical conditions. The GMT ratio (95%CI) for RSV-OA over RSV-A-AIR group for those with cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes mellitus, other diseases, and overall was 0.71 (0.61, 0.82), 0.67 (0.58, 0.78), and 0.71 (0.60, 0.84), and 0.72 (0.64, 0.81) for RSV A and 0.77 (0.67, 0.89), 0.67 (0.58, 0.77), 0.69 (0.59, 0.82), and 0.73 (0.65, 0.82) for RSV-B.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The new data in this application comes from study RSV OA=ADJ-025, which was a phase 3b, openlabel, non-randomized study to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immune response and to evaluate the safety of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (Arexvy) in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk for RSV disease, com pared to older adults ≥60 years of age for whom efficacy has previously been demonstrated. The open-label, non-randomized design is not expected to affect the comparison of immunogenicity between younger and older adults.

In Part A of the study, the immune response and safety profile of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus disease (cohort 1) compared to older adults ≥60 years of age (cohort 2) was investigated. Part B included cohort 3 (same inclusion criteria as cohort 1) and aimed at collecting additional safety data in an extended sample size of individuals at increased risk for RSV disease 18-49 years of age. Overall, the design of the study is acceptable for the immunobridging exercise.

The study included an immunocompetent population 18-49 years of age at increased risk of RSV-LRTD due to the presence of at least 1 stable medical condition (chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease or neurologic/neuromuscular condition) (RSV-AAIR). An indication is sought for all individuals 18-49 years of age, regardless of co-morbidities. The applicant assumed that a demonstration of non-inferiority for this age group in RSV OA=ADJ-025 would support a conclusion that there would also be non-inferior immune responses in adults aged 1849 years without such underlying conditions. This is considered a reasonable assumption. This assumption is also supported by the results of RSV OA=ADJ-018 (EMEA/H/C/006054/II/0008) in which

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the immune response 1-month post-vaccination with Arexvy for 50-59-year-old both at and not at increased risk of RSV-LRTD was noninferior to the response seen in ≥ 60-year-old population (coprimary endpoints). Therefore, the choice of the increased risk population for the immunobridging approach and the broader population sought for in the indication is considered acceptable from an immunogenicity point of view. The four co-primary endpoints were the GMT ratio's and seroresponse rates (SRRs) based on anti-RSV A and anti-RSV B neutralizing antibody titres obtained at 1-month post-vaccination. Non-inferiority margins were set at 1.5 for GMT ratio and 10% for difference in SRR for ≥60 YOA compared to 18 -49 YOA. A hierarchical testing strategy was used: in the first sequence, non-inferiority was tested for RSV-A (GMT ratio and SRR as co-primary); in the second sequence, non -inferiority was tested for RSV-B (GMT ratio and SRR as co-primary). The non-inferiority criteria and primary endpoints are appropriate and in line with previous studies involving Arexvy. The per protocol set was used to evaluate the immune response.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In total, 1528 participants were screened for the study, of which 69 did not meet the inclusion criteria. One participant withdrew before vaccine administration. Therefore 1458 participants were in the exposed set (426 subjects in Cohort 1, 429 subjects in Cohort 2 and 603 subjects in Cohort 3).

Compared to the primary efficacy study ADJ-006, the participants in the OA-RSV group had similar baseline characteristics. In the current study ADJ-025, younger adults had a higher BMI and a greater frequency of tobacco use, which is expected from a younger population with, among others, cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidities.

Elimination from the PPS was more common among 1849 YOA (7.7%) than among ≥60 YOA (2.8%), which might have introduced a slight bias. The main reasons for protocol deviations were 'assessment or timepoint completion' followed by 'study procedures' and 'wrong study treatment/administration/dose'. However, overall, a smaller number of participants was eliminated from the PPS than anticipated (~15% anticipated, actual elimination was 5.3%). A sensitivity analyses was performed on the exposed set to address this issue, the result of which did not differ meaningfully from the main PPS analysis.

Regarding the protocol deviation reason 'wrong study treatment/administration/dose' due to use of study treatment impacted by temperature excursion (7 participants in cohort 1, 4 participants in cohort 2 and 2 participants in cohort 3), further clarificati on was requested. According to the Applicant, the monitoring of the study revealed that there was an issue with temperature monitoring of the refrigerator at a Japanese site. At this site, the temperature monitoring device from GSK was not used, but instead a non-calibrated thermometer was used to record temperature. In total, 24 participants were impacted by this issue. Each impacted dose of the Arexvy vaccine was evaluated under a worstcase scenario, assuming continuous exposure to ambient temperature for the duration of the temperature monitoring issue and then compared against the available stability data. The 11 included doses had temperature monitoring gaps shorter than the validated stability limits and were deemed fit for purpose. This is regarded acceptable.

Non-inferiority of the immune response to RSVPreF3 OA in 1849 YOA compared to ≥60 YOA was demonstrated in terms of RSV-A &amp; B neutralizing GMTs (upper limit of the 95% CI on group GMT ratio was 0.81 and 0.82 respectively, which was below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 1.5) and SRR (upper limit of the 95% CI on SRR difference was -4.14% and -4.83% respectively below the predefined non-inferiority criterion of 10%). The neutralising antibody titers for both RSV-A and RSV-B declined over time in both age groups but remained well above baseline levels up till 6 months post vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analyses by baseline medical condition (cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases) and age group (18-49 YOA, 6069 YOA and ≥70 YOA ) showed no meaningful differences were found in overall immune response by subgroup. No other subgroup analyses were performed. Based on the known effect of Arexvy and other similar vaccines, no differing immunogenic response between subgroups such as race, gender, or number of co-morbidities would be expected.

In line with results included in the MAA, RSVPreF3 vaccine was able to induce CD4+ T-cells in both 1849-year-old group, and in the older adults. However, all CMI analyses were exploraty.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Non-inferiority of the immune response to RSVPreF3 OA in 1849 YOA compared to ≥60 YOA was demonstrated in terms of RSV-A &amp; B neutralizing GMTs and SRR, supporting the inference of efficacy in the younger population.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The main source of the known safety profile of Arexvy is derived from the pivotal phase 3 study RSV OA=ADJ-006 and is further supported by data from other phase 3 studies (RSV OA=ADJ-004, -007, 009, and -018). The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile across the Phase 3 clinical studies.

The safety data presented for this extension of indication is derived from a phase 3b, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized study (RSV OA=ADJ-025). It was conducted in 2 Parts - Part A (immunogenicity and safety evaluation) and Part B (additional safety evaluation). Part A consisted of Cohort 1 which included adults 1849 YOA AIR for RSV disease and Cohort 2 which included adults ≥60 YOA. Part B included Cohort 3, which had the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as Cohort 1. Safety analyses were performed for both Part A and Part B.

The evaluation of reactogenicity and safety after the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine administration was a secondary objective, with the following descriptive endpoints:

- -Percentage of participants reporting each solicited administration site event with onset within 4 days after study intervention administration (i.e., the day of study intervention administration and 3 subsequent days).
- -Percentage of participants reporting each solicited systemic event with onset within 4 days after study intervention administration (i.e., the day of study intervention administration and 3 subsequent days).
- -Percentage of participants reporting unsolicited AEs within 30 days after study intervention administration (i.e., the day of study intervention administration and 29 subsequent days) by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class (SOC), High Level Term (HLT) and Preferred Term (PT). Similar tabulation was done for Grade 3 unsolicited AEs, for any causally related unsolicited AEs, for Grade 3 causally related unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs resulting in a medically attended visit.
- -Percentage of participants reporting SAEs and AESIs (including potential immune mediated diseases (pIMDs) and atrial fibrillation (AF)) after study intervention administration (Day 1) up to study end (6 months after study intervention administration) by MedDRA Primary SOC, HLT and PT.

## Solicited adverse events

## Solicited administration site events

Solicited administration site events were reported in 76.4% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 58.2% of participants in the RSVOA group. The most frequently reported solicited administration site event across both study groups was injection site pain (76.0% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 57.5% of participants in the RSV-OA group). Grade 3 solicited administration site events were reported in 1.6% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 0.2% of participants in the RSV-OA group. The mo st frequently reported Grade 3 solicited administration site event in both study groups was injection site pain (1.3% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 0.2% of participants in the RSV-OA group). Across all groups, the median duration of each solicited administration site event (pain, erythema, and swelling) was 2-3 days and the median number of days with Grade 3 events was 1-2 days. Table 14 shows the percentage of solicited administration site events within 4 days following vaccination in the exposed set.

## Solicited systemic adverse events

Solicited systemic events were reported in 75.0% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 54.9% of participants in the RSV-OA group (Table 15 ). The most frequently reported solicited systemic events were myalgia and fatigue. Myalgia was reported in 59.9% of participants in RSV-A-AIR group and 39.5% of participants in the RSV-OA group. Fatigue was reported in 59.6% of participants in the RSVA-AIR group and 34.6% of participants in the RSV-OA group. Grade 3 solicited systemic events were reported in 5.8% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 2.3% of participants in the RSV-OA group. The most frequently reported Grade 3 solicited systemic events were fatigue, headache, and myalgia; the incidence of Grade 3 events across all solicited event types was ≤ 3% in either group. Across all groups, the median duration of each solicited systemic event was 1-2 days and the median number of days with Grade 3 events was 1-2 days.

## Sensitivity analysis for solicited adverse events

A generally high electronic clinical outcomes assessment (eCOA) compliance was observed from Day 1 to Day 4 (98.3%). The compliance for participants who completed the eDiaries for 4 consecutive days (Day 1 to Day 4) was 94.7%. However, a drop in completion of the eDiaries from Day 5 to Day 30 was observed. The overall eDiary compliance (Day 1 to Day 30) was 91.0% (90.6% in the RSV-AIR group [Cohorts 1+3] and 91.9% in the RSV-OA group. From Day 5 onwards, participants had to complete separate daily eDiaries for each ongoing symptom (maximum 8 ongoing solicited events, i.e., maximum 8 eDiaries per day).

As a remedial action, reminders for ongoing solicited events after Day 4 were put in place before the end of the Cohort 3 enrolment, applicable for those enrolled as of 08 August 2024.

To assess the impact of missing data and further complement the main analysis for duration of solicited events, 2 sensitivity analyses were performed.

- -Sensitivity Analysis 1: A sensitivity analysis for evaluating the duration of solicited events for those participants from Cohort 3 enrolled as of 08 August 2024, as from then the eDiary alerts for participants from Day 5 onwards were activated in the vendor system.
- o For Cohort 3 participants who received eDiary alerts compliance from Day 5 onwards was 74.5% and compliance from Day 1 to Day 30 was 95.8%.
- o The median duration of solicited administration site events remained 2-3 days.
- o The median duration of solicited systemic events remained 1-2 days.
- -Sensitivity Analysis 2: A sensitivity analysis to account for missing eDiary for ongoing symptoms. This analysis was performed for all participants and for those participants enrolled in Cohort 3 as of 08 August 2024. In this analysis a different definition for the duration of an event for the missing data was performed. To account for missing eDiary data as of day 5 onwards (due to non-activation of the eDiary alerts for participants from day 5 onwards in the vendor system), a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the below definition of duration:
- o The duration of a solicited AE with at least one day Grade &gt; 0 is defined as End dateStart date + 1, with Start date defined as the first day with the symptom and End date

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

defined as the day before the first occurrence of the symptom (in or beyond the solicited period) equals 'N' with no days having occurrence afterwards.

- o If a solicited event is still not reported as 'N' at day 30, the end date will be considered equal to vaccination date + 29 days.
- o The median duration of solicited administration site events remained 2-3 days.
- o The median duration of solicited systemic events remained 1-2 days.

## All unsolicited adverse events

## Within 30 minutes

No hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction to vaccination was reported in any participant. Unsolicited AEs were reported in 4 (0.4%) participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and in none of the participants in the RSV-OA group. The unsolicited AEs were nausea (n=2), lymph node pain (n=1), and feeling hot (n=1). No Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported.

## Within 30 days

Unsolicited AEs were reported in 18.5% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 17.7% of participants in the RSVOA group. At the SOC level, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE SOC was 'Infections and infestations', reported in 6.2% of participants in the RSV-A-AIR group and 7.0% of participants in RSV-OA group.

RSV-A-AIR = At increased risk adult participants (18-49 YOA) receiving a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1) (Cohort 1; Cohort 3); RSV-OA = Older adult participants (&gt;= 60 YOA) receiving a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1) (Cohort 2) N = number of participants; n/% = number/percentage of participants presenting at least one type of adverse event; 95% CI = exact 95% confidence interval, LL = Lower Limit, UL = Upper Limit;

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## SAEs and SAEs with a fatal outcome :

Up to the study end, at least 1 SAE was reported in 14 participants (1.4%) in the RSV-A-AIR group and in 13 participants (3.0%) in the RSV-OA group. None of the SAEs reported in either study group (RSV-A-AIR and RSV-OA) were considered to be related to study intervention by the investigator ( Table 18 ). None of the participants in any of the study groups had an SAE leading to withdrawal, treatment discontinuation, or death.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -A non-serious event of AF was reported in 1 participant in the RSV-A-AIR group, and a serious event of AF was reported in 1 participant in the RSV-OA group. Both events were assessed as not related to study intervention by the investigator.

No events of neurological demyelinating pIMDs were reported in any of the participants in RSV-AAIR group and RSV-OA group up to study end.

## Atrial fibrillation

Events of AF were reported in 1 participant each in the RSV-A-AIR group and RSV-OA group. In the RSV-A-AIR group, a &gt;40-year-old participant had a non-serious AF (exacerbation of paroxysmal AF) that occurred 6 days after study intervention administration (the event was not confirmed by electrocardiography). The participant was obese had a relevant medical history of paroxysmal AF, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea. This event was assessed as mild in intensity and as not related to study intervention by the investigator. The event resolved spontaneously after 4 days of its onset.

In the RSV-OA group, a &gt;70-year-old participant had a serious AF that occurred 131 days after study intervention administration and was confirmed by electrocardiography. The participant was obese, had a relevant medical history of benign arrhythmia, obstructive sleep apnoea, and family history of AF. This event was assessed as moderate in intensity and as not related to study intervention by the investigator. The outcome of the event was reported as not resolved; however, the serious AF was reported to be stable by the investigator.

## Laboratory findings

No laboratory evaluations were performed in the Phase 3 trials, which is acceptable.

## Safety in special populations

## Pregnant women

In the study, 3 pregnancies (all in RSV-A-AIR) were reported. All pregnancies resulted in a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Up to the study end, no participant discontinued the study due to any AE.

## Post marketing experience

Since initial approval on 03 May 2023, and until 02 November 2024 (DLP of the last PSUR), it is estimated that 11 498 281 Arexvy doses have been distributed globally; most doses were distributed in the USA and Canada. The number of Arexvy doses administered since approval is available only for the US. From launch until 02 November 2024, it is estimated that 8.68 million doses were administered in the US, based on IQVIA National Prescription Audit Rapid Weekly Total Prescription data, and included an estimated 2.11 million immunizations in non-retail pharmacy settings. Up to 02 November 2024, a total of 1933 spontaneous reports have been received for Arexvy. These have mostly been non-serious (1659; 86%) and reflect the known safety profile of Arexvy as described in the RSI. The most common AEs reported have been local injection site events such as pain, erythema, swelling, and systemic events such as pyrexia, fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The review of the cumulative spontaneous post-marketing data did not

result in any update to the Company's RSI. Two safety signals were assessed following Health Authority Requests; the Company concluded that the available information on these events does not warrant an update of the Company's RSI.

Two safety signals were assessed following Health Authority Requests; the Company concluded that the available information on these events does not warrant an update of the Company's RSI. However, these events were added as ADR in the SmPC/package leaflet.

- In the Assessment for the Arexvy PSUR, covering the reporting period 03 November 2023 to 02 May 2024, the MAH was requested to add injection site necrosis as adverse reaction to the EU PI, based on review of spontaneous reports, including in at least 7 cases a close temporal relationship. It was acknowledged that the mechanism or risk factors for the occurrence of 'injection site necrosis' following vaccination with Arexvy remain uncertain: the event could be vaccine, antigen, adjuvant or procedure related. However, a causal association with the vaccine could not be excluded.
- Results from a post-marketing observational study using data from US individuals 65 years and older from the Medicare Fee-For-Service suggest an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination with Arexvy, with an incidence rate ratio (GBS cases in the risk window/control window) of 2.46 (95% CI: 1.19, 5.08) and an estimated 7 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered. On 25 October 2024, the US FDA notified GSK that the abovementioned study results should be included into the US PI for Arexvy. In the PSUR covering the reporting period between 3 May 2024 until 2 November 2024, the PRAC considered that a causal relationship between Arexvy and GBS was at least a reasonable possibility in view of data from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports and the information from the SCCS performed by FDA. Thus, GBS was included as an adverse drug reaction in the SmPC.

The evidence from across the Arexvy development programme and real-world use up to 02 November 2024 does not suggest a causal association with any other pIMD (including neurological demyelinating pIMD) at present.

The review of spontaneous reports from GSK's Global Safety database received up to 02 November 2024 concerning the administration of Arexvy in error in adults 18 through 49 YOA, mostly consisting of reports of exposure in pregnancy, does not highlight any safety issue. To address these vaccination error reports, GSK is strengthening its medical information material to improve awareness of the authorized indication and correct use of Arexvy and is enhancing follow-up of pregnancy exposure cases to support continuous safety surveillance. More details on the postmarketing safety experience will continue to be communicated to regulatory authorities through periodic safety reports.

The post-marketing safety data received up to 02 November 2024 does not alter the overall benefit-risk profile of Arexvy for the active immunization for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The known safety profile of Arexvy is derived from the phase 3 studies RSV OA=ADJ-006, -004, 007, and -009, all of which included participants 60 years of age or older. Study ADJ-018 additionally included participants 50-59 years of age, both with and without co-morbidities leading to an increased risk of RSV-LRTD. In the current variation, evidence from ADJ-025 is submitted, which provides safety data for 1029 participants aged 18-49-year-old AIR of RSV-LRTD, with a follow-up of 6 months. The study had three cohorts: cohort 1 (18-49 YOA AIR for RSV disease),

\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cohort 2 (≥60 YOA RSV -OA), and cohort 3 (18-49 YOA AIR for RSV disease), all of which participated in the safety endpoints.

Safety endpoints, and methods of collection were comparable to the previous Arexvy trials and collected in an appropriate manner. No subgroup analyses were performed for the safety endpoints. This is acceptable as during the MAA it was observed that gender did not influence the safety profile in older adults &gt;60 years of age and therefore, it is unlikely to be of major influence in the currently evaluated age group.

Proportions reporting any solicited adverse reactions were higher in the younger RSV-A-AIR groups (75.0%) than in the RSV-OA group (54.9%). However, the number of grade 3 events remained low (5.8% versus 2.3%). This is an expected finding. Pain was the mos t frequently reported solicited administration site event (76%), and fatigue (60%) and myalgia (60%) the most common systemic solicited event. In younger individuals, and the overall frequency of these reactogenicity events did not differ from what was already provided in the SmPC ADR table. These adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination.

Between groups, there was no clinically meaningful difference in unsolicited adverse events (both related and unrelated) within 30 days after vaccination (RSV-A-AIR group 18.5%, RSV-OA group 17.7%). Non-serious related unsolicited adverse events within 30 days after vaccination occurred more frequently in RSV -A-AIR (8.7%) group than in RSV-OA (3.0%) group. At PT level, these numerical imbalances were mainly driven by reactogenicity events (chills, injection site reactions, nausea, vomiting) and lymphadenopathy which are recognized ADR in the SmPC of Arexvy.

No new adverse drug reactions have been identified in this application. However, the frequency of adverse reactions in the SmPC was revised considering pooled data from all studies for participants 18 years of age and older (i.e.  RSV OA=ADJ-006, -018 and -025). Consequently, the frequency for injection site erythema was revised from very common to common. No other amendments were deemed necessary.

Serious adverse events occurred in similar frequencies in the RSV -A-AIR group and the RSV-OA group. On PTlevel 'Infections and infestations' occurred slightly more often in the RSV -A-AIR group than in the RSV-OA group (0.7% versus 0.2%), however there was no indication that this may be a safety signal. Most likely these differences are due to the differing epidemiological factors and baseline characteristics (i.e. greater viral exposure or higher BMI in the younger group). This is aligned with the conclusions in the placebo-controlled trials (-006, -018) where there was no indication that participants receiving Arexvy had a higher rate of infections and infestations than those receiving placebo.

Up to the study end, at least 1 SAE was reported in 14 participants (1.4%) in the RSV-A-AIR group and in 13 participants (3.0%) in the RSV-OA group. None of the SAEs were considered related to Arexvy. There were no SAEs with a fatal outcome reported. Regarding pIMDs, events were reported in 2 participants (0.2%) in the RSV-A-AIR group (hematoma [non-serious AE] and type 1 diabetes mellitus [SAE] in 1 participant each) and in 1 participant (0.2%) in the RSV-OA group (pernicious anaemia [non-serious AE]). The AE of hematoma in a &gt;30-year-old diabetic participant was considered as related to study intervention by the investigator but not the MAH. The participant developed haematoma at the insulin injection site 14 days after vaccination and the condition aggravated over the body. There were no laboratory findings identifying coagulopathy and the haematomas spontaneously resolved within months. The MAH conducted a broad search for haemorrhages in the GSK safety database. The case of exacerbated hematoma in study RSV OA=ADJ-025 is the only case reported across Arexvy clinical studies or post-marketing settings until 27 August 2025. The Company will continue to monitor reports of multiple disseminated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haematomas after administration of Arexvy through routine pharmacovigilance including signal detection activities.

Events of atrial fibrillation were reported in 1 participant each in the RSV-A-AIR group and RSV-OA group. In both reports, this occurred in patients with either pre-existing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, or with pre-existing risk factors for atrial fibrillation. In addition, the occurrence in one of the participants was not confirmed with an ECG. It is agreed that these episodes of AF were not caused nor aggravated by Arexvy.

There were three pregnancies in the RSV-A-AIR group during the study, which all resulted in a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly. Arexvy is not recommended during pregnancy, and routine pharmacovigilance activities are sufficient to further characterise this special population.

The available data in post-marketing in 18 years of age and older does not raise any concern.

To conclude, no new safety concern was identified in the submitted data and at this stage, routine pharmacovigilance activities are sufficient to further characterise the safety profile of Arexvy.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, the safety profile in the population 18 years of age and older was similar to the safety profile in the older adults (&gt;60 years) and no new safety signals nor safety concerns have been identified.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

## Pharmacovigilance plan

No additional pharmacovigilance activities are required.

## Risk minimisation measures

Not applicable

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.  The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

It is agreed with the applicant that the amendments to the patient leaflet with this extension of the indication are minimal, only one sentence in section 1 of the patient leaflet and a change in section 4.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

The intended indication is: Arexvy is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults 18 years of age and older.

RSV is a high attack-rate virus characterized as capable of causing severe disease at opposite ends of life, and in those with co-morbidities. The 18-49-year-old population relevant for this extension of indication has more limited epidemiological data ava ilable than those ≥60 years of age and are less likely to be tested for RSV leading to an underestimation of the disease burden. However, existing data does show a disease burden among these individuals. Although hospitalization in healthy adults 18-49 YoA is rare (incidence approximately 2.1 per 100,000 PY), RSV infections are common and may cause cold or influenza-like symptoms. Approximately 22% of influenza-like illness in 25-29-year-olds has been attributed to RSV, and symptomatic illness in adults may be severe enough to result in half or more of effected adults missing work (Zambon 2001). Cases in adults have been reported to result in persistent shortness of breath and fatigue up to 4 weeks following illness (Hall et al 1978). Outbreaks of healthcare-associated respiratory syncytial virus (HA-RSV) infections are well described, particularly in neonatal intensive care units (ICUs), paediatric ICUs, and units caring for immunosuppressed children. HA-RSV is responsible for 20% of RSV-related in-hospital deaths in lower- and middle-income countries (Saiman, 2024, J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc). In such cases, it is plausible that accidental spread due to hospital-workers with a mild RSV-infection contributes to infection of vulnerable children.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Since 2023, there have been substantial advances in the prevention of RSV due to the approval of Arexvy and two additional vaccines. mRESVIA is approved for prevention of RSV-LRTD in adults aged ≥ 60 years, and adults 18-59 years who are at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV. Abrysvo is approved in adults ≥ 18 years regardless of co -morbidity status. Abrysvo is also approved for the passive immunization of infants following maternal immunisation during pregnancy. Despite new vaccination possibilities for the prevention of RSV, the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease remains high. Treatment of RSV disease consists primarily of supportive care (e.g. oxygen, hydration and suctioning of secretions). An antiviral agent, ribavirin, is licensed for the treatment of RSV infection in the United States and some EU member states; however, it is not recommended in the United States or EU treatment guidelines.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The evidence is provided from a single clinical study: A Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immune response and to evaluate the safety of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk for RSV disease (i.e. with predefined, stable, chronic medical conditions leading to an increased risk for RSV disease such as chronic pulmonary disease, chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, or neurological or neuromuscular disease) , compared to older adults ≥60 years of age (ADJ-025). The primary objective of the study was to determine non-inferiority of the immune response elicited by Arexvy after 1 month in 18-49-year-old individuals at increased risk of RSVLRTD compared to ≥ 60-year-old individuals (i.e. the population for whom efficacy has been established at the time of the initial MA). The study had three cohorts: Cohorts 1 (18-49 YOA AIR for RSV disease), Cohort 2 (≥60 YOA RSV -OA), and Cohort 3 (18-49 YOA AIR for RSV disease), and was divided into two parts (Part A and part B). The primary immunogenicity analyses were only performed for Part A (Cohorts 1 and 2); safety analyses were performed for both Part A and Part B (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3).

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The primary immunogenicity objective of study ADJ-025 was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the humoral immune response following the administration of Arexvy in participants 18-49 YOA at increased risk for RSV disease compared to adults ≥60 YOA, in whom vaccine efficacy was demonstrated at the initial application.

The four co-primary endpoints of the pivotal study of this application were met:

The adjusted GMT ratio (95%CI) for (RSV-OA /RSV-A-AIR) was 0.72 (0.64;0.81) and 0.73 (0.65;0.82) for RSV A and B respectively. The SRR difference was -9.36 (-14.58; -4.14) and 10.06 (-15.29; -4.83) for RSV A and B respectively. Thus, the prespecified non-inferiority criteria for the four co-primary endpoints were met. Titers remained well above baseline levels up till 6 months post vaccination for all groups.

An additional analysis was performed on the enrolled set instead of the per protocol set with the same results as in the PPS set.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

There is no correlate of protection known for RSV disease. Therefore, the benefit of Arexvy in 18 to 49 years of age and older has been inferred via immunobridging to the e ≥60 YOA population, for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

whom vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated in the initial application. This is in alignment with the Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1.) In studies involving participants 60 years of age and older, vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated LRTD over 3 RSV seasons was 62.9%. It can be inferred that the efficacy in people under 60 years of age is comparable over these three seasons. However, the duration of protection conferred by Arexvy has not been established beyond these three seasons, and it is currently unknown if and when a booster would be beneficial.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The safety data presented for this extension of indication is derived from the completed study ADJ025. It includes a total of 1029 participants 18-49 years of age who were followed up to at least 6 months.

Pain (76%) was the most frequently reported solicited administration site event, and fatigue (60%) and myalgia (60%) the most common systemic solicited event followed by headache (44%) and arthralgia (28%). These adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination.

Proportions reporting any solicited adverse reactions were higher in the younger RSV-A-AIR groups (75.0%) than in the RSV-OA group (54.9%). The pattern is also reflected in the number of grade 3 events (5.8% versus 2.3%).

At least 1 SAE was reported in 14 participants (1.4%) in the RSV-A-AIR group and in 13 participants (3.0%) in the RSV-OA group. None of them were considered causally related to vaccination. There were no SAEs with a fatal outcome.

Regarding pIMDs, events were reported in 2 participants (0.2%) in the RSV-A-AIR group (hematoma [non-serious AE] and type 1 diabetes mellitus [SAE] in 1 participant each) and in 1 participant (0.2%) in the RSV-OA group (pernicious anaemia [non-serious AE]). The AE of hematoma was considered as related to study intervention by the investigator but not by the MAH.

No new adverse drug reaction was identified in study ADJ025. However, the frequency of adverse reactions in the SmPC was revised should be based on pooled data from all studies with Arexvy including participants 18 years of age and older. Consequently, the frequency for injection site erythema was revised from very common to common. No other amendments were deemed necessary.

No new safety concerns were identified.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The trial was open-label and not placebo controlled, which could have impacted the reporting of safety endpoints.

The sample size of 1025 participants aged 18-49 had 64% and 87% probability of observing at least one vaccinated participant with an AE if the true AE incidence rate is 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. The known safety profile is based on people ≥50 years.

No additional pharmacovigilance activities are considered necessary to characterise the above uncertainties and limitations.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Non-inferiority of the immune response to RSVPreF3 OA in 1849 YOA compared to ≥60 YOA was demonstrated in terms of RSV-A &amp; B neutralizing GMTs (upper limit of the 95% CI on group GMT

ratio was 0.81 and 0.82 respectively, below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 1.5) and SRR (upper limit of the 95% CI on SRR difference was -4.14% and -4.83% respectively, below the pre-defined non-inferiority criterion of 10%). Robustness of the results were confirmed with sensitivity analyses. These results support the inference of efficacy in the younger population.

The trial was open label, which potentially impacts the reporting of the safety endpoints. However, as all participants received the vaccination, it is not expected that older and younger individuals would report AEs differently in the open-label setting. Although younger participants had a higher rate of reactogenicity and related adverse events than the older participants (which is an expected observation), in general the frequency and type of events were consistent the known safety profile of Arexvy.

The study population involved 18-49-year-olds at increased risk of RSV LRTD due to comorbidities. However, the MAH is seeking the indication for all 18-49-year-olds. This is acceptable. In the immune competent population, there is no expectation that the underlying conditions would have a substantial impact on either the immunogenicity or safety results. This assumption is also supported by the results of RSV OA=ADJ-018 in which both the immunogenicity results (as presented by the immune response 1-month post-vaccination with Arexvy for 50-59-year-olds both at and not at increased risk of RSV-LRTD was comparable in both populations) do not suggest differences in outcomes based on the presence of comorbidities.

Although based on the immunogenicity profile it can be inferred that Arexvy is efficacious in younger, healthier populations, the clinical benefit of this efficacy may be less clear than for the older populations in whom severe disease leading to hospitali zation occurs more frequently. According to a Darwin-EU study, in the 18-59-year-old population, the rate of RSV-related hospitalization is 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9 - 2.2) per 100,000 PY. However, the clinical benefit of RSV vaccination does not only rest on prevention of hospitalization. RSV infections are common and may cause cold or influenza-like symptoms. Approximately 22% of influenza-like illness in 25-29year-olds has been attributed to RSV, and symptomatic illness in adults may be severe enough to result in half or more of effected adults missing work (Zambon 2001).

For the safety outcomes, the total number of adults aged 18-49 years exposed to Arexvy is relatively modest. The current study is powered to observe AEs with an incidence of 0.1-0.2% and would therefore not detect AEs with a similar frequency as RSV -related hospitalizations. However, the extensive safety database for Arexvy in older adults (as well as for other AS01 adjuvanted vaccines) does not provide reasons for concern. No new safety concern has been identified.

The uncertainties associated with the level of clinical benefit are not considered significant to impact the extension of indication to this population. Moreover, the current wording of the indication would allow NITAGs to determine if and how to recommend use in adults aged from 18 years as the currently approved indication allows them to do the same from a minimum age of 60 years. In particular, the proposed wording allows NITAGs to select certain adults for vaccination either because they are considered to be at risk of severe disease if they become infected with RSV and/or because they are particularly at risk of acquiring RSV disease due to their employment even if the disease is expected to be mild in severity. For example, NITAGS may choose to target healthcare workers to minimize staff shortages during the RSV season just as influenza vaccines are so targeted in many countries. Or they may in particular focus on healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units (ICUs), paediatric ICUs, and units caring for immunosuppressed children to prevent healthcare-associated respiratory syncytial virus infections in these vulnerable populations.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The data from study ADJ-025 establish the non-inferiority of immune response in individuals 18-49 years old compared to the population for whom efficacy has been established. There are no new safety concerns. While the study was conducted in adults aged 18-49 years with at least one prespecified underlying medical condition, there is no expectation that the underlying conditions would have a relevant effect on immunogenicity or safety. From a clinical perspective, a positive benefit/risk balance in the proposed indication is established.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Arexvy is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                          | Type   | Annexes affected   |

Extension of indication to include active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults 18 years of age and older for Arexvy, based on results from study 222253 (RSV OA=ADJ-025); this is a Phase 3b, open-label study to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immune response and to evaluate the safety of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in adults 18-49 years of age at increased risk of respiratory syncytial virus disease, compared to older adults ≥60 years of age. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 3.1 of the RMP has been agreed. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The variation leads to amendments to the annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
