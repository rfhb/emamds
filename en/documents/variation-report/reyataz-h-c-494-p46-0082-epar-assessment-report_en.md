## 1. Introduction

On  March  2015,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Reyataz,  in  accordance  with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the paediatric extension of indication and the oral powder line extension.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that AI424020 (Phase 1/2, open-label, pharmacokinetic and safety study of atazanavir in combination regimens in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and experienced HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents) is a stand-alone study.

Of note, Reyataz is currently approved in EU for adults and paediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age. This paediatric indication was the outcome of the Week 48 interim results of study AI424020 submitted by the MAH in 2008.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Two  formulations  of  atazanavir  (ATV)  were  administered  in  this  study:  the  current  marketed  ATV capsules and the new formulation ATV powder.

Depending on the group, ATV was administered alone or boosted with ritonavir (RTV) liquid or capsule formulation, in combination with 2 NRTIs.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study AI424020. This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label study conducted in the United States and South Africa to determine the safety, PK, and optimal dose of ATV powder  and  capsules,  administered  with  or  without  RTV,  in  ART-naive  and  experienced  pediatric subjects with HIV aged 91 days to 21 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

AI424020:  Phase  1/2,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  study  of atazanavir  in  combination  regimens  in  antiretroviral  therapy-naïve  and experienced HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents.

## Methods

## Objectives

Primary objectives were:

- To determine the PK profile and dosing schedule of the capsule formulation for ATV and ATV/RTV in combination with 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected pediatric subjects;
- To determine the PK profile and dosing schedule for the powder formulation of ATV and ATV/RTV in combination with 2 NRTIs in HIV-infected pediatric subjects;
-  To  determine the safety and tolerability of ATV and ATV/RTV in combination with 2 NRTIs in HIVinfected pediatric subjects.

Key Secondary objectives include the antiretroviral activity and the development of virologic resistance during treatment with ATV and ATV/RTV.

## Study design

The study was conducted in two steps:

- Step 1 : a dose finding PK and safety study, conducted in US and South Africa, divided in two Parts:
- o Part  A:  ATV  dose-finding  where  subjects  received  ATV  without  RTV  plus  2  NRTIs  (excluding ABC and TDF).
- o Part B: ATV/RTV dose finding where subjects received ATV plus RTV plus 2 NRTIs (excluding ABC and TDF).

Eligible  subjects  were  assigned  to  treatment  groups,  stratified  by  age,  ATV  formulation,  and concomitant administration of RTV:

| ATYwithoutRTV   | ATVwithRTV   | Formulation   | Age Ranges                     |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Group 1         | Group 5      | Powder        | Infants 3 months to ≤ 2 years  |
| Group 2         | Group 6      | Powder        | Children > 2 to ≤ 13 years     |
| Group 3         | Group 7      | Capsules      | Children > 2 to ≤ 13 years     |
| Group 4         | Group 8      | Capsules      | Adolescents > 13 to ≤ 21 years |
|                 | Group 5A     | Powder        | Infants 3 months to ≤ 2 years  |

First, 5 subjects were enrolled in each group to receive the starting dose of ATV at 310 mg/m² QD, +/RTV 100 mg/m² QD (up to 100 mg QD). If the dose acceptance criteria were not met, the ATV dose was either decreased or increased. If dose acceptance criteria were met, an additional 5 subjects were enrolled at the same dose and the regimen evaluated once more with 10 total subjects. The design of this Step 1 is as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Step 2 : a long-term safety extension that was initiated for the sole purpose of continuing treatment for  subjects  in  South  Africa  who  had  achieved  virologic  response,  would  benefit  from  continued treatment in the opinion of the investigator and protocol team, or had reached Week 96 of treatment and could not otherwise obtain the therapy as it was not yet marketed/approved.

## Study population /Sample size

Enrolled subjects were ART-naive or experienced HIV infants, children and adolescents from 3 months to 21 years of age, with HIV RNA ≥ 5000 c/ml. This study was to enrol a minimum of 152 subjects (including at least 60 subjects from South Africa).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Virologic response (HIV RNA measurements) was assessed using response rates for:

- Virologic one log suppression (VOLS) in the Treated Subjects population
- Virologic response (VR) and virologic response in observed cases (VR-OC)
- Time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR)

Resistance was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic resistance samples collected at the screening visit and at the time of premature discontinuation or the end of the study.

Subjects  had  intensive,  24-hour  PK  sampling  at  Week  1,  and  again  at  Week  56  for  those  who continued on study. Intensive, 24-hour PK sampling was performed 2 weeks after a new dose of ATV had been initiated.

## Statistical Methods

The analysis of efficacy parameters incorporated 2 methods of handling missing data: Non-Completer = Failure (NC = F, 'modified intention-to-treat [ITT]'), where subjects with missing measurements are treated as failures; and Non-Completer = Missing (NC = M, 'Observed Cases'), where subjects with missing measurements are excluded from the analysis.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

The first patient first visit occurred on 16-Nov-2000, and the study was initially closed to accrual on 24-Jan-2007, with 183 subjects enrolled and 182 subjects treated. The age distribution was as follows:

## PK results

## ATV without RTV:

No acceptable dose was found for ATV oral powder without RTV in Groups 1 and 2 due to relatively high oral clearance in pediatric subjects and increased variability. In order to maintain the protocolspecified Cmin (no child &lt; 60 ng/mL, and ≤ 2 of 10 children &lt; 120 ng/mL), the ATV dose had to be increased such that ATV AUC and Cmax values for Group 3 at 520 mg/m 2  and Group 4 at 620 mg/m 2 were 1.5 to 2.5-fold greater than those previously observed in adults receiving ATV 400 mg QD (231 mg/m2 for average adult). ATV AUC(TAU) values were similar to but ATV Cmax values were higher than and Cmin values lower than HIV-positive adults receiving ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD. On average, subjects  less  than  13  years  of  age  (Group  3)  had  higher  peak  to  trough  concentration  ratios, suggesting  that  they  may  not  be  able  to  maintain  adequate  Cmin  values  without  RTV  at  adult equivalent doses of ATV based on body surface area (BSA) or body weight.

## ATV with RTV:

For pediatric subjects from 3 months to 13 years of age (Groups 5 and 6), ATV powder at a dose of 310 mg/m 2  + 100 mg/m 2  RTV once daily produced AUC and Cmin values that were comparable to adults  receiving  ATV/RTV  300/100  mg  once  daily.  There  was  a  trend  toward  lower  Cmin  values  in subjects  younger  than  2  years  of  age  (Group  5),  but  these  values  were  within  the  range  of  those observed in adults receiving ATV/RTV 300/100 mg once daily. All subjects in Group 5 received total daily doses of 100 to 150 mg of ATV.

For pediatric subjects from 6 years of age to adulthood (Groups 7 and 8), a capsule regimen of ATV 205 mg/m 2  + RTV 100 mg/m 2  once daily produced AUC and Cmin values that were comparable to adults receiving ATV/RTV 300/100 mg once daily. Pediatric subjects in Group 7 have somewhat higher Cmax and lower Cmin values than those in Group 8, but are still within the range of adults receiving ATV/RTV 300/100 QD.

## Efficacy results

Efficacy for the ATV powder Cohort was not analyzed after Week 48 in this study for several reasons. First, a decision had been made that the powder formulation should be administered only boosted with RTV. Second, individual dose adjustments in the boosted arm (ATV/RTV) of the study based on body surface  area  were  such  that  efficacy  information  was  no  longer  useful.  Finally,  the  pediatric development plan included two BMS dose finding studies dedicated to an assessment of boosted ATV powder (AI424397 and AI424451).

In conclusion, Week 48 efficacy results for both ATV formulations and Week 96 efficacy results for ATV capsule are provided:

Overall, virologic and immunologic efficacy was observed with ATV and ATV/RTV across all age groups, with ATV capsule and powder, in treatment-naive subjects and treatment-experienced subjects.

## Safety results

A  total  of  193  subjects  were  treated  in  this  study  (85  with  ATV  and  108  with  ATV/RTV),  and  182 subjects had completed at least 48 weeks of therapy.

27%  of  subjects  (53/193)  discontinued  prior  to  or  on  the  Week  48  visit  while  on  their  initial formulation  of  study  drug.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  clinical  events  or progression and toxicity (7% [14/193] each).

43% of subjects  (83/193)  discontinued  after  the  Week  96  visit  while  on  their  initial  formulation  of study  drug.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  completion  of  treatment  (17% [32/193]) and protocol non-compliance (11% [21/193]).

37/193 treated subjects (19%) discontinued study therapy due to AEs.

## Deaths and SAEs:

Through study, there were 4 deaths reported; all were not considered related to the study drug by the investigators. The  most  common  SAEs  were  blood  bilirubin  increased (33%),  blood  bilirubin unconjugated increased (47/193 [24%]), and hyperbilirubinemia (15%). At Week 48, SAEs were more frequent in adolescents (63%) and adults (60%) than in infants (34%) and children (44%).

## Grade 3 to 4 AEs:

At Week 48, 64% of the subjects (69% ATV; 60% ATV/RTV) reported Grade 3 to 4 AEs. The most common  Grade  3  to  4  AEs  were  laboratory  abnormalities:  blood  bilirubin  unconjugated  increased (46%) and blood bilirubin increased (42%). Grade 3 to 4 AEs (excluding laboratory AEs) reported in ≥ 2% of subjects overall were pyrexia (3%) and AV block (2%).

## Hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice and ocular icterus:

At Week 48, Grade 2 to 4 total bilirubin levels were reported in 65% of subjects (ATV 55% ATV/RTV 73%). Jaundice and ocular icterus were reported for 10% and 23% of subjects, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiac abnormalities:

At Week 48, Grade 2 to 4 cardiac AEs were reported for 8 subjects, all of whom received ATV (9%). One subject had an SAE of cardiomyopathy (Grade 3) and congestive heart failure that led to death. This death occurred 136 days after the last dose of study therapy, and was not considered related to the study drug by the investigator.

Six subjects from the ATV group discontinued due to a cardiac disorder, and 44 subjects (24%) had AV block (ATV 31%, ATV/RTV 19%), including 2 subjects with a second degree AV block.

## Rash:

Overall rash was reported for 45% of subjects (ATV 37%, ATV/RTV 49%), and generalized rash was reported for 14% of subjects (ATV 11%, ATV/RTV 15%).

## AEs within cohorts:

Among  the  pediatric  cohorts,  older  subjects  reported  more  Grade  3  to  4  AEs  (adolescents  70%, children 62%, infants 59%), more Grade 2-4 hyperbilirubinemia (young adults 89%, adolescents 74%, children 78%, infants 66%) and more Grade 2-4 cardiac events (adolescents 9%, children 4%, infants 0%). Conversely, rash was reported for 48% of Infants, 43% of Children, 33% of Adolescents, and 22% of young Adults.

## AEs within formulations:

Among subjects who received ATV capsule or powder formulation (Week 48 analysis), more subjects who received  capsules  had  Grade  3  to  4  AEs  (68%)  compared  with  subjects  who  received  powder (58%). Frequency of Grade 2-4 hyperbilirubinemia was similar (78% and 70%, respectively, in ATV capsule and powder formulations). Grade 2-4 cardiac abnormalities were reported for 7 (6%) subjects receiving  the  capsule  formulation  and  1  (2%)  subject  who  received  powder.  Grade  2-4  Rash  was reported for 14% of subjects receiving either the capsule or powder formulation.

## 2.3.3. Discussion

As expected based on adult data, PK results are not in favour of unboosted ATV in infants and children. Additionally, efficacy results show lower rate of virologic response (&lt; 400 c/ml) with unboosted ATV (40%) than boosted ATV (61%). With ATV/RTV, the selected doses (ATV powder 310 mg/m 2  and ATV capsule 205 mg/m², both boosted with RTV 100 mg/m²) are associated with comparable ATV exposure (AUC and Cmin) in paediatric subjects compared to adults. Of note, a trend towards lower Cmin in subjects &lt; 2 years of age was highlighted.

Safety  results  did  not  highlight  new  or  unexpected  safety  findings  related  to  ATV  in  this  paediatric population.  Overall,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  safety  profiles  of  the  ATV Capsule and Powder formulations. However, a trend to higher AEs in older subjects (and therefore in more subjects treated by ATV Capsule) could be noted.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Study  AI424020  was  initiated  in  2000  with  several  interim  reports.  In  2008,  the  interim  Week  48 clinical study report was submitted (type II variation 494/II/57) in order to extend the use of Reyataz for children ≥ 6 years of age with the current formulation (Reyataz capsules) and for children from 3 months  to  6  years  of  age  with  a  new  formulation  (Reyataz  oral  powder).  However,  the  CHMP  has concluded  in  2010  after  several  RSI  (EMA/CHMP/288775/2015)  that  data  were  too  limited  and  the study  suffered  from  critical  deficiencies  to  support  an  indication  under  6  year  of  age  with  the  new formulation. In conclusion, on the basis of this study, the indication of Reyataz was only extended to children ≥ 6 years of age with the current marketed capsules.

Recently , the MAH has submitted a new paediatric extension (procedure EMEA/H/C/494/X/94/G) with the Reyataz oral powder formulation for extending the indication to children from 3 months of age. The results  of  additional  paediatric  studies  (the  Phase  3  studies  PRINCE  I  and  PRINCE  II)  have  been submitted as part of this procedure, as well this currently discussed study AI424020. Although this study was not judged solely appropriate to support the use in young children, it is admitted that it could bring supportive data (mainly safety) in addition to the pivotal PRINCE I and PRINCE II.

In conclusion, no additional recommendation or variation could be issued from this final report of study AI424020.  The  use  of  Reyataz  in  children  from  3  months  of  age  is  now  the  subject  of  a  specific Application.
