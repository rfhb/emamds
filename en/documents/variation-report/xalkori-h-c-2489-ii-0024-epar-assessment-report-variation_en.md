## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## About the disease

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and it is estimated that more patients will die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancer combined. In 2012, the annual incidence of lung cancer worldwide was 23.1 per 100,000 persons, and the incidence was higher in men (34.2 per 100,000) than women (13.6 per 100,000) according to estimates from the World Health Organization and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN project. In Europe, lung cancer had an incidence of 46.6 per 100,000 men and 15.1 per 100,000 women (Ferlay et al, 2013). In the US, the incidence of lung or bronchial cancer was 76.4 per 100,000 men and 52.7 per 100,000 women (Howlander et al, 2012). Most lung cancers (85%) are NSCLC (Tyczynski et al, 2003) that present as inoperable locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) disease with no curative treatment available. United States (US) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

End Results (SEER) data indicated that the 5-year survival rate between 2002 and 2008 among all patients with NSCLC was 17.5% (Howlander et al, 2012). However, 5-year survival rates have been shown to be 5% and &lt;1% for Stage IIIB and Stage IV NSCLC, respectively (Reck, 2012).

NSCLC is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 2013).

Standard first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC of any histological subtype consisting normally of platinum-based chemotherapy has modest impact on efficacy outcomes, as objective response rates (ORRs) in the range of 15% to 32% have been reported with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3 to 6 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 8 to 12 months (1-year OS survival probabilities ranging from 34% to 44%) (Sandleret al, 2006; Scagliotti et al, 2008; Schiller et al, 2002; Herbst et al, 2004; Herbst et al, 2005; Kelly et al, 2001).

Evolution from the use of platinum doublets for all patients regardless of histology began to change with (1) the addition of bevacizumab, an antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to carboplatin/paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC, which prolonged survival compared to the chemotherapy doublet alone resulting in a median OS of 12.3 months in the randomized Phase 3 study (Sandler et al, 2006); and (2) the addition of pemetrexed into first-line platinum-containing doublets, which showed that pemetrexed/cisplatin was generally better tolerated than gemcitabine/cisplatin. The efficacy of this regimen, based on OS, was superior to gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with NSCLC of non-squamous cell histology whereas the opposite was observed in patients with NSCLC of squamous cell histology (Scagliotti et al, 2008). Retrospective analyses of the second-line studies with single-agent pemetrexed indicated selective benefit of this agent in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Consequently, in all lines of therapy, the approved product label restricts pemetrexed usage to non-squamous histology only (Alimta EU SmPC).

With the evolving understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, agents that target specific molecular signalling pathways, particularly in genetically defined subsets of patients, have become the goal of cancer drug development. Examples include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib (Iressa), afatinib (Giotrif) and erlotinib (Tarceva), which have been shown to be effective in patients with specific activating EGFR mutations (Lynch et al, 2004; Pao et al, 2004). In the international, randomized, Phase 3, IRESSA Pan-Asia Study (IPASS) study, gefitinib was shown to significantly improve PFS compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy in the first-line advanced disease treatment setting in those patients whose tumours were positive for EGFR-activating mutations (Mok et al, 2009); however no OS benefit was demonstrated, as 95% of patients assigned to the control arm received second-line gefitinib (Iressa EPAR). Studies have also shown statistically significant benefit for the irreversible EGFR TKI, afatinib, when compared with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for advanced and metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. There was a statistically significant improvement in PFS with the use of afatinib versus cisplatin/pemetrexed in LUX-Lung 3 (median 11.1 months vs. 6.7 months; HR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.65; p-value=0.001) (Giotrif EPAR) and versus cisplatin/gemcitabine in LUX-Lung 6 (11.0 vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.39; p-value&lt; 0.001) (Wu et al, 2014). The EURTAC study has also shown statistically significant improved PFS of Tarceva used as monotherapy versus platinum based doublet chemotherapy (median 10.4 months vs. 5.1 months; HR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.49; p-value &lt;0.0001) in the first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (Tarceva EPAR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One of the newer molecular targets identified in NSCLC is the echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion oncogene. To date, at least 27 different ALK fusion variants have been reported in the literature, of which EML4-ALK is the predominant isoform (Ou et al, 2012). ALKpositive NSCLC constitutes a molecularly defined subgroup with an estimated prevalence of 3% to 5% of NSCLC (Garber, 2010; Choi et al, 2010). Currently, crizotinib (Xalkori) and ceritinib (Zykadia) are approved in this targeted population of ALK positive patients.

## About the product

Xalkori (crizotinib) is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and its oncogenic variants (i.e., ALK fusion events and selected ALK mutations). Crizotinib is also an inhibitor of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-Met), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON) RTKs. Xalkori received a conditional approval in the EU on 23 October 2012, for the treatment of adults with previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

This application is to extend the indication of Xalkori to the first-line treatment ALK-positive advanced NSCLC on the basis of results from Study A8081014 (also referred to as study 1014), a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of crizotinib to first-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC and updated safety results from Studies A8081001, A8081005 and A8081007 (also referred to as study 1001, 1005 and 1007). In addition to the clinical study report for study A8081014, the efficacy and safety analyses of patients with ALKpositive NSCLC of non-adenocarcinoma histology from studies A8081001, A8081005, A8081007 and A8081014 have been included as part of this application.

In addition, the MAH requested the conversion of the marketing authorisation from conditional to full based on the fact that two randomised phase 3 studies showing benefit of crizotinib versus standardof-care chemotherapy in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC would constitute comprehensive clinical data.

The proposed and recommended indication is as follows: XALKORI is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH submitted a justification for not performing the ERA.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

A justification has been provided for not performing an updated Environmental Risk Assessment. The already submitted ERA for the initial Marketing Authorisation covers the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC irrespective of line of treatment therapy. Also considering that no changes of the maximum therapeutic dose were recommended, the MAH justification (in accordance with the EMA guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is considered acceptable.

## 2.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

In the pivotal study A8081014, the PK of crizotinib, including its active moieties, based on population PK (POPPK) methods, was evaluated as secondary objective. In addition, the correlations between PK and response were also explored.

At the time of the initial MA, the MAH was requested to provide further PK analyses on dose proportionality, due to the non-linear pharmacokinetics of crizotinib in humans. Furthermore, the CHMP recommended conducting a definitive Exposure-Response (ER) analysis on final data from Study A8081014.

To fulfil these requests, steady-state trough plasma concentration values following 250 mg BID during repeated treatment cycles and ER analysis of selected efficacy endpoints (e.g. ORR, PFS, OS) have been submitted by the MAH.

## 2.3.2.1. Pharmacokinetics

Plasma samples were analysed for crizotinib and PF-06260182 (lactam metabolite; the most abundant metabolite of crizotinib in plasma) concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) method. Blood samples for analysis of crizotinib and active moieties concentrations processed in local laboratories at all sites were unit-standardized. When comparison of laboratory test results was performed, laboratory tests expressed as continuous (quantitative) variables were normalized by a linear transformation.

A total of 169 patients who were treated with crizotinib and had at least 1 measured plasma concentration of crizotinib or its metabolite, PF-06260182 were included in PK concentration population. A total of 66 (39.1%) patients were male and 103 (60.9%) were female.  A total of 89 (52.7%) patients were White, 76 (45.0%) were Asian, none were Black, and 4 (2.4%) were of other races.

Crizotinib capsules, 250 mg twice daily (BID), were to be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Cycles were defined in 21-day periods.

In the crizotinib arm only, plasma samples for PK assessment were to be obtained prior to (predose) and around the time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) following morning dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 5. No predose sample was to be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1.

## Absorption

One hundred and sixty-two (162) patients provided at least 1 predose (0 hours) plasma concentration of crizotinib or PF-06260182. The geometric mean predose concentrations (Ctrough) of crizotinib and of PF-06260182 both following 250 mg BID dosing of crizotinib are reported in the table below.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

Correlation of ALK gene fusion variants to outcome measures was a secondary endpoint of study A8081014.

A mandatory tumour sample (archived or fresh) was required at screening for detecting ALK gene fusion events (inclusion criterion 2). The Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH test was used as primary assay and all samples were to be analysed by the central laboratory.

A summary of descriptive statistics for percentage of ALK-positive cells by the central laboratory investigational-use only (IUO) diagnostic test (Abbott Molecular) is provided in the table below.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD Modelling

As recommended by the CHMP, the MAH conducted an Exposure-Response (ER) analysis of efficacy endpoints for crizotinib study A8081014 (PMAR-EQDD-A808a-sNDA-319). The objectives of this ER analysis were:

- To perform crizotinib ER analysis of selected efficacy endpoints (Objective Response Rate [ORR], Progression-free survival [PFS] that is the only primary endpoint of the study and overall survival [OS]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate effect modifiers (interactions between covariates and exposure) in these ER analyses of crizotinib efficacy.

## Methods

Model assumptions were made based on data from 2 previous studies in which 3 exposure measures were analysed: Ctrough (average crizotinib trough concentration), mCtrough (average metabolite trough concentration) and Cavg,ss (population model predicted steady-state average crizotinib concentration). The 2 previous studies were the following: Study A8081005 and Study A8081007.

Also in study A8081014 ER analysis, 3 sets of exposure measures were used:

- -Arithmetic mean of observed steady-state (≥ Cycle 2 Day 1; cycle length is 21 days) trough value (Ctrough) for crizotinib up to 5 cycles of crizotinib treatment or at the time of data cut-off.
- -Arithmetic mean of observed steady-state (≥ Cycle 2 Day 1) trough value (mCtrough) for PF06260182 up to 5 cycles of crizotinib treatment or at the time of data cut-off.
- -Predicted average steady-state concentration values (Cavg,ss) for crizotinib, based on steadystate clearance from the population PK model and the average total daily dose. This exposure measure was only planned to be used in the analysis if at least 20% of patients had a missing crizotinib Ctrough value.

The exposure measure for the crizotinib metabolite was based only on observed concentrations since a population PK model was not available for this metabolite.

Analyses were performed using generalized linear models and Cox proportional hazards models. Cox regression models were used for time-to-event endpoints. All potential confounders were included in each of the logistic regression and the Cox regression models. The following covariates were reported: Race group (Asian vs. Non-Asian), Baseline body weight (BWT), Baseline creatinine clearance (BCCL), gender (male vs. female), Age, Baseline ECOG Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. ≥ 1), PPI use (yes/no), CYP3A Inhibitor use (CYP3A Inh), CYP3A inducer use (CYP3A Ind), Baseline sum of longest lesion diameters (SLD), Actual total dose/number of days on treatment (Dose/day).

Logistic regression models were used for binary endpoints.

A modelling approach was used to control for potential confounders, and explore potential effect modifiers. The potential effect modifiers were evaluated individually including interactions between the potential effect modifiers and the exposure metric. No detailed model building for interactions was planned or done.

In order to estimate the model predictability for ORR, the residual deviance was used as the primary measure of model fit. Moreover diagnostics were assessed using plot of observed and predicted response versus exposure to evaluate the predictive performance for the model for ORR.

## Results

In the Study A8081014, 340 patients were included in the dataset, 171 in the crizotinib arm, 169 in the chemotherapy arm (pemetrexed/carboplatin or pemetrexed/cisplatin).

Approximately linear relationship was shown between crizotinib Ctrough and the average metabolite Ctrough (mCtrough). The Pearson correlation coefficient of the 2 exposure measures was 0.83. Approximately linear relationship was shown also between average crizotinib Ctrough and population PK predicted crizotinib exposure (Cavg,ss). The Pearson correlation coefficient of the 2 exposure measures was 0.85.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the population modelling analysis report (PMAR) the ER relationship between each efficacy endpoints - ORR, PFR and OS - and the exposure measures - Ctrough, mCtrough and predicted Cavg,ss was analysed. No statistically significant exposure-response relationship, e.g. p-value&gt;0.05, was found for any of the exposure measures.

ER relationship of each model changed after adjusting for potential confounders. This indicates that there was a degree of confounding with the ER relationship in the unadjusted model. However, in most cases no statistically significant interaction was observed between the measures of exposure and the potential effect modifiers.

Statistically significant relationships were detected when analysing all the exposure measures log(Ctrought), log(mCtrought) and log(Cavg,ss) - with concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) usage in the ORR results.

Observed and average model-predicted ORR tended to increase with increasing exposure, as shown in the below figure.

(ePharmacologyArtifactID,8648044)

## Figure 1: Observed and average model-predicted objective response rates for average crizotinib Ctrough.

The increase in ORR with increasing exposure was larger in patients using PPIs than in patients with no PPI use.

Cox regression analysis showed that higher exposures corresponded to numerically longer PFS for all 3 exposure measures. For this endpoint, the ER relationship was not statistically significant (pvalue&gt;0.05) for all 3 exposure measures. There were no statistically significant effect modifiers of the ER relationship for PFS for any of the exposure metrics.

Cox regression analysis of OS showed that higher exposures corresponded to numerically longer event times for all 3 exposure measures. However, none of the exposure measures were statistically significant (p-value&gt;0.05) exposure-response effect for OS. Statistically significant relationships were detected also when analysing log (Ctrough) and co-administrations of a CYP3A4 inhibitor in the OS analysis. This data indicates that use of CYP3A4 inhibitor is an effect modifier of the ER relationship. In this analysis, higher exposure corresponded to lower hazard, and thus longer OS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional ER analyses (study A8081014 and study A8081007) were conducted by the MAH.

## ER analyses for Study A8081014

Univariate covariate analysis and stepwise covariate selection for ER (efficacy) relationship in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC were conducted. The datasets, sets of exposure and covariates used in these analyses were also reported in PMAR-EQDD-A808a-sNDA-319 (see above). The analyses were conducted for ORR, PFS, and OS using logistic regression models for ORR and Cox regression models for PFS and OS.

The following table summarizes the comparison ER estimates between full models (PMAR-EQDDA808a-sNDA-319) and stepwise backward covariate selection final models.

Logistic regression for ORR showed similar numerical trends for exposure across all models.

There was no statistically significant ER relationship for ORR and no statistically significant covariates were retained in the model through stepwise selection for any of the exposure measures.

For PFS, Cox regression models showed similar numerical trends for exposure across all models. The analysis showed that final model for log(Cavg,ss) which included baseline SLD as the only covariate was statistically significant. Baseline SLD was consistently included in the final model for all 3 exposure measures.

Cox regression models for OS showed similar numerical trends for exposure for all models. The analysis showed that final model for all 3 exposure measures was statistically significant. Significant covariates included Asian race, BWT and baseline ECOG PS in the stepwise selection analyses.

OS data were immature as only 22% of the patients with a crizotinib Ctrough have reached the survival endpoint and the median survival time was not achieved (as of the data cut-off).

## ER analyses for Study A8081007

In order to evaluate if trends in the crizotinib ER relationship for previous clinical studies were similar to those with Study 1014, data from Study 1007 were used for a stepwise covariate selection procedure to evaluate the ER relationship for ORR, PFS and OS. Study 1007 is a pivotal randomized phase 3 study which had a similar study design to 1014. The ER analyses using full models (including covariates and modifiers) for Study A8081007 was provided in a previous variation procedure II/0005/G which received a commission decision on 29 January 2014.

The set of covariates used in Study A8081007 differed slightly from those used in Study A8081014. Covariates baseline brain metastases (BBM) and baseline ALT were included in analyses for Study A8081007 but not for Study A8081014, and CYP3A inhibitor use was included in analyses for Study A8081014 but not for Study A8081007. Only log transformed Cavg, ss was included in the analyses as three exposure measures Ctrough, mCtrough and Cavg, ss tended to give similar results.

The Table below summarizes the exposure-response estimates between full models and stepwise backward covariate selection models.

Logistic regression for ORR showed similar numerical trends for exposure for the full and final models and are similar to those observed in Study A8081014.

There was no statistically significant ER relationship for ORR and no statistically significant covariates were retained in the model through stepwise selection for any of the exposure measures. For PFS, Cox regression models showed similar numerical trends for exposure for the full and final models and were similar to those seen in Study A8081014. The analysis showed that final model for log(Cavg,ss) which included baseline SLD as the only covariate was not statistically significant.

Cox regression for OS showed similar numerical trends in exposure for the full and final models and were similar to those observed in Study A8081014. The analyses showed a statistically significant ER relationship with OS for the final model. The final model for log(Cavg,ss) and OS included baseline SLD and baseline ECOG as covariates.

Similarly to Study A8081014, the OS data were immature because the median survival time was not achieved indicating that a majority of patients were censored by the data cut-off.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Greater than proportional increases in crizotinib AUC and Cmax were observed over the 200-300 mg BID dose in patients (during the initial MA). Consequently, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of steady-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

state trough concentration following 250 mg BID crizotinib cannot be precisely predicted by singledose. To investigate steady-state trough plasma concentration values following 250 mg BID crizotinib during repeated treatment cycles, the MAH submitted the results of the phase 3, randomized, openlabel study A8081014.

The PK method and sample timing were considered appropriate and in line with information reported in the Xalkori SmPC.

The analysis of pre-dose concentrations indicates that crizotinib and its active moieties, PF-06260182, reach the steady-state plasma concentrations within the first cycle after repeated oral administration of crizotinib 250 mg BID. Asian patients appeared to exhibit slightly higher Ctrough, ss mean for crizotinib and PF-06260182 than non-Asian patients confirming a slightly higher systemic exposure in Asian patients. However, the geometric mean ratios of PF-06260182 to crizotinib Ctrough, ss were similar between Asian and non-Asian patients.

One of the secondary objectives of the A8081014 study was to evaluate the PK of crizotinib, including its active moieties, using PopPK methods and explore correlations between PK and response.

The demographic characteristics were well balanced between the 2 randomized treatment arms but they were relatively less balanced across the four exposure quantiles for a few variables (eg, gender, baseline body weight, Asian race, proton pump inhibitor [PPI] usage, SLD) which necessitates a modelling approach to adjust for the potential confounders in order to appropriately assess the ER relationship.

Only numerical trends in the overall ER relationship could be observed in the ER study: i) logistic regression analysis showed that higher exposure corresponded to numerically higher ORR for all the 3 exposure measures; ii) Cox regression analysis showed that higher exposure corresponded to numerically higher PFS for all the exposure measures analysed, and iii) Cox regression of OS showed that higher exposure corresponded to numerically longer event times for all the exposure measures analysed. Because OS data are immature, the analysis of the OS data is limited.

The evaluation of interactions between covariate and exposure modifiers shows that the increase in ORR with increasing exposure was larger in patients using PPIs than in patients with no PPI use. This finding may suggest that a complex interaction occurs. Previous PopPK analysis indicated that PPIs decreased crizotinib Ka when concomitantly administered. Yet, co-administration with PPIs has no clinically relevant effect on exposure to crizotinib. Also, CYP3A4 inhibitor use is an effect modifier of the ER relationship given that higher exposure corresponds to lower hazard, and thus longer OS. However it is difficult to properly adjust for many covariates in logistic and Cox regression models when there is limited number of evaluable events in subgroups with different covariates for endpoint.

Additional exposure-response analyses in studies A8081014 and A8081007 were conducted by the MAH. The univariate covariate analysis and stepwise covariate selection in Study A8081014 showed no statistically significant covariates for ORR, while all covariates reported as statistically significant for OS and PFS (i.e. SLD, Asian, BWT and ECOG) were intrinsic factors.

Regarding the exposure-response analysis in study A8081007, differently from what done in study A8081014, 'CYP3A inhibitor use' covariate was not included. However, consistently with results reported for study A8081014, also in this case the only covariates statistically significant were intrinsic factors (i.e. ECOG and SLD).

One of the secondary endpoint was the analysis of the correlation between ALK gene fusion variants (either no rearrangement or one of the specific rearrangements V1, V2, V3a, V3b, V3a/b, V4, V5a, V6, V7) and outcome measures. However, the number of patients with each ALK gene fusion variant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

detected using the PCR test was too small to draw any valid conclusions with respect to outcome measures.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Results of the pharmacokinetic assessment of plasma concentrations (based on sparse sampling) in Study A8081014 and of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) analysis for efficacy endpoints in Study A8081014 were consistent with those from previous studies of Xalkori. No changes to the SmPC are warranted.

## 2.4.2. Main study

Study  A8081014 : Phase  3,  randomized,  open-Label  study  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of crizotinib  versus  pemetrexed/cisplatin  or  pemetrexed/carboplatin  in  previously  untreated patients with non-squamous carcinoma of the lung harbouring a translocation or inversion event involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene locus

## Methods

## Study participants

Female or male patients, 18 years of age or older, were eligible if they had locally advanced recurrent or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC based on histological or cytological diagnosis.

ALK-positive status was determined by the Abbott Molecular IUO test performed by a central laboratory under US FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE).

Patients were required to have tumours with measurable disease according to RECIST (version 1.1) and an ECOG PS of 0-2.

Patients must have had no prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease with the exception of prior adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage I-III or combined modality chemotherapyradiation for locally advanced disease, which was allowed if completed &gt;12 months prior to documented disease progression.

Patients with brain metastases were only eligible if treated and neurologically stable with no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization, and if they were not taking any medications contraindicated by protocol exclusion criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Any major surgeries must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, while at least 2 weeks were required for any prior radiation (except palliative) or minor surgeries/procedures. In case of palliative radiation (≤10 fractions), it must have been completed 48 hours prior to crizotinib therapy commencing. In addition, an adequate organ function was required.

Patients previously exposed to therapy directly targeting ALK and with baseline severe medical conditions (i.e., ongoing congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmias Grade≥2, history of extensive disseminated/bilateral or known presence of Grade 3/4 interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease) were excluded from the study.

## Treatments

All patients were required to take folic acid, 350-1000 μg orally daily and to receive Vitamin B12, 1000 μg (1 injection IM or as required by local standard of care/regulations) for seven days prior to randomization, starting approximately 7 days before beginning treatment.

## Crizotinib arm:

Crizotinib, 250 mg BID, was taken orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Cycles were defined in 21-day periods to facilitate scheduling of visits and assessments. Patients were required to continue with folic acid, 350-1000 μg orally on a daily basis through completion of the first cycle only (up to 3 weeks).

It was allowed to continue crizotinib treatment as assigned beyond the time of RECIST-defined disease progression, as assessed by Independent Radiology Review (IRR), at the discretion of the investigator if the patient was perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.

## Chemotherapy arm:

The chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin or carboplatin combined with pemetrexed) was chosen by the investigator after randomization. The maximum number of chemotherapy treatment cycles allowed was 6.

Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin :

Pemetrexed, 500 mg/m 2 , was administered IV over 10 minutes or according to institutional administration timing on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, in combination with Cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) or Carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg.min/mL), administered approximately 30 minutes after the end of pemetrexed infusion.

Patients were also required to continue to take folic acid (350-1000 μg orally daily) until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed, and to receive Vitamin B12 (1000 μg every 9 weeks) until discontinuation of chemotherapy.

Premedication with corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone, 4 mg given twice daily) was required the day before, the day of, and the day after pemetrexed dosing, in order to reduce potential cutaneous reactions.

After 6 cycles patients were to continue in the study without further treatment, having ongoing tumour assessments until RECIST-defined disease progression as determined by IRR.

In case of progression of disease, patients were allowed to cross-over to receive crizotinib treatment.

In both treatment arms, following the discontinuation of study treatment, survival status was to be collected every 2 months until death or until 18 months after the randomization of the last patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objectives

The primary study objective was to demonstrate the crizotinib superior efficacy in terms of prolonged PFS compared to first-line chemotherapy with either pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in patients with previously untreated ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

As secondary objectives, additional measures of clinical efficacy (ORR, OS, DCR, TTP and TTR), the safety and tolerability compared to chemotherapy, the crizotinib PK profile, the correlation of ALK gene fusion variants to outcome measures, the Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) and the health care resource utilization (HCRU) were also investigated in the trial.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was PFS based on RECIST 1.1, with disease progression events assessed by IRR. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

The efficacy secondary endpoints assessed were:

-ORR (determined by IRR) was defined as the percentage of patients with CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1.1, as determined by IRR, relative to the FA population;

- OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause.#;

- Disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks was defined as the percentage of patients with CR, PR, or stable disease at 12 weeks according to RECIST Version 1.1, as determined by IRR, relative to the FA population;

- times to overall, intracranial and extracranial progression (TTP, IC-TTP, EC-TTP), the rate of OS at 1 year and 18 months, duration of response (DR), and time to tumour response (TTR).

As additional secondary endpoints, safety, PK/PD, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and health care resource utilization (HCRU) were evaluated.

## Sample size

Considering that a total of 229 PFS events in the two arms, using a 1-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025, is required to detect a 50% improvement in PFS (from 6 to 9 months) with 85% power, a total sample size of 294 patients is required, assuming non-uniform accrual over approximately 25 months and follow-up of at least 8 months after the last patient is randomized. To account for events being censored, for example due to potential discordance between the investigators and independent radiology review, approximately 40 extra patients were planned to be enrolled for a total sample size of 334 patients (167 in each treatment arm).

## Randomisation

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio based on a random permutated block design using a centralized Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/website to receive either crizotinib or chemotherapy.

The randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (0-1 or 2), race (Asian or non-Asian), and baseline brain metastases (presence or absence).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients randomized to chemotherapy with disease progression as assessed by IRR were permitted to cross-over to crizotinib treatment provided that relevant safety screening criteria for crizotinib were met.

## Statistical methods

## Primary efficacy analysis

PFS was analysed in the full analysis (FA) population defined as defined all patients who were randomized with study drug assignment designated according to the initial randomization. This was the primary population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints.

Estimates of the PFS curves were obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method and were displayed graphically. Differences in PFS between treatment arms were analysed by the log rank test stratified for baseline factors. The median event time (and other quartiles) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were provided for each treatment arm. Additionally, for each treatment arm the median PFS and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were provided for each level of the stratification variables. The Cox regression model, stratified for baseline stratification factors, was fitted. The estimated hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% CI was provided.

## Secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint

The potential influences of the stratification factors and other baseline patient characteristics were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. As secondary analyses for PFS an unstratified log-rank test and Cox regression model was used. PFS based on the investigator assessment was summarized for subgroups: 1) the patients randomized to crizotinib ; 2) patients randomized to chemotherapy; 3) patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to receive crizotinib, beginning from the first day of crizotinib treatment. The total event disagreement rate between PFS based on IRR and the investigator assessment of tumour data was calculated.

## Secondary efficacy analyses

One-year and 18-month survival probabilities were based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in OS between treatment arms were analysed by a 1-sided log-rank test stratified for baseline stratification factors. Estimates of the OS curves obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method were presented.  Analysis of OS was also performed by treatment group. The Cox regression model, stratified for baseline stratification factors, was fitted. The estimated hazard ratio and its 95% CI was provided. In order to take into account that in case of progression of disease, patients were allowed to receive crizotinib treatment the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) was used as a sensitivity analysis.

ORR was summarized for each treatment arm along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI using a method based on the F-distribution. ORR between the 2 treatment arms was compared using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for baseline stratification factors and a 2-sided unstratified test (e.g., Pearson). Treatment difference of ORR and its 95% CI based on the normal distribution were provided. Analysis of ORR was also performed by treatment group. DCR at Week 12 was analysed similarly as described for ORR.

## Best overall response was summarized by treatment arm.

TTR was summarized by descriptive statistics in the subgroup of responders (CR and PR) and in the subgroup of the patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to receive crizotinib based on investigator assessment of response using descriptive statistics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DR was summarized for the subgroup of responders (CR and PR) and in in the subgroup of the patients randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to receive crizotinib based on investigator assessment of response using using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median event time (if appropriate) and 2-sided 95% CI for the median for each treatment arm were provided.

TTP, IC-TTP and EC-TTP analysed for subgroups of patients with and without brain metastases at baseline. Differences between treatment arms were analysed by the unstratified log rank test. Estimates of the curves obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method were presented.

All patients from the FA population who completed a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline PRO assessment prior to cross-over or end of randomized study treatment were included in the PRO evaluable population used for the analysis of change from baseline scores and TTD in patient-reported pain in chest, dyspnea and cough.

The study was designed to have an interim analysis and a final analysis for the primary endpoint. The interim analysis was planned after 103 (45%) PFS events, with the aim to allow early stopping of the study for futility, to assess safety, and to allow for sample size re-estimation based on the method outlined by Cui et al (1999). The O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundary was used for efficacy and the Rho (rho=1.5) stopping boundary (non-binding was used for futility). Both Type I and II error rates was preserved. The final analysis has been conducted after achievement of the pre-specified 229 events.

The original Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was amended twice. The main changes included in Version 2.0 (dated 22 January 2013) were the removal of the second interim analysis of efficacy/futility for PFS and the postponement of the planned first interim analysis to after 45% instead of 35% of PFS events.

In the amended SAP Version 2.1 (dated 14 February 2014), endpoints and statistical analyses to evaluate treatment activity in patients with or without brain metastases were added.

Additional changes to planned analyses that were implemented after the database snapshot included:

- Analysis  of  PFS,  ORR,  OS  and  AEs  by  type  of  chemotherapy  individually  (pemetrexed  + cisplatin or pemetrexed + carboplatin).
- Evaluation  of  ORR,  TTR  and  DR  for  cross-over  patients  in  the  'Response  Evaluation' population, defined as all patients with an adequate baseline disease assessment (at the time of cross-over) and at least 1 post-cross-over assessment or who discontinued the study.

Protocol Amendment 8 was implemented after the data cut-off date for the submitted CSR.

Significant protocol deviations, mainly related to failure to obtain informed consent (12.2%) and treatment administration (11.7%), were registered in 41.1% of patients. During the course of the study, 3 Protocol Deviation Alert Letters (i.e. reminder to perform pregnancy testing, to select and confirm use of appropriate contraception, and to repeat ALT and total bilirubin laboratory test when symptomatic or within 7 days for crizotinib-treated patients with Grade 2 ALT elevation) were sent to Investigators.

## Numbers analysed

Overall, 343 patients (172 randomized to crizotinib and 171 randomized to chemotherapy) were included in the FA population. At the time of the final PFS analysis, 120 (70.2%) patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm received subsequent crizotinib treatment (109 patients through the crossover process and 11 patients as subsequent follow up therapy).

## Outcomes and estimation

The median duration of study treatment was 47.4 weeks in the crizotinib arm and 18 weeks in the chemotherapy group for which a maximum of 6 cycles was permitted, with median relative dose intensities of 98.9% for crizotinib and 94.4-96.3% across the individual chemotherapy agents (i.e., pemetrexed, cisplatin, carboplatin).

## Patient- Reported Outcomes (PROs)

Patient-reported symptoms and global QOL were collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). A total of 166 patients in the crizotinib arm and 163 patients in the chemotherapy arm had completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires at baseline and at least 1 post baseline visit.

Significantly greater improvement in global QOL was observed in the crizotinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (overall difference in change from baseline scores 13.8; p value &lt;0.0001).

A clinically meaningful (≥10-point) improvement from baseline was observed in the crizotinib arm at Cycles 9 and 10, while clinically meaningful (≥10-point) deterioration was observed in the chemotherapy arm on Cycle 1 Day 7.

The individual component symptoms included in the composite endpoint have been also analysed separately. A significantly longer TTD was registered in dyspnoea with crizotinib in comparison to chemotherapy (7.6 months versus 1.4 months, HR: 0.548, 95% CI: 0.404, 0.744, Hochberg-adjusted log-rank 2-sided p-value=0.0005).

Regarding the EQ-5D questionnaire, the results of the within patients analyses showed a statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.05) improvement from baseline in EQ-5D VAS general health status scores in the crizotinib arm (Cycles 3 to 16 and 18 to 21) and no statistically significant change from baseline in the chemotherapy arm over the first 6 cycles. A statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.05) greater improvement was observed in EQ-5D VAS general health status scores in the crizotinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm.

In the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire, in response to the first question (' Have you experienced any visual disturbances? '), 33% to 67% of patients reported experiencing a visual disturbance in the crizotinib arm and 13% to 21% in the chemotherapy arm. In both treatment arms, the majority of patients (73%-100% with crizotinib and &gt;60% with chemotherapy) who reported experiencing a visual disturbance had an event frequency of &gt;1 day per week. In the crizotinib arm, visual disturbances were reported as occurred in the morning by 38% to 63% of patients and as occurred in the evening by 56% to 86% of patients. Most patients reported each event lasting ≤1 minute in both arms. The most commonly experienced visual disturbances were appearance of shimmering/flashing/trailing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lights, streamers/strings/floaters, and overlapping shadows/after images in the crizotinib arm, and hazy/blurry vision in the chemotherapy group. For most patients with a visual disturbance at each cycle in the crizotinib arm, visual effects were reported as not at all or a little bothersome, and no or minimal impact (scores 0 to 3) on daily activities at each cycle was indicated.

## Ancillary analyses

Several secondary and sensitivity analyses for both primary and secondary endpoints were conducted.

In particular, pre-specified sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of cross-over on OS, specifically, for the potentially confounding effects of subsequent crizotinib treatment (n=120 patients) in the chemotherapy arm and of subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) (n= 21 patients) in the crizotinib arm. With the Rank-Preserving Structural Failure Time Model (RPSFTM), two approaches (i.e, the Wilcoxon and logrank tests) were used to derive parameters to correct for cross-over. After adjusting for cross-over, the HRs for OS were 0.604 (95% CI: 0.265, 1.420) and 0.674 (95% CI: 0.283, 1.483) based on the Wilcoxon and log-rank tests, respectively.

Kaplan-Meier plots of OS after adjusting for cross-over by RPSFTM using the Wilcoxon and log-rank tests are presented below:

Further to the CHMP request, the MAH has performed additional sensitivity analyses for Study 1014, to estimate the effect of crizotinib on OS in the presence of crossover, using the two-stage and the IPE methods.

The two-stage model (Latimer and Abrams, 2014), with Log-normal distribution for OS was applied to two sets of analyses: an analysis unadjusted for the differences in patient's characteristics between crossover and non-crossover patients and an analysis that take into account for differences in patients characteristics.

The Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE) method (Branson and Whitehead 2002) was conducted to adjust for the impact of crossover from chemotherapy to crizotinib and from crizotinib to chemotherapy and estimate the treatment effect for OS in Study 1014.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

## Non-adenocarcinoma histology

Further to a CHMP request in the context of variation EMEA/H/C/002489/II/0004, a subgroup efficacy and safety analysis in patients with adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histology has been submitted, including Study A8081014 (before cross-over) and Study A8081005.

A summary of efficacy results by histology groups in both studies are reported in the following table:

In study A8081005, information is available from 45 response-evaluable patients with previously treated non adenocarcinoma NSCLC (including 22 patients with SCC). Partial responses were observed in 20 of 45 patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC for an ORR of 44%, and 9 of 22 patients with SCC NSCLC for an ORR of 41%, both of which were less than the ORR reported in Study A8081005 (54%) for all patients (see SmPC section 5.1).

## Elderly population

Of the 171 patients treated with crizotinib in randomised Phase 3 Study A8081014, 22 (13%) were 65 years or older. Of 109 patients treated with crizotinib who crossed over from chemotherapy arm, 26

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(24%) were 65 years or older. Of the 172 patients treated with crizotinib in randomised Phase 3 Study A8081007, 27 (16%) were 65 years or older. Of the 154 patients in Study A8081001, 22 (14%) were 65 years or older. Of the 1063 patients in Study A8081005, 173 (16%) were 65 years or older. The frequency of adverse reactions was generally similar for patients &lt;65 years of age and patients ≥ 65 years of age with the exception of oedema and constipation, which were reported with greater frequency (≥15% difference) in Study A8081014 among patients treated with crizotinib ≥ 65 years of age. No patients in the crizotinib arm of randomised Phase 3 Studies A8081007 and A8081014, and single arm Study A8081005 were &gt;85 years. There was one patient &gt;85 years old out of 154 patients in single-arm Study A8081001 (see SmPC section 5.1).

## Supportive studies

As supportive to the crizotinib efficacy in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients, updated OS results from study 1005 (phase 2, open-label, single arm study of crizotinib in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients who had been treated with at least 1 prior treatment) and study 1001 (open-label, single arm study of crizotinib in advanced malignancies, including a cohort with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC) have been submitted.

In particular, in this submission OS data have been updated (data cut-off date 30 November 2013) based on the 905 previously treated patients with ALK-positive (by the IUO) in the SA population for study 1005, and based on 154 patients in the ALK-positive advanced NSCLC cohort in the SA population for study 1001.

As of the data cut-off date, the median duration of treatment was 47.0 weeks (range 0.1 to 192 weeks) in Study 1005 and 56.9 weeks (range 0.7 to 267 weeks) in Study 1001.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of studies

The pivotal trial for this application for an extension of indication is a phase III study (A8081014) designed as an open-label, randomized, 2-arm, international, multicentre trial to assess the efficacy and safety of crizotinib alone versus first-line chemotherapy, i.e., pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC whose tumours harbour ALK fusions.

The primary objective was to demonstrate that crizotinib is superior to first-line chemotherapy, pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin, in prolonging PFS. Secondary objectives notably included OS, ORR, DCR, and QoL. A total of 343 patients were randomized in the study.

Overall, the eligibility criteria are acceptable. The enrolment was restricted to patients with nonsquamous histology, which is acceptable taking into account the expected incidence of ALK mutations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to histology, and furthermore it allowed selecting pemetrexed-based chemotherapy as the comparator. The PI has been updated to reflect the inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding the squamous cell carcinoma histology (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

The patient population was adequately selected on the basis of the diagnostic test Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH.

ECOG PS 2 patients were poorly represented, while patients with brain metastases (asymptomatic and stable) were adequately represented, which is important taking into account the frequency expected in the target population. Prior (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed, provided that DFS was &gt; 12 months. Overall, about 7% of the patients had received prior systemic treatment, balanced in the two arms.

The combination of pemetrexed-based with cisplatin or carboplatin is deemed an adequate control arm in the target population, also considering the results observed in the 1007 trial, in which pemetrexed performed better than docetaxel. Pemetrexed is currently approved as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment in patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinumpemetrexed combination (since September 2011 in EU, see EPAR Alimta), and therefore the inclusion of this option in the control arm would have strengthened the adequacy of the control arm. The MAH argued that the ORR reported with maintenance pemetrexed after 4 cycles induction chemotherapy in studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were low (6.8% and 3%, respectively), however it is not known whether allowing maintenance pemetrexed would have impacted the results, due to a delay in the occurrence of progression in the control arm. It is acknowledged that maintenance treatment with pemetrexed as monotherapy was not considered a standard approach when the study was designed.

In principle, the selection of PFS as the primary endpoint is considered acceptable in this early setting. Since all patients in the control arm were allowed to receive crizotinib at progression, OS results are expected to be confounded. The choice to allow systematic one-way cross-over is justified based on ethical reasons. An additional possible source of bias is the prospect for both investigators' and patients' in the control arm to have access to a targeted treatment. This is much more relevant taking into account that this was an open-label study with PFS as the primary endpoint. To control for the risks of bias, the primary PFS analysis was based on Independent Radiology Review (IRR).

The evaluation of global quality of life, and more particularly the time to deterioration in symptoms (pain in chest, dyspnoea, or cough), based on validated and widely used PRO instruments, was among the secondary endpoints. The statistical methods for the analysis of Time to deterioration (TTD) in patient-reported pain in chest, dyspnoea, and cough are considered adequate, including the use of the Hochberg procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons. Completion of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 was requested at days 1, 7 and 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of the subsequent cycles, and at the end of treatment.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Study A8081014 was a worldwide study. Overall, a sufficient number of EU patients has been enrolled. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between crizotinib and chemotherapy arm.

A clinically meaningful benefit in terms of PFS by IRR has been observed, with a 3.9 months difference in median PFS and HR of 0.454 (95% CI 0.346, 0.596). The curves show an early separation (at the time of the first assessment) which augments over time. At month 12, the probability of being event free was 47.8 (95% CI 39.5, 55.7) and 16.1 (95% CI 10.5, 22.8) for crizotinib and chemotherapy, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Submitted OS data are still too immature to draw any conclusion. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the systematic one-way cross-over is expected to confound the interpretation of OS results. At the data cut-off of the present analysis (30 November 2013), very few patients who had progressed in the crizotinib arm had crossed to another systemic treatment post-progression, mainly due to the possibility to continue crizotinib beyond progression.

When using PFS as primary endpoint for confirmatory studies, there is a risk that the tumour's drug resistance profile is affected by therapy which might be of relevance for the activity of next-line therapies.  Based on study design, no information on PFS of treatments received post-progression (PFS2), including crizotinib, can be provided. Therefore, the potential impact of first line crizotinib on next line therapies cannot be evaluated. In addition, no safety and efficacy data are available on retreatment with crizotinib of patients who received crizotinib in previous lines of therapy. However, for patients progressing after first-line crizotinib there are at present therapeutic options which were not available at the time of study conduction.

In addition, the benefit in terms of PFS observed in patients who crossed to crizotinib after progression in the control arm is consistent to what has been observed in Study 1007, which is re-assuring.

ORR was much higher in the crizotinib arm, responses were in general more profound and durable (more than twice longer than in the control arm). Time to tumour response was shorter in the crizotinib arm. Interestingly, in the chemotherapy arm responses were observed up to 24 weeks, with 26% of the responses observed from week 18 onwards. This observation raises questions on the adequacy of the control arm and the choice to have a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy without allowing maintenance with pemetrexed as monotherapy. However, in this regard, it should be noted that in the PARAMOUNT study, on which the approval of pemetrexed as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment immediately following platinum-pemetrexed combination was based, only a limited number of objective responses (4.1%) were reported. In addition, although cross-study comparisons have limitations, patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC randomized to crizotinib in Study 1014 had longer median PFS (10.9 months) than patients with unselected advanced NSCLC with a complete response, partial response, or stable disease during induction treatment in either JMEN study (7.7 months, as measured from the start of induction treatment) or PARAMOUNT study (6.9 months, as measured from the start of induction treatment).

Treatment with crizotinib was associated with a statistically significant longer Time to Deterioration in Pain (in Chest), Dyspnoea, or Cough, with a median TTD of 2.1 vs 0.5 months, with an HR: 0.591. A sensitivity analysis excluding Cycle 1 day 7 and day 15 from the TTD assessment showed no impact on the overall results, with a median TTD (pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough) of 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.8, 7.6) in the crizotinib arm and 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.4, 2.1) in the chemotherapy arm. Nevertheless, due to the study design (open-label, collection of questionnaires at day 7 and 15 of cycle 1 despite the differences in the treatment characteristics, and the trend to late responses in the control arm) these results might overestimate the benefit, especially in the long-run.

Descriptive statistics by treatment arm were reported for the change from baseline for each of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 multiple-item and single-item scale scores, and EQ-5D VAS scores. Overall a benefit in favour of crizotinib has been observed for all domains and all the symptoms' scores analysed, with the exception of diarrhoea and peripheral neuropathy for which a statistically significant deterioration was observed in the crizotinib arm compared with the chemotherapy arm.

A number of sensitivity and subgroup analyses have been provided that overall support the results of the primary analysis of PFS and do not raise any particular concern for any of the subgroups analysed.

The overall disagreement rate between IRR and Investigator assessment was not negligible. Nevertheless, overall there were no major differences in the PFS results by IRR or by investigators.

The analysis of TTP based on the presence/absence of brain metastases at baseline does not seem to show any meaningful differences, thus supporting a potential benefit of crizotinib in both subgroups. This finding is consistent with PFS subgroup analyses.

A number of subgroup and sensitivity analyses, pre-specified in the protocol, were conducted, including the use of the Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Model (RPSFTM) to adjust OS analyses for cross-over.

As requested by the CHMP, the MAH also performed additional OS sensitivity analyses (i.e. IPE and two-stage methods) to explore different methods with different assumptions.

In all analysis set, the results of two-stage methods are consistent with those obtained by RPSFTM. In particular, the results show a significant improvement in OS in favour of crizotinib with HRs ranging from 0.610 to 0.649 and 1-sided p-values ranging from 0.0123 to 0.0242 for the Log-normal model without or with covariates and methods of missing data imputation. Results from the IPE method suggested an improved OS with crizotinib compared to chemotherapy (i.e. HRs ranging from 0.571 to 0.674). The observed improvement was statistically significant for all parametric models explored with the IPE method (1-sided p-values ranging from 0.0130 to 0.0251), with the exception of the Exponential model that was to be considered to best fit to the data (1-sided p-value = 0.0408). In any case, results from the exponential model were in line with those coming from the remaining sensitivity analyses to correct for crossover.

Considering the various analyses presented, the treatment effect estimates of crizotinib on OS in presence of cross-over remain overall consistent, reassuring on the robustness of the primary analysis results.

Further to the CHMP request, the MAH provided available data in patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology. The subgroups in studies 1007 and 1014 were too small to draw reliable conclusions. Of note, no patients with SCC histology were randomized in the crizotinib arm in Study 1007 and no patients with SCC were enrolled in Study 1014 due to pemetrexed-based regimen being used as a comparator.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A clinically meaningful benefit in terms of PFS has been observed in favour of crizotinib, which is supported by consistent results from a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses did not raise particular concern for any of the subgroups analysed. The primary analysis of OS is supported by different sensitivity analyses adjusted for cross-over conducted by the MAH. Results in terms of ORR, Duration of Response, Time to Progression and Time to Tumour Response support the high activity of crizotinib in the patient population enrolled in the pivotal study, which adequately reflects the target population expected in the real-life setting. PROs showed a benefit in favour of crizotinib for most domains and symptoms, although the results may overestimate the true benefit due to the study design. Although the control arm could have included the option for maintenance treatment with pemetrexed, the magnitude of benefit observed in terms of PFS and other secondary endpoints is considered sufficient to provide reassurance on the benefit of crizotinib in this setting.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The safety profile of crizotinib in ALK positive pre-treated advanced NSCLC patients is mainly characterised by ADRs in the SOC eye disorders (vision disorder), gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, constipation) , general disorders (oedema, fatigue), hepatobiliary disorders (elevated transaminases) and nervous system disorders (dizziness, neuropathy).

For the Xalkori extended indication in the treatment of previously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients, data from the pivotal randomised phase 3 study 1014 and cumulative supportive safety data from 6 additional studies in ALK+ advanced NSCLC and other advanced cancers patients, have been submitted.

Overall, safety data of 2044 patients treated with crizotinib and of 340 patients who received chemotherapy have been provided.

In addition, 11,659 patients were cumulatively exposed to crizotinib from post-marketing experience (PSUR#5: 26 February 2013-25 August 2014).

In the pivotal phase III study, the median duration of treatment was 47.4 weeks in the crizotinib arm compared with 18.0 weeks in the chemotherapy group, with a similar median overall relative dose intensity per cycle across the 4 drugs (crizotinib: 98.9%; pemetrexed: 95.8%; cisplatin: 96.3%; carboplatin: 94.4%). The median number of cycles started was 16 (1-50) in the crizotinib arm and 6 (1-6) in the chemotherapy group, reflecting the maximum number of cycles permitted. In the crizotinib arm, 84 (49.1%) patients required a dosing interruption, and in 66 (38.6%) patients at least 1 dose reduction was needed. These rates were lower for the chemotherapy treatments (at least 1 dose interruption: 0.6%-5.5%; at least 1 dose reduction: 9.5%-9.9%). However, 36 (21.3%) patients had at least 1 cycle delay of the chemotherapy regimen.

Among the 109 patients who crossed over from the chemotherapy group in study 1014, the median duration of crizotinib treatment based on active dosing days was 22.6 weeks, with a median number of 8 cycles started. Around 57% of crossing over patients were still on-treatment at the time of data cut-

off. A dose interruption and a dose reduction was requested in 38 (34.9%) and 36 (33%) patients, respectively.

Patients who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib were generally comparable with those in the 2 randomized treatment arms, with the exception of a higher percentage of Asian (56.0%) versus White (42.2%).

## Adverse events

All AEs were coded using MedDRA Version 16.1 and summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred term. Severity grading for AEs was consistent with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; Version 4.0 for Studies 1014, 1007, 1005, 1013, 1029, and 1012, and Version 3.0 for Study 1001).

In order to avoid underestimation of medical conditions, certain PTs were analysed in aggregate using clustered terms.

A summary of all-causality and treatment-related AEs registered by treatment arm in Study 1014 is shown in below tables:

Among the 109 patients in the chemotherapy arm who crossed over to receive crizotinib, the most common all-causality AEs were vision disorder (57.8%), nausea (47.7%), diarrhoea (46.8%), edema (39.4%), Vomiting (35.8%), and elevated transaminases (34.9%). The treatment-related AEs commonly reported were vision disorder (52.3%), diarrhoea (42.2%), nausea (42.2%), vomiting (32.1%) and elevated transaminases (32.1%). Forty-three out of the 109 patients (39.5%) reported Grade 3/4 all-causality AEs that were considered treatment-related in 36 (33%) of them, mainly in terms of elevated transaminases (12.8%) and neutropenia (11%).

## Adverse events of Special Interest in Study 1014

AEs of special interest, all-causality and treatment-related, were summarized overall and also followed a 3-tier approach, on which basis they were classified into 1 of 3 tiers:

- Tier-1: pre-specified events or clusters of events of clinical importance, described in a list in the product's Safety Review Plan maintained by the Sponsor.
- Tier-2: not Tier-1 but 'common' events, reported by at least 10% of patients for all grades in any treatment arm and by at least 5% of patients for Grade 3, 4, or 5 combined.
- Tier-3: events that were neither Tier-1 nor Tier-2.

Tier 1 all-causality AEs of special interest that occurred statistically significantly (2-sided p-value &lt;0.05) more frequently in the crizotinib arm compared with the chemotherapy arm (before cross-over) were constipation, diarrhea, elevated transaminases and hepatotoxicity, and bradycardia. In the chemotherapy arm, the Tier 1 all-causality AE of special interest occurred more frequently compared with the crizotinib arm was leukopenia. These comparisons were not adjusted for multiplicity or the longer duration of study treatment in the crizotinib arm.

To account for this difference between arms, exposure adjusted incidence rates (per 1,000 personyears) were calculated. Person-years of exposure was calculated as the sum of individual patient-years at risk, which is the sum of time to onset for patients with the event, time to 28 days after last dose for patients alive without the event, or time to death for patients who died within 28 days after the last dose without the event, divided by 365.25. Incidence rates were calculated as the total number of patients with events relative to person-years exposure.

Results of this exposure-adjusted analysis are summarized in the table below.

The exposure adjusted incidence rates were statistically significantly higher in the crizotinib arm for allcausality bradycardia, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, oedema, and vision disorder.

Tier 1 Grade 3, 4, or 5 all-causality AEs of special interest that occurred statistically significantly (2sided p-value &lt;0.05) more frequently in the crizotinib arm compared with the chemotherapy arm (before cross-over) were Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, and elevated transaminases and hepatotoxicity no Tier 1 Grade 3, 4, or 5 all-causality AEs of special interest occurred more frequently in the chemotherapy arm than in the crizotinib group.

Tier-2 TRAEs of special interest reported more frequently with crizotinib were visual impairment, abdominal pain, oedema peripheral, dysgeusia and dizziness, while in the chemotherapy arm anemia, asthenia, platelet count decrease and decreased appetite were mostly registered. The only treatmentrelated Grade ≥3 occurred was anaemia in the chemotherapy arm.

Based on the current crizotinib safety data, an internal clinical and safety review was done to determine ADRs likely associated with crizotinib. The list of crizotinib ADRs reported in Study 1014 is presented in the following table:

## Review of selected safety events across clinical studies

The following selected events were reviewed because considered associated or potentially correlated to crizotinib, or were newly identified:

## · Hepatotoxicity

Increases to Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevation were observed in 184 (11%) and 93 (6%) of patients, respectively. Seventeen (1%) patients required permanent discontinuation from treatment associated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with elevated transaminases. In randomised Phase 3 Study 1014, increases to Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were observed in 15% and 8% of patients receiving crizotinib versus 2% and 1% of patients receiving chemotherapy. In randomised Phase 3 Study 1007, increases to Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were observed in 18% and 9% of patients receiving crizotinib and 5% and &lt;1% of patients receiving chemotherapy.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in less than 0.5% of 1669 patients treated with crizotinib across clinical trials.

Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. Across studies with crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, median time to onset of increased Grade 1 or 2 transaminases was 23 days. Median time to onset of increased Grade 3 or 4 transaminases was 43 days.

Across studies with crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (N=1669), dose reductions associated with transaminase elevations occurred in 74 (4%) patients. Seventeen (1%) patients required permanent discontinuation from treatment.

There have been no fatal cases reported in Study 1014 or new fatal cases in the other clinical studies since the last regulatory submission.

## Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury Cases

Across studies 1014, 1007, 1005 and 1001, a total of 20 ALK-positive NSCLC crizotinib-treated patients have been identified with ALT and/or AST ≥3 x ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN, including 4 patients in the Study 1014, 11 patients described in previous regulatory submissions, and 5 new cases from Studies 1005 and 1001.

Cases were determined to be potentially consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity, if significant liver injury occurred during administration of crizotinib, and if there was no plausible alternative explanation for the observed event, or if the investigator or the Sponsor considered crizotinib to be a reasonably likely cause of the observed liver injury, despite the presence of plausible alternative explanations.

Out of the total 20 patients with adverse events and/or laboratory test results suggestive of druginduced liver injury, 8 were considered to meet Hy's Law criteria.

## · Interstitial Lung Disease/ Pneumonitis

Across studies in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (N=1669), 49 (3%) patients treated with crizotinib had any grade ILD, 18 (1%) patients had Grade 3 or 4, and 8 (&lt;1%) patients had fatal outcome.

## Independent Review Committee (IRC) review of ILD/Pneumonitis

In order to evaluate potential cases of pneumonitis associated with crizotinib, all Grade ≥3 respiratory AE/SAEs plus any-grade Pneumonitis, Interstitial lung disease, and Radiation pneumonitis AE/SAEs were reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).

As per the current IRC review (July 2014 IRC Report), there were a total of 20 patients (3 from the original review, 6 from the second review, 9 from the third review and 2 from the current review, 1 from study 1005 and 1 from study 1014) with events of de novo ILD/Pneumonitis possibly related to crizotinib.

The mean onset of crizotinib induced ILD from the time the drug was started was 82 days. In 17 of 20 patients de novo ILD/Pneumonitis occurred before 100 days (average time 29 days).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall for the 4 studies, based on the IRC review, the incidence of crizotinib induced ILD was 1.2% (1.2% for Caucasian and 1.2% for Asian). However, the incidence rate is 1.4% also taking into account 3 possibly treatment-related respiratory events based on investigator's assessment of the 25 patients with insufficient data for the IRC to make an assessment.

To date, the IRC did not identify any chemotherapy-treated patients with de novo ILD/Pneumonitis.

## · QT Interval Prolongation

Across studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) ≥ 500 msec was recorded in 32 (2.1%) of 1560 patients and a maximum increase from baseline in QTcF ≥ 60 msec was observed in 76 (5.0%) of 1520 patients. All-causality Grade 3 or 4 Electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported in 25 (1.5%) out of 1669 patients

## · Bradycardia

In studies with crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, all-causality bradycardia was experienced by 205 (12%) of 1669 patients treated with crizotinib. A total of 242 (15%) patients had a pulse rate &lt;50 bpm.

## · Vision Disorder

In studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (N=1669), all-causality vision disorder, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, vision blurred, and vitreous floaters, was experienced by 1038 (62%) of 1669 patients treated with crizotinib. Ninety-five percent of these patients had events that were mild in severity. Seven (0.4%) patients had temporary treatment discontinuation and 2 (0.1%) patients had a dose reduction associated with vision disorder. There were no permanent discontinuations associated with vision disorder for any of the 1669 patients treated with crizotinib.

## · Gastrointestinal Events

Across studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, nausea (57%), diarrhoea (54%), vomiting (51%), and constipation (43%) were the most commonly reported all-causality gastrointestinal events. Median times to onset for nausea and vomiting were 4 days.

In clinical studies with crizotinib, events of gastrointestinal perforations were reported. There were reports of fatal cases of gastrointestinal perforation during post-marketing use of crizotinib.

## · Neuropathy

All-causality neuropathy (including cases of burning sensation, dysaesthesia, formication, gait disturbance, hyperaesthesia, hypoaesthesia, hypotonia, motor dysfunction, muscle atrophy, muscular weakness, neuralgia, neuritis, neuropathy peripheral, neurotoxicity, paraesthesia, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, peroneal nerve palsy, polyneuropathy, sensory disturbance, skin burning sensation), was experienced by 419 (25%) out of 1669 patients treated with crizotinib.

## · Neutropenia and Leukopenia

Across studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (N=1669), Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 207 (12%) patients treated with crizotinib. Median time to onset of any grade neutropenia was 87 days. Neutropenia was associated with dose reduction or permanent treatment discontinuation for 4% and &lt;1% of patients, respectively. Less than 0.5% of patients experienced febrile neutropenia in clinical studies with crizotinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (N=1669), Grade 3 or Grade 4 leukopenia was observed in 48 (3%) patients. Median time to onset of any grade leukopenia was 85 days.

Leukopenia was associated with a dose reduction for &lt;0.5% of patients, and no patients permanently discontinued crizotinib treatment associated with leukopenia.

In clinical studies of crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, shifts to Grade 3 or 4 decreases in leukocytes and neutrophils were observed at frequencies of 4% and 14%, respectively.

## · Renal Cyst

All-causality complex renal cysts were experienced by 50 (3%) of 1669 patients treated with crizotinib.

## · Oedema

Oedema (including cases of face oedema, generalised oedema, local swelling, localised oedema, oedema, oedema peripheral, and periorbital oedema) is a very common ADR reported in 49% of patients across studies in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

## · Syncope

Across studies, syncope has been reported in 3% of patients and is considered as a common ADR.

## Update of the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on the basis of the pooled safety data

In the crizotinib SmPC, Section 4.8, undesirable effects, all causality frequency data for all listed ADRs has been updated with the larger data set that includes 1669 ALK positive advanced NSCLC patients from the pooled data of 4 clinical studies (Studies 1001, 1005, 1007 and 1014). All the 4 studies are ongoing.  The cut-off date for summary of the pooled data was 30 November 2013. The frequencies of the ADR terms were categorized according to the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS Working Group III-V) convention.

An overview of the changes in ADR frequencies and categories is presented in the table below.  The ADRs are ordered first by system organ class (SOC).

The most frequently reported (≥2% patients) events were Disease progression (14 patients, 12.8%), elevated transaminases (3 patients, 2.8%) and Respiratory failure (3 patients, 2.8%). In 8 (7.3%) patients SAEs were considered treatment-related. The only treatment-related SAE reported in more than 1 patient was elevated transaminases (3 patients, 2.8%).

## Study 1007

In 23 (13.4%) patients in the crizotinib arm, SAEs were considered treatment-related, including interstitial lung disease (4 patients, 2.3%), elevated transaminases (3 patients, 1.7%), decreased appetite, neutropenia, pneumonia and vomiting (each in 2 patients, 1.2%).

In the chemotherapy group, treatment-related SAEs were registered in 24 (14%) patients, and the most common event was neutropenia (14 patients, 8.2%). Further treatment-related SAEs occurred in ≥ 1% of patients were anemia (3 patients, 1.8%), stomatitis (3 patients, 1.8%), deep vein thrombosis (2 patients, 1.2%) and leukopenia (2 patients, 1.2%).

## Study 1005

SAEs were considered treatment-related in 115 (10.8%) patients, and the most commonly (≥1%) reported were renal cyst (15 patients, 1.4%) and interstitial lung disease (14 patients, 1.3%).

## Study 1001

In the ALK-positive NSCLC RP2D cohort, treatment-related SAEs were reported in 13 (8.4%) patients, most commonly in terms of elevated transaminases (3 patients, 1.9%), dyspnoea (2 patients, 1.9%), and renal cyst (2 patients, 1.9%). Among the 204 patients in the other RP2D cohort, SAEs were considered treatment-related in 13 (6.4%) patients, and the most common event was anaemia (3 patients, 1.5%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study 1013

Seven patients (15.9%) experienced treatment-related SAEs, such as blood creatinine phosphokinase increased, cardiac failure congestive, cerebral infarction, deep vein thrombosis, diarrhoea, interstitial lung disease, ischemia, nausea and vomiting (each 1 patient, 2.3%).

## Study 1012

All-causality SAEs were reported in 19 (61.3%) of the 31 patients, and the most common events were disease progression (7 patients, 22.6%), ascites (2 patients, 6.5%), cholestasis (2 patients, 6.5%), dyspnoea (2 patients, 6.5%), hepatotoxicity (2 patients, 6.5%) and renal failure (2 patients, 6.5%).

After crossing-over to crizotinib treatment, 20 (18.3%) patients had Grade 5 all-causality AEs such as disease progression (14 patients), respiratory failure (3 patients), pneumonitis (1 patient), infection (1 patient), pneumonia (1 patient). Pneumonitis was the only grade 5 all-causality considered to be treatment-related.

## Study 1007

In the crizotinib arm, Grade 5 all-causality AEs were reported in 30 (17.4%) patients, including 18 (10.5%) who had disease progression. events reported in more than 1 patient were interstitial disease lung (3 patients, 1.7%), and dyspnoea and death (each in 2 patients, 1.2%) patients.

Grade 5 AEs were considered treatment-related in a total of 3 (1.7%) patients, in which interstitial disease lung (2 patients, 1.2%) and arrhythmia (1 patient, 0.6%) occurred.

Regarding chemotherapy arm, 7 out of the 171 patients (4.1%) analyzed for safety had Grade 5 allcausality AEs. Disease progression (3 patients, 1.8%) was the only Grade 5 all-causality AE reported in more than 1 patient, and sepsis (1 patient, 0.6%) was the only Grade 5 AE considered treatmentrelated.

## Study 1005

Grade 5 all-causality AEs have been registered in 221 (20.8%) patients, mostly in terms of disease progression (126 patients, 11.9%). Other frequently reported Grade 5 all-causality AEs included pneumonia (15 patients, 1.4%), respiratory failure (8 patients, 0.8%), pulmonary embolism (7 patients, 0.7%), death (7 patients, 0.7%), dyspnoea (6 patients, 0.6%), and lung infection (5 patients, 0.5%). events were considered treatment-related for a total of 13 (1.2%) patients, including death (3 patients, 0.3%), hepatotoxicity (2 patients, 0.2%), interstitial lung disease (2 patients, 0.2%), lung infection (2 patients, 0.2%), and pneumonia (2 patients, 0.2%).

## Study 1001

Twenty-nine (18.8%) out of the 154 patients in the ALK-positive NSCLC RP2D cohort reported Grade 5 all-causality AEs. Disease progression (21 patients, 13.6%) and pneumonia (2 patients, 1.3%) were the only events registered in more than 1 patient. The remaining 6 patients experienced each 1 of the following Grade 5 AEs: Aspergillus infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, lung infection, pulmonary haemorrhage, respiratory failure and subcutaneous emphysema.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Death due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (1 patient, 0.6%) was the only Grade 5 treatment-related AE.

In the Other RP2D cohort, all-causality fatal SAEs were reported in 35 (17.2%) out of 204 patients, and the most common (≥2 patients) were disease progression (25 patients), pneumonia (2 patients) and respiratory failure (2 patients). A treatment-related SAE of death (1 patient, 0.5%) was the only Grade 5 treatment-related event reported.

## Study 1013

Among the 44 patients, a total of 7 (15.9%) patients had Grade 5 all-causality AEs, including Disease progression (3 patients, 6.8%), interstitial lung disease (2 patients, 24.5%), cerebral infarction (1 patient, 2.3%) and respiratory failure (1 patient, 2.3%).

Two Grade 5 AEs, interstitial lung disease (1 patient, 2.3%) and cerebral infarction (1 patient, 2.3%), were considered treatment related.

## Study 1012

All-causality fatal SAEs were reported in 11 (35.5%) of the 31 patients, including disease progression (7 patients, 22.6%), cholestasis (1 patient, 3.2%), chronic hepatic failure (1 patient, 3.2%), respiratory failure (1 patient, 3.2%) and septic shock (1 patient, 3.2%). None of these events were considered to be treatment related.

After Protocol Amendment #6, all male patients were to undergo hypogonadism laboratory tests (i.e. total T, free T, FSH, LH) together with DXA scan. However, limited data (8 patients in the crizotinib arm and 5 patients in the chemotherapy arm for hypogonadism laboratory parameters; 2 patients in each treatment arm for DXA analysis) are available. Hypogonadism was reported for 1 (0.6%) patient in the crizotinib arm (treatment-related Grade 1), while no events were reported in the chemotherapy group.

## Safety in special populations

## Race

There was no clear pattern in the differences between crizotinib and chemotherapy of all-causality AE frequency for Asian and non- Asian patients. However, in the crizotinib arm elevated transaminases, decreased appetite and upper respiratory infection were more frequent in Asian, while oedema was most common in non-Asian patients. In the chemotherapy group, Asian experienced more frequently decreased appetite and leukopenia, while in non-Asian dyspnoea was the most common event.

Across studies in patients with ALK positive advanced NSCLC (N=1669), the following adverse reactions were reported with an absolute difference of ≥10% in Asian patients (N=753) than in nonAsian patients (N=916): elevated transaminases, decreased appetite, neutropenia, and leukopenia. No adverse drug reactions were reported with an absolute difference of ≥15%.

## Gender

The differences between crizotinib and chemotherapy of all-causality AEs were comparable among males and females to the differences reported in the overall population. However, in the crizotinib arm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

elevated transaminases were more frequent in male, and nausea, neutropenia, and vomiting in female patients. Nausea was the more frequent event in chemotherapy-treated female patients.

## Use in pregnancy and lactation

At the data cut-off date, 2 cases of pregnancy in females receiving crizotinib, and 2 cases of male patients who had female partners who became pregnant have been reported in clinical studies.

Both female patients (one patient in Study 1001 and one patient in Study 1005) underwent an induced abortion.

The outcome of the pregnancy for the female partners of the 2 male patients was a full-term male in one case (Study 1001) and a foetal demise at 8 weeks gestational age in the other one (Study 1001).

A case of maternal exposure during pregnancy  was reported to the MAH expedited reporting database after the data cut-off date. One patient in Study 1014 became pregnant while receiving crizotinib and underwent an induced abortion at 6 weeks gestational age. No macroscopic abnormalities were seen and the condition of the foetus was normal.

## Non-adenocarcinoma histology

A report on the subgroup analysis in patients with adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histology in Study 1014 (before cross-over) and Study 1005 has been submitted.

Since the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma histology corresponds to the majority of the SA population (approximately 94.1% and 94.4% for Study 1014 and Study 1005, respectively), the safety analyses were limited to presentation of AEs in all patients in the safety analysis set and in the subgroup of patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology.

A summary of all-causality AEs reported in at least 10% of all patients in the crizotinib or chemotherapy arms is reported in the following Table:

In Study 1014, among non-adenocarcinoma population, 2 patients (20.0%) in the crizotinib arm and no patients in the chemotherapy arm had Grade 5 AEs, while a total of 15 patients (27.3%) with nonadenocarcinoma experienced Grade 5 AEs in Study 1005. Most Grade 5 events were due to disease progression.

No Grade 5 TRAEs, either in the crizotinib or in the chemotherapy arms, were reported for Study 1014, regardless of histology. In Study 1005, a total of 13 patients (1.2%) had a Grade 5 TRAE, but no patient with non-adenocarcinoma histology was included.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## Study 1014

AEs associated with temporary discontinuation were reported in 70 (40.9%) patients in the crizotinib arm and 58 (34.3%) patients in the chemotherapy group before cross-over. In 59 (34.5%) crizotinib patients and 51 (30.2%) patients in the chemotherapy arm these events were considered treatmentrelated. The most common all-causality and treatment-related AEs associated with temporary discontinuation are shown in the following table:

Forty-four (40.4%) crossing over patients had all-causality AEs associated with temporary discontinuation. AEs were considered treatment-related for 35 patients. The most frequently reported all-causality AEs were ALT increased (9 patients, 11%), AST increased (6 patients, 8.3%) and Neutropenia (6 patients, 5.5%). All the reported AEs were considered treatment-related.

Patients who experienced AEs associated with permanent treatment discontinuation were 21 (12.3%) and 24 (14.2%) in the crizotinib and in the chemotherapy arm, respectively. These events were considered treatment-related in 8 (4.7%) patients who received crizotinib and 14 (8.3%) patients in the chemotherapy group before cross-over.

The most frequently reported all-causality and treatment-related AEs by treatment arm are listed in the following table:

Permanent discontinuation due to all-causality AEs was necessary in 17 (15.6%) patients who crossed over from chemotherapy to crizotinib. Disease progression (4 patients, 3.7%), Respiratory failure (3 patients, 2.8%) and elevated transaminases (2 patients, 1.8%) were the most commonly reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. The following AEs were considered treatment-related for a total of 6 (5.5%) patients: elevated transaminases (2 patients, 1.8%), cerebral ischemia, hepatotoxicity, dysgeusia, dysphagia and interstitial lung disease (each in 1 patient, 0.9%).

## Study 1007

Twenty- nine (16.9%) patients in the crizotinib arm and 16 (9.4%) in the chemotherapy group had allcausality SAEs associated with permanent treatment discontinuation. SAEs leading were considered treatment-related in a total of 8 (4.7%) patients in the crizotinib arm and 8 (4.7%) patients in the chemotherapy group; interstitial lung disease (4 patients, 2.3%) and neutropenia (3 patients, 1.8%) were the only treatment-related SAE associated with discontinuation in ≥1 patient respectively in the crizotinib and chemotherapy arm.

## Study 1005

SAEs were associated to permanent discontinuation in 175 (16.5%) patients, and in 32 (3%) patients these events were considered treatment-related, having interstitial lung disease (10 patients, 0.9%) and hepatotoxicity (5 patients, 0.5%) as the most commonly reported.

## Study 1001

In the ALK-positive NSCLC RP2D cohort, 20 (13%) patients had all-causality SAEs associated with permanent discontinuation of crizotinib. These events were considered treatment-related in 2 patients (1 with dyspnoea and 1 with interstitial lung disease).

In the Other RP2D cohort, SAEs leading to permanent discontinuation were experienced by 24 (11.8%) patients, including treatment-related SAEs Anaemia and Chest pain each in 1 patient (0.5%).

## Study 1013

Two (4.5%) patients had treatment- related SAEs associated with permanent discontinuation (Cerebral infarction and interstitial lung disease, each in 1 patient).

## Post marketing experience

Xalkori  is  approved  in  more  than  70  countries  worldwide.  Based  on  submitted  PSURs,  there  are cumulatively around 11,659 patients exposed to crizotinib from marketing experience.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

This variation application includes safety data from the pivotal study 1014, comparing crizotinib versus standard platinum-based doublet in previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients, together with selected safety data from supportive studies. Safety data have been presented by single study and as ad hoc pooled tables including data from the 1669 ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib across clinical studies (1001, 1005, 1007 and 1014). The SmPC has been updated on the basis of the pooled safety data set.

The most common (&gt;30%) Treatment-Related AEs (TRAEs) were vision disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, elevated transaminase, constipation and oedema in the crizotinib arm and nausea, fatigue, vomiting and decreased appetite in the chemotherapy group. As expected, elevated transaminase and neutropenia were the most frequently reported crizotinib Grade 3/4 TRAEs, while in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomized to chemotherapy Grade 3/4 events related to bone marrow toxicity were mainly registered.

Among the most common crizotinib TRAEs, the cluster term abdominal pain (19.3% in the crizotinib arm and 6.5% in the chemotherapy group) is the only one newly reported. In the pooled population of 1669 ALK+ NSCLC patients who received crizotinib across clinical studies, the frequency of abdominal pain ADRs was 20.7%.

Considering the longer duration of study treatment in the crizotinib (47.4 weeks) in comparison to chemotherapy (18 weeks), exposure adjusted incidence rates were calculated for treatment-emergent AEs of special interest. The rate of bradycardia, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, oedema, and vision disorder was statistically higher in patients treated with crizotinib, while for the chemotherapy group the rate was higher for all-causality AEs of constipation, dyspnoea, hypokalaemia, leukopenia, nausea, neuropathy, neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, and vomiting.

A similar rate of patients discontinued treatment in both arms for all-causality AEs (12.3% with crizotinib and 14.2% with chemotherapy), while a higher rate of treatment-related permanent discontinuation was needed in the chemotherapy group (8.3% vs 4.7%).

Almost the same number of deaths occurred in the two arms, mainly due to disease under study (39/44 in the crizotinib arm and 43/46 in the chemotherapy group). One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in a patient who received crizotinib after cross-over.

No major differences are highlighted in terms of AEs frequency and severity when crizotinib is administered as first line or in patients previously treated, also taking into account events reported in the 109 patients enrolled in study 1014 that after randomization to chemotherapy crossed over to crizotinib.

No new crizotinib safety signal was detectable from study 1014 and from supportive studies. Based on the updated safety data, 3 new cases of drug-induced liver injury (including 2 cases in study 1014) and 2 additional de novo ILD cases (including 1 with fatal outcome in study 1014) have been reported.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Crizotinib safety profile is consistent in terms of frequency and type of events in patients with ALKpositive advanced NSCLC in both pretreated and untreated patients, regardless of line of treatment.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial and QRD-template related changes in the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

Limited sections of the PL were affected, particularly section 4; some differences in the adverse drug reactions came out on the basis of the pooled safety database including both indications. The posology section remained unchanged. Xalkori continues to be subject to medical prescription and treatment to be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. Moreover, the extension of indication does not change the requirements for having the combined PL of 200 mg and 250 mg hard capsules, and no changes were made to the labelling. In conclusion, results from user testing assessed during the initial Marketing Authorization application can be considered applicable to the updated PL.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In the full analysis population of study 1014, the median PFS was 10.9 months for crizotinib and 7.0 months for chemotherapy. The HR comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy was 0.454 (95% CI: 0.346, 0.596), with a p-value of &lt;0.0001 (1-sided, based on a stratified log-rank test). There was also a nonstatistically significant improvement in OS in the crizotinib arm (HR: 0.821 [95% CI: 0.536, 1.255]; 1sided p-value=0.1804). However, after adjusting for treatment and other factors in the model, patients with ECOG PS of 0/1 had a statistically significantly better OS than patients with ECOG PS of 2 (2-sided p-value &lt;0.0001). Median OS was not reached in either arm and only a positive trend in overall survival is observed. These results were anticipated in such a first line setting. The primary OS analysis was also impacted by the high degree of cross-over from chemotherapy to crizotinib.

Crizotinib treatment resulted in a clinically and statistically significant improvement in IRR-assessed PFS as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with ALK-positive advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. These results suggest that Xalkori has shown a relevant effect in the first line setting.

Finally, quality of life results, even statistically significant, should be taken with caution with such an open label study.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Based on study design, no information on PFS of treatments received post-progression (PFS2), including crizotinib, can be provided. Therefore, the potential impact of first line crizotinib on next line therapies cannot be evaluated. However, for patients progressing after first-line crizotinib there are at present therapeutic options which were not available at the time the study was conducted. However OS data are reassuring and no overall detrimental effect is expected.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The crizotinib safety profile observed in Study 1014 was generally consistent with the known AE profile reported for Studies 1007 1005 and 1001. For patients who received crizotinib after cross-over from chemotherapy, the adverse event profile was consistent with that observed for the previously untreated patients in the crizotinib arm and with that previously observed for the crizotinib arm in Study 1007.

The most common (&gt;30%) Treatment-Related AEs (TRAEs) were vision disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, elevated transaminase, constipation and oedema. As expected, elevated transaminase and neutropenia were the most frequently reported crizotinib Grade 3/4 TRAEs.

Among the 109 patients who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib, 20 (18.3%) patients had Grade 5 all-causality AEs. The most commonly reported Grade 5 all-causality AE for the cross-over patients was disease progression in 14 (12.8%) patients and respiratory failure in 3 (2.8%) patients.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety data provided by study 1014 is consistent with the already known safety profile of crizotinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit/risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Results from the pivotal study are considered clinically meaningful. Patients treated with crizotinib in first line of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) have a higher probability of remaining stable without tumour progression than those treated with the traditional chemotherapy (gain of 3.9 months). This positive effect on the PFS was supported by all the sensitivity analyses carried out by the MAH. The investigator's analysis also showed the same trend in this regard. In addition, the subgroups analyses on PFS both by the IRRas the investigators give robustness to the main analysis. Secondary variables point out in the same direction. Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most common any grade adverse reactions (&gt;25%) across both studies were vision disorder, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, oedema, constipation, elevated transaminases, decreased appetite, fatigue, dizziness and neuropathy. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions across all studies are increased ALT and neutropenia. The safety of crizotinib is overall manageable in the intended patient population. No major differences are highlighted in terms of AEs frequency and severity when crizotinib is administered as first line or in patients previously treated.

## Benefit/risk balance

In the first line setting of ALK+ NSCLC, crizotinib showed a statistically significant 3.9 months improvement of PFS compared to chemotherapy. This benefit in a patient population, for which there is currently no targeted treatment approved outweighs the risks related to gastrointestinal AEs, elevated transaminases and neutropenia.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

Crizotinib treatment resulted in a statistically significant, robust, and clinically meaningful improvement in IRR-assessed PFS as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Without PFS2 results, the impact of first line crizotinib on next line therapies remains uncertain. Nevertheless, data from other ALK-inhibitor has shown a clinical benefit for patients previously exposed to crizotinib, and this benefit is likely better than that expected from chemotherapy in last line.

No new crizotinib safety signal has been identified from study 1014 and from supportive studies and the risk profile remains unchanged.

## Conclusion

The benefit risk of crizotinib in the first line treatment of adult patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC patients is considered positive. Moreover, the MAH requested to convert Conditional Marketing Authorisation into full Marketing Authorisation cannot be accepted as the updated OS data from study A8081007 which is the remaining specific obligation has not been provided.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indication to add first-line treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the results of the pivotal Study A8081014; a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of crizotinib to first-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) in patients with previously untreated ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC, as well as updated safety results from Studies A8081001, A8081005 and A8081007. As a result sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial and QRD-template related changes in the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. A revised RMP version 6.2 was agreed during the procedure.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
