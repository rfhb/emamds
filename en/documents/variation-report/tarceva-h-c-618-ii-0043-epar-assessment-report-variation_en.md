## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Erlotinib is an EGFR TKI that was developed for the treatment of NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and other solid tumors. Erlotinib exerts its therapeutic activity through direct and reversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Erlotinib was approved in the EU on 19 September 2005. Erlotinib is currently approved in the EU for the following indications:

- First-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations.
- Monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after four cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.
- Treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.
- In combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

In order to provide support for first-line maintenance treatment with erlotinib in NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations, results are provided from a pre-specified subpopulation analysis of Study BO18192 (SATURN), a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study of single-agent erlotinib in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who had not progressed following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients in this study were randomized to treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) or placebo until disease progression, death or intolerable toxicity. This subpopulation analysis evaluated treatment response to erlotinib versus placebo in NSCLC patients with tumors harboring EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations). The efficacy data in this subpopulation of 22 erlotinib-treated patients were previously submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) as part of the Responses to Questions for Type II Variation EMEA/H/C/618/II/017.

At the time of approval of the first-line maintenance indication in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a postmarketing commitment to conduct a randomized controlled study in patients with histologically documented, advanced, or recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC who have not experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity during chemotherapy with four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. The study BO25460 (IUNO) was to compare erlotinib as first-line maintenance therapy with erlotinib at progression (second-line treatment); all eligible patients were to have known EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) status and were to be without EGFR activating mutations. Patients with EGFR activating mutations were excluded as it was considered unethical to have such patients potentially being randomized to placebo in the first-line maintenance setting.

The purpose of this Type II variation is to modify the approved indication associated with the first-line maintenance treatment of NSCLC.  The proposed changes to the indication were as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Tarceva is indicated for the first-line and maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations.'

'Tarceva is also indicated as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.'

Preliminary results from study BO25469 (IUNO) and the final CSR from study BO18192 (SATURN) are provided in order to support the above change in the indication. The SATURN study has previously been assessed by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/298837/2010) and was the basis for the use of erlotinib in the maintenance setting. Furthermore, three published scientific paper 1 ,2 ,3 are also provided as supporting literature.

The final indication was as follows:

Tarceva is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations.

Tarceva is indicated for switch maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy. Tarceva is also indicated as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main studies

IUNO study: A multicenter, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled,2-arm Phase III study designed to evaluate the relative survival benefit and safety of 'early' (first-line maintenance) erlotinib versus 'late' (second-line) erlotinib in patients with advanced (stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC whose tumours did not harbour an EGFR-activating mutation and who had not progressed following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.

## Methods

A descriptive representation is presented in Figure 1.

## Study participants and treatments

Patients were initially screened into a chemotherapy run-in period in which they had to complete 4 cycles of an approved (non-investigational) platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without subsequent disease progression (i.e., had documented complete response/partial response or stable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] v1.1 criteria) for eligibility.

- -Blinded phase : patients whose tumours were confirmed to lack an EGFR activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 2 L858R mutation) or had an indeterminate EGFR mutation status following central testing were randomized to receive 150 mg/day erlotinib ('early erlotinib' group) or placebo ('late erlotinib' group) in the maintenance setting until the occurrence of disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or because of symptomatic deterioration attributed to suspected tumor progression), death, or unacceptable toxicity.
- -Open-label phase : following randomization, patients who had disease progression in the blinded phase were unblinded and entered the open-label phase of the study. Patients randomized to the 'early erlotinib' group received approved second-line (excluding EGFR-targeted) therapies, whereas patients in the 'late erlotinib' group received 150 mg/day erlotinib. Patients were monitored until the occurrence of disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progression (assessed according to radiological or symptomatic deterioration criteria per local practice), death, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to receive second-line open-label treatment received best supportive care (BSC) until such time they could receive it, or alternatively proceeded directly to Survival Follow-up.

Patients who had documented disease progression at the end of second-line treatment in the open-label phase, or who were not amenable to second-line openlabel treatment at the end of the blinded phase, entered survival follow-up in which they could receive further lines of cancer therapy or BSC at the discretion of the investigator. Survival status was monitored.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was:

- To compare the overall survival (OS) of first-line maintenance therapy with erlotinib ('early erlotinib') versus erlotinib administered at the time of disease progression ('late erlotinib').

Secondary objectives of the study were:

- To compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the 'early erlotinib' (erlotinib) and 'late erlotinib' (placebo) groups during the blinded (first-line maintenance) phase.

- To compare overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) between treatment groups during the blinded (maintenance) phase

- To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of erlotinib in this patient population

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy parameter of overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death.

Disease progression in the blinded phase was defined according to RECIST version v1.1. Duration of PFS was assessed during the blinded phase of the study, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.

## Blinding (masking)

The first phase of the study was double-blinded and the second phase of the study was open-label.

## Statistical methods

The primary endpoint of OS was assessed using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test at a 5% significance level. Median survival time and 95% confidence limits were estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology. One-year survival rates from randomization were compared using estimates from the KM survival curves. Estimates of treatment effect were expressed as hazard ratios (HR) ('early erlotinib' group versus 'late erlotinib' group) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

The analysis was planned to be performed when 460 death events had been recorded, and has now been conducted. As per protocol, the study ends when the final analysis for the primary endpoint has been performed. The final results became available on 30 July 2015 and the final analysis for the primary endpoint has been performed. Therefore, the study will now be closed.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 643 patients were enrolled and randomized between September 2011 and June 2014. The date of data cut-off for the primary analysis was 23 March 2015, at which time there were 477 death events recorded (74% of randomized patients). The date of the snapshot for the analysis of this ongoing study was 10 July 2015. Of the 643 patients, 322 patients were randomized to receive 150 mg/day erlotinib ['early erlotinib' group] and 321 patients were randomized to receive placebo ('late erlotinib' group). Of the 322 patients randomized to the 'early erlotinib' group, 160 (50%) received second line treatment; of the 321 patients randomized to the 'late erlotinib' group, 250 patients (78%) received second line treatment, until the occurrence of further disease progression death, or unacceptable toxicities.

## Recruitment

Patients were recruited at 122 centres in 20 countries globally.

## Numbers analysed

All 321 patients randomized in the 'late erlotinib' group and all 322 patients randomized in the 'early erlotinib' group were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population. Two patients did not receive study treatment post-randomization and were therefore excluded from the safety analysis in the blinded phase.

In total, 71 patients (22%) from the 'late erlotinib' group and 162 patients (50%) from the 'early erlotinib' group were excluded from the safety analysis population in the second-line open-label phase due to not having received at least one dose of open-label phase study treatment.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint - OS

The results of the primary endpoint of this study showed that OS in patients who received 'early erlotinib' in the first-line maintenance setting was not superior to 'late erlotinib' treatment (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.22; log rank p-value = 0.8183). Median OS was similar and 1-year event-free rates were the same in both treatment groups.

## Secondary endpoint - PFS

PFS assessed during the blinded phase showed no difference between erlotinib and placebo treatment. At the time of the data cut-off, 305 patients (95.0%) on placebo and 303 patients (94.1%) on erlotinib in the blinded phase, had progressed or died. The majority of these events were progressions (281, placebo and 264, erlotinib). The estimated median PFS was similar for both treatment groups: 12 weeks (95% CI: 11.71, 12.29 weeks [placebo]) versus 13 weeks (95% CI: 12.14, 17.43 weeks [erlotinib]). The HR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.11), showing no clinical meaningful PFS benefit for the erlotinib group (p = 0.48, two-sided unstratified logrank test). The 6-month estimate of PFS rate was 24% (95% CI: 19.50%, 28.94%) in the placebo group compared with 27% (95% CI: 22.19%, 32.02%) in the erlotinib group.

Progression Free Survival

-Censoring:

(uene=0'patosueo=t)

Summaries of Time-to-Event (median, percentiles) are Kaplan-Meier estimates. 95s CI for median

Censored value was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.

RE

For unstratified and stratified analyses, Hazard ratios,

958 Cfs were estimated

For stratified analyses, strata are Histology, Stage, by Cox regression without or with the strata.

STUDY  BO18192  (SATURN): A  multi-centre,  double-blind  randomized,  Phase  III  study  to evaluate the efficacy of Tarceva or placebo following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in  patients  with  histologically  documented,  advanced  or  recurrent  (Stage  IIIB  and  not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  who  have  not  experienced  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity  during chemotherapy.

Study BO18192 (SATURN) was a randomized, multi-center, Phase III study in patients with histologically documented, locally advanced, or recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC before chemotherapy. The results of this study led to the EMA approval (EMEA/H/C/618/II/017; positive opinion received on 18 March 2010) of erlotinib as monotherapy in the maintenance setting in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after four cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After eligibility screening, patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC completed four cycles of an acceptable platinum-based chemotherapy combination. Following chemotherapy, patients who met the following criteria were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 1, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function, and absence of unacceptable toxicity and/or disease progression (CR, PR, or SD).

Eligible patients were randomised to receive either erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR protein expression by IHC, stage of disease at start of chemotherapy, ECOG PS, chemotherapy regimen, smoking status, and region.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS according to RECIST in all patients and in the EGFR IHC positive population. An independent combined radiological and clinical assessment was undertaken to provide an independent assessment of response and disease progression. Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS and response rates (ORR and DCR) according to RECIST v1.0.

For the purpose of this Type II variation application, the focus is on the prospectively defined subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation). All analyses in this EGFR mutation positive subgroup were prospectively defined, but exploratory in nature. Median survival times and 95% confidence limits for PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, and the corresponding treatment difference tested using a log-rank test. The between-treatment difference in response rates (ORR and DCR) was tested using a χ2 test.

## Progression-Free Survival

Based on the clinical cut-off for the Clinical Study Report (CSR) (17 May 2008) first-line maintenance erlotinib treatment after 4 cycles of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, the overall population showed a benefit for the primary PFS end-point (HR= 0.71 p&lt; 0.0001). However the largest benefit was observed in a predefined exploratory analysis in patients with EGFR activating mutations (n= 49) demonstrating a substantial PFS benefit (HR=0.10, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.25; p&lt;0.0001). Median PFS was 44.6 weeks (95% CI: 35.1 weeks, not reached) in the erlotinib group compared with 13.0 weeks (95% CI: 11.6, 18.4 weeks) in the placebo group. A Kaplan-Meier curve of the PFS results for patients with both EGFR mutated and wild-type tumours is shown in the below figure. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS for the subpopulation of patients with EGFR mutations were separated between the erlotinib and placebo groups over the course of the observation period.

## Overall Survival

At the time of data cut-off (17 May 2009), there was a benefit in OS (HR= 0.81 p=0.0088) in the overall population. 8 of 22 patients (36.4%) with tumors harboring EGFR-activating mutations in the erlotinib group had died, therefore the OS data reported at this time were immature. In addition, 67% of placebo patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the EGFR mutation positive subgroup received second or further line treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which may have affected the observed hazard ratio for OS. Nonetheless, the HR for OS in patients with activating EGFR mutations was below 1.00 (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.34, 2.02).

In an updated analysis of OS (data cut-off 12 Jan 2012), no difference was observed in the risk of death between the two treatment groups in the subgroup of patients with tumours harboring an EGFR-activating mutation. The HR for OS was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.52; 1.97), the p-value (log-rank test) was 0.9739 and the median OS was 23.8 and 23.6 months in the placebo and erlotinib groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

In the Liu et al. 2015 meta-analysis of more than 1592 patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations from 27 randomized controlled studies with first generation EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), pooled estimates of treatment efficacy were calculated based on published HRs or estimated from other survival data.

The analysis of PFS in patients receiving EGFR-TKIs or placebo as maintenance therapy included data from three clinical studies (including the BO18192 [SATURN] subgroup). Results in patients with EGFR activating mutations were consistent with the findings from SATURN, revealing a significant PFS benefit for first-line maintenance treatment with erlotinib versus placebo (HR [95% CI]: 0.14 [0.08, 0.26], p= 0.00001). Patients without an EGFR activating mutation had an HR (95% CI) of 0.81 (0.68, 0.97), p= 0.02. Other findings of this meta-analysis included the following:

- In patients with EGFR activating mutations, treatment with an EGFR-TKI showed a PFS benefit over treatment with chemotherapy in the first-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 0.41 [0.31, 0.55], p=0.00001) and in the second/third-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 0.46 [0.24, 0.89], p=0.02). For patients without a mutation, PFS was reduced with an EGFR-TKI compared with chemotherapy in the first-line (HR [95% CI]: 1.65 [1.06, 2.58], p=0.03) and second/third-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 1.27 [1.08, 1.51], p=0.005).
- A significant difference (p=0.04) in PFS improvement between patients with and without a mutation could also be seen for treatment with an EGFR-TKI versus placebo (four clinical studies) (HR [95% CI]: 0.26 [0.09, 0.79], p=0.02 for patients with a mutation and 0.83 [0.72, 0.95], p=0.006 for patients without a mutation), suggesting a greater PFS benefit of EGFR-TKIs as first-line and second/third-line treatment in patients with EGFR activating mutations compared with patients without a mutation.
- Patients treated with EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy (five clinical studies) had a more pronounced PFS benefit compared with chemotherapy alone (HR [95% CI]: 0.49 [0.32, 0.77], p=0.002 for patients with a mutation and 0.83 [0.71, 0.96], p=0.01 for patients without a mutation). The heterogeneity between the two subpopulations was significant (p =0.03).

Overall, the authors suggest that a treatment benefit with EGFR-TKIs could be shown for patients with EGFR activating mutations irrespective of the treatment setting.

The meta-analysis by Liu et al. included, amongst others, three studies in the maintenance setting, where an EGFR-TKI is compared with placebo:

- 1) IFCT-GFPC with 8 patients with EGFR activating mutation (Erlotinib vs. Placebo)
- 2) INFORM with 30 patients with EGFR activating mutation (Gefitinib vs. placebo)
- 3) SATURN with 49 patients with EGFR activating mutation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 8: Summary of the meta-analysis of first-line therapy and maintenance therapy with EGFR-TKIs

<!-- image -->

The authors pooled the three above studies and could show a statistically significant HR, but the results seem to be mainly driven by the SATURN study. Nonetheless, altogether data from the three studies provide evidence for the effect of EGFR-TKI's in the maintenance setting.

## Pooled Analysis of Published Clinical Study Data 4

The Paz-Ares et al. 2014 pooled analysis of prospective or retrospective studies evaluated treatment with single agent EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib) or chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations. The pooled median PFS was evaluated in 26 studies (731 patients) with erlotinib, 54 studies (1802 patients) with gefitinib, and 20 studies (984 patients) with chemotherapy. The results of the analysis indicated that the PFS (bootstrap estimated 95% confidence limit) was longer in patients when treated with erlotinib (12.4 months [10.9, 13.4 months]), or gefitinib (9.4 months [8.7, 10.2 months]) compared with conventional chemotherapy (5.6 months [5.1, 6.2 months]). Permutation testing with 20,000 random permutations indicated that the increase in PFS was statistically significant for erlotinib or gefitinib compared with chemotherapy in the first-line, in lines other than first-line (p=0.0022 and p=0.0039, respectively), and in all lines of therapy. Pooled median PFS values for erlotinib were not statistically different between lines of therapy (12.0 vs. 12.9 months for first-line vs. other lines, p=0.678). Overall, the Applicant claim that a clear PFS benefit was reported with an EGFR-TKI compared with chemotherapy for NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations in all lines of treatment.

## Supportive study

## The Atlas study: randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase IIIB Study

The ATLAS study 1  explored the potential benefit of adding maintenance erlotinib to bevacizumab after a first-line chemotherapy regimen with bevacizumab in 743 patients with advanced NSCLC, including 52 patients with EGFR activating mutations (27 with bevacizumab/erlotinib and 25 with bevacizumab/placebo). Patients were eligible if they showed stable disease or no significant toxicity after four lines of chemotherapy.

In the mutation-positive population, biomarker analyses showed a greater improvement in PFS with bevacizumab/erlotinib versus bevacizumab/placebo (HR [95% CI] 0.44 [0.22, 0.86]) compared with patients without an EGFR activating mutation (n=295; 150 bevacizumab/erlotinib and 145 bevacizumab/placebo) (HR [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.64, 1.13]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

More than 50% of patients in each group had subsequent second-line therapy. Despite this, OS results showed a similar difference in outcome between the combination with erlotinib and with placebo by EGFR mutation status: HR (95% CI): 0.46 (0.21, 1.02) for patients with EGFR activating mutations and 0.86 (0.65, 1.15) for patients without an EGFR activating mutation.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The IUNO study was designed at the request of regulatory authorities to investigate 'early erlotinib' vs. 'late erlotinib'. Patients without PD after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised to erlotinib 150mg/day or placebo until PD, death or unacceptable toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of erlotinib in maintenance therapy in patients with NSCLC and no known EGFR activating mutation. 321 patients were randomised to receive placebo and 322 were randomised to receive erlotinib.  The primary endpoint was OS and secondary endpoints were PFS, ORR, DCR (disease control rate), and safety. The IUNO study had a blinded phase, which was the time from randomisation to PD. After PD the study was un-blinded. Patients in the placebo arm would then switch to erlotinib and patients in the erlotinib arm would switch to second-line chemotherapy or BSC.  The primary endpoint was assessed using a 2-sided stratified log-rank test at 5% significance level.

The baseline characteristics are well-balanced between the two groups. The majority of the patients were male, white, ECOG PS 1, had adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV disease.

The SATURN study had been previously assessed by the CHMP (Doc. Ref No. EMA/CHMP/298837/2010) and was the basis for the maintenance indication. Therefore, a re-assessment of this study was not performed in this variation. However, a discussion of the updated data from the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation was assessed.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoint in the IUNO study shows no difference between the two groups (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.22; p-value = 0.8183). Thus, there seems to be no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC with no known EGFR activating mutation. The subgroup analysis shows the HR in the different subgroups is not different from the overall estimate. Some subgroups (North America and Eastern Europe) have HR that are very different from the overall estimate, however, the 95%CIs are very wide reflecting the small number of patients in these subgroups. The results of the PFS analysis are consistent with the OS data.

Thus, the indication of 'maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.' is no longer justified.

However, following the SAG recommendations in 2010 the CHMP assessed the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutations. In this subgroup, the effect in terms of PFS associated with erlotinib administration (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12, 0.45, p&lt;0.0001, median PFS 13.0 weeks with placebo versus 46.1 weeks with erlotinib) was very large. An updated analysis of PFS in this subgroup confirms the previous findings. The use of erlotinib as maintenance after first line treatment shows no detrimental effect on OS in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutations. The KM curves are overlapping. This is somewhat expected, since any effect of erlotinib on OS is bound to be diluted by cross-over and later lines of therapy.

To further support the use of erlotinib in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutations, the Applicant has provided analyses of three published studies. The ATLAS study investigated the efficacy of bevacizumab+erlotinib vs. bevacizumab+placebo in the maintenance setting in patients with stable disease after first line treatment. Known EGFR mutation status was not required for inclusion and was not a stratification factor. In total 373 patients were randomised to bevacizumab +placebo and 370 patients were randomized to bevacizumab +erl. A biomarker analysis identified 52 patients in total (27 patients in the bevacizumab +erl and 25 patiens in the bevacizumab +placebo) with EGFR activating mutations. The PFS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was statistically significant in favour of patients with EGFR activating mutation being treated with bevacizumab +erl compared to those with EGFR activating mutation being treated with bevacizumab+placebo (HR = 0.44). This is reassuring and provides further supportive evidence for the findings in the SATURN study in this subpopulation. The results showed no detrimental effect on OS.

The meta-analysis by Lui et al. included, amongst others, three studies in the maintenance setting, where EGFR-TKIs were compared with placebo. The authors pooled the three studies and could show a statistically significant HR, but the results seem to be mainly driven by the SATURN study. Nonetheless, the data from the three studies provide further evidence for the effect of EGFR-TKI's in the switch maintenance setting for patients with EGFR-activating mutations.

The last supportive study, the Paz-Ares study, analysed both prospective and retrospective studies. The study provided evidence for the efficacy of EGFR-TKI's in first-line and other lines of therapy, however, did not provide any direct evidence for the use of erlotinib in maintenance setting.

In light of the results from the IUNO study and other available information on erlotinib, the MAH is recommended to discuss the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients without EGFR activating mutation status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The efficacy of erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation has previously been demonstrated in clinical trials (e.g. EURTAC, EMA/657134/2011). However, the indication of 'switch maintenance use of erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum based first line chemotherapy' is no longer justified based on the findings in the IUNO study. The study failed to meet its primary endpoint, OS. However, the efficacy of erlotinib in the maintenance setting in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation has previously been shown in exploratory analysis in the SATURN study. Updated analysis of the SATURN trial support these previous findings. Recent scientific publications provide further evidence on the efficacy of erlotinib in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutation. In line with the findings in the SATURN study, large improvements in PFS in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutation were observed in the ATLAS study. Based on the SATURN study, switch maintenance treatment was considered justified in patients with stable disease after first-line treatment.

Overall, taking the totality of data and the biological rationale for the use of erlotinib in EGFR mutated patients into consideration, the use of erlotinib in the switch maintenance setting in patients with NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation with stable disease after first-line chemotherapy treatment is considered justified.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The SATURN study has previously been evaluated by the CHMP. However, the safety in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation will be subject to an assessment.

The safety data from the IUNO study will also be described in this section.

## Adverse events

STUDY BO18192 (SATURN) Overall, the safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbored EGFR-activating mutations was consistent with previously observed data. An overview of key safety data reported in the EGFR mutant subpopulation of the BO18192 (SATURN) study based on the Clinical Study Report cut-off date is presented in the below table, and detailed results are described in the following sections.

Investigator text for AEs encoded using MedlRA version 18.0. Fercentages are based on N in the colimn headings. For frequency coumts by preferred tem, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted only once. For frequency counts of \"Total number of events\" rows, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are coumted separately.

## Deaths

For the IUNO study, there were 36 deaths during the blinded phase, 25 in the erlotinib group and 11 in the placebo group; in total 22 deaths were due to progressive disease (PD) and 14 deaths were due to adverse events. More patients on erlotinib died due to PD in the blinded phase compared to on placebo (14/322 [4.3%] vs. 8/319 [2.5%]) and the majority of these deaths on erlotinib occurred within 12 weeks from randomization (2.5% [8/14] vs. 0.9% [3/8] on placebo), although one of the protocol inclusion criteria mandated that the patient's life expectancy should have been at least 12 weeks from randomization to be included in the study. A similar proportion of patients died due to PD in the remainder of the blinded phase (1.9% [6/322] of patients on erlotinib vs. 1.6% [5/319] of patients on placebo).

There were more deaths due to AEs (defined as events that may not be attributed exclusively due to the progression of underlying malignancy) in the erlotinib group (11 patients [3.4%]) compared with the placebo group (3 patients [0.9%). The majority of these deaths were similarly within the first 12 weeks postrandomisation (6/11 on erlotinib vs. 2/3 on placebo). None of the fatal events were considered causally related to blinded phase study drug by the investigators; rather, the majority was considered related to NSCLC and/or concurrent disease/concomitant medications (3 events) and 'other' undefined causes (4 events).

## Laboratory findings

Hematology laboratory parameters were only assessed as clinically needed during the BO25460 (IUNO) study. Mean and median hematology and chemistry parameters were within the normal range and generally comparable among patients in both treatment groups.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of patients with EGFR activating mutation is consistent with the findings for the entire population in the SATURN study. Although the number of patients is low, no concerns have been raised.  The most common AEs are skin disorders (rash) and diarrhoea. These are well-known AEs related to the use of erlotinib and are clinically manageable. There are no major differences with regard to the number of deaths. Only one SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) occurred in the erlotinib arm and none in the placebo arm. The event resolved with following treatment.

With regard to the IUNO, key safety data from the blinded phase of the study have been assessed. The most common AEs in the erlotinib arm are rash, diarrhoea, dyspnea and cough. The above pattern in AEs is in line with the known safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC. The number of deaths during the firsts 12 weeks was higher in the erlotinib arm due to an imbalance with regard to patients with a short life expectancy. In the remainder of the blinded phase, the number of deaths was comparable. During the blinded phase more deaths due to AEs are observed in the erlotinib arm. Six out of 11 deaths in the erlotinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm occurred during the first 12 weeks and may thus have been related to the imbalance in patients with a short life expectancy. Most of the AEs seem to be related to the underlying disease. However, severe infections, such as pneumonia with or without neutropenia, has been observed in other clinical trials. Furthermore, cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have previously been reported in patients being treated with erlotinib, however, several confounding factors exist such as prior radiotherapy, prior chemotherapy, pulmonary infections, and metastatic lung disease.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety of erlotinib in the subgroup of patients with EGRF activating mutation in the SATURN study is as expected. There are no new safety findings. There were no new safety findings in the IUNO study.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.5.4. Direct Healthcare Professional Communication

A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate on the revised indication and the results that have led to the conclusion that erlotinib is no longer indicated for maintenance treatment in patients without an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation.

The DHPC is provided in Attachment 3 together with the communication plan.

The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent authorities. The DHPC should be sent by 14 January 2016 to healthcare providers.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The MAH did not provide an updated RMP. A justification for non-inclusion of the updated Risk Management Plan was provided. Since there has been insufficient time to finalise the RMP update between release of the IUNO data and submission of this application, and in view of the urgency to amend the Product Information, the MAH commits to update and submit the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as soon as possible via a separate variation application. This has been considered an acceptable approach by the CHMP.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

- changes to the PL were considered not affecting readability.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The  benefits  of  erlotinib  in  terms  of  long-term  outcome  in  patients  with  NSCLC  with  EGFR  activating mutation have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. A subgroups analysis in the SATURN study has shown a remarkable gain in median PFS in this patient population in the switch maintenance setting after first-line therapy. The updated results of the study were consistent with the earlier results and confirm the clinically relevant effect of erlotinib in patients with activating EGRF mutations. The findings in the SATURN study in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation are supported by the ATLAS study, a meta-analysis by Lui et al (2015) and by a pooled analysis by Paz-Ares et al. (2014). No effect on OS and PFS was shown in the IUNO study in patient which did not harbour EGFR activating mutations. Overall, these data supporting the change in the indication to restrict to patients with locally advance NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first line treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The data to support the indication is mainly based on one study, the SATURN study, where EGFR activating mutations were pre-specified and were used as a stratification factor. The meta-analysis by Lui et al. included three studies in the maintenance setting, where EGFR-TKIs were compared with placebo. The pooled analysis showed a statistically significant HR, but the results seems to be mainly driven by the SATURN study. In addition, the supportive study, the Paz-Ares study, while providing evidence for the efficacy of EGFR-TKI's in first-line and other lines of therapy, did not provide any direct evidence for the use of erlotinib in maintenance setting. Given these caveats, the data from the SATURN study and the supportive evidence in the literature are considered robust enough to support the change in indication.

It was noted that at the time of the submission of this application, the final CSR for IUNO had not yet been finalised. Therefore the MAH has agreed to submit the final CSR for the IUNO study post approval, and also committed to submit a variation in order to update the RMP at the earliest convenience.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  safety  profile  of  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutation  is  in  line  with  the  findings  for  the  entire population in the SATURN study. Although the number of patients is low, no concerns have been raised and no differences were observed. The most common AEs were skin disorders (rash) and diarrhea. These are well-known AEs related to the use of erlotinib and are clinically manageable. There are no major differences with regard to the number of deaths. Only one SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) occurred in the erlotinib arm and none in the placebo arm. The event resolved with following treatment.

With regard to the IUNO, the most common AEs in the erlotinib arm were rash, diarrhea, dyspnea and cough. The above pattern in AEs are in line with the known safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No new safety signals have been detected and the adverse event profile is well-known for erlotinib as for other EGFR-TKI's. The safety of erlotinib should be viewed in the context of that this patient population in general have a very poor prognosis.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The remarkable gain in median PFS in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation in the SATURN study is clinically relevant, considering the poor prognosis that these patients are otherwise faced with. There is a clear biological and molecular rational for the treatment effect. The safety profile of erlotinib is well-known and well-characterised. The majority of AEs related to erlotinib are clinically manageable and pose no major concerns.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit-risk balance of erlotinib in the indication 'Tarceva is indicated for switch maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy. ' is considered positive in patients with EGFR activating mutations being treated in the switch  maintenance setting.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The remarkable effect seen in median PFS is not translated to an OS gain in the SATURN study. The use of erlotinib as maintenance after first line treatment shows no detrimental effect on OS in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutations. The KM curves are overlapping. This is somewhat expected, as any effect of erlotinib on OS is bound to be diluted by cross-over and later lines of therapy.

Based on the SATURN study, switch maintenance treatment was deemed justified in patients with stable disease after first-line treatment. Recent scientific publications (eg the ATLAS study, meta analyses on the effect of EGFR-TKIs) provided further support for the findings in the SATURN study in this subpopulation.

In conclusion, in the context of the totality of the efficacy and safety data presented, the benefits  associated with clinically relevant effects in terms of PFS and OS outweigh the risks with regard to the use of erlotinib in the switch maintenance setting in patients with stable disease after first-line treatment with EGFR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activating mutations.  In light of the results from the IUNO study and other available information on erlotinib, the MAH is recommended to discuss the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients without EGFR activating mutation status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:
