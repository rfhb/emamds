## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Respreeza is indicated for maintenance treatment, to slow the progression of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency ( e.g. genotypes PiZZ, PiZ(null), Pi(null,null), PiSZ). Patients are to be under optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment and show evidence of progressive lung disease ( e.g . lower forced expiratory volume per second

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(FEV1) predicted, impaired walking capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

First infusions should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. Subsequent infusions can be administered by a caregiver or by the patient (see section 4.4).

## Posology

The recommended dose of Respreeza is 60 mg / kg body weight (bw) administered once weekly.

## Elderly population

The safety and efficacy of Respreeza in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) have not been established in specific clinical trials.

## Patients with renal or hepatic impairment

No special investigations have been performed. No alternative dose regimen can be recommended in those patients.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Respreeza in the paediatric population (below 18 years) have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Respreeza should only be administered intravenously by infusion after reconstitution. The powder must be reconstituted with water for injections (see instructions on reconstitution in section 6.6) and administered using an intravenous administration set (supplied with the 4,000 and 5,000 package).

The reconstituted solution should be infused intravenously at an infusion rate of about 0.08 ml / kg bw / min. This infusion rate may be adjusted, based upon patient tolerability. The recommended dose of 60 mg / kg bw will take approximately 15 minutes to infuse. One vial of Respreeza is for single use only.

For detailed information regarding the administration of the reconstituted solution, see the instructions at the end of section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also section 4.4).
- IgA deficient patients with known antibodies against IgA, due to the risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

The recommended infusion rate given under section 4.2 should be adhered to. During the first infusions, patient's clinical state, including vital signs, should be closely monitored throughout the infusion period. If any reaction takes place that might be related to the administration of Respreeza, the rate of infusion should be decreased or the administration should be stopped, as required by the clinical condition of the patient. If symptoms subside promptly after stopping, the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity reactions may occur, including in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor.

Respreeza may contain trace amounts of IgA. Patients with selective or severe IgA deficiency can develop antibodies to IgA and, therefore, have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.

Suspected allergic or anaphylactic type reactions may require immediate discontinuation of the infusion, depending on the nature and severity of the reaction. In case of shock, emergency medical treatment should be administered.

## Home-treatment / self-administration

There are limited data regarding the use of this medicinal product in home-treatment / selfadministration.

Potential risks associated with home-treatment / self-administration are related to the handling and administration of the medicinal product as well as to the handling of adverse reactions, particularly hypersensitivity. Patients should be informed of signs of hypersensitivity reactions.

The decision of whether a patient is suitable for home-treatment / self-administration is made by the treating doctor, who should ensure appropriate training is provided (e.g. regarding reconstitution, use of Mix2Vial ® set, assembly of intravenous tubing, infusion techniques, maintenance of a treatment diary, identification of adverse reactions and measures to be taken in case such reactions occur) and the use is reviewed at regular intervals.

## Transmissible agents

Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation / removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.

The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A (HAV) and parvovirus B19 virus.

Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated receipt of human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors.

## Smoking

Tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema. Therefore, cessation of smoking and the avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke are strongly recommended.

## Sodium content

## Respreeza 1,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion

This medicine contains approximately 37 mg (1.6 mmol) sodium per 1,000 mg Respreeza vial. This is equivalent to 1.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## Respreeza 4,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion

This medicine contains approximately 149 mg (6.5 mmol) sodium per 4,000 mg Respreeza vial. This is equivalent to 7.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

Respreeza 5,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine contains approximately 186 mg (8.1 mmol) sodium per 5,000 mg Respreeza vial. This is equivalent to 9.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

That should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with Respreeza and its safety for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Since alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is an endogenous human protein, it is considered unlikely that Respreeza will cause harm to the foetus when given at recommended doses. However, Respreeza should be given with caution to pregnant women.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Respreeza / metabolites are excreted in human milk. The excretion of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Respreeza should be made, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of human alpha1proteinase inhibitor therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

No animal fertility studies have been conducted with Respreeza and its effect on human fertility has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Since human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is an endogenous human protein, no adverse effects on fertility are expected when given at recommended doses.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness may occur following the administration of Respreeza (see section 4.8). Therefore, Respreeza may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been observed during the treatment. In the most serious cases, allergic reactions may progress to severe anaphylactic reactions even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administrations (see section 4.4).

For safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions (ARs) collected from six clinical studies in 221 patients and post-marketing experience are presented in the table below according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term (PT) Level). Frequency per patient (based on six months of exposure during clinical trials) has been evaluated according to the following convention: common ( ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥1/1 ,000 to &lt;1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) and very rare (&lt;1/10,000). The frequency of ARs during post marketing only is considered as 'not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)'.

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Consequences of overdose are unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the event of overdose, the patient should be observed closely for the occurrence of adverse reactions and supportive measures should be available as necessary.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, proteinase inhibitor, ATC code: B02AB02

Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal constituent of human blood. Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor has a molecular weight of 51 kDa and belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors.

## Mechanism of action

Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is understood to be the primary anti-protease in the lower respiratory tract, where it inhibits neutrophil elastase (NE). Normal healthy individuals produce sufficient alpha1-proteinase inhibitor to control the NE produced by activated neutrophils and are thus able to prevent inappropriate proteolysis of lung tissue by NE. Conditions that increase neutrophil accumulation and activation in the lung, such as respiratory infection and smoking, will in turn increase levels of NE. However, individuals deficient in endogenous alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are unable to maintain appropriate antiprotease defence and experience more rapid proteolysis of the alveolar walls starting prior to the development of clinically evident chronic obstructive lung disease in the third or fourth decade.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The administration of Respreeza increases and maintains serum levels and lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor leading to a slowdown of the progression of emphysema.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## RAPID studies

The safety and efficacy of Respreeza was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center study (RAPID) followed by a 2-year open-label extension study (RAPID extension study). A total of 180 subjects with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency characterized by a serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor level &lt; 11 μM ( i.e. &lt; 50 mg/dL as determined by nephelometry) and clinical evidence of emphysema, were randomized to receive a weekly 60 mg / kg bw intravenous dose of either Respreeza (93 subjects) or placebo (87 subjects) for up to 24 months. The subjects ranged in age from 31 to 67 years (median age 54 years) with average baseline alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels of approximately 6.15 µM, and average volume-adjusted CT lung density of 47 g/L /50 g/L for Respreeza and placebo subjects, respectively.

One-hundred forty subjects (76 Respreeza-treated subjects and 64 subjects treated with placebo in the RAPID Study) continued into the RAPID extension study and were treated with a weekly 60 mg / kg bw intravenous dose of Respreeza for up to 24 months.

The studies investigated the effect of Respreeza on the progression of emphysema, assessed by the decline of lung density, measured by computer tomography (CT).

Respreeza-treated subjects demonstrated a consistent pattern of slower lung density decline than those receiving placebo (see Figure 1). The annual rate of lung density decline, as measured by CT scan at total lung capacity (TLC) over 2 years was lower with Respreeza (-1.45 g/L) as compared with placebo (-2.19 g/L), reflecting a 34% reduction (p = 0.017, 1-sided).

The RAPID extension study demonstrated that the reduced rate in lung density decline was maintained for subjects continuously treated with Respreeza for 4 years (see Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Single doses of 120 mg / kg bw have been administered to 137 subjects treated with Respreeza.

## Pediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Respreeza in all subsets of the pediatric population in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (see section 4.2 for information on pediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Four clinical studies were conducted with Respreeza in 89 subjects (59 males and 30 females) to evaluate the effect of Respreeza on serum levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. The subjects ranged in age from 29 to 68 years (median age 49 years). At screening, serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels were between 3.2 and 10.1 µ M (mean of 5.6 µ M).

A double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, crossover pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 13 males and 5 females with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency, ranging in age from 36 to 66 years. Nine subjects received a single 60 mg / kg bw dose of Respreeza followed by a comparator product, and 9 subjects received comparator product followed by a single 60 mg / kg bw dose of Respreeza, with a wash-out period of 35 days between doses. A total of 13 post-infusion serum samples were taken at various time points up to Day 21. Table 1 shows the mean results for the Respreeza pharmacokinetic parameters.

Table 1: Pharmacokinetic parameters for alpha1-proteinase inhibitor following a single 60 mg / kg bw dose of Respreeza

| Pharmacokinetic Parameter              | Mean (standard deviation)*   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Area under the curve (AUC 0- ∞ )       | 144 (±27) µMx day            |
| Maximum concentration (C max )         | 44.1 (±10.8) µM              |
| Terminal half-life (t 1/2ß )           | 5.1 (±2.4) days              |
| Total clearance                        | 603 (±129) mL/day            |
| Volume of distribution at steady state | 3.8 (±1.3) L                 |

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using data from 90 Respreeza-treated subjects from the RAPID trial. The population estimate of mean half-life was 6.8 days. The model predicted mean steady-state concentration was 21.8 µM after a 60 mg /kg bw / week dose. The population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetic analysis did not indicate that there were any significant effects of age, gender, weight, or baseline serum antigenic alpha1-proteinase inhibitor concentrations on the clearance of Respreeza.

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship

In a double-blind, controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety and biochemical efficacy of 7-11) were maintained above 11 µ M. The mean (standard deviation) of the steady state trough serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor level for Respreeza-treated subjects was 17.7 µ M (2.5).

In a subgroup of subjects enrolled in this study (10 Respreeza-treated subjects) broncho-alveolar showed a consistent increase following treatment. ELF levels of antigenic alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha1-proteinase inhibitor: NE complexes increased from baseline. Free elastase was immeasurably low in all samples.

Respreeza 44 subjects were randomized to receive 60 mg / kg bw intravenous dose of Respreeza once weekly for 24 weeks. The mean trough serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels at steady state (weeks lavage was performed. Epithelial lining fluid measurements (ELF) of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels

Following the completion of the RAPID study, an analysis of achieved median alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels and lung density decline was conducted. This analysis revealed an inverse linear relationship between trough serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels and the annual decline in lung density as measured by volume adjusted CT scans for subjects receiving 60 mg / kg bw intravenous dose of Respreeza.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The safety of Respreeza has been assessed in several preclinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology and short-term toxicity studies. Repeat dose toxicity studies longer than 5 days, reproductive toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies, have not been performed. Such studies are not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies against the heterologous human protein in animals. Since human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a protein and a physiological constituent of human blood, it is not expected to present carcinogenic, genotoxic, or teratogenic effects.

9. Place the Respreeza vial on an even and firm surface. Invert the water for injections vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and vertically pierce the Respreeza vial with the clear tip of the Mix2Vial set (Figure 4). The water for injections will automatically flow into the Respreeza vial.

NOTE: Ensure all water has transferred into the Respreeza vial.

10. Follow steps below to remove entire Mix2Vial set from Respreeza vial:

- With one hand tightly grasp the Respreeza vial as shown in Figure 5.
- With the other hand tightly grasp the water for injections vial and the blue part of the Mix2Vial set.
- Bend the entire Mix2Vial set to the side until it disconnects from the Respreeza vial (Figure 5).

Discard the water for injections vial with the entire Mix2Vial set.

11. Gently swirl the Respreeza vial until the powder is completely dissolved (Figure 6). DO NOT SHAKE. Take care not to touch the rubber vial stopper.

12. Inspect visually the reconstituted solution. The solution should be clear, colourless to slightly yellow, and free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are discoloured, cloudy or have particles.

13. If more than 1 vial of Respreeza is needed to achieve the required dose, repeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing an unused Mix2Vial set.

## Use a separate, unused Mix2Vial set, and a water for injections vial for each Respreeza vial.

14. The reconstituted solutions can be sequentially administered directly from the vial, or the reconstituted solutions can alternatively be transferred into an infusion container (e.g., empty intravenous bag or glass bottle; (not supplied) via a commercially available intravenous fluid tubing transfer set (not supplied)) prior to administration.

Use aseptic technique to transfer the reconstituted solution into an infusion container.

## Administration

The reconstituted solution must be administered using an IV infusion set.

1. Make sure that the air vent cap and the roller clamp of the IV infusion set are closed. VERTICALLY pierce the Respreeza vial with the IV infusion set spike while twisting the IV infusion set spike gently or connect it to an infusion container.
2. Elevate the Respreeza vial/infusion container or hang on an infusion stand.
3. Prime the drip chamber by squeezing it until the Respreeza solution has filled the chamber roughly half-way.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|   4. | Open the air vent cap of the IV infusion set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    5 | Slowly open the roller clamp of the IV infusion set and let the Respreeza solution flow until it reaches the end of the tubing with no air bubbles.                                                                                                                                                  |
|    6 | Close the roller clamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|    7 | Disinfect the injection site with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab before carefully inserting the needle into the vein. Make sure that there is no more air in the butterfly tube left.                                                                                                            |
|    8 | Connect the end of the IV infusion set to the butterfly set and open the roller clamp again.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|    9 | Infuse the reconstituted solution into the vein. The solution should be infused at an infusion rate of about 0.08 ml per kg body weight each min, as determined by your response and your comfort. The recommended dose of 60 mg per kg of body weight will take approximately 15 minutes to infuse. |

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or healthcare professional.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Respreeza is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Respreeza
3. How to use Respreeza
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Respreeza
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Respreeza is and what it is used for

## What Respreeza is

This medicine contains the active substance human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, which is a normal component of the blood and is found in the lung. There, its main function is to protect the lung tissue by limiting the action of a certain enzyme, called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase can cause damage if its action is not controlled (for example, in case you have an alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency).

## What Respreeza is used for

This medicine is used in adults with known severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (an inherited condition also called alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency) who have developed a lung condition called emphysema.

Emphysema develops when the lack of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor results in a condition in which neutrophil elastase is not being properly controlled, damaging the tiny air sacs in the lungs through which oxygen passes into the body. Because of this damage, the lungs do not work properly.

Using this medicine regularly increases the blood and lung levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, thus slowing the progression of emphysema.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Respreeza

## Do NOT take Respreeza

- if you are allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- if you have been found to have a deficiency of certain blood proteins called immunoglobulin type A (IgA) and have developed antibodies against them.

## Warnings and precautions

-  Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Respreeza.

Information on allergic reactions: when slowing or stopping the infusion may be required? You may be allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor even if you have previously received human alpha1-proteinase inhibitors and had tolerated them well. In some cases, severe allergic reactions may occur. Your doctor will inform you about signs of allergic reactions (for example chills, flushing, faster heartbeat, fall in blood pressure, light-headedness, rash, hives, itching, difficulty in breathing or swallowing as well as swelling of your hands, face, or mouth) (see also section 4).

-  Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions during the infusion of this medicine. Depending on the nature and severity of the reaction, your doctor may decide whether to slow or stop the infusion completely and start the appropriate treatment.
-  In case of self-administration / home-treatment, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor or healthcare professional.

## Information on safety with respect to infections

Respreeza is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood with the blood cells removed).

Because blood can carry infections, when medicines are made from human blood or plasma certain measures are put in place to prevent these from being present in the medicine and passed on to patients. These include:

- careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded,
- the testing of samples of donated blood and plasma to try to avoid use of material with signs of virus/infections,
- the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses.

The measures taken are considered effective for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and parvovirus B19 virus.

However, despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.

Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors.

-  It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Respreeza the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used.

## Smoking

Since tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema, you are strongly advised to stop smoking and avoid passive smoking.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age.

## Other medicines and Respreeza

-  Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

-  If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine.

Since alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, recommended dose of this medicine is not expected to cause harm to the developing foetus. However, as there is no information available regarding the safety of Respreeza use during pregnancy, if you are pregnant, this medicine should only be given to you with caution.

It is unknown whether Respreeza passes into human milk. If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.

There are no data concerning the effect on fertility but as alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, no adverse effects on fertility are expected if you use Respreeza at the recommended dose.

## Driving and using machines

Dizziness may occur after the administration of this medicine. If you experience dizziness, you should not drive or use machines until the dizziness has passed (see section 4).

## Respreeza contains sodium

This medicinal product contains approximately 37 mg sodium per 1,000 mg Respreeza vial, 149 mg sodium per 4,000 mg Respreeza vial and 186 mg sodium per 5,000 mg Respreeza vial, equivalent to 1.9%, 7.4% and 9.3% respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Your doctor or healthcare professional will take that into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

## 3. How to use Respreeza

After reconstitution, Respreeza is given by infusion into a vein. A healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency will supervise the first infusions.

## Home treatment / Self-administration

After the first infusions, you or your caregiver might also administer Respreeza, but only after receiving adequate training. If your doctor decides that you are suitable for such home-treatment / selfadministration, he or she will instruct you in:

- how to prepare and give this medicine (see the illustrated instructions at the end of this leaflet in 'Information for health-care professionals and for patients suitable for home-treatment / selfadministration'),
- how to keep the product sterile (aseptic infusion techniques),
- how to keep a treatment diary,
- how to identify side effects, including signs of allergic reactions, and measures to be taken in case such effects occur (see also section 2 and section 4).

Your doctor or your healthcare professional will regularly review your / your caregiver's infusion technique to ensure continued appropriate handling.

## Dose

The amount of Respreeza you are given is based on your body weight. The recommended dose is 60 mg per kg of body weight and should be administered once per week. The infusion solution is normally given over about 15 minutes (about 0.08 ml of solution per kg body weight each min). Your doctor will determine the appropriate infusion rate for you by taking into account your weight and your tolerability to infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you use more Respreeza than you should

Consequences of an overdose are unknown.

-  Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you think you have used more Respreeza as you should. He or she will take the appropriate measures.

## If you forget to use Respreeza

-  Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor or healthcare professional.
-  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop using Respreeza

-  Do no stop using this medicine without consulting your doctor or healthcare professional. If treatment with Respreeza is stopped, your condition may worsen.

| 2. Elevate the Respreeza vial/infusion container or hang on an infusion stand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3. Prime the drip chamber by squeezing it until the Respreeza solution has filled the chamber roughly half-way.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4. Open the air vent cap of the IV infusion set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5. Slowly open the roller clamp of the IV infusion set and let the Respreeza solution flow until it reaches the end of the tubing with no air bubbles.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6. Close the roller clamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7. Disinfect the injection site with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab before carefully inserting the needle into the vein. Make sure that there is no air in the butterfly tube left.                                                                                                                 |
| 8. Connect the end of the IV infusion set to the butterfly set and open the roller clamp again.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9. Infuse the reconstituted solution into the vein. The solution should be infused at an infusion rate of about 0.08 ml per kg body weight each min, as determined by your response and your comfort. The recommended dose of 60 mg per kg of body weight will take approximately 15 minutes to infuse. |
