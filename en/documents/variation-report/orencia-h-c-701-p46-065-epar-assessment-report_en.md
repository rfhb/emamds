## 1. Introduction

On  29  July  2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  study  report  for  a  completed  clinical  study  (study  number IM101566) for ORENCIA, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The study enrolled a mixed population of adult and paediatric patients.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study number IM101566, entitled 'A Phase II Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind,  Parallel  Arms  with  Switchover,  Pilot  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of Intravenous Abatacept in Treatment Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis/ Minimal Change Disease)' is a stand alone study.

The  MAH  stated  that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for ORENCIA and therefore no further impact on the ORENCIA product information is anticipated.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Intravenous abatacept, currently marketed for use in adult and paediatric subjects with RA/pJIA, is a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilised powder for 'concentrate for solution' IV use. This was the formulation used in Study IM101566.

There is no difference in the way the abatacept dose is prepared for and administered to adult and paediatric/adolescent  populations.  A  silicone-free  syringe  was  used  to  reconstitute  the  lyophilised powder and for transfer to the infusion bag/bottle.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- study number IM101566, entitled 'A Phase II Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Arms with Switchover, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Abatacept in Treatment Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis/ Minimal Change Disease)'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study IM101566

## Description

Study  IM101566  was  a  Phase  2  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  arms  with  switchover,  placebocontrolled multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous abatacept in adult and paediatric patients with treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome (TRNS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Assess improvement  in complete remission while maintaining renal function following treatment with abatacept compared to placebo.
- o Assess  difference  in  percent  of  subjects  achieving  complete  remission  (UPCR  ≤  0.3) with preservation of eGFR at Day 113.
- Assess improvement in patient reported outcomes related to nephrotic syndrome.
- o Assess  changes  using  the  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information System (PROMIS).
- Assess the safety and immunogenicity of abatacept in subjects with TRNS.
- o Describe rates of AEs and SAEs and immunogenicity testing.
- Assess the pharmacokinetics of abatacept in subjects with TRNS.

## Study design

In  the  original  study  design,  subjects  were  to  be  randomised  1:1  to  IV  abatacept  or  placebo  in  a double-blind fashion into parallel arms with a switchover study design. The trial consisted of 5 periods: the Screening Period was 28 days (could be extended an additional 14 days to complete testing by repeating screening labs), a 16 week Treatment Period 1 (parallel arms: IV abatacept vs placebo), a switchover in treatment in a second 16-week Treatment Period 2, and a 169 day abatacept Open Label Extension  Period  (OLE),  and  a  6  month  Follow-up  Period.  The  original  study  design  is  depicted  in Figure 1.

In  an  attempt  to  improve  enrolment,  the  study  design  was  modified  after  study  initiation  within Amendment 2 of the study protocol. The final study design was also to randomise subjects 1:1 to IV abatacept  or  placebo  in  a  double-blind  fashion  into  parallel  arms  but  without  the  switchover  and  a blinded Period 2. The trial consisted of 4 periods: the Screening Period was 28 days (could be extended an additional 14 days to complete testing by repeating screening labs), a 16 week Double-Blind Period (parallel arms: IV abatacept vs placebo), and a 169 day abatacept Open Label Extension Period (OLE), and a 6 month Follow-up Period. An optional early escape for subjects &lt; 18 year of age was available on Day 85. The revised study design is shown in Figure 2.

## Study population /Sample size

Key inclusion criteria:

- Male and female subjects aged 6 years or older
- Subjects  diagnosed  with  TRNS  due  to  either  focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis  (FSGS)  or Minimal Change Disease (MCD) [TRNS (FSGS/MCD)]
- o Pathological findings of either FSGS (excluding collapsing FSGS) or MCD on the most recent renal biopsy (renal biopsies will not be part of this study). This will be confirmed by review of the pathology report (not slides) by a central pathologist
- o UPCR ≥ 3 at screening
- o Treatment resistant defined as:
-  Persistence  of  UPCR  ≥  3  in  spite  of  therapy  with  any  one  of  the  following agents: corticosteroids (CS), calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid (MPA) or cyclophosphamide
-  Duration  of  therapy:  The  duration  of  CS  therapy  required  to  determine treatment  resistance  will  be  6  weeks  in  subjects  &lt;  18  year  of  age  and 12 weeks for subjects ≥ 18 years. For all other agents, the minimum duration of therapy will be 16 weeks, regardless of age
-  Intolerance to any two of these agents, regardless of duration of treatment or age
- Subjects  must  be  receiving  either  an  angiotensin-converting-enzyme  inhibitor  (ACEi)  or  an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at stable doses for at least 2 weeks prior to randomisation unless intolerance is documented. Combined use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors will  not  be  allowed.  If  aldosterone  inhibitors  (spirolactone  or  eplerenone)  or  aliskiren  (direct renin inhibitor) are used, they must also be at stable doses.
- A  minimal  level  of  renal  function  at  screening  based  on  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate (eGFR) will be required (≥ 45 for both children and adults)
- APOL1 Genotyping. Subjects will be genotyped for the APOL1 renal risk variants SNPs [Risk allele  G1  (rs73885319  and  rs60910145)  and  risk  allele  G2  (rs71785313)].  Subjects  with 2 copies of the high-risk APOL1 variants are in the APOL1 high-risk group which will be used for stratification at randomization. Genotyping during screening will not be necessary if results of previous testing are available. Subjects will be allowed to opt-out of genotyping for APOL1. Subjects who refuse genotyping will still be eligible to be randomised.
- Concomitant medication. Subjects may enrol with or without the following background agents used to treat TRNS  (FSGS/MCD):  CS  (low  dose, prednisone or equivalent at doses ≤ 10 mg/day), calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), MMF or MPA. Agents must be used at standard doses, must not have been started within 8 weeks of enrolment and must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation. No adjustment in doses of concomitant medications will be allowed during the double-blind period. Dose decrease or holds to address drug-related toxicity are allowed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Key exclusion criteria:

- Subjects with causes of TRNS other than FSGS or MCD (eg, IgA nephropathy, obesity related glomerulopathy or membranous nephropathy)
- Subjects with collapsing FSGS, also known as collapsing glomerulopathy
- Subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Subjects with diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2
- Subjects with clinically significant congestive heart failure (CHF; New  York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or Class IV)
- Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 for adults

The  study  was  planned  to  randomise  90  subjects  to  assess  the  primary  endpoint  of  proportion  of subjects in Renal Response at Day 113 between the IV Abatacept and placebo arms. Randomisation was stratified by genotype (APOL1 high risk group vs Others) and age (&lt; 18 and ≥ 18 years).

## Treatments

Subjects randomised to abatacept treatment in the Double-Blind Period were dosed as follows.

- Adults  used  the  weight-tiered  dose:  &lt;  60  kg:  500  mg,  60  to  100  kg:  750  mg,  &gt;  100  kg: 1000 mg;
- Paediatric patients 6 to 17 years who weigh &lt; 75 kg received 10 mg/kg and those who weigh ≥ 75 kg followed adult dosing.

Dosing  was  on  Day  1,  15,  29  and  then  every  28  days  for  113  days.  Subjects  in  the  placebo  arm received normal saline or D5W following the same dosing schedule. In the open-label extension, all subjects received age and weight-based IV abatacept every 28 days for 169 days.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects in Renal Response at Day 113. Renal Response was defined as a subject meeting all of the following criteria:

- Proteinuria: Reduction of baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) of ≥ 50% and to less than 3.
- Renal function: No worsening of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), defined as  within  normal  range  if  normal  at  baseline,  or  ≥  75%  baseline  value  if  below  normal  at baseline.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included:

- Mean change from baseline in UPCR at Day 113
- Mean change from baseline in serum albumin at Day 113
- Proportion of subjects achieving complete remission (UPCR ≤ 0.3 with eGFR: normal or ≥ 75% of baseline value if below normal at baseline) at Day 113
- Mean change from baseline in PROMIS measures at Day 113.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety endpoints included:

- all adverse events (AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths, etc) and AEs of interest (infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders,  infusion  related  reactions,  renal-related events).

The immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects with positive antibody response relative to baseline over time.

Exploratory endpoints  comprised  mean  change  from  baseline  in serum  total cholesterol  and triglycerides  at  Day  113;  and  mean  change  in  height  standard  deviation  score  (HSDS)  in  subjects &lt; 18 years at Day 113.

The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT  Analysis  Population  by treatment group assigned at randomisation during the double-blind period. The primary analysis was to be repeated using the PP analysis population if more than 10% of subjects in any treatment group met the criteria for a relevant protocol deviation. All other efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT Analysis Population, unless otherwise specified.

Analysis of all safety data followed the MAH's standard safety data conventions and supplements to the standard conventions for the abatacept programs. The evaluation of drug safety was based primarily on  clinical  AEs,  vital  signs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  reported  during  the  study.  All  safety presentations were based on the As Treated Analysis Population by treatment group. Unless otherwise specified  adverse  events  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  summarised  for  double-blind  period, cumulative abatacept safety period and OLE period. The efficacy analysis was mainly focused on the double-blind period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 66 subjects were enrolled at 24 sites in the US, and 36 were randomised and treated. The remaining 30 enrolled subjects failed to meet study criteria. Of the 36 randomised subjects, 16 were less than 18 years of age.

The  enrolment  period  lasted  approximately  36  months.  The  MAH  terminated  Study  IM101566 prematurely  due  to  concerns  over  an  unexpectedly  slow  rate  of  enrolment,  in  spite  of  previously extending the study recruitment timelines and multiple efforts to increase enrolment, including a major protocol  revision.  The  Data  Monitoring  Committee  also  voiced  concern  over  the  slow  enrolment  to complete and achieve the primary study efficacy assessment and recommended study termination.

## Baseline data

For  all  randomised  and  treated  subjects,  the  mean  (SD)  age  was  25.8  (16.80)  years,  55.6%  of subjects were female and most subjects were white (75.0%) and not Hispanic/Latino (80.6%). For the paediatric subjects, mean (SD) age was 11.0 (3.06) years, 43.8% of subjects were female, and most subjects were white (62.5%) and not Hispanic/Latino (75.0%). Baseline demographic characteristics for the entire study population and the paediatric subgroup are summarised in Tables 2 and 3.

## Efficacy results

## Subject disposition

Subject disposition is summarised in Table 6. A total of 27 subjects (75%) completed the double-blind period, and 22 (61.1%) were treated in Period 2 (with the remaining 5 subjects entering OLE directly after  the  double-blind  period  as  per  amended  study  design).  A  total  of  23  subjects  (63.9%)  were treated in OLE, and 10 subjects (27.8%) completed OLE.

Includes\\_data up to 56 days post last Abatacept\\_dose date. SAEs include hospitalizaticns\\_for elective suurgical procecures. Related AE or SAE defined as AE or SAE with Related or Missing relationship to study medication. MEDDRA VERSION:22.1

No deaths were reported during the study. SAEs were reported in 9 subjects during the double-blind period  (5  in  the  abatacept  group  and  4  in  the  placebo  group;  Table  13).  Of  these,  one  SAE  was considered related to study drug; this was a case of Grade 1 lip swelling on study day 6 in a subject assigned to placebo. The event resolved on day 8 and no action was taken concerning the study drug. During the cumulative abatacept period, a total of 10 subjects experienced an SAE (Table 14).

The  MAH  has  separately  highlighted  four  SAEs  as  follows:  one  subject  had  new  onset  of  reported seizures  7  weeks  after  the  last  infusion  of  abatacept;  one  subject  had  a  complex  medical  event characterised by acute kidney injury associated with thrombotic microangiopathy and pneumonia due to  RSV,  almost  4  months  after  the  last  dose  of  abatacept;  one  subject  developed  a  tunnel  graft

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infection  over  6  months  after  last  abatacept  dose;  and  one  subject  develop  a  parainfluenza  virus pneumonia  after  their  3rd  dose  of  abatacept  (this  was  the  only  serious  infection  associated  with abatacept use).

During the double-blind period, three subjects (8.3%) experienced an AE that led to discontinuation: in the abatacept group, 1 subject discontinued due to fluid overload, and in the placebo group, 1 subject discontinued due to influenza and another subject due to acute kidney injury. During the cumulative abatacept period, 2 subjects (6.3%) had an AE that led to discontinuation (1 subject with diarrhoea, face oedema and non-cardiac chest pain, and 1 subject with fluid overload).

Most frequently reported AEs across both dose groups during the double-blind period are displayed in Table  15.  During  the  cumulative  abatacept  period,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  nausea (25%), diarrhoea (21.9%), vomiting (21.9%), headache (18.8%) and upper respiratory tract infection (15.6%).

Among pre-specified  AEs  of  special  interest,  peri-infusional  AEs  were  more  frequent  with  abatacept than placebo. Other AEs  of special interest  were  equally  distributed  between  treatment  groups,  the most common AE of special interest being an infection in both groups (Table 16).

There  were  no  particular  findings  in  clinical  laboratory  assessments.  The  most  frequent  laboratory abnormality was a low total protein concentration, observed in 4 subjects on abatacept and 6 subjects on placebo.

According to the MAH, the overall safety observed was consistent with that seen in abatacept trials and more favourable than that  seen  in  randomised  controlled  trials  with  abatacept  for  the  treatment  of active lupus nephritis.

## Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity results

In study IM101566, PK blood samples were obtained pre-dose and 0.5 hours post-dose in relation to each study drug administration. In addition, samples were collected at 1 week intervals between study days  85  and  113  for  determination  of  the  area  under  the  serum  time  curve  over  a  dosing  interval (AUCtau).  Trough  (Cmin)  and  maximum  observed  serum  concentrations  (Cmax)  and  AUCtau  are summarised in Table 17. The results in the overall populations showed that trough concentration did not reach therapeutic levels of 10 ug/mL, with the exception of Day 29 within the adult population. According to the MAH, the detrimental effects of ongoing proteinuria contributed to the observed PK, and  the  lower  exposures  compared  to  those  seen  in  non-proteinuric  patients  were  therefore  as expected.

In study IM101566, immunogenicity was evaluated at Day 1 (Baseline) and at Day 113. For subjects who discontinued during or at the end of the Double-blind Treatment Period, immunogenicity was also evaluated 56, 84 and 168 days after the last dose of study medication. Immunogenicity results are summarised in Table 18. In the abatacept group, 1 out of 14 subjects (7.1%) had a positive CTLA4 and possibly Ig response at Day 113, and 3 out of 7 subjects (42.9%) had a positive CTLA4 and possibly Ig response during post-treatment visits. In the placebo group, no subjects had a positive response at Day 113, whereas 2 out of 5 subjects (40.0%) had a positive CTLA4 and possibly Ig response during post-treatment  visits.  No  paediatric  subjects  in  the  abatacept  group  had  a  positive  response  either during or post treatment, whereas in the placebo group, one paediatric subject developed a positive response post treatment. According to the MAH, the presence of anti-drug antibodies had no effect on the PK or safety.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study IM101566 was a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety  of  intravenous  abatacept  in  the  treatment  of  treatment  resistant  nephrotic  syndrome.  In principle,  the  design  elements  as  described  are  considered  adequate  and  fit  for  purpose.  A  mixed population of  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  was  to  be  enrolled,  and  randomisation  was  stratified  by age. For purposes of Article 46, it should be noted that there was no specified minimum number of paediatric subjects.

Subject  enrolment  appears  to  have  been  challenging;  moreover,  a  significant  number  of  screened subjects  failed  to  meet  eligibility  criteria.  The  study  was  terminated  before  the  planned  number  of subjects had been randomised, and only 36 subjects, of which 16 subjects were in the paediatric age group,  were  ultimately  treated  with  study  drug  in  the  double-blind  period.  Overall,  32  subjects, including 15 paediatric subjects, were exposed to abatacept during the entire study.

Overall, very few subjects demonstrated any signs of potential efficacy in respect of either the primary or secondary endpoints assessed. The overall safety profile was consistent with previous experience. The relatively low abatacept exposures observed in the study are readily explained by the underlying condition in the patient population studied.

In conclusion, this prematurely terminated Phase 2 study did not suggest that abatacept would have general applicability for treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome in either adult or paediatric subjects, and  there  was  no  significant  new  safety  information.  Considering  the  very  limited  sample  size,  no further conclusions can be made.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The  current  study  does  not  seem  to  support  the  use  of  abatacept  in  treatment  resistant  nephrotic syndrome (FSGS or MCD type), and no claims thereto are made by the MAH. In terms of paediatric use, no conclusions relevant to Article 46 can be made based on the few paediatric subjects treated within the study. Overall, the results of the study do not change the benefit-risk profile of abatacept in its  currently  approved  indications  for  use.  No  changes  to  the  current  product  information  are warranted.
