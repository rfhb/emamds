## 1 Introduction

## Non-small-cell lung cancer

Lung cancer is the most frequent or second most frequent type of cancer among European men and ranks third or higher among European women. Prognosis is poor with relative 1-year survival rates of approximately 30% and 5-year survival rates around 10%. 134.171 men and 29.948 women died of lung cancer in the European Union in 1985 [1]. Although the standardised mortality ratio is declining slightly in men it is still rising in women in the vast majority of European Countries [2].

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 75% of lung cancers. Surgery is the preferred  treatment  of  patients  with  early  disease  but  more  than  60-65%  of  patients  present  with locally  advanced  (stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  disease  (stage  IV)  and  are  not  suitable  for  surgery. Virtually no patient with a disease staged as IIIB or IV will survive and the primary goal of therapy is palliative.  However,  moderate  gains  in  survival  and  other  important  outcomes  like  time  to  disease progression and quality of life have been shown with platinum-based chemotherapy [3, 4]. The current standard  of  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with  advanced  disease  consists  of  a  two-drug  platinumbased chemotherapy where 1-year survival rates of 33% and 2-year survival rates of 11% have been reported  [5].  Initial  therapy  will  ultimately  fail  and  second-line  chemotherapy  therapy  might  be considered.

Practices have varied as to second-line chemotherapy for NSCLC, and until recently the benefits of second-line  chemotherapy had not been well established and were mainly based phase II trials [6]. More  recently,  one  phase  III  trial  comparing  docetaxel  to  best  supportive  care  has  established  a positive benefit risk profile of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in second line treatment of NSCLC, with positive effects  on  survival,  progression-free  survival,  and  reduced  need  for  symptomatic  treatment  and radiotherapy [7, 8]. Pemetrexed has also been authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy [9, 10].

Patients  progressing  after  possible  second-line  therapy  with  docetaxel  are  usually  treated  with  best supportive care and palliative radiation. Gefitinib, a HER1/EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the same class as erlotinib, has been approved in some countries as third-line therapy based on phase II trials despite unknown benefits compared to best supportive care.

## About the product

EGFR is a trans-membrane glycoprotein consisting of a single polypeptide chain. EGFR belongs to a family  of  structurally  related  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (TK)  that  play  a  critical  role  in  many  cellsignalling pathways that influence cell division, apoptosis, motility and adhesion [11]. The binding of a  ligand  to  the  EGFR  initiates  a  cascade  of  events,  with  signal  transduction  culminating  in  nuclear gene  activation.    EGFR  is  believed  to  be  important  in  multiple  signal-transduction  pathways  and appears  to  play  a  critical  role  in  both  tumorigenesis  and  tumor  growth.  EGFR  and  its  ligands  are overexpressed or involved in autocrine growth loops in a number of tumor types, including NSCLC [12-14]. An increase in EGFR expression appears to correlate with aggressive morphology and poor outcome in NSCLC [15, 16] and poor response to therapy [17].

Tarceva  contains  erlotinib  (formerly  OSI-774,  CP-358,74,  R  1415,  NSC  718781),  a  quinazoline derivative,  which  is  an  inhibitor  of  EGFR  TK.  Erlotinib  hydrochloride  exists  as  an  anhydrous crystalline solid with three known polymorphs (A,B,E), of which modification A is the thermodynamically  most  stable  form  that  is  provided  from  routine  drug  processing.  Erlotinib hydrochloride is sparingly soluble in organic solvents and water. Erlotinib has no chiral centres. The molecular weight of the hyrdrochloride salt is 429.9.

The program leading to the discovery of erlotinib was initiated in the early 1990s. In vitro testing of erlotinib  demonstrated a specific and potent inhibition of EGFR (IC50 = 2 nM) [18]. Subsequent in vivo experiments assessed EGFR inhibition in human tumour xenograft efficacy models, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Phase I studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of erlotinib at various dose levels, suggesting a fixed daily oral dose of 150 mg as the recommended dose for Phase II studies. In a Phase II study in patients with NSCLC who had progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy, a 12.3% objective response rate and a median overall survival of 8.4 months were observed [19]. Subsequently, two Phase III trials of

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

erlotinib in first-line NSCLC with combination chemotherapy, were initiated. In addition, a Phase III study  of  erlotinib  as  single  agent  in  patients  with  NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  one  prior chemotherapy  regimen  (Study  BR.21)  was  conducted.  In  this  trial,  a  significantly  longer  overall survival  and  progression-free  survival  was  observed  for  erlotinib  compared  to  best  supportive  care [20].

## Finished Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The properties  of  erlotinib  hydrochloride  suggested  that  a  tablet  manufacturing  process  based  upon dry granulation might be suitable for development of a market formulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consideration was given to this in the selection of excipients, which was based on the evaluation with respect to suitability of manufacturing, and stability of two formulations containing a fixed amount of active  substance  and  varying  amount  of  fillers.  Stability  studies  were  also  performed  with  four different formulations containing the active substance in combination with different excipients under accelerated conditions of temperature and humidity.

During the development the influence of the particle size distribution on the processability and the dissolution behaviour of the film coated tablets were investigated.

Based upon the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties observed in preclinical in vivo studies an immediate release formulation was considered appropriate for clinical development.

The proposed formulations have also been used for the batches used in the clinical and pre-clinical studies. The only differences are the use of printing ink.

The small size of the tablets makes it easy for patients to swallow. The film-coating masks the bitter taste of the active ingredient and minimizes direct contact with the active substance.

All  excipients  chosen  are  well-known  and  comply  with  the  Ph  Eur,  except  from  the  printing  ink. Specifications for the printing ink were provided.

The choice and function of the excipients in the final formulation have been described and justified.

These are: lactose monohydrate, cellulose microcrystalline, sodium starch glycolate Type IA , sodium lauryl sulphate , magnesium stearate , colorants and printing ink.

Regarding the TSE compliance of the excipients, it is confirmed that the lactose used is in accordance with the Public Statement (EMEA/CPMP/571/02).

The description and choice of container closure system is in accordance with the CHMP guideline on Plastic primary packaging materials. The experience with the active substance and the data from the stability studies performed with the film coated tablets shows that the chosen PVC blister are adequate to support the stability and use of the medicinal product.

The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe

## 3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

All of the definitive toxicology and toxicokinetic studies were conducted in accordance with the GLP procedures. Pilot and exploratory toxicology studies were not conducted under GLP procedures but were generally conducted using appropriate protocols and documentation to assure data integrity.

## Pharmacology

Erlotinib was studied in various in vitro enzymatic and cell-based assays as well as in human tumour xenograft models in athymic mice. A variety of in vitro and in vivo general and safety pharmacology studies were  performed.

- Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

The  primary  pharmacodynamics  of  erlotinib  were  studied in  vitro using  human  colorectal  cancer (DiFi), head and neck cancer (HN5), and breast cancer cell lines. Erlotinib potently inhibited purified, full-length HER1/EGFR tyrosine kinase activity with an IC50 of 2 nM. The IC50 for the inhibition of cellular EGFR tyrosine kinase activity was 20 nM. More than 1000-fold higher concentrations were required  to  inhibit  other  kinases  such  as c-src and v-abl .  Erlotinib  also  selectively  inhibited  the recombinant intracellular kinase domain of EGFR, but not that of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin receptor, platelet-derived  growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ ),  Met,  and  CSF1R.  Complete Inhibition of HN5 cell proliferation in cell culture occurred at 250 nM. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell-cycle distribution indicated that the cells were partially blocked in G1. Inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib induced apoptosis in a significant fraction of DiFi cells [18]. According to the applicant,  the  primary  in  vivo  metabolites  of  erlotinib,  O-demethylated  positional  isomers  OSI-413 and OSI-420 (also referred to in the development as CP-373,420), also have EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity and in vivo tumor growth inhibitory activity. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (IC50) OSI-420, OSI-413, and OSI-943 was 2.5 nM, 1.4 nM, and not determined, respectively. Inhibition  of  cellular  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  activity  (IC50)  was    14  nM,  8  nM,  and  24  nM, respectively.

The cell-cycle effects of erlotinib hydrochloride were studied in human tumour xenografts in athymic mice where the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was monitored by immunohistochemistry  of  excised  tumor  samples.  Groups  consisting  of  4  tumor-bearing  mice  each were administered a single dose of erlotinib in 6% captisol / water, by IP bolus injection or PO. Two hours  prior  to  tumor  harvest,  10  mg/kg  BrdU  was  administered  IP.  Tumors  and  gut  tissue  were harvested  from  4-96h  post  erlotinib  dose,  and  relative  changes  in  BrdU  incorporation  were determined. In the case of duodenum, the labelling index nadir occurred at 8-24 hours for both IP and OS  administration, and recovered by 24-48 hours. Each  tumor  reached  the nadir  of  BrdU incorporation  at  different  times,  between  8-72  and  4-48  hours,  for  IP  and  PO  administration, respectively, and  returned to predose  levels by  48, and  8-72  hours, respectively. Since  the incorporation of BrdU occurs during S phase of the cell cycle, the BrdU incorporation profile reflects the duration of inhibitory effects exerted by erlotinib on DNA replication and cell cycle progression

The  dynamics  of  EGFR-receptor  inhibition  were  evaluated  in  athymic  human  tumour  xenograftimplanted  mice  dosed  orally  with  erlotinib.  Erlotinib  at  plasma  concentration  of  8  µM  potently

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>



reduced EGFR associated tyrosine phosphorylation within 1 hour of dosing. The effective dose for 50% inhibition of the target receptor  (ED50) was 9.9 mg/kg. On average, a 70% reduction in EGFRassociated  phosphotyrosine  over  a  24-h  period  was  observed  after  a  single  100  mg/kg  dose. Substantial  growth  inhibition  of  human  tumor  xenografts  was  achieved  with  PO  doses  of  the compound  (ED50  =  10  mg/kg/day  for  20  days).  At  92  mg/kg/day  HN5  tumour  growth  was  80% inhibited. Against well-established HN5 tumors (&gt; 1 cm in diameter), treatment with ≥ 11 mg/kg/day erlotinib  either  arrested  growth  or  slightly  decreased  the  size  of  tumors  during  the  dosing  period. Treatment with erlotinib  produced  tumour  stasis  during  and  somewhat  beyond  cessation  of  dosing. [21].

Xenograft  studies  on  the  effect  of  combining  erlotinib  with  gemcitabine  or  cisplatin  were  also submitted, and reports have been published [22]. The studies used the human NSCLC cell line A549 (a slow growing cell line with doubling time of approximately 10 days). The agents were combined at their maximum tolerated doses (MTD, erlotinib at 100 mg/kg daily po, gemcitabine at 120 mg/kg/day every 3 days IP, cisplatin at 6 mg/kg/day every 6 days IP) and at suboptimal doses representing ¼ MTD for both erlotinib  and  the  chemotherapeutic  agents.  Single  agent  activity  of  each  agent  at  its respective MTD was observed. Significant tumor growth inhibition was seen in the gemcitabine/erlotinib and cisplatin/erlotinib combinations (&gt;100% and 90%, respectively), with partial regressions. The enhanced tumor growth inhibition obtained when erlotinib was combined with either gemcitabine  or  cisplatin  was  significant  compared  to  that  obtained  with  monotherapy  (p&lt;0.05). However, treatment of human xenograft tumor bearing nude mice with erlotinib in combination with either  gemcitabine or cisplatin resulted in lethal toxicities when each of the drugs was dosed at the respective MTD. When ¼ MTD of erlotinib were administered in combination with sub-optimal doses ¼ MTD of either of the conventional chemotherapeutic agents, tumor growth inhibition was found to be synergistic and treatment was well tolerated. However, the combination therapy regimens were not significantly  superior  to  either  of  the  monotherapy  treatments  in  which  each  single  agent  was administered at its respective MTD.

Solid  tumor  xenograft  studies  were  performed  with  combination  therapies,  which  consisted  of erlotinib plus cisplatin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. The major aim of these studies was to examine the effects of sequencing the treatment regimes of chemotherapeutics and erlotinib in various combinations and explore potential differences in efficacy. There appeared to be no clear difference in efficacy in any of the dose-sequence studies. The dosing of erlotinib before the administration of the cytotoxic drug did not have any antagonistic effects. However, there appeared to be greater toxicity when both agents were dosed on the same day, irrespective if one was dosed prior to the other.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

In vitro  tissue  bath  studies,  a  ligand  binding  profile,  and in vivo  mouse  CNS activity  studies  were performed  as  part  of  the  initial  general  pharmacology  evaluation  of  erlotinib.    The  affinities  of erlotinib for 67 receptors and other binding sites were determined with radiolabeled ligand. Erlotinib interacted  with  low  affinity  on  peripheral  benzodiazepine  (IC50=  2.5  µM),  adenosine-1  (IC50 =  6.8 µM), and µ-opiate (IC50 = 7.0 µM) receptors. Binding occurred at concentrations 125-fold higher than the  IC50 concentration  required  to  inhibit  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  in  intact  cells  (20  nM)  and  at concentrations at least 1250 x higher than the IC50 for inhibition of purified EGFR tyrosine kinase (2 nM). At concentrations up to 1 µM, erlotinib did not significantly inhibit the binding of ligands to any of  the  other  64  neurotransmitter  receptors,  regulatory  binding  sites,  calcium  channels,  opioid receptors, or neurotransmitter uptake sites tested. In isolated tissue bath studies, erlotinib had no effect on  norepinephrine-stimulated  contraction  of  isolated  guinea  pig  aorta  or  on  oxytocin-stimulated contraction of isolated rat uterus. Erlotinib at 10 µM reduced the basal beating rate of isolated guinea pig  right  atria  by  10%  compared  with  vehicle-treated  control  atria,  but  had  no  effect  on  histamineinduced  increase  in  beating  rate.  The  force  of  histamine-induced  contraction  of  isolated  guinea  pig ileum  was  reduced  42%  by  10  µM  of  erlotinib.  The  force  of  Ca ++ -mediated  contraction  of  K + -depolarised guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle was reduced 34% by 100 µM of erlotinib. Therefore, the  applicant  concluded  that  the  inhibitory  effect  of  erlotinib  on  histamine-induced  contraction  of isolated  ileum  was  probably  not  due  to  calcium  channel  antagonism.  Erlotinib  blocked  potassium current  through  recombinant  hERG  channels  with  an  IC20 of  3  µM,  or  approximately  1170  ng/ml. Erlotinib  at  3  µM  had  no  effect  on  the  action  potential  duration,  amplitude,  maximum  upstroke velocity, or resting membrane potential in rabbit Purkinje fibres.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In studies on pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions in mice, erlotinib (up to 100 mg/kg) was neither proconvulsant or anticonvulsant.

## · Safety pharmacology

Erlotinib dose-dependently inhibited gastric emptying in rats after either oral (5, 10, and 50 mg/kg) or intravenous  (I.V.)  dosing  (2.5,  5  and  10  mg/kg).  In  rats,  erlotinib  up  to  50  mg/kg  orally  had  no biologically  significant  effect  on  renal  function,  blood  gases,  blood  pH,  mean  arterial  pressure,  or heart rate.

Oral administration of 1 to 320 mg/kg of erlotinib to mice did not induce behavioural changes. Mice given a 1000 mg/kg dose had reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in their individual cubicles at the 30 min timepoint, but had normal activity levels when transferred to the open field. One of 3 mice fell from the inverted screen at 1 and 2 hours after dosing, suggestive of impaired coordination and/or decreased  grip  strength.  There  were  no  deaths  in  any  group.  In  parallel  pharmacokinetic  studies, plasma concentrations of erlotinib reached a mean Cmax of 34000 ng/ml within 30 min after the 320 mg/kg  dose.  The  applicant  concluded  that  the  behavioural  studies  indicated  that  erlotinib  was  well tolerated  by  mice  at  plasma  concentrations  at  least  11  times  greater  than  the  estimated  clinically efficacious plasma concentration.

A test for potential acute neurobehavioral toxicity was performed in female rats dosed orally with 50, 225, or 1000 mg/kg erlotinib hydrochloride. The study was terminated after behavioural evaluations 24 hours after dosing. Two of ten rats in the high dose group had treatment-related, red discoloured urine  and  erlotinib  caused  a  slight  dose-dependent  decrease  in  body  temperature.  No  biologically significant neurobehavioral toxic effects were seen at any dose level.

The pharmacological effects of erlotinib on the respiratory system following a single oral gavage dose of 50-1000 mg/kg in the albino rat were evaluated. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, respiratory rate,  and  derived  minute  volume)  were  measured  for  15  minutes  periods  predose,  and  2,  6  and  24 hours postdose. No deaths, no adverse clinical signs, and no treatment-related effects on any of the respiratory parameters examined were observed.

The  cardiovascular  effects  were  studied  in  mongrel  dogs  treated  orally  with  erlotinib  at  50  or  100 mg/kg. The 50 mg/kg dose was expected to yield plasma concentrations near clinically efficacious plasma levels, but the measured levels were low, prompting evaluation of the 100 mg/kg dose. Neither 50 or 100 mg/kg erlotinib affected cardiovascular function in dogs. The measured maximal plasma levels  (Cmax )  ranged  from  0.2  to  2.8  fold  the  Cmax  plasma  concentration  of  approximately  3  µg/ml following a 150 mg dose of erlotinib. A second telemetry study confirmed these findings relative to a lack  of  an  erlotinib  effect  on  cardiovascular  function  in  dogs.  The  measured  individual  maximal plasma concentrations in this study in dogs ranged from 0.5 to 9.9 µg//ml.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No nonclinical drug interaction studies have been conducted.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted  by  the  I.V.  and  oral  route  of  administration  in  mice,  rats, dogs, and monkeys. For the first studies, HPLC procedures with ultraviolet detection were used, and later  HPLC  methods  coupled  with  LC-MS/MS  detection  were  developed,  which  provided  higher sensitivity, selectivity, and throughput.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

Similar pharmacokinetic behavior of erlotinib was observed between mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys following  oral  administration  of  erlotinib  hydrochloride.  Maximum  plasma  concentrations  were reached between 0.5 and 4 hours and the drug was eliminated with a terminal half-life of 1.5 to 3 hours. At doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg, nonlinear kinetics were generally observed with greater  than  expected  increases  in  AUC  suggesting  saturation  of  metabolism.  For  higher  doses,  the opposite effect was observed with either linear kinetics or less than expected increases in AUC and Cmax with increasing  dose.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  decreased  drug  absorption  at  high  doses possibly due to solubility-rate-limited kinetics. Substantial variability was observed in pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  all  dose  groups,  studies,  and  species.  Exposure  to  erlotinib  and metabolites was higher in dogs in the fed vs. fasted state. Substantial differences in erlotinib plasma

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure  were  observed  between  male  and  female  rats,  apparently  due  to  differences  in  CYP3A2 expression between genders and the slower metabolism of erlotinib in female rats by this enzyme.

Repeat-dose  studies  conducted  in  rats,  dogs,  and  monkeys  generally  showed  no  changes  in pharmacokinetic behavior of erlotinib over time.

## · Distribution

Tissue distribution was evaluated in athymic nude mice and rats using whole body autoradiography with 14 C-erlotinib hydrochloride. In mice with and without HN5 tumour xenografts, tissue distribution occurred  rapidly  with  maximum  radiolabel  concentrations  1  hour  after  oral  administration.  Most tissues  including  tumour  contained  similar  radioactivity  concentrations  to  that  in  plasma,  with  the exception of kidney and liver, which were approximately 2- to 3 fold greater. In HN5 tumor-bearing athymic nude mice, erlotinib penetrated uniformly into HN5 tumors, pancreas, and lungs. The tumorto-plasma  concentration  ratio  in  the  murine  human  tumor  xenograft  model  ranged  from  0.3  to  1. Radioactivity in the brain was approximately 6-fold less than observed in plasma indicating decreased penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Elimination half-life in plasma and most tissues was approximately 3 hours with liver displaying a longer half-life of 5-6 hours. In rats, radioactivity was widely  distributed  into  tissues  after  oral  administration,  with  peak  concentrations  around  4  hours postdose. Radioactivity was rapidly eliminated by both the renal route and via biliary secretion into the gastrointestinal tract. Only limited BBB transfer occurred. Melanin binding of radioactivity was observed. The decrease in radioactivity in pigment containing tissues in pigmented male rats was slow between 24 and 72 h.

Plasma protein binding of erlotinib was evaluated for mouse, rat, dog and human plasma with values of  95%,  92%, 85%, and 92% respectively. Similar experiments with the active metabolite OSI-420 gave values of 73%, 77.5%, 83.3%, and 90.9%, respectively.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

In  liver  microsomes  from  several  species,  erlotinib  had  a  faster  turnover  in  human  and  mouse compared to rat and dog. Five metabolites were identified by LC-MS/MS: OSI-413, OSI-420 (most abundant  in  mouse),  OSI-356  (most  abundant  in  human  and  rat),  OSI-493  and  OSI-943.  In  the standard  LC-MS/MS assays, the isomers OSI-420 and OSI-413 were not separated and reported as OSI-420/413.  O-demethylation  products  of  OSI-356  and  OSI-493  were  found  with  rat  liver microsomes after  induction  by  phenobarbital,  concomitant  with  a  higher  metabolic  turnover,  which indicated  metabolism  by  CYP3A  isoenzymes.  Furthermore,  metabolic  stability  of  erlotinib  in β -naphthaflavone-induced rat liver and lung microsomes correlated with the activity of CYP1A1 as a second, predominantly extrahepatic metabolic pathway. This result was consistent with the potential pulmonary  first  pass  effect  in  rats,  which  might  indicate  a  certain  role  of  lung  metabolism. Glucuronidation  was  investigated  using  liver  microsomes  from  different  species.  Very  low  but comparable rates of glucuronidation were obtained only with human and dog liver microsomes.

Following oral administration of 14 C-erlotinib to rats, the percentage of total radioactivity in plasma, representing  unchanged  drug,  was  88%  in  males  and  78%  in  females.  AUC  values  of  total radioactivity  and  unchanged drug were 1.8 and 1.6 fold higher in females than in males. However, Cmax was higher in males than in females. The gender differences were possibly due to differences in CYP3A2 expression and the involvement of CYP3A isoenzymes in the metabolism of erlotinib. In male and female dogs, unchanged drug amounted to 67% and 74%, respectively, of total radioactivity, indicating larger amounts of circulating metabolites in dogs than in rats. Similar to rats, mean AUC values of total radioactivity and unchanged drug were 2.3 and 2.5 fold higher in females than in males. In samples obtained 1-8 hours after oral administration, the same metabolites in almost same relative amounts were detected in male and female rats. OSI-420 was the main metabolite (14%), followed by OSI-493 and OSI-356. In dog plasma, almost similar percentages of OSI-420/413 (11-12%) and low amounts of OSI-356 were found. In mouse plasma, OSI-420/413 was the most abundant metabolite. In tumour samples from mice treated orally, the product of O-demethylation of OSI-356 was the most prominent metabolite.

In rats, dogs, and also in humans, the absorbed erlotinib was extensively metabolised. The metabolite pattern in human excreta was very similar to rats and dogs. Biliary excretion was predominant, and no gender-related  differences  were  seen.  In  rats,  only  4.5%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  into  bile  as unchanged  drug.  In  all  species,  urinary  excretion  was  minor  with  no  preference  for  a  specific

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolite. The radioactivity recovered in urine and faeces as percent of the dose was 89% in rats and 100%  in  dogs.  The  most  important  excreted  metabolites  in  rats  were  the  phase  I  products  OSI493&gt;OSI-420&gt;OSI-356,  comprising  together  63%  of  the  dose.  Only  low  levels  of  phase  II metabolites, 2.2% of sulphate of OSI-356 but almost no glucuronides, were detected in rat faeces. In rat  bile,  approximately 29% of excreted radioactivity was assigned to glucuronic acid conjugates of OSI-420&gt;erlotinib&gt;OSI-413&gt;OSI-356. Therefore, most conjugates are probably cleaved in the gut the lumen or during sample extraction and may encompass larger portions of excreted metabolites, which may be the case also in other species. In dogs, more than 60% of the oral dose was excreted in faeces as the acids of OSI-420 and OSI-413. Other prominent metabolites were abundant in the order OSI420&gt;OSI-493&gt;OSI-356.

## · Excretion

In rats and dogs, erlotinib and its metabolites were excreted predominantly via the faeces (&gt;90% of the dose) and only a small amount was recovered in urine (2-6%). Only a small amount of the absorbed dose was excreted as unchanged erlotinib. In rats, both by oral and I.V. administration, recovery was complete and amounted to 97% within 4 days post administration. Similarly, in dogs dosed orally, excretion was complete (100%) within 6 days post administration.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

The inhibition potential of erlotinib and of OSI-420 on the main human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes was studied in vitro . Erlotinib was a strong, reversible, and competitive inhibitor of the glucuronidation of bilirubin. Inhibition parameters were determined using liver microsomes from rat, cynomolgus monkey and human and were equivalent across species. In spite of the strong inhibition of glucuronidation by erlotinib, the potential risk of drug-drug interactions with other glucuronidated drugs  appears  to  be  small  because  of  the  high  apparent  Km  (24µM,  indicating  a  low  affinity/high capacity reaction).

The induction potential of erlotinib on the main cytochrome P450 isoenzymes was studied directly in human  hepatocytes.  No  evidence  was  obtained  that  erlotinib  has  a  potential  to  produce  drug-drug interactions by induction of major cytochrome P450 enzymes or transporter proteins.

No in vitro studies on drug-drug interactions were performed.

## · Other pharmacokinetic studies

A  higher  clearance  and  smaller  AUC  observed  in  rats  after  I.V.  versus  intraarterial  administration indicating  first-pass  pulmonary  extraction.  However,  the  difference  in  plasma  concentrations  was mainly  in  the  very  first  sampling  timepoint  (5  min)  and  the  AUC  of  the  primary  metabolite  OSI420/413 was similar for both routes.

PK  of  pregnant  female  rats  on  the  first  day  of  oral  administration  were  similar  to  studies  in  nonpregnant females. Increased erlotinib plasma clearance was observed in nursing rat dams. In rabbit, study, comparison between gestation day 7 and 19 showed increased Cmax and AUC, with the greatest increases in the highest dose group of 1.7 and 2.7 fold, respectively.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single dose GLP toxicity studies were conducted in the mouse, rat and dog.

Following single doses, drug-related mortality was seen in rats at 1000 and 2000 mg/kg orally and at 50  mg/kg  intravenously.  Mortality  was  seen  in  mice  at  2000  mg/kg  orally  and  at  75  mg/kg intravenously. Death occurred within one to nine days after oral administration or within seconds after intravenous dosing. Commonly observed clinical signs of toxicity following single-dose intravenous administration  included  decreased  activity,  irregular  respiration,  convulsions,  rapid  chewing,  and salivation. The effects of oral treatment were generally delayed (four to six days postdose), and the animals developed an unkempt, thin, hunched, and pale appearance that was accompanied by a loss of body weight or reduced body weight gain.

Single  large  oral  doses  (100  to  200  mg/kg)  and  single  intravenous  doses  (7  and  15  mg/kg) administered  to  the  dog  caused  numerous  abnormal  clinical  signs,  most  notably  decreased  activity, emesis,  ataxia,  and  pupillary  dilation.  These  effects  resolved  following  both  oral  and  intravenous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration.  In  addition,  oral  doses  increased  serum  bilirubin,  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  indices, activated partial thromboplastin, urinary bilirubin, urinary protein, and decreased lymphocyte counts. Most of these changes resolved within 14 days. There were no histologic alterations 14 days following administration,  indicating  that  a  single  relatively  high  oral  dose  of  erlotinib  does  not  produce  long lasting  adverse effects in the dog.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat  dose  GLP  and  non-GLP  oral  and  I.V.  studies  were  conducted  in  the  mouse,  rat,  dog  and monkey. Rat oral and I.V. studies ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months in duration. Plasma exposures to erlotinib in pre-clinical and clinical studies are summarised in table 1.

In repeat-dose studies, erlotinib was not tolerated at doses of 15 mg/kg/day in female rats or at doses of  50  mg/kg/day  in  dogs.  The  primary  dose-limiting  effects  in  both  species  were  inappetence  with significant  weight  loss,  generalized  gastrointestinal  toxicity  and,  in  the  dog,  corneal  atrophy  and ulceration.  All  of  these  effects  were  reversible  upon  cessation  of  treatment.  Additional  epithelial, toxicity  observed  in  at  least  one  species  included  effects  in  skin  (follicular  degeneration  and inflammation, redness, and alopecia), ovary (atrophy), liver (necrosis), kidney (papillary necrosis and tubular  dilatation),  and  gastrointestinal  tract  (delayed  gastric  emptying  and  diarrhea.).  Treatmentrelated  increases  in  ALT,  AST,  and  bilirubin  were  observed  in  the  6-month  rat  and  12-month  dog studies.

In addition, erlotinib caused a reduction in red blood cell parameters with a compensatory increase in reticulocytes and an increase in white blood cells, primarily neutrophils. The no-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 1 mg/kg/day in the 6-month rat study and 7.5 mg/kg/day in the 12-month dog study.

In the 6 month study in rat, at 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, the following was seen: females had an increased incidence of ovarian atrophy and minimal to mild papillary necrosis with tubular dilatation of distal convoluted  tubules  and  collecting  ducts.  Both  sexes  had  dose-related  changes  in  skin  and  fur, correlating histologically with hair follicular degeneration/inflammation, and dose-related increase in plasma  bilirubin  and  in  positive  response  for  haemoglobin  in  urine.  Other  findings  at  5  and  10 mg/kg/day  were  dose-dependent  ALT  increases  (indicative  of  slight  liver  toxicity),  and  increased WBC,  particularly  monocytes  and  neutrophils  (indicative  of  an  inflammatory  response).  At  10 mg/kg/day, body weight of males was decreased, and in females, there was increased incidence and severity of focal to multifocal liver necrosis, pituitary enlargement, and angiectasis and slight increase in adrenal gland weight. NOAEL was set at 1 mg/kg/day. Plasma concentrations increased with dose though not linearly. Females had higher systemic drug exposure at all doses than males. In conclusion, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day produced follicular degeneration, inflammation in the skin, slight liver toxicity, ovarian  atrophy,  and  renal  papillary  necrosis.  At  10  mg/kg/day,  there  was  decreased  mean  body weight,  (males),  increased  occurrence  of  liver  necrosis  and  a  marked  increase  in  plasma  bilirubin (females).  Ovarian  atrophy  with  thickened  vaginal  and  endometrial  epithelium  is  suggestive  of  a disruption in hormonal control of oestrous cycling. Pituitary enlargement in high dose females is also suggestive of a central drug effect on oestrus cycling. Angiectasis in the female adrenal glands may also  be  a  consequence  of  the  hormonal  imbalance  associated  with  ovarian  atrophy.  Similar  toxic effects were observed in I.V. studies in the rat. Reversibility has not been investigated.

Repeat  dose  oral  studies  in  dogs  ranged  from  several  days  up  to  12  months.  Primarily  because  of emesis observed in the exploratory studies at daily doses of 100 mg/kg/day, doses in the definitive 1and 12 month studies were determined to be 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day.

In  the  28-day  oral  gavage  study  at  5,  15  and  50  mg/kg/day,  emesis,  loose  stool,  and  pre-dose  skin reddening  were  occasionally  observed  in  all  groups.  Salivation  was  noted  at  all  dose  levels.  RBC, haemoglobin,  and  haematocrit  values  were  significantly  decreased  in  the  50  mg/kg/day  females. Microscopic evidence of increased numbers of regenerating proximal tubules in the kidney was noted at 50 mg/kg/day. There was no apparent gender difference in plasma concentrations of erlotinib and OSI-420. The NOAEL was set at 15 mg/kg/day.

In the 12-month oral study, doses of 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day were given by gastric intubation. Because of  unexpected  adverse  effects,  treatment  of  the  high-dose  group  was  modified  on  day  12  (30 mg/kg/day) and discontinued on day 13. Half of these dogs were euthanised on the following day. The remaining  animals  underwent  a  recovery  period  and  were  euthanised  on  day  96.  From  day  50 onwards, the dose of 5 mg/kg was increased to 7.5 mg/kg and a new group was initiated at 2.5 mg/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  additional  group  received  the  compound  for  12  months  and  was  euthanised  approximately  7 months  later  than  the  initial  groups.  50  mg/kg  induced  severe  clinical  signs  and  body  weight  loss, associated  with  marked  histopathological  changes  to  the  eyes  (corneal  atrophy  and  ulcers),  kidneys (papillary necrosis), and digestive tract (inflammation in oesophagus, glandular dilation in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and rectum). There were clinical pathology changes related to inflammation (increase  in  fibrinogen  and  neutrophils,  decrease  in  albumin).  Increased  alkaline  phosphatase  and bilirubin was also seen at this dose but without any associated histopathological findings. There were moderate to marked changes in RBC parameters, decreases in electrolytes and increases in lipids and urea as well as a minimal degeneration of skeletal muscles, attributed to the poor health status of the animals.  The  ocular  changes,  body  weight  losses,  haematology,  and  plasma  chemistry  changes appeared to be reversible in animals that went through the recovery period. At 15 mg/kg/day and to a lesser extent, at 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg/day treatment produced reddening of the skin and buccal mucous membrane as  well  as  hair  loss.  At  15  mg/kg,  there  was  also  a  reduced  mean  body  weight  gain  in males.

A non-GLP oral gavage study for up to 14 days in cynomolgus monkeys at 25, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day  was  performed.  In  the  200  mg/kg/day  group,  dosing  was  discontinued  for  one  animal following  nine  doses,  due  to  adverse  clinical  signs  of  decreased  activity,  lethargy,  sternal/lateral recumbency, dehydration, and reduced food intake. At 200 mg/kg/day for one week, face and/or neck skin  or  mucosal  lesions  were  observed.  At  400  mg/kg/day,  a  tendency  toward  decreased  food consumption, decreased activity, dehydration, hunched posture, pale skin and lateral recumbency was seen.  Slightly  decreased  RBC  parameters  and  increased  reticulocyte  counts  were  observed  at  25 mg/kg/day. Increased total bilirubin was noted at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day. At 400 mg/kg/day, slight decreases in lymphocyte counts were noted. Although cutaneous and mucosal changes were observed in the monkeys, histological findings were consistent with minor local trauma and inflammation and were not suggestive of a mechanism-related toxicity or idiosyncratic or allergic reactions. The findings apparently do not correspond to and model skin changes noted in clinical trials with erlotinib.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

In in vitro tests, with and without metabolic activation, erlotinib, the impurity RO0729853-001, or any of the metabolites, were  not  mutagenic  in  the  microbial  reversion  assay,  did  not  produce chromosomal  damage  in  human  lymphocytes,  and  did  not  produce  a  biologically  significant  dosedependent  mutagenic  response  in  the  CHO/HGPRT  assay. In vivo , erlotinib did not  induce chromosomal damage as evidenced by micronucleus formation in the bone marrow cells of male or female CD-1 mice following three daily oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day.

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

Carcinogenicity studies were not performed.

- Reproductive and developmental studies

A series of tests was conducted to evaluate the effects of erlotinib on male and female fertility in the rat, embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in the rat and rabbit, and pre- and postnatal development of the rat (data not shown). Erlotinib at doses that produced maternal toxicity and decreased pup survival in the rat was not teratogenic, and did not affect the development of F1 or F2 generations. Erlotinib at doses that produced maternal toxicity and embryotoxicity in the rabbit was not identified as a selective developmental  toxicant.  In  rats,  maternal  toxicity  was  seen  at  doses  of ≥ 5 mg/kg/day  and  foetal toxicity  was  seen  at  doses  of ≥ 10  mg/kg/day.  In  rabbits,  maternal  and  foetal  toxicity  was  both observed at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day.

## · Local tolerance

Following dermal exposure for 24 hours, very slight erythema was produced in one of six rabbits at 2000  mg/kg.  Testing  of  54.3  mg  erlotinib  in  a  volume  of  0.1  ml  introduced  into  the  rabbit  eye indicated that erlotinib is not an ocular irritant in rabbits. Based on a guinea pig skin sensitisation test, the sensitisation potential of erlotinib was categorised as mild according to the Kligman/Magnusson classification scheme.

## · Other toxicity studies

Phototoxicity studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Erlotinib is an UV-absorbing compound that is present in eye and skin following systemic exposure. Erlotinib  was  given  to  hairless  rats  P.O.  for  7  days  at  5  mg/kg/day,  and  produced  a  weak  although discernible phototoxic skin reaction in vivo in the hairless rat. Erlotinib was not phototoxic in vitro in 3T3 fibroblasts at concentrations that were limited by solubility.

## Effects on bilirubin excretion

In anaesthetised male rats, erlotinib was administered via a jugular catheter as a slow bolus of 1, 5 or 15 mg/kg. Erlotinib at 5 and 15 mg/kg consistently reduced both total and direct bile bilirubin at all measured timepoints with no change in bile flow rate. At 1 mg/kg there was only a transient decrease at 30 minutes post-dose. Serum bilirubin was increased at 5 mg/kg (approximately 3-fold) and at 15 mg/kg  (approximately  5-fold).    Plasma  concentration  of  parent  compound  and  of  the  primary metabolite reached a maximum 30 minutes post-dose, declining steadily from this point. No effect on liver  weight  was  observed.  A  NOEL  was  not  established.  In in  vitro studies,  erlotinib  inhibited microsomal glucuronidation of bilirubin and suggested that this inhibition was similar across species (see page 15, Pharmacokinetic drug interactions).

## Immunotoxicity

Special immunotoxicity and antigenicity studies have not been conducted on erlotinib.

## Studies on impurities

To  ensure  qualification  of  the  specified  impurity  CP-471-125,  bacterial  reverse  mutation  and chromosomal aberration tests with human peripheral blood lymphocytes were conducted. Both tests were negative under GLP test conditions.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Considering  ecotoxicological  and  environmental  fate  properties  as  well  as  use  pattern,  dosage  and maximal estimated amounts of erlotinib to be placed on the market, no exposure levels of concern to the environment are to be expected.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

The  primary in  vitro pharmacodynamics studies  showed  that  erlotinib  is  a  potent,  selective,  directacting  inhibitor  of  the  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  catalytic  domain.  The  primary in  vivo metabolites  of erlotinib  also  have  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitory  activity.  The  antitumor  effects  of  erlotinib  in several xenograft models correlated well with inhibition of tumor-associated EGFR phosphotyrosine.

According  to  the  applicant  the  data  on  drug  exposure  and  antitumor  response  in  human  tumor xenograft models suggested evaluation of clinical dosing schedules designed to produce total plasma erlotinib  concentrations  of ≥ 420  ng/ml.  An  erlotinib  value  of  11000  ng/ml  would  correspond  to plasma concentrations producing 80% inhibition of tumour growth in the xenograft models.

Most in  vitro and in  vivo general  and  safety  pharmacology  studies  did  not  indicate  that  erlotinib produced non-target pharmacological effects that would cause specific safety concerns for clinical use. Binding of a few among a large panel of receptors, only occurred at concentrations at least 125-fold higher than the IC50  concentration required to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase in intact cells. Erlotinib dose-dependently inhibited gastric emptying in rats, which can be seen as a class effect.

A number of mutations have been identified in the EGFR gene. Tumour response and acquired drug resistance towards EGFR TK inhibiting agents has been associated with specific mutations within the EGFR gene [18,  23-31].  The  functional  consequences  of  these  mutations  on  receptor  function  and their  importance  for  tumour  growth  are  not  yet  understood  in  detail.  The  applicant  is  planning  to address the issue from a clinical perspective and no further mechanistic in vitro and in vivo studies are planned.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic behaviour of erlotinib has been adequately investigated. In summary, erlotinib was widely distributed into tissues including tumour tissue. Concentrations were smaller in the brain than  in  plasma.  Erlotinib  was  extensively  metabolised  and  rapidly  eliminated  mainly  via  biliary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

secretion  into  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  excreted  predominantly  via  the  faeces  together  with  its metabolites. The contribution of lung to the overall metabolism of erlotinib appears to be low.

CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 might contribute to erlotinib clearance especially after induction by smoking  [32]  (see also Clinical Pharmacokinetics, and Discussion on Clinical Pharmacokinetics).

## Toxicology

Erlotinib toxicity predominantly in epidermal tissues. The major target organs were kidney, liver, skin, GI tract, ovaries and cornea. Treatment-related increases in ALT, AST, and bilirubin were observed in the repeat-dose studies studies at exposure levels well below exposure levels in man. The increase in bilirubin  apparently  was  caused  by  erlotinib  impairment  of  bilirubin  conjugation  and  excretion associated with specific inhibition of UDPglucuronosyltranferase.

When applying higher dose levels (50 mg/kg/day) in the dog repeat dose study, unacceptable toxicity was noted. Exposures obtained in repeat dose toxicity studies compared to the human exposures were not sufficiently high to calculate exposure multiples, and thus, safety margins are non-existent.

Erlotinib  was  not  genotoxic.  The  lack  of  carcinogenicity  studies  has  been  adequately  justified  with reference to relevant guidance [33, 34].

Reproductive toxicity has been observed with erlotinib, and this is adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 5.3). The EGF receptor plays an important role in embryonic development. Blockade of this receptor is a potential risk on abnormal embryonal and foetal development. As such, erlonitib, has the  potential  to  be  a  teratogen.  Embryonal  and  foetal  toxicity  were  observed  in  rats  and  rabbits. Embryonal  and  foetal  toxicity  is  expected  in  humans  at  therapeutic  exposure.  Erlonitib  should therefore not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. It is not known whether erlotinib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, mothers should be advised against breastfeeding  while  receiving  Tarceva.  Adequate  information  has  been  included  in  the  SPC  (see section 4.6), and package leaflet.

A mild  phototoxic  reaction  has  been  observed  in  rats.  Severe  phototoxicity  in  humans  is  unlikely. Adequate  information  has  been  included  in  the  SPC  (see  section  5.3).  Photogenotoxicity  and photoallergy studies are not required, since erlonitib hydrochloride shows photostability (see Quality Aspects).

Inhibition of EGFR  signalling  augments  the  inflammatory  response  by  increased  chemokine expression and heavier inflammatory cell infiltrate involving T lymphocytes (Mascia et al., 2003). No effect on lymphoid or myeloid organs was seen in toxicity studies after up to 12 months of erlotinib exposure.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  standard  toxicity  studies,  additional  immunotoxicity  and antigenicity studies are not required [35].

## 4 Clinical aspects

The  clinical  documentation  for  the  submission  comprised  17  phase  I  trials  (PK,  metabolism  and interactions), of which 9 were performed in healthy volunteers and 8 in patients with solid tumours. Thirteen phase I-IIa studies were performed in patients with solid tumours (dose-ranging, safety and PK). The marketing authorisation application was based on one randomized placebo-controlled phase III study (BR.21, N=731) conducted in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC after failure of at least 1 standard  chemotherapy  regimen.  Reference  was  also  made  to  two  randomised  studies    evaluated erlotinib used in combination with standard chemotherapy in first-line therapy for NSCLC. All studies in the erlotinib clinical development program were performed in concordance with ICH GCP.

The recommended daily dose of Tarceva is 150 mg taken at least one hour before or two hours after the  ingestion  of  food  (see  SPC  section  4.2).  When  dose  adjustment  is  necessary,  reduction  should occur in 50 mg steps (see SPC section 4.2 and 4.4). Tarceva is available in strengths of 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg. In summary, concomitant use of CYP3A4 substrates and modulators may require dose adjustment  (see  discussion  on  clinical  pharmacokinetics,  and  SPC  section 4.2  and  4.5).  Tarceva  is contraindicated in case of severe hypersensitivity to erlotinib or to any of the excipients.

## Clinical Pharmacology

##  Pharmacokinetics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pharmacokinetics  of  erlotinib  has  been  studied  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  cancer  patients. Analyses of erlotinib and the metabolite OSI-420 were carried out primarily by LC-MS/MS methods. Single dose and multiple dose plasma PK parameters in healthy volunteers are summarised in tables 2 and 3.

The studies in healthy subjects were performed in males and females, but females formed a minority. The mean ages in the healthy-volunteer studies were generally between 26 and 38 years. The majority of the recruited subjects were Caucasians. Black, Hispanic and Asian individuals however were also studied.  Several  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  in  patients  with  various  solid  tumours, mostly NSCLC. The mean age in the patient studies was higher than in the populations of healthy volunteers and roughly varied between 55 and 65 years. The patients studied included women as well as men. One specific study was performed in Japanese patients (Study JO16564).

## · Absorption

Two bioavailabilty studies were conducted with  erlotinib 100 PO QD × 8 and 150 mg PO single dose, respectively, in fed and fasted in healthy subjects (N=21 each). Two  bioavailability and bioequivalence  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  absolute  BA  and  establish  BE  of  multiple  tablet strengths.

After  oral administration, erlotinib peak plasma levels are obtained in approximately 4 hours after oral dosing. In the absolute bioavailability cross-over study of a single 150 mg oral dose compared to an IV  30-minutes  infusion  of  25  mg,  different  terminal  half-lives  of  21  and  13  hours  were  observed, respectively,  in  normal  healthy  volunteers.  A  mean  estimate  of  oral  bioavailability  for  the  150  mg tablet of 59% (95% CI: 55% - 63%) was obtained using NONMEM, taking into account the faster clearance of erlotinib observed at the lower IV dose.



A high calorie,  high  fat  meal  increased  the  oral  bioavailability  of  erlotinib  both  after  a  single  dose (study  NP16584) and after multiple doses (study NP16787). In study NP16584 subjects received 2 single  150  mg  erlotinib  doses,  one  in  the  fasted  state  and  the  other  after  a  high  fat,  high  calorie breakfast in a randomized sequence with a 7-day washout period. Tmax was similar when erlotinib was  administered  with  food.  Tlag  was  increased  by  approximately  0.5  hour.  There  was  a  109% increase  in  erlotinib  AUC0-∞ and  a  64%  increase  in  Cmax  in  the  fed  state  as  compared  to  fasted conditions. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the metabolite OSI-420 in Period 1 indicated a 98% increase in AUC and a 32% increase in Cmax when study drug was administered in the fed state (compared to fasted conditions). Tmax was increased by approximately 1 hour. Patients had higher Cmax and AUC0-24 than subjects.

At doses ranging from 100 mg to 1000 mg, AUC increases linearly with no observable saturation in its elimination. Linearity may change from very low doses (&lt; 50 mg) to higher dose ranges (100 to 1000 mg), although data at low doses are limited. Mean (± SD) terminal half-life at 25 mg IV and 150 mg oral doses were 13 (± 6) and 21 (± 10) hours, respectively. The exact mechanism or specific pathway that may be saturated at the low dose range is not known.

There was a high inter-subject and inter-study variability in clearance and plasma terminal half-life of erlotinib  estimated  across  several  healthy  volunteer  studies.  Median  clearance  ranged  from  5.27  to 15.0 L/h and half-life ranged from 7.0 to 16.3 hours among 6 studies in a total of 110 subjects at doses ranging  from  100  to  200  mg.  From  various  healthy  volunteer  studies,  within-subject  CV  for  AUC varied from 16% to 24% while for Cmax, it ranged from 29% to 38%, as estimated in three different studies. The CV for the primary metabolite (OSI-420) was comparable with those of parent erlotinib. In  general,  cancer  patients  appeared  to  have  higher  AUC  and  longer  plasma  terminal  half-life  than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

healthy subjects after a single dose. Exposure also appeared higher in the target population following repeated administration.

## · Distribution

Erlotinib was administered to healthy volunteers (4 males, 16 females) as a 25 mg short IV infusion, the steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was estimated to be moderately high (mean ± SD: 83.84 L ± 17.56; n = 18).

In  vitro  studies  showed  that  erlotinib  is  highly  bound  in  blood  with  96.5%  bound  to  blood components. Binding of erlotinib was divided in 2 components: 34.2% to the blood cells and 62.37% to the plasma proteins when the hematocrit was 0.48. The free fraction (fu) was 3.5%. Erlotinib was bound primarily by albumin and non-esterified fatty acids, which comprise 43.9% of the total blood binding or 70.4% of the plasma protein binding. Erlotinib binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) was found to increase at higher AAG concentrations with values of 52.3% at 0.38 mg/mL and 96.3% at 5 mg/mL.

Tumour-to-plasma erlotinib ratio was measured in a study of 4 patients (3 with NSCLC, and 1 with laryngeal  cancer)  receiving  150 mg  daily  oral  doses  of  Tarceva.  Tumour  samples  from  surgical excisions on Day 9 of treatment revealed tumour concentrations of erlotinib that averaged 1,185 ng/g of  tissue.  This  corresponded  to  an  overall  average  of  63 %  (range  5-161  %)    of  the  steady  state observed  peak  plasma  concentrations.  The  primary  active  metabolites  were  present  in  tumour  at concentrations averaging 160 ng/g tissue, which corresponded to an overall average of 113 % (range 88-130%)  of the observed steady state peak plasma concentrations. The active metabolite OSI-420 was present in the tumour at concentrations similar to the observed steady-state Cmax in plasma (88% to 130%).

## · Elimination

Erlotinib  is  excreted  predominantly  as  metabolites  via  the  faeces  (&gt;90%)  with  renal  elimination accounting for only a small amount (approximately 9%) of an oral dose. Following administration of a single dose  of [14C]-erlotinib as a  100  mg  suspension  to  4  healthy  male  subjects,  plasma concentrations of erlotinib, OSI-420, and total radioactivity peaked at 1.4 hours after oral administration. The total radioactivity values were only slightly higher than the parent drug (erlotinib), suggesting that circulating radioactivity was primarily attributable to unchanged drug. In contrast, less than 2% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces.

Based  on  the  structures  of  the  metabolites,  3  primary  routes  of  metabolism  were  identified:  Odemethylation  of  the  side  chains  followed  by  oxidation  to  the  carboxylic  acid,  oxidation  of  the acetylene moiety followed by hydrolysis to the aryl carboxylic acid, and aromatic hydroxylation of the phenyl-acetylene  moiety.  Conjugates  of  OSI-356  with  sulfuric  or  glucuronic  acid  as  well  as  Oglucuronides of OSI-413/420 and its further de-alkylated products were found in small amounts.

The elimination of erlotinib was primarily metabolic with little or no direct elimination via kidney or biliary excretion.. The identified metabolites accounted for &gt; 80% of the total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces.

Four major metabolites were found in plasma. The bioanalytical LC-MS/MS assay cannot distinguish between the isomers OSI-413 and OSI-420. These two metabolites possess similar EGFR inhibitory pharmacological  activity  compared  to  the  parent  compound.  In  human  plasma,  these  metabolites accounted for approximately 5% of the amount identified as erlotinib with a variable effective mean ratio of OSI-420: OSI-413 between 2:1 and 4:1. The primary metabolite does not possess potential for P450-based drug-drug interactions as based on in vitro studies.

In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and specific CYP inhibitors, as well as recombinantly expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed that erlotinib is metabolised in humans in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2. Extrahepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 in  intestine,  CYP1A1  in  lung,  and  CYP1B1  in  tumour  tissue  also  potentially  contribute  to  the metabolic  clearance  of  erlotinib.  Potential  interactions  with  implications  on  erlotinib  exposure  may occur  with  drugs  which  are  metabolised  by,  or  are  inhibitors  or  inducers  of,  these  enzymes.  CYPs 1A1, 3A4, and 3A5 catalyzed the formation of OSI-413, OSI-420, OSI-356, and OSI-493, with OSI356  being  the  most  prominent  form  produced  by  CYP3A4  and  CYP1A1,  but  a  more  pronounced formation  of  OSI-420  by  CYP3A5  and  of  de-methylated  OSI-356  by  CYP1A2.  Inhibition  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

microsomal metabolism by 10 µM ketoconazole revealed 80% to 95% inhibition of the formation of the different metabolites.

## · Special populations

Population  PK  analyses  were  performed  first  using  data  from  2  Phase  III  trials  of  erlotinib  in combination  with  platinum  doublet  (Studies  BO16411  and  OSI2298g  )  and  later  using  data  from single  Phase  III  trial  with  erlotinib  given  as  monotherapy  (Study BR.21)  in  NSCLC  patients.  Data from several Phase II trials were also combined in both analyses.

For the combination data set, A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination well described the concentration-time data of the parent drug. The ratio of the AUCs of metabolite/parent calculated from the model was 12.1%. A total of 18 covariates were evaluated for erlotinib CL and Vc. Total  bilirubin  (TBIL)  and  AAG  were  the  covariates  most  critical  to  explaining  inter-individual variability  for  CL.    Compared  with  the  population  median,  patients  with  TBIL  levels  in  the  95th percentile (1.1 mg/mL) had a change in CL of -27.7% (CV% of approximately 50%). Compared with the population median, patients with AAG levels in the 95th percentile (2.3 g/L) had a change in CL of  -15.9%.    Other  covariates  such  as  gender,  alkaline  phosphatase,  creatinine  clearance,  and chemotherapy status had minimal effects on CL. Using erlotinib monotherapy as a reference, CL was 10.5% and 18.1% faster in patients treated with erlotinib in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel and  cisplatin/gemcitabine,  respectively.    The  estimated  CVs  were  large  (&gt; 44%).    Inter-individual variability for CL and Vc in the final model was 40.5% and 64.3%, respectively, compared with 50.9% and 80.6% in the base model.  The covariate effects in the final model explained about 37% of the inter-individual variance for CL and 36% of the inter-individual variance for Vc.

The single-agent dataset for the analysis included 2576 concentration measurements from 591 patients,  of  which  252  patients  were  from  4  Phase  II  single-agent  trials  (Studies  A248-101, A248-1003, A248-1007, and OSI2288g) and 339 patients were from the single-agent Phase III trial (Study BR.21). The structural model and the final model previously developed were applied to the single-agent dataset.  In addition, the effect of enzyme inducers/inhibitors and the effect of smoking, which were not included in the previous model, were also assessed.

Current  smokers  had  faster  clearance  than  patients  who  had  never  smoked  or  former  smokers; therefore, the smoking effect was included in the final model for the single-agent data.  In contrast, coadministration  of  enzyme  inducers,  which  was  found  to  be  significantly  associated  with  clearance (CL/F), was not incorporated in the single-agent final model because &lt; 1.5% (n = 9) of the cases were well documented.  In addition, alkaline phosphatase, which had a small effect in the previous model, was not tested with the single-agent data because alkaline phosphatase measurements were missing for 305 of 339 patients.

Overall,  in  the  single-agent  final  model,  the  effects  of  covariates  such  as  gender,  albumin,  and creatinine clearance were similar to those estimated in the first population PK analysis; all had a small effect on CL.  Total bilirubin and AAG remained to be the most significant covariates.  The effect of AAG was slightly greater than that previously reported, with an increase in AAG associated with a decrease in erlotinib clearance.

According to the single-agent final model, the PK parameters for the typical patient were 3.95 L/hr for CL/F, 233 L for volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F), and 40.9 hours for terminal half-life (t1/2).  The coefficient of variation (%CV) for inter-individual variance for CL/F and Vc/F was 39.4% and 71.7%, respectively.  The individual PK parameters for all patients were estimated from the single-agent  final  model  using  a  Bayesian  approach.    No  marked  differences  in  the  PK  parameters were found across  the  different  studies.    Values  for  CL/F  and  Vc/F  for  Study  BR.21  patients  were within the ranges for the other studies.  Mean values indicated a slightly lower CL in patients in the BR.21  study  compared  with  patients  from  other  studies,  whereas  Vc/F  was  similar.    Based  on  the individual  PK  parameters  from  591  patients,  the  predicted  mean  for  steady-state  area  under  the concentration-time  curve  (AUCSS),  maximum  concentration  (Cmax,SS),  and  minimum  concentration (Cmin,SS )  were  41.3 ± 22.0 µ g · hr/mL, 1995 ± 906  ng/mL, and 1238 ± 826 ng/mL, respectively. Median t1/2 for single-agent patients was 36.2 hours, which is consistent with the population estimate of  40.9 hours  from  this  analysis.The  pharmacokinetics  of  erlotinib  has  not  been  studied  in  patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Concerning  gender,  only  one  study  allowed  for  a  meaningful  comparison  of  pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects. A statistically significant difference was observed for AUC and elimination half-life. From the population model, the difference between male and female clearance is 4.70  L/h  versus  4.29  L/h.  Females  consistently  achieved  a  higher  exposure  but  the  estimated differences were small (3.7% increase of AUCss and a 5% increase of C24ss).

The single dose pharmacokinetics for erlotinib were compared using data from 2 comparable Phase I trials;  one  in  Japanese  NSCLC  patients  and  the  other  in  western  cancer  patients,  in  which  50/56 patients  were  Caucasian,  3  were  Hispanic,  1  was  Black,  and  1  was  Asian  There  was  no  apparent difference in PK characteristics of erlotinib between Japanese and western patients.

The effect of age on erlotinib pharmacokinetics was evaluated in the pivotal phase III Study BR.21, comparing subgroups aged &lt; 65 years with those ≥ 65 years. The median plasma concentration of the principal erlotinib metabolite, OSI-420, was increased by 58.6% and the sum of erlotinib plus OSI-420 was increased by 17% in the patients who were ≥ 65 years old, compared to younger patients.

The pharmacokinetics of erlotinib has not been studied in children.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

A moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 (~ Ki 8 µM) and CYP2C8 (~ Ki 15 µM) by erlotinib, and a weak inhibition of CYP1A2 (~ Ki 20 µM) and CYP3A4 (~ Ki 24 µM) by OSI-420 were observed. There was no significant inhibition of the activities catalyzed by CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 or by CYP1B1, suggesting that no drug-drug interactions with xenobiotics metabolized primarily by these CYP450 enzymes is expected. Hence, no clear evidence was obtained to suggest that erlotinib has the potential  to  produce  drug-drug  interactions  by  induction  of  major  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  or transporter  proteins.  An  interaction  study  between  erlotinib  and  midazolam  in  order  to  differentiate between effects on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 is in progress. In in vitro studies with human liver microsomes  erlotinib  was  found  to  be  a  strong  and,  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  glucuronidation  of bilirubin with an app. Ki 1.3 µM. Inhibition was similarly apparent with human recombinant expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferase  UGT1A1  (app.  Ki  0.7  µM,  substrate  bilirubin)  but  not  with  other transferases.



Interaction studies in healthy volunteers were performed with a potent CYP3A4  inhibitor, ketoconazole,  and  a  potent  CYP3A4  inductor,  rifampicin.  Rifampicin  pretreatment  caused  a  mean decrease in erlotinib Cmax by 29 % and of AUC by about 69% compared with erlotinib alone. Mean oral clearance (Cl/F) of erlotinib was approximately 3-fold higher following rifampicin administration. The  corresponding  mean  terminal  half-life  was  reduced  to  a  small  extent  (29%)  from  8.6  hours (erlotinib alone) to 6.1 hours (rifampicin pretreatment). Ketoconazole had a clear effect on the AUC and Cmax of erlotinib. Exposure to erlotinib in terms of AUC in the presence of ketoconazole was estimated to be increased by 64 % compared with that following administration of 100 mg erlotinib alone. With regard to the Cmax of erlotinib administered concomi-tantly with ketoconazole, exposure was  estimated  to  be  increased  by  67  %  compared  with  Cmax  of  erlotinib  administered  alone.  In contrast, there was little change in erlotinib pharmacokinetics on repeat treatment in the control group that did not receive ketoconazole.

No evidence for PK interactions between erlotinib and the different chemotherapies studied: cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or capecitabine were found (data not shown).

## Pharmacodynamics

No clinical studies investigating the mechanism of action have been conducted. No clinical primary pharmacology of erlotinib studies have been conducted.

## Dose selection

The available preclinical data at the time of dose selection had consistently suggested a dose/response relationship regarding the inhibition of the target according to some published series [18, 36] and data presented by the applicant. Doses below MTD (50 mg/kg/p.o. in Captisol, Balb/c nude mice) were less active  than  the  actual  MTD.  The  recommended  dose  of  erlotinib  in  phase  III  trials  was,  therefore, selected on the basis of the MTD, as determined in the Phase I study, A248-004. After daily dosing, the MTD was observed at the 150 mg dose level. The average trough (Cmin) concentration at this MTD dose  of  150  mg  on  Days  24  to  29  in  this  study  was  918  ng/mL  (median:  746  ng/mL;  n=19).  This concentration was higher than that (680 ng/mL) observed in HN5 murine model at the dose of 50%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inhibition  of  tumor  growth  and  was  considered  adequate  to  enter  into  Phase  III  trials.  Assuming  a protein binding of 95%, the corresponding unbound concentration (Cf) of drug is estimated to be 34 ng/mL (86 nM).  This concentration is 4 times higher than IC50 for cellular phosphotyrosine reduction assays (7.9 ng/mL) and 43 times higher than the IC50 for the kinase assay (0.79 ng/mL).  The average steady  state  trough  (Cmin)  concentration  observed  at  150 mg  in  study  A248-004  was  918  ng/mL based on total plasma concentrations and 46 ng/mL based on free plasma concentrations, assuming 95% protein binding.

## Secondary pharmacology

Based  on  the  positive  hERG  results  (IC20:  3 µ M)  and  current  regulatory  guidelines,  a  further investigation of the potential effect of erlotinib on ECG (in particular, QTc) in humans was planned. This study in healthy volunteers was terminated prematurely due to tolerability issues. No effect on the QT-interval could be demonstrated. Subsequently, ECG data collected from 7 healthy volunteer studies with a total of 152 subjects was subject to detailed analysis. All ECG data were reanalysed centrally at an outside laboratory specialising in the high-resolution manual analysis of ECG data and morphological  interpretation.  Although  several  of  these  studies  did  not  have  a  placebo  arm,  QTcinterval  changes  from  baseline  and  maximum  QTc-interval  changes  were  evaluated  with  respect  to time  after  dose,  peak  plasma  drug  (and  active  metabolite,  OSI-420)  concentrations  and  AUC  to determine the potential relationship of any changes in QTc-intervals with systemic drug exposure.

An integrated meta-analysis was performed of limited data with placebo and the 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg erlotinib doses using Day 1 data from 7 studies. Serial measurements of QTc-intervals over 24 hours after dosing were available in a minimum of 12 subjects at each dose. No effect of erlotinib was seen  on  mean  QTc  (F  or  B)-intervals  at  any  of  these  doses.  An  analogous  meta-analysis  was performed  for  day  7  multiple  dose  (steady  state)  data  from  2  studies  where  subjects  received therapeutic doses of 100 or 150 mg erlotinib per day. There was no increase in QTc (F or B)-intervals relative to baseline (pre-treatment on Day 1) despite having 7 consecutive days of dosing.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

## Discussion on clinical PK

Food increases the exposure after an oral dose of erlotinib both in terms of AUC and Cmax. The exact mechanism  for  this  effect  of  food  on  erlotinib  bioavailability  is  not  known.  The  effect  may  be  of clinical importance, and an appropriate warning has been included in the SPC (see SPC section 5.2)

Having a pKa of 5.4, erlotinib has a greater solubility in acidic media when the pH is less than 5 due to protonation of the secondary amine. The effect of antacids, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists on the absorption of erlotinib have not been investigated. The applicant committed to confirm these results through an in-vivo study to evaluate the effects of antacids, H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. Caution should be exercised when these drugs are combined with erlotinib (see SPC section 4.4).

Erlotinib has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 232 L and distributes into tumour tissue of humans.  Erlotinib  and  its  primary  metabolite  have  been  located  in  solid  tumours  in  concentrations approximating that of plasma, though with a large variability. Plasma protein binding is approximately 95 %. Erlotinib binds to serum albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG).

Erlotinib is metabolised in the liver by the hepatic cytochromes in humans, primarily CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2. Extrahepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 in intestine, CYP1A1 in lung, and 1B1 in tumour tissue potentially contribute to the metabolic clearance of erlotinib. Less than 2 % is excreted unchanged in the urine. Minor contributions from CYP3A5 are also possible.

Results of an in vitro study using L-MDR1 (human) and L-mdr1a (mouse) cells show that erlotinib is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein drug transporter (data not shown). Theoretically, rug penetration in the  brain  may  be  increased  when  combined  with  inhibitors  of  P-glycoprotein,  e.g.  cyclosporine, verapamil. However, no major CNS toxicity of erlotinib was observed in large patient trials conducted in  NSCLC patients in the presence of various co-medications. Similarly, good tolerability has been reported in various communications on glioblastoma patients with response to erlotinib [37, 38].

A population pharmacokinetic analysis in 591 patients receiving single agent Tarceva show a mean apparent clearance of 4.47 L/hour with a median half-life of 36.2 hours. Therefore, the time to reach steady state plasma concentration would be expected to occur in approximately 7-8 days. No clinically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant relationship between predicted apparent clearance and patient age, bodyweight, gender and ethnicity were observed. Patient factors, which correlated with erlotinib pharmacokinetics, were serum total bilirubin, AAG and current smoking. Increased serum concentrations of total bilirubin and AAG concentrations  were  associated  with  a  slower  rate  of  erlotinib  clearance;  however,  smokers  had  a higher  rate  of  erlotinib  clearance.  The  clinical  relevance  of  these  differences  is  unclear.  However, smokers had a higher rate of erlotinib clearance. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic study, current smokers should be advised to stop smoking while taking Tarceva, as plasma concentrations could be reduced otherwise. The observed variability of erlotinib exposure and the  trend  of  greater  AUC  values  in  female  subjects  might  be  due  to  gender  differences  in  the percentage of non-smoking individuals with apparent intermediate to high CYP1A2 metabolic activity [39].

The safety and efficacy of erlotinib has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Erlotinib is  eliminated  by  hepatic  metabolism  and  biliary  excretion.  No  data  are  available  in  patients  with hepatic  impairment.  Therefore  caution  should  be  exercised  when  administering  Tarceva  to  patients with hepatic impairment.  Use  of  Tarceva  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  not recommended (see SPC section 5.2). The applicant has committed to conduct a study in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function.

Erlotinib and its metabolites are not significantly excreted by the kidney, as less than 9 % of a single dose  is  excreted  in  the  urine.  In  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  no  clinically  significant relationship  was  observed  between  erlotinib  clearance  and  creatinine  clearance.  The  safety  and efficacy  of  erlotinib  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (serum  creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 times the upper normal limit). Based on pharmacokinetic data no dose adjustments appear necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no available data for patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  &lt;15 ml/min  and  use  of  Tarceva  in  patients  with  severe  renal impairment is not recommended. Adequate information has been provided in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC.

The safety and efficacy of erlotinib has not been studied in patients under the age of 18 years. Use of Tarceva in paediatric patients is not recommended (see SPC section 4.2).

Erlotinib is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A1, and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, as well as  a  strong  inhibitor  of  glucuronidation  by  UGT1A1 in vitro .  The  physiological  relevance  of  the strong inhibition of CYP1A1 is unknown due to the very limited expression of CYP1A1 in human tissues.

The inhibition of glucuronidation may cause interactions with medicinal products which are substrates of UGT1A1 and exclusively cleared by this pathway. Patients with low expression levels of UGT1A1 or genetic glucuronidation disorders (e.g. Gilbert's disease) may exhibit increased serum concentrations of bilirubin and must be treated with caution, and this has been adequately refelected in the SPC (see section 4.5). Based on the clinical safety data, the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be small.

Since  erlotinib  is  metabolised,  primarily  by  CYP3A4  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  CYP1A2,  potent inducers of CYP3A4 may reduce the efficacy of erlotinib whereas potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increased toxicity. Concomitant treatment with these types of agents should be avoided (see SPC section 4.5).  Reduced  exposure  has been observed for the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, and may also occur with other inducers e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates or St. Johns Wort ( hypericum perforatum ).  Caution should be observed when these drugs are combined with erlotinib. Alternate treatments lacking potent CYP3A4 inducing activity should be considered when possible. Caution  should  be  used  when  erlotinib  is  combined  with  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  e.g.  azole antifungals (i.e.  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole),  protease  inhibitors,  erythromycin  or clarithromycin.  If  necessary  the  dose  of  erlotinib  should  be  reduced,  particularly  if  toxicity  is observed.  No  clinical  interaction  study  with  a  CYP3A4  substrate  has  been  performed.  Based  on in vitro data, combination of erlotinib with CYP3A4 substrates should be conducted with caution. If such  a  combination  is  considered  necessary  a  close  clinical  monitoring  should  be  performed.  In  a clinical study, erlotinib was shown not to affect pharmacokinetics of the concomitantly administered CYP3A4/2C8 substrate paclitaxel. About 30% of the in-vitro metabolism of erlotinib is attributed to CYP1A2 activity. A pharmacokinetic interaction study to investigate this aspect was not considered necessary  taking into consideration the relatively small numbers of drugs that are strong inhibitors of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CYP1A2  and  the  small  likelihood  that  these  would  be  prescribed  concomitantly  with  erlotinib. Adequate warnings are provided in the SPC to highlight that the effects of CYP1A2 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetic of erlotinib have not been investigated and caution should be observed when these inhibitors are combined with erlotinib (see SPC section 4.5). Cigarette smoking is known to induce hepatic CYP1A2 via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor [39, 40]. Based on the results of the  population  pharmacokinetic  study,  patients  who  are  still  smoking  should  be  encouraged  to  stop smoking while taking Tarceva, as plasma concentrations could be reduced otherwise (see SPC section 4.5). The applicant committed to submit for evaluation the final report for a clinical interaction study for evaluating the effect of smoking on erlotinib pharmacokinetics.

Extrahepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 in intestine, CYP1A1 in lung, and CYP1B1 in tumour tissue also  potentially  contribute  to  the  metabolic  clearance  of  erlotinib.  Since  erlotinib  is  found  to  be  a strong  mechanism-based  inhibitor  of  CYP1A1,  the  overall  contribution  of  lung  metabolism  by CYP1A1 is expected to be negligible. CYP1B1 might contribute to erlotinib clearance especially after induction by smoking [32]. The substrate specificity of CYP1B1 as a drug-metabolizing enzyme has not been investigated. Potential interactions may occur with drugs which are metabolised by, or are inhibitors  or  inducers  of,  these  enzymes.  Adequate  information  has  been  included  in  the  SPC  (see section 4.5). The applicant has committed to study this effect in the ongoing PK study in smokers.

Co-administration  of  cytochrome  P450  inhibitors  or  inducers  was  not  associated  with  changes  in erlotinib  CL  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  but  detailed  documentation  were  lacking. Furthermore, the drug interactions between erlotinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers might be less profound at steady state than the interaction after administration of a single dose of erlotinib with the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducers.

International  Normalized  Ratio  (INR)  elevations,  and  bleeding  events  including  gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported in clinical studies, some  associated with concomitant warfarin administration  (see  section 4.8)  and  some  with  concomitant  NSAID  administration.  Patients  taking warfarin  or  other  coumarin-derivative  anticoagulants  should  be  monitored  regularly  for  changes  in prothrombin  time  or  INR.  A  clinical  interaction  study  with  midazolam  as  probe-drug  to  measure effects of erlotinib on CYP3A4 substrates has been initiated.

No apparent interaction was found while studying the influence of a number of chemotherapy agents (cisplatin,  carboplatin,  gemcitabine,  paclitaxel,  docetaxel,  or  capecitabine).  However,  these  latter observations have their origin from studies that were not specifically designed to detect an interaction which  should  be  kept  in  mind.  The  applicant  is  conducting  the  pharmacokinetics  phase  I  studies investigating the pharmacokinetic interactions of erlotinib and docetaxel, capecitabine, or paclitaxel/carboplatin.

In vitro studies does not suggest that erlotinib has a significant  potential of clinical relevant inhibition or induction on the metabolism of other drugs.

## Discussion on dosing

The dose selection is reasonably well justified based on a rather clear dose response relationship from in vitro and mice xenograph models and human MTD studies.

The applicant conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate the relationship between measures of erlotinib  exposure  and  various  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  in  Study  BR.21  (data  not  shown).  A PK/PD relation in patients has not been established.

The  possibility  of  recommending  individualised  dosing  has  been  explored.  The  observation  of  an association between severity and frequency of rash and efficacy of treatment has been made early in the development of erlotinib, and a confirmation of this finding was also seen in the erlotinib arm of BR.21. In the 363 erlotinib-treated patients who developed rash, the median survival was 9.49 months (95% CI: 7.95 - 10.91), and it was 2.22 months (95% CI: 1.71 - 2.76) for the 122 erlotinib-treated patients with no rash. However, no landmark analysis was conducted and the confounding effects due to  the  time-dependent nature of both rash and survival are acknowledged. Furthermore, there was a relatively high degree of rash in the placebo arm of study BR.21, and even in the placebo arm, the absence of a rash indicated a poorer outcome. The interim-results of a PKPD study to determine the feasibility of intrapatient dose escalation to tolerable rash in pretreated patients with NSCLC do not suggest a higher response rate in patients undergoing dose escalation[41]. It may also be possible that current  smokers  with  a  suggested  induction  of  erlotinib  drug  clearance  derive  a  benefit  from  dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

escalation.  The  applicant  committed  to  investigate  the  feasibility  and  safety  for  a  controlled  doseincrease  in  patients  with  an  increased  erlotinib  clearance  due  to  smoking.  In  conclusion  there  are currently insufficient data on these phenomena to enable individualized dosing, but data from ongoing and future trials will help to address this question.

## Clinical efficacy

The  clinical  development  program  of  erlotinib  in  NSCLC  as  single-agent  treatment  of  locally advanced  or  metastatic  Stage  IIIB/  IV  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  after  failure  of  at  least  one  prior chemotherapy regimen consisted of the pivotal study  BR.21 and the supportive Phase II study A2481007.

## · Main studies

## Title

A randomized placebo-controlled study of OSI-774 (Tarceva) in patients with incurable stage IIIB/IV Non-Small  Cell  Lung  Cancer  who  have  failed  standard  therapy  for  advanced  metatsatic  disease (protocol No. BR.21) [20].

## METHODS

## Study Participants

This was a multinational randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of erlotinib conducted in 731  patients  with  incurable  stage  IIIB/IV  NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  1  prior  chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomised across 86 centers in 17 countries. The first patient was randomised in November 2001 and the last patient in January 2003 with lock of database in April 2004. The study was initiated and conducted under the sponsorship of the NCIC CTG in Canada and of OSI for the international sites.

Patients were stratified at enrollment by center, number of prior regimens (one vs. two), prior platinum therapy  (yes  vs.  no),  best  response  to  prior  therapy  (CR  or  PR  vs.  SD  vs.  PD),  and  Eastern Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  (PS)  and  randomised  2:1  to  receive erlotinib  150 mg  tablets  orally  or  placebo  once  daily.  Treatment  continued  daily  until  disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The main selection criteria included histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of incurable stage  IIIB/IV  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung;  patients  had  to  have  evidence  of  disease  but measurable disease was not mandatory; 18 years of age or older; with the exception of elderly patients ( ≥ 70 years), all patients must have received at least 1 combination chemotherapy regimen and must not be planned  to receive further palliative  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  No  more  than  2  prior chemotherapy regimens were allowed. Elderly patients may have received 1 or 2 prior single agent regimens for their disease. Patients must have recovered from any toxic effects and at least 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose and prior to randomisation; Patients may have received prior radiation therapy providing that they have recovered from any toxic effects thereof and at least 7 days have elapsed between the last fraction and randomisation; ECOG performance status of 0, 1, 2 or 3; Adequate renal and hepatic function defined by the following laboratory values within 7 days prior to randomisation (serum creatinine &lt; 1,5 times the UNL, total bilirubin &lt; 1,5 UNL, ALT &lt; 2 times the UNL). Patients with any of  the following conditions were not eligible: significant history of cardiac disease; serious active infection or other serious underlying medical conditions that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment; known CNS metastases unless asymptomatic and on a stable dose of corticosteroids; any condition that does not permit compliance with the protocol; pregnant or lactating; patients with clinically significant ophthalmologic or gastrointstinal abnormalities.

## Treatments

Patients  were  randomised  2:1  to  receive  erlotinib  150 mg  tablets  orally  or  placebo  once  daily. Treatment  continued  daily  until  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity.  Treatment  had  to  be given  within  2  working  days  from  randomisation.  No  dose  escalation  of  erlotinib/placebo  was permitted  and  study  drug  was  reduced  for  toxicities  based  on  NCI-CTC  criteria  in  steps  of  50  mg. Study drug was given at a fixed dose of 150 mg as a single daily oral dose preferably in the morning. The drug was supposed to be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of any food or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

other medications, including grapefruit juice, vitamins and iron  supplements.  Treatment  was administered on an outpatient basis.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare overall survival between the 2 arms in patients with incurable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who have failed standard therapy for advanced disease. Secondary objectives were  to  compare  quality  of  life,  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  response  rates  (RR),  to  estimate response  duration,  toxicity,  to  correlate  the  expression  of  tissue  EGFR  levels  (at  diagnosis)  with outcomes and response to treatment, to measure and correlate trough levels of erlotinib with clinical responses and/or adverse events

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint according to study protocol was overall survival defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause. The secondary efficacy endpoints included quality of life of patients assessed using EORTC QLQC30 [42] and the lung cancer module (QLQ LC13) [43]. The questionnaire was completed at baseline, every 4 weeks on therapy, and at the 4- and 12-week post-treatment  follow-up  visits.  Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from randomisation to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. A patient who stopped  treatment  with  study  drug  and  went  on  receiving  alternative  therapy  for  NSCLC,  prior  to documentation of disease progression, was censored on the date alternative therapy began. Objective tumour response was assessed for patients with at least one measurable leason at baseline and at least one disease assessment after baseline using RECIST criteria. Assessments were done every six weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Duration of response (PR/CR) was defined as the time  from  first  objective  status  assessment  of  CR/PR  to  the  first  time  disease  progression  is documented or death. For the first 330 patients tumour responses or progression were assessed by an independent radiologist. The remaining 401 patients were assessed by the investigators only. Patients were assessed 4 weeks after discontinuing protocol treatment and then followed every 12 weeks until death.

## Sample size

According to a revised sample size calculation, a total of 582 events were required to detect a 33% (initially 50%) improvement in median survival (hazard ratio .75, initially .67) with erlotinib, using a two-sided 5% level test of significance and 90% power, assuming a median survival of 4 months for the  placebo  arm.    With  an  expected  accrual  time  of  14  months  and  6  months  additional  follow-up before final analysis, a sample size of 700 patients was calculated.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was stratified by centre, ECOG performance status (0 + 1 vs 2 + 3), best response to prior treatment (CR or PR vs. SD vs. PD), number of prior regimens (1 vs 2), exposure to platinum (yes vs. no) using a dynamic minimisation technique.

## Blinding (masking)

Each dosage strength of erlotinib and placebo tablets was manufactured to be indistinguishable from each other in appearance, smell, and taste. The study was double-blind, neither the investigator nor the patient was supposed to have knowledge about the assigned treatment.

## Statistical methods

All randomised patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) primary analysis of overall survival. The  2  treatment  arms  were  compared  using  the  stratified  log-rank  test  by  stratification  factors  at randomisation (see above) and EGFR expression status (positive vs negative vs unknown). No interim analysis was planned.

The primary endpoint in the QoL analysis was time from baseline assessment to deterioration in the following QoL symptoms: cough, dyspnea, and pain. Patients were considered as deteriorated for a given  symptom  if  their  change  in  score  from  the  baseline  on  the  domain/single  item  defining  this symptom was 10 points or higher, on a 1 - 100 scale, at any time-point after the baseline assessment. For each symptom, all patients who had a baseline and at least 1 of the follow-up QoL assessments were included in the time to deterioration analysis.  Patients were censored at the time of the last QoL questionnaire completion if they had not deteriorated before that.  The time to deterioration in each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

symptom  was  compared  between  the  2  treatment  arms  using  unstratified  log-rank  tests,  and  the Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the obtained p-values for multiple comparisons.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

In total, 731 patients were randomised (Figure 1). The majority of the treatment discontinuations were because  of  PD  or  symptomatic  progression:  64%  and  8%  in  the  erlotinib  arm  75%  and  8%  in  the placebo arm, respectively. The deaths listed (12% erlotinib arm and 9% placebo arm) were primarily because of PD or disease-related complications.

## Recruitment

Accrual lasted from 1 November 2001 until 31 January 2003. The cut-off date for the study report submitted in the initial application (database lock) was 23 April 2004.

## Conduct of the study

The  protocol  was  amended  3  times,  mainly  to  provide  information  about  the  possibility  of  drug interaction between erlotinib and warfarin, to change in the sample size from 330 to 700 patients, and to provide management and dose adjustment recommendations for interstitial pneumonitis.

Eligibility deviations as checked by NCIC CTG medical review were found in 2% of patients in the erlotinib  arm  and  4%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  most  common  deviation  was  the administration of 3 prior chemotherapies (a maximum of 2 was allowed). The applicant considered the potential impact of these deviations as negligible on the efficacy and safety results of the study. Other study conduct deviations (investigational therapeutic; Quality of Life; therapeutic modification) were noted in 1% of patients in the erlotinib arm and in 3% of patients in the placebo arm.

## Baseline data

The  main  baseline  characteristics  are  provided  in  table  4.  The  median  time  from  most  recent progression/relapse  to  randomisation  was  0.5  months  in  both  groups.  EGFR  expression  at  baseline were  interpretable  for  31%  of  the  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  for  35%  of  the  patients  in  the placebo arm. It is unknown how many of the samples were from the time of initial diagnosis or from a subsequent relapse. In the erlotinib arm, 16% of patients (representing 51% of the patients with known results)  had  a  positive  EGFR  expression  and  15%  (49%  of  the  patients  with  known  results)  had  a negative expression, compared with 20% and 15% (representing 57% and 43% of patients with known results) in the placebo arm.

## Numbers analysed

All 731 patients were included in the ITT efficacy analyses and description of baseline characteristics; 4 patients did not start protocol treatment and were excluded from the safety analyses.

## Outcomes and estimation

At the time of final analysis 587 deaths had occurred and 144 patients were still alive or lost to followup: 110 patients (23%) in the erlotinib arm and 34 patients (14%) in the placebo arm.

## Overall survival

The main efficacy results of study BR.21 are summarised in table 5. The median overall survival was 6.67 months  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (95% CI,  5.52  -  7.79 months) v. 4.70  months  in  the  placebo  arm (95%  CI,  4.11  -  6.28 months).    The  actuarial  12-month  survival  rates  were  31.2%  and  21.5%, respectively.  The Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival in Study BR.21 is shown in figure 2. The HR for  death  in  the  erlotinib  arm  relative  to  the  placebo  arm  estimated  from  the  primary  analysis (adjusted for stratification factors at randomization and EGFR expression status) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60 - 0.87) ( P = .001).

The median PFS was 9.71 weeks in the erlotinib arm (95% CI, 8.43 -12.43 weeks) compared with 8.00 weeks in the placebo arm (95% CI, 7.86 - 8.14 weeks).  The actuarial 26-week (6-month) PFS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rates were 24.5% and 9.3%, respectively, for the erlotinib and placebo arms.  The primary analysis of PFS  incorporated  an  adjustment  for  the  same  baseline  factors  used  in  the  overall  survival  analysis (stratification factors and EGFR expression status).  The adjusted HR for progression in the erlotinib arm relative to the placebo arm was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.51 - 0.73) (p &lt; 0.001). In univariate analyses, the factors that were associated with worse PFS were: ECOG PS 2 or 3, and PD as best response to prior therapy. Neither the number of prior regimens nor exposure to prior platinum was predictive of PFS. EGFR status was marginally associated with PFS. Patients with EGFR-negative tumours had shorter PFS than patients with EGFR-positive tumours, the difference was not statistically different.

## Objective response rate

The  objective  response  rates  in  the  erlotinib  arm  were  12/195  (6.2%)  for  the  first  330  randomised patients and 26/232 (11.2%)  for the last 401 randomised patients. A total of 4 CRs and 34 PRs were observed  among  the  427 patients  with  measurable  disease  treated  with  erlotinib,  for  an  objective response rate of 8.9% (95% CI, 6.4 - 12.0%).  An additional patient with only non-measurable lesions at  baseline  also  achieved  a  CR  while  treated  with  erlotinib.  Two  responses  were  observed  in  the placebo arm (1 CR and 1 PR) for a 0.9% response rate.  Both of these responses were in the group of 401  patients  with  less  intense  medical  review.  For  patients  with  measurable  disease,  the  median response duration was 34.3 weeks (95% CI, 24.71 - 46.29 weeks), ranging from 9.7 to 57.6+ weeks. Stable disease was observed in 35.1% of erlotinib-treated patients with measurable disease, compared with 26.5% of placebo-treated patients, for a CR + PR + SD rate of 44.0% and 27.5%, respectively. This  difference was  statistically significant,  p  =  0.004.  Exploratory  univariate  analyses  were performed to identify which baseline factors might predict response and response +SD with erlotinib. Response  rates  were  higher  among  women  (14.4%)  than  men  (6.0%),  higher  among  patients  with adenocarcinomas (13.9%) than patients with squamous carcinomas (3.8%) or other histologies (4.5%), higher  among  patients  who  never  smoked  (24.7%)  than  current  or  ex-smokers  (3.9%),  and  higher among  patients  with  EGRF-positive  tumours  (11.6%)  than  patients  with  EGRF-negative  tumours (3.2%).

A survival benefit of Tarceva was also observed in patients who did not achieve an objective tumour response (by RECIST). This was evidenced by a hazard ratio for death of 0.82 among patients whose best response was stable disease or progressive disease.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

Clinical studies in patients with renal and/or hepatic impaiment have not been performed. Renal- or hepatic  impairment  have  been  exclusion  criteria  in  the  pivotal  study  BR.21.  There  have  been  no specific studies in elderly patients.

## · Supportive study(ies)

Study A248-1007 was a single arm, open-label, multicenter Phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety  of  erlotinib  in  patients  with  Stage  IIIB  or  IV,  EGFR-positive  NSCLC  after  failure  of  prior platinum-based  chemotherapy  [19,  44,  45].    Patients  received  erlotinib,  150 mg  daily  until  disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. Serial measurements of all disease sites were performed every 8 weeks and response and PFS were assessed by the investigators using WHO criteria and RECIST.  No central evaluation was performed.  Efficacy was further evaluated by periodic assessments of survival and health-related quality of life (HQoL).

The  study  population  involved  patients ≥ 18 years  of  age.    The  main  criteria  for  inclusion  were documented Stage IIIB or IV advanced or recurrent metastatic NSCLC, disease progression or relapse following platinum-based therapy, and confirmation of EGFR-positivity (based on immunohistochemical staining of the original tumour specimen, newly biopsied material, or cytospin of  pleural  fluid).    Additional  criteria  included  written  informed  consent;  ECOG  PS  of  0  to  2;  and adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function as defined by protocol criteria.  Response rate was the primary efficacy endpoint in this study.

The 57 patients who entered the study represented a population with advanced NSCLC after failure of multiple  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  (median:  2  regimens,  range: 1 -  8).    Sixty  percent  of  the patients were female.  The median age was 62 years (range: 31 - 83).  Most patients (77%) had an ECOG  PS  of 1,  and  the  majority  were  ex-smokers  (74%).    The  most  common  tumor  type  was adenocarcinoma (61%).  The median time from initial diagnosis to study entry was 18 months (range:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4  -  137).    All  tumors  were  EGFR-positive.  Of  the  57 patients,  2  achieved  a  CR  and  5  had  a  best response of PR as determined by both WHO and RECIST, for an objective response rate of 12.3% (95% CI, 5.1 - 23.7%).  Twenty-two patients had SD (38.6%) and 28 patients (49.1%) had progressive disease (PD).  The median duration of response was 19.7 weeks (range: 11.7 - 80.3).  Response rates were similar  regardless  of  type  of  prior  chemotherapy  or  whether  the  patient  had  received  1,  2,  or more  prior  regimens.  With  9  patients  still  alive  and  censored  in  the  analysis,  the  median  overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 - 13.9 months).  The 1-year survival rate was 40.4% (95% CI, 27.6 - 54.2%).  With 5 patients censored in the analysis, the median PFS was 9.0 weeks (95% CI, 8.0 - 15.3 weeks).

## · Ancillary analyses

In  an  attempt  to  identify  patient  groups  who  are  more  likely  to  benefit  from  the  treatment,  the applicant  conducted  subgroup  analyses  for  overall  survival  (figure  3).  Regarding  EGFR-expression status the applicant obtained tumour samples from additional 104 patients and EGFR results available for 326 patients (45% of all participants) of study BR.21. The updated results are presented in table 6. Updated curves  for  overall  survival  of  EGFR-negative  patients  are  shown  in  figure  4.  Multivariate analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  existence  of  a  treatment  by  EGFR  status  interaction.  No statistically significant interaction was found in these exploratory analyses.

Figure 4. Survival in EGFR-Negative Patients - Updated EGFR Data

<!-- image -->

An  analysis  of  outcome  and  EGFR  mutation  status  (mutated v. wild-type)  was  attempted.  EGFR mutation status was known for only 117/731 (16%) of patients of BR.21. No association was found between mutation status and outcome.

A  higher  proportion  of  patients  receiving  erlotinib  received  transfusions  (7.8%  vs.  4.5%).  The summary  of  new  concomitant  medications  begun  during  the  study  showed  there  were  several medications and classes of medications taken more frequently by patients in the erlotinib group (e.g. anti-bacterials, corticosteroids). Twice as many patients received systemic antibiotics in the erlotinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group (56% compared to 28%). A total of 29/488 (5.9%) of erlotinib patients received radiotherapy (33 treatments), compared to 26/243 (7.8%) of placebo patients (26 treatments).

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of erlotinib 150 mg daily monotherapy has been demonstrated compared to placebo in terms  of  overall  survival  in  the  claimed  indication,  based  on  the  single  phase  III  trial  submitted. Concerning secondary endpoints such as objective response rate, progression-free survival and quality of life, the high prevalence of rash in the erlotinib arm combined with the 2:1 randomisation in favour of  erlotinib  raises  doubts  about  the  effectiveness  of  the  blinding.  Furthermore,  no  central  radiology review was carried out for the majority of patients (n=401), and this raises questions about the claimed overall objective response rate and progression-free survival.

Currently, docetaxel and pemetrexed have been approved for 2 nd -line treatment of NSCLC and their efficacy has been established according to current regulatory requirements. In view of the significant treatment  effect  in  terms  of  overall  survival  observed  for  erlotinib  compared  to  placebo,  inferiority compared to single-agent docetaxel or pemetrexed seems unlikely and a randomised controlled study is  not  a  requirement  for  the  purpose  of  marketing  authorisation.  Nevertheless,  the  applicant  has planned  to  conduct  a  phase  III  trial  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  (stage  IIIB  /IV)  who  had progressive disease during 4 cycles of standard platinum based chemo-therapy (trial BO18602).

There  are  concerns  about  potential  lack  of  efficacy  in  EGFR-negative  patients.  For  a  compound targeting EGFR signalling, solid evidence should be presented showing that the compound is active in EGFR-negative tumours (defined by IHC using the DAKO kit and defining positive as &lt; 10% tumor cells staining). It is acknowledged that no statistically significant interaction of treatment by EGFRstatus was observed in multivariate analysis, but the study has not been designed to ensure adequate power to detect such interactions. A hazard ratio of 1.01 (original) or 0.93 (updated) rather indicates lack of a meaningful effect, and the updated results regarding progression-free survival and tumour response (data not shown) did not provide useful information to establish efficacy in this subgroup of EGFR-negative patients show that the benefit of treatment is at best is moderate or not existing in this subgroup.  This  issue  is  further  discussed  with  reference  to  the  proposed  therapeutic  indication  for Tarceva (see benefit risk assessment).

Tarceva  resulted  in  symptom  benefits  by  significantly  prolonging  time  to  deterioration  in  cough dyspnoea  and  pain,  versus  placebo.  These  symptom  benefits  were  not  due  to  an  increased  use  of palliative radiotherapy or concomitant medications in the Tarceva group. It is reassuring that treatment with erlotinib slightly improved QoL regarding cough, dyspnoea and pain and that the toxicities of treatment (diarrhoea, sore mouth) did not impair the overall quality of life compared to placebo. A general improvement of the quality of life cannot be concluded from the data.

The  applicant  has  committed  to  submit  for  evaluation  a  report  investigating  the  reason  for  the imbalance  in  antibiotic  treatment  (e.g.  with  tetracyclines,  penicillins  with  a  broad  spectrum,  other aminoglycosides  and  lincosamides).  Also,  the  applicant  has  committed  to  submit  for  evaluation  a report supporting and informing of the number of surgeries/procedures/resuscitations and other nondrug related treatments that might have had an impact on survival.

Further  studies  are  ongoing  or  planned,  such  as  trials  to  test  the  influence  of  CYP3A4  activity  on erlotinib pharmacokinetics (NP17536), erlotinib MTD with concurrent administration of pemetrexed (BP18193),  erlotinib  pharmacokinetics  in  smokers  and  non-smokers  (OSI  774-103),  in  hepaticallyimpaired patients (OSI 774-104) and in rifampicin-exposed healthy volunteers (OSI 774-105).

The  applicant  is  conducting  two  studies  in  patients  with  NSCLC  that  aim  to  identify  prognostic markers such as tumoral EGFR-expression status and EGFR mutations and analyze interrelationships with clinical efficacy parameters. The prospective studying of the correlation between tumoural EGFR mutation status and clinical outcome is of great relevance. An adjuvant phase III study in patients with NSCLC  Ib-IIIA  after  4  cycles  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy  will  also  assess  tumoral  EGFRexpression  status.  Blood  samples  will  be  collected  to  determine  the  EGFR  polymorphisms.  The relationships  between  EGFR  polymorphism  to  survival  and  PFS  will  be  analyzed,  as  well  as  the correlation between EGFR polymorphism and other markers (e.g. EGFR mutation, EGFR expression).

## Clinical safety

The primary safety population was defined as the 759 patients treated with at least one 150 mg dose of Tarceva monotherapy during Phase III study BR.21, Phase II study A248-1007, and three Phase II studies  in  populations  other  than  NSCLC:  248-101  (ovarian  cancer),  A248-1003  (head  and  neck cancer), and OSI2288g (metastatic breast cancer) and the 242 patients who received placebo in study BR.21.

## Studies with Healthy Volunteers

Adverse events have also been assessed in 279 healthy volunteers in studies during which subjects had limited exposure to erlotinib or placebo.  As with cancer patients, the most common adverse events among  healthy  volunteers  exposed  to  erlotinib  were  rash  and  diarrhea.    The  diarrhea  was  mostly considered mild in severity and reversible, however, the rash as considered moderately severe in some healthy subjects dosed for up to 7 days and lasted for almost up to 1 year.  The occurrence of these adverse  effects,  most  notably  acneiform  rash,  limited  the  ability  of  some  healthy  volunteers  to complete the protocol-specified dosing regimens. Erlotinib 200 mg orally twice daily repetitive dosing evaluated in Study 248-002 was not well tolerated by healthy male subjects.  This study produced the first evidence of severe rash characterized by the investigator as an erythematous rash or a follicular exanthema.  The rashes developed on the face, neck, chest, and back of all 6 subjects who received erlotinib 200 mg twice daily 3 to 4 days after the first dose. Dosing was discontinued after 4 to 5 days and the study was terminated.

## Phase III study OSI2298g

This  was  a  phase  III  randomised  double  blind  multicenter  trial  of  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy (Carboplatin and Paclitaxel) versus chemotherapy alone (carboplatin and paclitaxel) in patients with advanced  NSCLC.  1079  patients  were  enrolled.  The  erlotinib  arm  had  a  higher  incidence  of  study drug-related serious adverse events relative to the placebo arm (8.6% erlotinib, 2.4% placebo). The most common events included diarrhea (3.8% erlotinib, 1.1% placebo) and rash (dermatitis acneiform) (0.8% erlotinib, 0% placebo). There were also a greater number of patients with serious adverse events that  were  attributed  by  the  investigator  as  leading  to  death  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  Such  events  were experienced by 53 of 526 patients in the erlotinib arm (10.1%) and 27 of 533 patients in the placebo arm  (5.1%).  The  majority  of  these  events  (63  of  80)  occurred  in  the  first  4  months  of  study participation (43 erlotinib; 20 placebo).

## Phase III study BO16411

This  was  a  phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  of  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy (Cisplatin  and  Gemcitabine)  versus  chemotherapy  alone  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC.  1172 patients  were  enrolled.  Overall,  gastrointestinal  disorders  were  the  most  frequently-reported  events, and occurred more frequently in the erlotinib group (75% vs. 69% in the placebo group). There was a marked  elevation  in  the  incidence  of  diarrhea  in  the  erlotinib  group  (40%  vs.  17%  in  the  placebo group).  The  most  notable  imbalance  between  the  groups  related  to  the  incidence  of  skin  disorders (70%  vs  34%)  arising  minly  from  rash  (66%  vs.  19%).  Other  body  systems  in  which  there  was  a higher incidence of events on active treatment were metabolism and nutrition disorders (38% vs. 33%: mainly driven by anorexia and dehydration), investigations (28% vs 21%, mainly driven by weight decrease), renal and urinary disorders (13% vs. 7%: mainly renal failure) and eye disorders (9% vs. 5%: mainly conjunctivitis). Overall, there was a higher incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3 and 4 events in the  erlotinib  group  (77%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (72%).  The  proportion  of  deaths  was  similar between the treatment groups (48% of patients dying due to PD in the erlotinib group vs 46% in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo group; 11% dying due to AE in the erlotinib group vs. 12% in the placebo group). Almost all events  leading  to  death  were  considered  by  the  investigators  as  unrelated  to  study  medication,  but there was an increased incidence of events considered as probably related to study medication in the erlotinib  group.  Some  events  only  resulted  in  death  for  patients  in  the  erlotinib  group.  Notable amongst  these  are  renal  failure  and  acute  renal  failure,  from  which  four  patients  died,  febrile neutropenia,  neuropenic  sepsis  and  neutropenia,  from  which  four  patients  died  and  diarrhea,  from which two patients died. The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the erlotinib group (53%) than in the placebo group (47%). This was driven by an excess of serious events in the erlotinib group in four body systems: blood and lymphatic system disorders (mainly anemia and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal disorders (mainly diarrhea), renal and urinary disorders, and skin and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders.  There  was  a  marked  increase  in  the  incidence  of  serious  renal disorders in the erlotinib group relative to the placebo group (17 patients, 3% vs. 5 patients, &lt;1%). Renal  failure  and  acute  renal  failure  were  the  major  events  behind  this,  recorded  in  12  erlotinib patients but in only 2 placebo patients.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse events and deaths

The incidence of serious adverse events in Study BR.21 was slightly higher in the erlotinib arm than in the placebo arm (34% versus 28%), which was lower than the incidences in Study A248-1007 (47%) and the combined Phase II studies (40%).  The most common serious adverse events that occurred at least  twice  as  often  in  the  erlotinib  arm  as  in  the  placebo  arm  of  Study  BR.21  include  fatigue, pneumonia,  dehydration,  diarrhea,  and  vomiting.  Across  all  study  populations,  the  most  common serious  adverse  events  were  respiratory  disorders  and  the  rates  were  consistent  and  balanced  in  the controlled study (BR.21, 16% versus 14% in placebo; A248-1007, 28%; other Phase II, 11%. In Study BR.21, serious gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 5%) in the erlotinib arm than in the  placebo  arm  (10%  versus  3%),  as  were  infections  and  infestations  (8%  versus  3%).    This  is consistent with the incidences observed in A248-1007 and the other Phase II studies, in which 7% and 11%, respectively, experienced gastrointestinal disorders and 14% and 9%, respectively, experienced Infection  and  Infestation  disorders.    More  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  of  Study BR.21  (8%) experienced treatment-related serious adverse events than in the placebo arm (3%).  Treatment-related serious metabolism and nutrition disorders were also slightly more common in the erlotinib arm (3%) than in the placebo arm (&lt; 1%). Excluding NSCLC as the primary cause of death, 5% of patients in the  erlotinib  group  of  Study BR.21,  4%  in  the  placebo  group,  and  5%  in  Study A248-1007  died  of other causes. Death was attributed to toxicity from protocol treatment in 2 erlotinib-treated patients and 1 placebo-treated patient in Study BR.21.  In addition, 2 other erlotinib-treated patients died from a  combination  of  NSCLC  and  protocol  treatment  complications.    No  patients  died  from  treatmentrelated  adverse  events  in  Study A248-1007  or  in  the  Phase II  studies.  In  general,  serious  adverse events  were  most  often  associated  with  the  underlying  NSCLC,  with  dyspnea  being  the  most commonly occurring serious adverse event.  The incidence of serious adverse events in Study BR.21 was slightly higher in the erlotinib arm than in the placebo arm (34% versus 28%), which was lower than the incidences in Study A248-1007 (47%) and the combined Phase II studies (40%).  Across all study populations, the most common serious adverse events were respiratory disorders and the rates were consistent and well balanced in the controlled study (BR.21, 16% versus 14% in placebo; A2481007, 28%; other Phase II, 11%. In Study BR.21, serious gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 5%) in the erlotinib arm than in the placebo arm (10% versus 3%), as were infections and infestations (8% versus 3%).  This is consistent with the incidences observed in A248-1007 and the other Phase II studies, in which 7% and 11%, respectively, experienced gastrointestinal disorders and 14%  and  9%,  respectively,  experienced  Infection  and  Infestation  disorders.    More  patients  in  the erlotinib  arm of Study BR.21 (8%) experienced treatment-related serious adverse events than in the placebo arm (3%).  Treatment-related serious metabolism and nutrition disorders were also slightly more common in the erlotinib arm (3%) than in the placebo arm (&lt; 1%). In Study A248-1007, serious adverse events considered treatment-related were reported in 2 patients (4%), including 1 patient who experienced Grade 2 nausea and vomiting and 1 patient with Grade 2 cellulitis.  There was no Grade 3 or  4  treatment-related  serious  adverse  event  reported  during  Study A248-1007.    Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 5% of the patients in the combined Phase II studies.  These were  all  single  episodes  of  mainly  gastrointestinal  disorders  (diarrhea,  pancreatitis,  dysphagia)  and general disorders (fatigue, pyrexia, edema). Deaths In Study BR.21, 32% of the erlotinib group and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

29% of the placebo group died during treatment or within 30 days of the last dose, as did 35% of patients  in  Study A248-1007.  For most patients, the primary cause of death within 30 days of last dose was attributed by the Investigators to be NSCLC (ie, progressive disease):  27% in the BR.21 erlotinib-treated  group  versus  26%  in  the  placebo  group  and  30%  in  Study A248-1007.    Excluding NSCLC as the primary cause of death, 5% of patients in the erlotinib group of Study BR.21, 4% in the placebo group, and 5% in Study A248-1007 died of other causes.  Death was attributed to toxicity from protocol treatment in 2 erlotinib-treated patients and 1 placebo-treated patient in Study BR.21. In  addition,  2  other  erlotinib-treated  patients  died  from  a  combination  of  NSCLC  and  protocol treatment  complications  (see  the  following  table).    No  patients  died  from  treatment-related  adverse events in Study A248-1007 or in the Phase II studies. In the Japanese Phase I study (JO16564), 2 of the 15 patients died within 30 days of last dose of study drug:  1 patient due to progressive disease and 1 patient due to interstitial pneumonia attributed to erlotinib therapy by the Investigator, although this diagnosis was not confirmed by autopsy findings.

## Targeted Adverse Events

Adverse events that had a notable higher incidence in the BR.21 erlotinib arm when compared with the  placebo  arm  orthat  were  considere  of  special  interest  included:    skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue disorders  (78%  versus  24%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (74%  versus  50%),  respiratory,  thoracic  and mediastinal disorders (66% versus 62%), infections and infestations (32% versus 20%), eye disorders (27% versus 9%), and metabolism and nutritional disorders (55% versus 41%).

##  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders

In Study BR.21, the median time to onset of rash was approximately 1 week (8 days compared with 18 days in the placebo group). The prevalence of rash by study period (i.e., 4 weeks) suggests that the rate  remains  fairly  constant  in  patients  who  stay  on  study  drug.    The  rash  appears  to  diminish following  discontinuation  based  on  the  prevalence  observed  during  the  second  follow-up  visit.  The severity  of  rash  was  mainly  Grade  1  or  2  during  the  on-study  period  and  mainly  Grade  1  during follow-up. The incidence of RASH observed in patients receiving single-agent erlotinib is consistent with that observed in the studies of erlotinib with concurrent chemotherapy.  In Study OSI2298g the composite incidence of RASH was 81% and 43% in the erlotinib and placebo groups, respectively, and 66% and 19%, respectively, in Study BO16411.

##  Gastrointestinal Disorders

The overall incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was 74% in the erlotinib arm of Study BR.21 (50% in the placebo arm), 88% in Study A248-1007, and 84% in the combined Phase II studies.  Slightly over  half  of  erlotinib-treated  patients  experienced  diarrhea  (54%  in  BR.21  erlotinib  arm,  56%  in Study A248-1007,  and  51%  in  the  combined  Phase II  studies).    Diarrhea  was  generally  of  mild  or moderate severity, although 6% of patients in the BR.21 erlotinib arm experienced Grade 3 diarrhea, as did 6% of patients in the combined Phase II studies and 1 patient in Study A248-1007. The median time to first diarrhea was 12 days and 19 days in the erlotinib group and placebo group, respectively, of Study BR.21.  The prevalence by study period remained fairly constant but significantly decreased during the follow-up periods, suggesting reversibility of diarrhea upon study drug cessation.

##  Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders

Cases  of  interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD),  including  fatalities,  have  been  reported  uncommonly  in patients  receiving  Tarceva  for  treatment  of  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  or  other  advanced solid tumours. In the pivotal study BR.21 in NSCLC, the incidence of ILD (0.8 %) was the same in both  the  placebo  and  Tarceva  groups.  The  overall  incidence  in  Tarceva-treated  patients  from  all studies  (including  uncontrolled  studies  and  studies  with  concurrent  chemotherapy)  is approximately 0.6 % compared to 0.2 % in patients on placebo. Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD included pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and lung infiltration. Confounding or  contributing  factors  such  as  concomitant  or  prior  chemotherapy,  prior  radiotherapy,  pre-existing parenchymal lung disease, metastatic lung disease, or pulmonary infections were frequent.

-  Infections and Infestations

There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  infections  and  infestations  in  the  BR.21  erlotinib  arm  than  in  the placebo  arm  (32%  versus  20%).  The  incidence  was  46%  in  study A248-1007  and  31%  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combined  Phase II  studies.    In  Study BR.21,  8%  of  erlotinib-treated  patients  and  3%  of  placebotreated patients experienced infections as a serious adverse event. In 2 of the erlotinib-treated patients, the serious adverse event was considered treatment related (pneumonia and hepatitis B). The apparent higher rate of pulmonary infections in the erlotinib arm of study BR.21 was no longer evident when adjusted for the longer survival experienced by this group.

##  Ophthalmological Disorders

Eye disorders occurred in 27% of patients in the BR.21 erlotinib arm (9% in the placebo group), 19% of patients in A248-1007, and 32% in the combined Phase II studies. These events were predominately of  mild  or  moderate  severity,  with  Grade 3  or  4  events  reported  in  5  patients  (1%)  of  the  BR.21 erlotinib  arm,  1  patient  in  Study A248-1007,  and  3  patients  (1%)  in  the  combined  Phase II  studies. Three  of  the  5 patients  in  the  BR.21  erlotinib  arm  who  had  eye  disorders  experienced  Grade  3/4 conjunctivitis, as did 1 patient in the combined Phase II studies.  No other type of Grade 3 or 4 eye disorder was reported in more than 1 erlotinib-treated patient.

One isolated case of corneal ulceration was reported in one patient receiving Tarceva with concurrent chemotherapy, as a complication of mucocutaneous inflammation.

##  Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders

The overall incidence of metabolism and nutrition disorders was higher in the erlotinib arm than in the placebo arm of Study BR.21 (55% versus 41%), primarily due to the difference in the incidence of anorexia:  52% versus 38%.

##  Bleeding Disorders

In  Study BR.21,  10  patients  (2%)  in  the  erlotinib  arm  had  a  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  compared with 1 patient (&lt; 1%) in the placebo arm.  Eight of these were serious adverse events, 5 of which were considered  treatment  related.  All  8 serious  cases  were  associated  with  contributing  factors  that included concomitant warfarin administration in 2 patients, concurrent NSAID in 3 patients, and antiulcer medication in 4 patients suggesting active peptic ulcer disease.  Overall, 24% of patients in the erlotinib arm and 17% of patients in the placebo arm experienced a bleeding disorder.  Hemoptysis was  most  frequent  but  balanced  between  the  2  treatment  arms  (15%  versus  14%),  followed  by epistaxis, which was more frequent in erlotinib-treated patients (7% versus &lt; 1%).  Most events were of Grade 1 severity. To correct for the longer survival time observed in the erlotinib arm, the incidence of serious bleeding per patient weeks was calculated. The rate in the erlotinib arm was 7.64 per patient weeks compared with 18.22 in the placebo arm.

## · Safety in special populations

The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in males and females and in patients &lt; 65 years of age  and  those ≥ 65.  In  Study BR.21,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  was,  in  general,  higher  in Caucasians  compared  with  Asians  even  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  erlotinib  arm  of  Study BR.21, there  was  a  notably  higher  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  among  patients  with  performance status 0 or 1 than among patients with performance status 2 or 3 (83% versus 56%). The difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders among patients with performance status 0 or 1 than among patients  with  performance  status  2  or  3in  the  erlotinib  arm  of  Study BR.21  included  diarrhea  (62% versus  39%),  nausea  (36% versus 25%), and vomiting (25% versus 20%). The incidence of RASH among patients  with  performance  status  0  or  1  was  82%  compared  with  63%  among  patients  with performance status 2 or 3 in the erlotinib arm of Study BR.21.  This incidence of 63% among patients with performance status 2 or 3 is notably less than the overall incidence of RASH among erlotinibtreated patients (75%).

No clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been completed.  The influence of hepatic metastases  and/or  hepatic  dysfunction  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  erlotinib  is  not  currently  known. Liver  function  test  abnormalities  (including  increased  alanine  aminotransferase  [ALT],  aspartate aminotransferase  [AST],  bilirubin).  These  were  mainly  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  transient  in nature or associated with liver metastases.

No clinical studies have been conducted or are planned in patients with compromised renal function.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Interaction  with  Anticoagulants:  Phase II  and  Phase III  studies  included  increased  surveillance  of coagulation  parameters  (INR).    Systematic  data  collection  was  only  performed  in  Study BR.21  in patients receiving concurrent warfarin.  On-study INR values were available for 32 erlotinib-treated patients  and  14  placebo-treated  patients.    Shifts  to  values  that  may  be  associated  with  significant bleeding  risks  (INR ≥ 4)  were  seen  in  11  erlotinib-treated  patients  (27%)  and  4 placebo-treated patients  (21%).    Approximately  half  in  each  arm  developed  shifts  to  INR  of  &gt; 6,  which  may  be associated  with  greatest  risk  of  bleeding  episodes.    None  of  these  patients,  however,  experienced serious clinical bleeding.

Interaction with CYP3A4 Inhibitors: The incidence of dose reductions or discontinuations was similar between those patients who received CYP3A4 inhibitors and those who did not (data not shown).

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

In study BR.21, adverse events led to study drug discontinuation in 4 (2%) v. 25 (5%, with diarrhoea 1%, and rash 1%) patients, for placebo and erlotibib, respectively, and to dose reduction in 0 (0%) v. 42 (9%, with rash 6%, and diarrhoea 1%) patients, for placebo and erlotinib, respectively.

No post marketing experience was available at the time of submission of the application.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Compared  to  other  chemotherapies,  based  on  the  current  clinical  safety  database,  erlotinib  has  a favourable  safety  profile  when  used  as  a  single-agent.  The  observed  adverse  events  have  been  in accordance with the findings of the preclinical studies.

Rash (75 %) and diarrhoea (54 %) were the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Most were Grade 1/2 in severity and manageable without intervention. Grade 3/4 rash and diarrhoea occurred  in  9 %  and  6 %,  respectively  in  Tarceva-treated  patients  and  each  resulted  in  study discontinuation in 1 % of patients. Dose reduction for rash and diarrhoea was needed in 6 % and 1 % of patients, respectively. In study BR.21, the median time to onset of rash was 8 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhoea was 12 days.

Skin-related AEs are very frequent with erlotinib and appear within the first month of drug treatment in the majority of cases. Erlotinib-associated facial rush was the most common form of skin toxicity and was reversible upon withdrawal of erlotinib. Erlotinib-associated skin toxicity thus very closely resembles skin toxicity as known from gefitinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Diarrhoea has occurred in approximately 50% of patients on Tarceva and moderate or severe diarrhoea should be treated with e.g. loperamide. In some cases dose reduction may be necessary. In the clinical studies  doses  were  reduced  by  50 mg  steps.  Dose  reductions  by  25 mg  steps  have  not  been investigated. In the event of severe or persistent diarrhoea, nausea, anorexia, or vomiting associated with dehydration, Tarceva therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to treat the dehydration (see section 4.8).

The tablets contain lactose and should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose  intolerance,  Lapp  lactase  deficiency  or  glucose-galactose  malabsorption  (see  SPC  section 4.4).

There was a consistent and high incidence of usually mild and dose-related skin and gastrointestinal AEs,  that  resulted  in  study  discontinuation  in  1%  of  erlotinib-treated  patients  (BR.21).  No  clear association has been found between erlotinib administration and cardiac disorders, bleeding disorders, laboratory  abnormalities  and  infections.  Dry  eyes  were  more  frequent  in  erlotinib-exposed  patients (4%)  as  opposed  to  placebo-exposed  patients  (1%).  In  conclusion,  adverse  events  associated  with erlotinib treatment are reasonably well defined, and the most common  adverse  events, i.e. gastrointestinal  disturbances  and  skin  rash,  are  mostly  mild  and  reversible  upon  dose  reductions  or drug withdrawal.

Overall,  34%  of  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  of  study  BR.21  developed  a  serious  adverse  event  as compared to 28% in the placebo arm. The most common serious adverse events that occurred at least twice as often in the erlotinib arm as in the placebo arm of Study BR.21 included fatigue, pneumonia, dehydration,  diarrhea,  and  vomiting.  These  serious  adverse  events  were  not  unexpected  and  the absolute increase of 6% in the treatment group is moderate compared to many other chemotherapies. An  increase  of  treatment  related  deaths  has  not  been  observed  in  studies  investigating  single-drug treatment with erlotinib, although in combination treatment serious adverse events that were attributed by the investigator  as  leading  to  death  in  the  erlotinib  arm  were  higher  compared  to  placebo.    The generally  favourable  safety  profile  is  also  reflected  by  the  small  number  of  patients  discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.

In patients who develop acute onset of new and/or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, Tarceva therapy should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is diagnosed, Tarceva should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary (see section 4.8).

There  are  no  studies  in  pregnant  women  using  erlotinib  but  studies  in  animals  have  shown  some reproductive  toxicity  (see  Toxicology).  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is  unknown.  Women  of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on Tarceva. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy, and for at least 2 weeks after completing therapy. Treatment should only be continued in pregnant women if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the foetus. It is not known whether erlotinib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm  to  the  infant,  mothers  should  be  advised  against  breastfeeding  while  receiving  Tarceva.  This information is adequately reflected in the SPC (see section 4.6), and package leaflet.

Single oral doses of Tarceva up to 1000 mg erlotinib in healthy subjects, and up to 1600 mg in cancer patients have been tolerated. Repeated twice daily doses of 200 mg in healthy subjects were poorly tolerated after only a few days of dosing. Based on the data from these studies, severe adverse events such as diarrhoea, rash and possibly increased activity of liver aminotransferases may occur above the recommended  dose  of  150 mg.  In  case  of  suspected  overdose,  Tarceva  should  be  withheld  and symptomatic treatment initiated (this is reflected in the SPC, see section 4.8).

No studies  on  the  effects  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines  have  been  performed;  however erlotinib is not associated with impairment of mental ability  (this is reflected in the SPC, see section 4.7).

Patient groups at higher risk of adverse drug reactions have not been identified. The impact of slight to moderate liver impairment on safety has not been investigated. The applicant has committed to submit for  evaluation  the  final  study  report  for  the  planned  pharmacokinetic  study  in  cancer  patients  with hepatic dysfunction once the study is finalised.

## 5 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Erlotinib  is  an  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor/  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  type 1 (EGFR also  known  as  HER1)  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor.  Erlotinib  potently  inhibits  the  intracellular phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of normal cells and cancer cells. In non-clinical models, inhibition of EGFR phosphotyrosine results in cell stasis and/or death.

Chronic dosing effects observed in at least one animal species or study included effects on the cornea (atrophy,  ulceration),  skin  (follicular  degeneration  and  inflammation,  redness,  and  alopecia),  ovary (atrophy), liver (liver necrosis), kidney  (renal papillary necrosis and  tubular dilatation),  and gastrointestinal  tract  (delayed  gastric  emptying  and  diarrhoea).  Red  blood  cell  parameters  were decreased and white blood cells, primarily neutrophils, were increased. There were treatment-related increases in ALT, AST and bilirubin. These findings were observed at exposures well below clinically relevant exposures.

Based on the mode of action of the compound, Erlotinib, has the potential to be a teratogen. Data from reproductive  toxicology  tests  in  rats  and  rabbits  at  doses  near  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  and/or maternally toxic doses showed  reproductive (embryotoxicity in rats, embryo  resorption and foetotoxicity in rabbits) and developmental (decrease in pup growth and survival in rats) toxicity, but was not teratogenic and did not impair fertility. These findings were observed at clinically relevant exposures.

Erlotinib tested negative in conventional genotoxicity studies. Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.

A mild phototoxic skin reaction was observed in rats after UV irradiation.

## Efficacy

The efficacy and safety of Tarceva was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial  (BR.21),  in  731 patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive Tarceva 150 mg or  placebo  orally  once  daily.  Study  endpoints  included  overall  survival,  progression-free  survival (PFS),  response  rate,  duration  of  response,  time  to  deterioration  of  lung  cancer-related  symptoms (cough, dyspnoea and pain), and safety. The primary end-point was survival.

Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. About two-thirds of the patients were male and approximately one-third had a baseline ECOG performance status (PS) of  2,  and  9 %  had  a  baseline  ECOG  PS  of  3.  Ninety-three  percent  and  92 %  of  all  patients  in  the Tarceva and placebo groups, respectively, had received a prior platinum-containing regimen and 36 % and 37 % of all patients, respectively, had received a prior taxane therapy.

The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death in the Tarceva group relative to the placebo group was 0.73 (95 %  CI,  0.60  to  0.87)  (p = 0.001).  The  percent  of  patients  alive  at  12 months  was  31.2 %  and 21.5 %, for the Tarceva and placebo groups respectively. The median overall survival was 6.7 months in  the  Tarceva  group (95 % CI, 5.5 to 7.8 months) compared with 4.7 months in the placebo group (95 % CI, 4.1 to 6.3 months).

The effect on overall survival was explored across different patient subsets. The effect of Tarceva on overall survival was similar in patients with a baseline performance status (ECOG) of 2-3 (HR = 0.77, CI 0.6-1.0) or 0-1 (HR = 0.73, 0.6-0.9), male ((HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-0.9) or female patients (HR = 0.80, CI 0.6-1.1), patients &lt; 65  years of age (HR = 0.75,  CI 0.6-0.9) or older patients  (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0), patients with one prior regimen (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-1.0) or more than one prior regimens (HR = 0.75,  CI 0.6-1.0),  Caucasian  (HR = 0.79,  CI 0.6-1.0)  or  Asian  patients  (HR = 0.61,  0.4-1.0), patients  with  adenocarcinoma  (HR = 0.71,  CI 0.6-0.9)  or  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (HR = 0.67, CI 0.5-0.9),  but  not  in  patients  with  other  histologies  (HR  1.04,  CI 0.7-1.5),  patients  with  stage  IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.92, CI 0.7-1.2) or &lt; stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.65, 0.5-0.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients who  never  smoked  had  a  much  greater  benefit  from  erlotinib (survival  HR = 0.42, CI 0.28-0.64) compared with current or ex-smokers (HR = 0.87, CI 0.71-1.05).

In the 45 % of patients with known EGFR-expression status, the hazard ratio was 0.68 (CI 0.49-0.94) for  patients  with  EGFR-positive  tumours  and  0.93  (CI 0.63-1.36)  for  patients  with  EGFR-negative tumours (defined by IHC using EGFR pharmDx kit and defining EGFR-negative as less than 10% tumour cells staining). In the remaining 55 % of patients with unknown EGFR-expression status, the hazard ratio was 0.77 (CI 0.61-0.98).

The median PFS was 9.7 weeks in the Tarceva group (95 % CI, 8.4 to 12.4 weeks) compared with 8.0 weeks in the placebo group (95 % CI, 7.9 to 8.1 weeks).

The objective response rate by RECIST in the Tarceva group was 8.9 % (95 % CI, 6.4 to 12.0 %). The first 330 patients were centrally assessed (response rate 6.2 %); 401 patients were investigatorassessed (response rate 11.2 %). The median duration of response was 34.3 weeks, ranging from 9.7 to 57.6+ weeks.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  complete  response,  partial  response  or stable disease was 44.0 % and 27.5 %, respectively, for the Tarceva and placebo groups (p = 0.004). A survival  benefit  of  Tarceva  was  also  observed  in  patients  who  did  not  achieve  an  objective  tumour response (by RECIST). This was evidenced by a hazard ratio for death of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99) among patients whose best response was stable disease or progressive disease.

Tarceva  resulted  in  symptom  benefits  by  significantly  prolonging  time  to  deterioration  in  cough dyspnoea and pain, versus placebo.

## Safety

Rash (75 %) and diarrhoea (54 %) were the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Most were Grade 1/2 in severity and manageable without intervention. Grade 3/4 rash and diarrhoea occurred  in  9 %  and  6 %,  respectively  in  Tarceva-treated  patients  and  each  resulted  in  study discontinuation in 1 % of patients. Dose reduction for rash and diarrhoea was needed in 6 and 1 % of patients, respectively. In study BR.21, the median time to onset of rash was 8 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhoea was 12 days.

No clear association has been found between erlotinib administration and cardiac disorders, bleeding disorders, laboratory abnormalities and infections. Dry eyes were more frequent in erlotinib-exposed patients (4%) as opposed to placebo-exposed patients (1%).

In conclusion, adverse events associated with erlotinib treatment are reasonably well defined, and the most  common  adverse  events,  i.e.  gastrointestinal  disturbances  and  skin  rash,  are  mostly  mild  and reversible upon dose reductions or drug withdrawal.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Based on the results submitted in this application, it can be concluded that erlotinib monotherapy has demonstrated  antitumour  activity  and  a  significant  overall  survival  benefit  when  compared  with placebo  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  after  failure  of  at  least  one  prior chemotherapy regimen. These efficacy results represent a significant clinical effect in the second or third  line  treatment  of  an  advanced  stage  of  a  disease.  There  are  two  common  adverse  events connected to erlotinib treatment, rash and diarrhoea but they were generally manageable and relatively few were characterised as severe or life-threatening. The generally favourable safety profile is also reflected by the small number of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.

The  CHMP  consulted  the  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  for  oncology  to  provide  guidance  on whether it is possible to quantify the benefit of erlotinib in treatment of  patients with EGFR negative tumours,  and  to  what  extent  can  the  benefit  in  this  patient  population  be  considered  clinically meaningful.  The SAG commented that a compound targeting EGFR signalling would generally be expected to be less active, or inactive, in EGFR-negative tumours, compared to EGFR-positive ones. The  BR.21  study  included  a  heterogeneous  population  of  both  patients  with  EGFR-negative  and EGFR-positive  tumours,  and  varying  treatment  effects  would  be  expected  based  on  theoretical grounds. To test this hypothesis, unplanned subgroup analyses were conducted. The BR.21 study and the  documentation  presented  failed  to  provide  any  formal  or  exploratory  evidence  suggesting  a relevant treatment effect in EGFR-negative patients. Unfortunately, BR.21 was not powered to test for an interaction between treatment and EGFR expression, or to detect small treatment effects in EGFRnegative patients. Furthermore, the collection of material to allow determination of EGFR-expression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

status  and  other  markers  was  not  systematic,  and  this  further  weakened  the  possibility  to  study different  treatment  effects  across  subgroups.  These  are  considered  pitfalls  of  the  study,  given  the theoretic  background.  The  SAG  acknowledged  that  other  factors,  independent  from  EGFR  status overexpression,  might  also  be  associated  with  response  to  erlotinib.  It  is  also  acknowledged  that EGFR  status  may  be  subject  to  measurement  error  (false-positive  and  false-negative  results,  nonvalidated  methods,  arbitrary  cut-off  values  for  defining  positive  patients,  etc.),  and  this  adds  to  the difficulty of studying the association between EGFR-expression and response to erlotinib. Further data and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved are needed in order to establish a potential benefit of erlotinib in EGFR-negative patients.

The  SAG  concluded  that  it  is  not  possible  to  quantify  the  benefit  (if  any)  of  erlotinib  in  EGFRnegative patients, and there are no data or rationale to support the existence of a clinically meaningful effect in this subgroup. With respect to EGFR-status, a clinically relevant effect of erlotinib has only been demonstrated in EGFR-positive patients. EGFR-status should be known and taken into account together with all factors associated with response to treatment in order to allow a rational choice of treatment. There is no pharmacological rationale for using erlotinib in EGFR-negative patients.

Concerning exploratory evidence from BR.21, the observed response rate in this subgroup was low (3%), and there were no data to suggest an effect on overall survival or other meaningful endpoints in these  patients.  Whether  erlotinib  is  associated  with  any  clinically  meaningful  benefit  in  EGFRnegative  patients  is  unknown,  although  the  observed  results  and  pharmacological  rationale  do  not support this hypothesis. EGFR expression testing can be used in clinical practice. There is a need to improve on the methods that will make the determination more reliable but this is not considered to be a major hurdle by the SAG. Such approach has become the standard for trastuzumab treatment, which is only given to patients who are so-called 3+ in the Dako test or 2+ and 3+ in the FISH for Her2neu.

Having considered the advice from the SAG and the data and justifications presented by the applicant, the CHMP acknowledged that the discussion about the relation of EGFR receptor status/mutations and efficacy is ongoing, and that further data are needed to resolve the issue conclusively. There remains considerable uncertainty about the precise role of EGFR-expression and other independent factors and treatment  effect  (e.g.,  smoking  history,  gender,  performance  status,  etc.).  In  view  of  the  overall positive  results  of  the  trial  and  the  need  to  take  into  account  all  positive  and  negative  predictive factors, the CHMP supported a recommendation for a therapeutic indication, but with mentioning that no survival benefit or other clinically relevant effect of erlotinib has been observed in EGFR-negative patients  (defined  by  IHC  using  EGFR  pharmDx  kit  and  defining  EGFR-negative  as  less  than  10% tumour  cells  staining),  and  that  prescribing  physicians  should  refer  to  the  results  of  the  subgroup analysis in section 5.1 for deciding what patients should receive treatment with Tarceva.

Tarceva treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the benefit/risk  ratio  of  Tarceva  indicated  for:  'the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. When prescribing  Tarceva,  factors  associated  with  prolonged  survival  should  be  taken  into  account.  No survival benefit or other clinically relevant effects of the treatment have been demonstrated in patients with  EGFR  negative  tumours  (see  section  5.1)'  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation.
