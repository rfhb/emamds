| WS/2358   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 'urinary retention' and 'dysuria' to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency rare and to amend a warning regarding urinary retention ; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and bring it in line with the latest QRD template. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 16/02/2023 |     | SmPC and PL | Based on the cumulative review of cases of Dysuria and Urinary retention reported in the post-marketing setting, and observed in clinical trial data, a causal association between Elebrato Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta and the adverse effects \"Dysuria\" and \"Urinary retention\" is considered a possibility. Therefore, these events are added as new undesirable effects under section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency \"rare\". As cases of acute urinary retention have been observed in a post-marketing setting, a warning regarding the prescription of this product to patients with urinary retention or risk factors of urinary retention was also added. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. |

Dysgeusia was not previously identified as an ADR for combination inhaled fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol trifenatate (FF/UMEC/VI) in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) clinical trial safety database but mainly supported by reference to the safety profile FF/UMEC/VI from asthma studies, literature case reports and review of cases of dysgeusia observed for the mono (UMEC) and dual constituents (UMEC/VI) of FF/UMEC/VI, both authorised for use in COPD. Frequency of dysgeusia was calculated based on the incidence in the triple therapy COPD clinical trials (CTT116855, CTT116853, 200812). Furthermore, based on assessment of study CTT116855 and postmarketing safety data for FF/UMEC/VI, intraocular pressure increased with frequency rare and vision blurred, glaucoma and eye pain with frequency uncommon were identified as new ADRS.

Additionally cross reference to the effects on symptoms is added. This is based on the results of study CTT116855 and study 200812 and the population PK report 208059. As a consequence, the indication section (4.1), Undesirable effects section (4.8), Pharmacodynamic Properties section (5.1), Pharmacokinetic properties section (5.2) and Preclinical Safety data section (5.3) of the SmPC have been updated. The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. A minor amendment in annex II is also introduced to bring it in line with the QRD template. Additionally, minor changes have been introduced to the RMP to bring it in line with the new template (revision 2).
