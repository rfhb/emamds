## 1. Introduction

On 7th February 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric (study 20101221) for romiplostim (Nplate), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of an agreed paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-000653-PIP0109-M05) for Nplate, approved by the EMA on 11th August 2017 (Decision P/0233/2017).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously once a week.

On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

On 9th November 2017, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on an extension of indication application for Nplate (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G) to include paediatric chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients: 1 year of age and older. At the time (5 December 2016) of the submission of this variation application, the MAH submitted 3 completed studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were placebo controlled, and study 20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing studies (studies 20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy studies).

The MAH stated that study 20101221 - 'A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)' is a stand alone study, and is also part of a clinical development program.

The hereby submitted study 20101221 is also part of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for romiplostim (Nplate) targeted to grant indications for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; ITP) in paediatric patients who are refractory or intolerant to other treatments (e.g., glucocorticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy) (EMA Decision number P/0233/2017; PIP number EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). The following table summarizes all clinical studies included in the PIP number EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05:

* Data obtained from: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu

The outcome date of the compliance report (EMEA-C-000653-PIP01-09-M05) on the agreed PIP was 27th March 2020.

## Assessor's comments:

Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously once a week.

On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). At the time (5 December 2016) of the submission of the variation application EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G to grant the extension of indication to include paediatric population (1 year of age and older) for Nplate, the MAH submitted 3 completed studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were placebo controlled, and study 20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing studies (studies 20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy studies).

Studies 20080279, 20090340 and 20101221 are measures of the agreed European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Nplate (P/0233/2017; EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). Please, take into account that the outcome date of the compliance report (EMEA-C-000653-PIP01-09-M05) on the agreed PIP was 27th March 2020.

Study 20101221 agrees with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, as regards of its submission to the competent authority within six months of completion. Study 20090340 has been submitted to the EMA in procedure EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G.

Furthermore, the MAH has not provided information regarding the need for submitting a variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing studies not yet completed at the time of granting the paediatric indication). In order to increase the availability of information on the use of romiplostim in the paediatric ITP population (approx. prevalence of 7.2 cases per 100,000 per year), and considering that the already completed studies 20090340 and 20101221 are also part of an agreed PIP for Nplate, the MAH is requested to apply for a variation to update the summary of product characteristics by reflecting the main results of these studies as soon as possible (please, see Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Romiplostim (Nplate) is currently authorised in the European Union to be used in patients one year of age and older as 125 micrograms, 250 micrograms and 500 micrograms powder for solution for injection.

Study 20101221 was performed by administering romiplostim subcutaneously once per week as the authorized formulation developed for use in paediatric population (please, see Assessment Report for Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G).

Nplate 125 micrograms powder for solution for injection is supplied for single use in a 3 mL glass vial containing 230 micrograms of romiplostim, providing 125 micrograms of deliverable romiplostim.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The buffer formulation used for manufacture of the 125 micrograms presentation is the same as that used for Nplate 250 micrograms and 500 micrograms.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Romiplostim (Nplate) is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular transcriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production.

Nplate 125 µg powder for solution for injection is currently approved by the European Commission for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously once a week.

Nplate 250 μ g and 500 μ g powder for solution for injection are indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). The initial dose of romiplostim is 1 microgram/kg based on actual body weight.

In children and adults, the initial dose of romiplostim is 1 microgram/kg based on actual body weight. In children, the volume of romiplostim to administer is calculated based on body weight, dose required, and concentration of product. The once weekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 microgram /kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥50 x 10 ^9/L. Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count (≥50 x 10^9/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should be assessed monthly thereafter. A maximum once weekly dose of 10 micrograms/kg should not be exceeded.

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study 20101221: A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Clinical study 20101221 - 'A Single Arm, Open-label, Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study of Romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Pediatric Subjects With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)'

## Description

Study 20101221 was a phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study to describe the percentage of time paediatric subjects with ITP had a platelet response while receiving romiplostim. A platelet response was defined as having a platelet count of ≥50 x 1 0^9L in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks. This study also includes a protocol supplement to implement bone marrow evaluations. Romiplostim was administered to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies.

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary

- To describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response in the first 6 months from the start of treatment with romiplostim.
- To evaluate the incidence of changes in bone marrow findings at year 1 or year 2 after initial exposure to romiplostim.

## Secondary

- To describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response over the study duration.
- To describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have an increase in platelet count ≥ 20 x 10^9/L above baseline over study duration.
- To describe the use of rescue ITP medications.
- To describe the incidence of antibody formation.
- To describe the safety of romiplostim as a long-term treatment in paediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.
- To evaluate the incidence of increased reticulin as evidenced by silver staining at year 1 or year 2, after initial exposure to romiplostim.

## Exploratory

- To describe the incidence of sustained platelet response.
- To describe the incidence of splenectomy.
- To describe the subject incidence of romiplostim self-administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

This phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study was designed to evaluate the percentage of time paediatric subjects with ITP had a response, defined as a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks, while receiving romiplostim. This study also includes a protocol supplement to implement bone marrow evaluations. Romiplostim was administered to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies.

The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, up to 3-year treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit, and an end-of-study (EOS) visit (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Study Design and Treatment Schema - Main Protocol

<!-- image -->

Romiplostim was administered weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Dose adjustment rules were based on individual platelet counts. The maximum permitted dose of romiplostim was 10 micrograms/kg.

Subjects who reduced their romiplostim dose, no longer required ITP medications (concomitant or rescue), or had an onset of a sustained platelet response (defined as consecutive platelet counts of ≥50 x 10^9/L) were monitored for at least 6 months begi nning with the first platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L.

Subjects whose platelet count remained ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of any medications for ITP for at least 6 months were followed every 12 weeks for the duration of the 36-month treatment period. If during the 36-month treatment period a subject's platelet count subsequently fell below 50 x 10^9/L, treatment with romiplostim at the initial starting dose could be resumed per the protocol.

Subjects who had a platelet count of ≤20 x 10^9/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the maximum romiplostim dose of 10 micrograms/kg discontinued romiplostim and were considered non-responders.

A subset of at least 60 subjects was enrolled sequentially into the following cohorts of protocol supplement for the EU, Switzerland, and Turkey:

- bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at baseline and year 1
- bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at baseline and year 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Once the first cohort completed enrolment, the second cohort began enrolling. All subjects in the 2 cohorts were to receive romiplostim for 3 years, unless withdrawn from the study early. Subjects completed an EOT visit at the conclusion of their treatment period and returned for an EOS visit (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Study Design and Treatment Schema - Bone Marrow Biopsy Evaluation

<!-- image -->

A baseline bone marrow biopsy and aspirate were required to determine eligibility; this could either have been a bone marrow biopsy within 1 year before planned first dose of romiplostim (with available bone marrow tissue block or a minimum of 5 unstained, evaluable histological slides to send to a central laboratory) or a pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy and aspirate within 3 weeks before planned first dose of romiplostim. A further bone marrow biopsy and aspirate was required at year 1 (day 365) or year 2 (day 720) (+ 4-week window), depending on cohort in which the subject was enrolled. The study schemas are provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2 above.

## Study population /Sample size

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility

Eligible paediatric subjects diagnosed with ITP for at least 6 months according to the American Society of Haematology guidelines who had thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of ≤30 x 10^9/L) or bleeding that was uncontrolled with conventional therapy within 4 weeks of enrolment.

Subjects had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be included into the bone marrow biopsy analysis:

- Subject must have agreed to a scheduled bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at year 1 or year 2 after romiplostim treatment and any unscheduled biopsies if clinically indicated.
- Subjects must have had a reticulin grade of 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to the modified Bauermeister grading scale, as assessed by central laboratory from a bone marrow biopsy performed within 1 year before planned first dose of romiplostim or consent to a pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy and aspirate before planned first dose of romiplostim.

Number of Subjects Planned

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 20101221 was planned to include approximately 200 subjects. Of these, at least 30 subjects were to be enrolled into each of the 2 cohorts identified by bone marrow biopsy time points (year 1 or year 2).

## Treatments

Dosage, treatment regimen, route of administration

This was a single-arm, open-label study, where romiplostim was administered weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection at the starting dose of 1.0 micrograms/kg. Dose adjustment rules were based on individual platelet counts.

Intra-individual, weekly dose adjustment by 1 microgram/kg:

- platelets &lt;50 x 10^9/L: increase;
- platelets 50 to 200 x 10^9/L: no change;
- platelets 200 to &lt;400 x10^9/L for two consecutive weeks: reduce;
- platelets &gt;/=400 x 10^9/L: withhold and reduce on next dosing when platelets &lt;200 x 10^9/L.

The maximum permitted dose of romiplostim was 10 micrograms/kg.

## Duration of Treatment

The maximum study duration (for a subject completing the study) was approximately 3 years and 2 months: a 4-week screening period, up to 36-month treatment period, an EOT visit, and an EOS visit.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary

- The percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L starting from week 2 in the first 6 months of the treatment period without rescue medication use within the past 4 weeks.
- Evaluation of bone marrow changes after year 1 and year 2 for the following:
- o incidence of collagen as evidenced by trichrome staining (using the modified Bauermeister grading scale) after romiplostim exposure,
- o incidence of bone marrow reticulin increases in severity ≥2 grades (ie, grade 0 to 2-4, 1 to 3-4, 2 to 4), compared to baseline, or an increase to grade 3 or grade 4 as evidenced by reticulin silver staining using the modified Bauermeister grading scale after romiplostim exposure,
- o incidence of bone marrow abnormalities (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, monosomy 7) as evidenced by cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),

## Secondary

- The percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L starting from week 2 until the end of the treatment period without rescue medication use within the past 4 weeks.
- The percentage of time with an increase in platelet count ≥20 x 10^9/L above baseline starting from week 2 until the end of the treatment period without rescue medication use in the past 4 weeks.
- The subject incidence of rescue ITP medications used.

- The incidence of adverse events, including clinically significant changes in laboratory values.
- The incidence of increased reticulin as evidenced by silver staining at year 1 or year 2, after exposure to romiplostim.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exploratory

- The subject incidence with a sustained platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L for 6 months or greater without the use of any ITP medications (concomitant, rescue, or romiplostim).
- The incidence of splenectomy during the treatment period for subjects entering the study presplenectomy.
- The subject incidence of romiplostim self-administration. It was eligible any subject that received its first 8 doses at the clinic and achieved a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L without romiplostim dose adjustments for 4 consecutive weeks.

## Statistical Methods

No formal hypothesis was tested. Summary statistics was provided for the primary and secondary endpoints. Categorical data were presented in the form of number and percentage. Continuous data were provided with the descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, Q1 [25th percentile], Q3 [75th percentile], minimum, and maximum).

The analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints was based on the set of subjects receiving at least 1 dose of romiplostim.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

At the time of this final analysis (database snapshot date 23 October 2019), all 203 subjects (100%) enrolled in the study across 3 age groups received at least 1 dose of romiplostim and were included in the Full Analysis Set (see Table 1). Of these, 108 subjects (53.2%) completed romiplostim and 95 subjects (46.8%) discontinued romiplostim. The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy (43 subjects [21.2%]).

A total of 109 subjects (53.7%) completed the study; 94 subjects (46.3%) discontinued the study (see Table 1). The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was protocol-specified criteria (67 subjects [33.0%]).

## Baseline data

The distribution of boys (100 subjects; 49.3%) and girls (103 subjects; 50.7%) was similar in the Full Analysis Set.

Most patients (164 subjects; 80.8%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 9.5 (4.4) years overall. Subjects were stratified into 1 of the 3 age groups as below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ≥1 to &lt;6 years (49 subjects [24.1%])
- ≥6 to &lt;12 years (81 subjects [39.9%])
- ≥12 to &lt;18 years (73 subjects [36.0%])

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between subjects enrolled in cohort 1 and cohort 2 and between subjects enrolled in the protocol supplement and those enrolled in the main protocol. Baseline Bone Marrow characteristics of subjects in the protocol supplement are showed below (see Table 3).

## Secondary Endpoints

Percentage of time with a platelet response over the study duration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platele t response (platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L) without rescue medication use within the past 4 weeks for the overall treatment period (week 2 to EOT) was 60.82% (35.65) and 78.21%, respectively. The mean (SD) percentage of time with a platelet response was si milar for ≥1 to &lt;6 years (57.21% [36.46]) and ≥6 to &lt;12 years (55.63% [38.31]) age groups, and was higher in the ≥12 to &lt;18 years (68.99% [30.68]) age group. Overall, the number of subjects who had at least 1 platelet response from week 2 to EOS was 179 su bjects (88.2%) and was similar in ≥1 to &lt;6 years (42 of 49 subjects [85.7%]) and ≥6 to &lt;12 years (68 of 81 subjects [84.0%]) age groups, and was higher in ≥12 to &lt;18 years (69 of 73 subjects [94.5%]) age group. Analysis of platelet response rate over time showed that the overall percentage of subjects with a platelet response at week 2 was 23.2%. The total response rate increased over time on study overall and across all age groups. Increase in platelet count of ≥20 x 10^9/L above baseline over the study du ration The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥20 x 10^9/L from baseline without rescue medication use for ITP in the past 4 weeks was 64.16% (33.82) and 80.13%, respectively. The mean (SD) percentage of time was similar in ≥1 to &lt;6 years (61.67% [35.54]) and ≥6 to &lt;12 years (59.92% [36.24]) age groups, and was higher in ≥12 to &lt;18 years (70.55% [29.03]) age group. Use of rescue ITP medications Sixty subjects (29.6%) overall received rescue medication during the treatment period (week 2 to EOT). The incidence of subjects using rescue medications was higher in ≥1 to &lt;6 years (23 of 49 subjects [46.9%]) age group than in ≥6 to &lt;12 years (23 of 81 subjects [28.4%]) and ≥12 to &lt;18 years (14 of 73 subjects [19.2%]) age groups. The most frequently used rescue medication by category was corticosteroids (19.2%) followed by Ig (17.2%). The incidence of subjects using rescue medication during the sequential 12-week periods (weeks 1 to 12, weeks &gt;12 to 24, weeks &gt;24 to 36) decreased over time in all 3 age groups. Anti-romiplostim Antibody Assays Subjects were tested for the presence (at baseline) or development (postbaseline) of romiplostim (including TPO mimetic peptide, the peptide component of romiplostim) and TPO antibodies. Seventeen subjects (8.4%) had a positive binding non-neutralizing antibody response against romiplostim while on study. Of these, 2 subjects had positive binding antibody status at or before baseline (pre-existing). Fifteen subjects (7.7%) developed post-baseline binding antibodies to romiplostim with a negative or no result at baseline. Of these, 7 had a transient binding antibody response with a negative result at the subjects' last time point tested within the study period. Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive result for neutralizing antibody response against romiplostim while on study. None of these subjects were positive for neutralizing antibodies at or before baseline; all subjects developed neutralizing antibodies post-baseline. Of these, 4 had a transient neutralizing antibody response with a negative result at the subjects' last time point tested within the study period. Seven subjects (3.4%) had a positive binding, non-neutralizing antibody response against TPO while on study. Of these, 2 subjects had positive binding antibody status at or before baseline (pre-existing). Five subjects (2.6%) developed post-baseline binding non-neutralizing antibody response with a negative or no result at baseline. Of these 5 subjects, 4 had transient binding antibody response with a negative result at the subjects' last time point tested within the study period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One subject (0.5%) had a postbaseline positive result for neutralizing antibody response against TPO (negative for antiromiplostim antibodies) while on study with negative or no result at baseline. The subject showed a transient antibody response with a negative result at the subject's last time point tested within the study period. Subjects who developed increased reticulin Of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy, 5 of 27 subjects (18.5%) in cohort 1 (95% exact binomial CI: 6.3, 38.1) and 17 of 36 subjects (47.2%) in cohort 2 (95% exact binomial CI: 30.4, 64.5) developed increased reticulin (any increase from baseline in the modified Bauermeister grade). Subjects without an evaluable baseline result were assumed to have a baseline modified Bauermeister score of 0. Exploratory Endpoints Sustained platelet response El even subjects (5.4%) had a sustained platelet response (consecutive platelet counts of ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of any ITP medications for at least 24 weeks). The incidence of sustained platelet response was 10.2% (5 of 49 subjects) for ≥1 to &lt;6 years, 2.5% (2 of 81 subjects) for ≥6 to &lt;12 years, and 5.5% (4 of 73 subjects) for ≥12 to &lt;18 years age groups. Overall, the mean (SD) time to onset of sustained platelet response was 57.1 (36.0) weeks. Incidence of splenectomy A total of 193 subjects entered the study as non-splenectomized. Three of 193 subjects (1.6%) underwent splenectomy during the study. The incidence of splenectomy during the study was 0% (0 of 47 subjects) for ≥1 to &lt;6 years, 2.6% (2 of 77 subjects) for ≥6 to &lt;12 years, and 1.4% (1 of 69 subjects) for ≥12 to &lt;18 years age groups.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Nplate is currently approved by the European Commission (EC) for chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) as powder for solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously once a week.

On 4th February 2009, Nplate was firstly approved by the EC for the treatment of adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). On 9th November 2017, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on an extension of indication for Nplate (EMEA/H/C/000942/II/0060/G) to include paediatric population (1 year of age and older). At the time (5 December 2016) of the submission of that variation application, the MAH submitted 3 completed studies (studies 20060195 and 20080279, which were placebo controlled, and study 20030213, which was a long-term safety and efficacy study) and 2 ongoing studies (studies 20090340 and 20101221, which are both long term safety and efficacy studies).

The hereby submitted study (20101221) is also part of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for Nplate (P/0233/2017; EMEA-000653-PIP01-09-M05). Agreed PIP includes a total of three clinical studies: 20080279, 20090340 and 20101221.

Study 20101221 was a phase 3b, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study where romiplostim was administered weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection to thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies. Dose adjustment rules were based on individual platelet counts, being 10 micrograms/kg the maximum permitted dose of romiplostim. The study consisted of a 4-week screening period, up to 3-year treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit, and an endof-study (EOS) visit. The primary objectives of study 20101221 were to describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response in the first 6 months from the start of treatment with romiplostim as well as evaluating the incidence of changes in bone marrow findings at year 1 or year 2 after initial exposure to romiplostim. A platelet response was defined as having a platelet count of ≥50 x 10^9/L in the absence of ITP rescue medications in the past 4 weeks. Secondary objectives were to describe the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet response over the study duration, the percentage of time that paediatric subjects with ITP have an increase in platel et count ≥20 x 10^9/L above baseline over study duration, the use of rescue ITP medications, the incidence of antibody formation, the safety of romiplostim as a long-term treatment in paediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP and to evaluate the incidence of increased reticulin as evidenced by silver staining at year 1 or year 2, after initial exposure to romiplostim. In addition, it was proposed as exploratory objectives to describe the incidence of sustained platelet response, the incidence of splenectomy and the subject incidence of romiplostim self-administration.

A total of 203 subjects were enrolled in the study across 3 age groups (≥1 to &lt;6 years: 49 subjects [24.1%]; ≥6 to &lt;12 years: 81 subjects [39.9%]; ≥12 to &lt;18 years: 73 subjects [36.0%]). F or evaluating the incidence of changes in bone marrow, a total of 79 subjects were enrolled sequentially into the protocol supplement for the EU, Switzerland, and Turkey. Of these, 30 subjects were in cohort

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 (bone marrow samples [biopsy and aspirate] taken at baseline and year 1) and 49 subjects were in cohort 2 (bone marrow samples [biopsy and aspirate] taken at baseline and year 2). With respect to the primary endpoints, the mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet response within the first 6 months of initiation of romiplostim was 50.57% (37.01) and 50.0%, respectively. The median percentage of time with a platelet response was 50.0% for ≥1 to &lt;6 age group, 33.33% for ≥6 to &lt;12 age group, and 66.67% for ≥12 to &lt;18 years age group. When t he subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsy (cohort 1: 27/30 subjects [90.0%] and cohort 2: 36/49 subjects [73.5%]) were evaluate, no subjects developed collagen (a grade of 4 on the modified Bauermeister grading scale), 1/27 subjects (3.7%) in cohort 1 developed an increased modified Bauermeister grade by ≥2 severity grades (from grade 0 baseline value to grade 2 post -baseline value) and no subjects developed a bone marrow abnormality. Moreover, 5/27 subjects (18.5%) in cohort 1 (95% exact binomial CI: 6.3, 38.1) and 17/36 subjects (47.2%) in cohort 2 (95% exact binomial CI: 30.4, 64.5) developed increased reticulin (any increase from baseline in the modified Bauermeister grade). Regarding the safety results, a total of 193 subjects (95.1%) overall had at least 1 treatmentemergent adverse event. Adverse events reported for ≥20% of subjects were epistaxis (39.4%), headache (38.4%), nasopharyngitis (36.9%), pyrexia (32.0%), cough (25.6%), petechiae (23.6%), vomiting (23.2%), and hematoma (20.7%). Fifteen subjects (7.4%) had adverse events leading to withdrawal of romiplostim. Serious adverse events were reported for 60 subjects (29.6%). No fatal adverse events were reported in the study. The most frequently reported adverse events of interest were pulmonary disorders (Amgen MedDRA query) (82.8%), events from the haemorrhages standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) (69.5%), and events from the hypersensitivity/ angioedema/ anaphylactic reactions/ anaphylactic-anaphylactoid shock conditions SMQs (34.0%). Fifteen subjects (7.7%) developed postbaseline binding antibodies to romiplostim with a negative or no result at baseline. Five subjects (2.6%) developed postbaseline binding non-neutralizing antibody response against TPO with a negative or no result at baseline. Study 20101221 agrees with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, as regards of its submission to the competent authority within six months of completion. Study 20090340 has been submitted as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G . In summary, study 20101221 has been adequately designed and completed in accordance (EMEA-C000653-PIP01-09-M05) to the agreed PIP. Regarding the submitted data on the primary endpoints, although results of percentage of time with a platelet response within the first 6 months of initiation of treatment were generally consistent with the known efficacy profile of romiplostim, study 20101221 appears to be of particular interest since it provides information regarding long-term bone marrow effects in paediatric ITP subjects which has not been yet included in the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC). In view of the safety results, the overall safety profile of the paediatric subjects who received romiplostim in study 20101221 was similar to the known safety profile of romiplostim. The main limitation of the submitted study is the limited sample size, which makes challenging drawing any conclusion for the overall and, in particular, for the different age cohorts. Due to the difficulties to recruit paediatric ITP subjects (approx. prevalence 7.2 cases per 100,000 per year), this limitation is not posed as an objection. In this regard, it should be taken into account that Nplate was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/05/283 from 27 May 2005 to February 2019 (at the end of the 10-year period of market exclusivity) in the following indication: Treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

In order to increase the availability of information on the use of romiplostim in the paediatric population suffering from this rare condition (ITP), the SmPC should be updated to also reflect the main results of the completed study 20101221.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Study 20101221 has been submitted within six months of its completion and is part of the PIP EMEA000653-PIP01-09-M05 (P/0233/2017). The study has been adequately designed and completed in accordance (EMEA-C-000653-PIP01-09-M05) to the agreed PIP. On the light of the obtained results, it is considered of interest to conduct a formal benefit/risk evaluation in order to increase the availability of information on the use of romiplostim in the paediatric ITP population.

Study 20090340 (also included in the agreed PIP) has been submitted as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/942/II/0060/G to the EMA.
