## 1  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 2.1 Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Merck  Sharp  &amp;  Dohme  Ltd.  submitted  on  3  September  2007  an  application  for Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  TESAVEL,  through  the centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The legal basis for this application refers to Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, for the authorised medicinal product Januvia (EU/1/07/383/001-018).

## Scientific Advice:

The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

## Licensing status:

The initial product, Januvia, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 21 March 2007.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP and the evaluation teams were:

Rapporteur: Pieter de Graeff Co-Rapporteur: Harald Enzmann

## 2.2 Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- The application was received by the EMEA on 3 September 2007.
- The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 18 October 2007. The Co-Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 18 October 2007.
- The procedure started on 16 September 2007.
- During  the  meeting  on  12-15  November  2007,  the  CHMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  to  TESAVEL  on  15  November  2007.  The  applicant provided the letter of undertaking on the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation on 14 November 2007.
- The CHMP opinions were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 10 January 2008.

## 2  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Januvia  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing access to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for TESAVEL consists only of Module 1 information.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the TESAVEL medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Januvia. Information on the scientific discussions can be  found  in  the  Januvia  CHMP  assessment  report  and  in  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report (EPAR).

The approved indication is:

'For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated:

- to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- to  improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.
- to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, TESAVEL is indicated:

- in combination with the PPAR γ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPAR γ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.'

The  dose  is  100 mg  sitagliptin  once  daily.  The  dosage  of  metformin  or  PPAR γ agonist  should  be maintained,  and  TESAVEL  administered  concomitantly.  When  TESAVEL  is  used  in  combination with  a  sulphonylurea,  a  lower  dose  of  the  sulphonylurea  may  be  considered  to  reduce  the  risk  of hypoglycaemia.

The  active  substance  of  TESAVEL  is  sitagliptin  phosphate  monohydrate,  a  dipeptidyl  peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the active (intact) form of the incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent inhibitory peptide (GIP), producing an elevation of incretin concentrations that lead to enhancement of glucosedependent insulin secretion and a reduction in glucagon release.

The benefit of TESAVEL is a demonstrated reduction in baseline HbA1c at 24 weeks in combination with  metformin,  or  a  PPAR γ agonist,  or  a  sulphonylurea,  or  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin,  in patients who have not responded to metformin alone, or a maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea, or a combination sulphonylurea and metformin, or a PPAR γ agonist. It has also shown a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) . The most common side effect when taking TESAVEL with metformin is  nausea.  When taking TESAVEL with pioglitazone, they are low blood sugar, flatulence and foot swelling.  The  most  common  side  effect  when  taking  TESAVEL  with  a  sulfonylurea is  low  blood sugar. When taking TESAVEL with metformin and a sulfonylurea the most common side effects are low blood sugar and constipation. When taking TESAVEL alone, the most common side effects are low  blood  sugar,  headache,  stuffy  or  runny  nose  and  sore  throat.  Additional  adverse  experiences reported  regardless  of  causal  relationship  to  medication  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients treated with TESAVEL included osteoarthritis and pain in extremity.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the quality data in support of the  TESAVEL application are identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Januvia  dossier  which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Januvia  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support of the TESAVEL application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Januvia dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the clinical data in support of the TESAVEL application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Januvia dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit  balance  of  TESAVEL  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated:

- to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- to  improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.
- to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, TESAVEL is indicated:

- in combination with the PPAR γ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPAR γ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
