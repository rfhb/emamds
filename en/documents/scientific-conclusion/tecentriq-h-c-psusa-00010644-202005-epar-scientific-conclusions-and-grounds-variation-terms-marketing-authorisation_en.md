## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for atezolizumab, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Uveitis

Taking  into  account  the  available  data  on  uveitis  from  clinical  trials,  the  literature  and  spontaneous reports, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, which is within the immune-related events already known  for  the  class,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  atezolizumab  when  used  in monotherapy and uveitis is established.

## Psoriasis

A cumulative search of the company global safety database up to the DLP of this PSUR found 31 reports of psoriasis-related events in the clinical  database and 55 case-reports in the safety database, which resulted from atezolizumab's use both in monotherapy and combination regimens. Despite in some cases the events could have been explained by the patient's clinical history, for a number of cases, n o alternative explanation could be found and, in light of the mechanistic plausibility of the events and the fact that a number of products from the class of the immune checkpoint inhibitors already have psoriasis listed in their PIs, the PRAC considers the causal relationship is established.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for atezolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product containing atezolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
