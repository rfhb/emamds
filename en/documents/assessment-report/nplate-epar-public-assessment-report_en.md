## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Immune  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterized  by  platelet destruction caused by antiplatelet auto-antibodies. The estimated incidence is 100 cases per 1 million people per year, and about half of these cases occur in children. 72 percent of patients over 10 years old are women, and 70 percent of these women are less than 40 years old. ITP is classified as acute (of six month or less in duration) or chronic. In addition it can be primary or secondary to an underlying disorder.

The  diagnosis  of  ITP  can  be  difficult  because  of  the  variety  of  presentations  and  lack  of  specific criteria. The only consistent abnormalities are microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, characterized by red-cell  fragmentation,  and  thrombocytopenia,  features  that  can  also  occur  in  other  conditions. Neurologic  and  renal  abnormalities  and  fever  can  also  occur.  The  onset  of  the  disease  is  often insidious because history and physical examination are normal except for symptoms that accompany platelet disorders (purpura, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding are common). In general ITP is defined by a low platelet count, normal bone marrow, and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia.

Currently  available  treatments  for  chronic  ITP  act  by  decreasing  platelet  destruction  including corticosterosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), intravenous ant-Rh o (D) or suppressing the production of antiplatelet antibodies. Relapse is common when these agents are discontinued. Surgical splenectomy is generally considered second-line therapy for adults with ITP after the use of steroids and usually results  in  a  remission.  A  small  percentage of  patients  is  severely  affected  and  does  not respond  to  treatment.  Patients  who  fail  to  maintain  a  platelet  count  above  30  x  10 9 /L after  6  to  12 months of standard therapy are often defined as refractory to therapy.

The applicant submitted a full application under Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. This medicinal product was granted an orphan designation on 27 May 2005 (EU/3/05/283). The claimed indication for romiplostim is:

Treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP):

-  who are nonsplenectomized and have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to corticosteroids and/or immunoglobulins;
-  who are splenectomized and have had an inadequate response to splenectomy.

The approved indication for romiplostim is:

Romiplostim  is  indicated  for  adult  chronic  immune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP) splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).

Romiplostim may be considered as second line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contra-indicated.

The recommended initial dose for romiplostim is 1 μ g/kg bodyweight, administered once weekly as a subcutaneous  injection.  A  subject's  actual  body  weight  at  initiation  of  therapy  should  be  used  to calculate dose.  The once weekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 μ g/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10 9 /l.  Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count ( ≥ 50 x 10 9 /l for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should be assessed monthly thereafter and a maximum once weekly dose of 10 μ g/kg should not be exceeded. Treatment with romiplostim should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of romiplostim therapy at the highest weekly dose of 10 μ g/kg. No adjustment of the dosing regimen is required for older patients.

Nplate has romiplostim as active ingredient. Romiplostim is a recombinant protein that is expressed in Escherichia coli . It is a dimer of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain linked to a peptide chain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Each peptide chain within the dimer contains two thrombopoietin receptor-binding domains (TRBD). Romiplostim increases platelet production through activation of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor cMpl, and thus mimicking the action of endogenous thrombopoietin (eTPO).

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Romiplostim is a recombinant non-glycosylated Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) produced in E coli and purified by a series of chromatography steps and ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps.

The  finished  product,  Nplate,  is  formulated  as  500  or  250 µg  powder  for  solution  for  injection intended for subcutaneous administration and chronic use.

## Active Substance

## Description of the active substance

Romiplostim  is  a  recombinant  non-glycosylated  Fc-peptide  59  KDa  fusion  protein  (peptibody) produced  in E. coli .  The  peptibody  molecule  contains  two  identical  269  amino  acid  single-chain subunits,  each  consisting  of  a  human  immunoglobulin  IgG1  Fc  domain  covalently  linked  at  the  Cterminus to a peptide containing two thrombopoetin receptor binding domains, of which each binding domain  consists  of  a  14-amino  acid  sequence.  This  type  of  recombinant  protein  is  referred  as  a 'peptibody' since it contains an active peptide region and an antibody Fc region.

##  Manufacture

The active substance manufacturing process comprises 2 major stages: fermentation and purification.

## Fermentation

The  romiplostim  protein  is  expressed  intracellularly  in E  coli as  inclusion  bodies  using  high  cell density  fed  batch  fermentation.    The  fermentation  process  begins  with  thaw  and  expansion  of  the working cell bank vial in a seed flask.  This is followed by further cell expansion and induction of product synthesis in a production fermentor.  After completion of production fermentation, the broth is chilled  and  cell  processing  is  initiated.  The  cells  are  harvested  and  lysed  to  release  the  inclusion bodies. These are recovered by centrifugation, washed and recovered as a slurry which can be stored frozen prior to further purification.

## Purification

The purification  process  begins  with  thawing  the  slurry  which  is  then  solubilized.    Romiplostim  is purified  using  a  series  of  chromatography,  concentration  and  diafiltration  steps  to  produce  purified bulk active substance.

##  Control of Materials

## Raw Materials and Reagents

All raw materials are tested according to the specified compendial or non-compendial specifications. Compendial materials are tested to one or more of the following: European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.), United  States  Pharmacopoeia  (USP),  National  Formulary  (NF),  Japanese  Pharmacopoeia  (JP), American Chemical Society (ACS), or the Food Chemical Codex (FCC). Specifications for the noncompendial materials including test methods and acceptance criteria are described.

Also the materials of animal origin used during development and production are adequately controlled.

## Source, history, and generation of the cell substrate

The romiplostim gene was constructed by combining the sequence of the Fc portion of the human IgG1 heavy chain from the first amino acid of the hinge domain to the carboxyl terminus with the sequence encoding a peptide chain containing two TRBD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cell banking system, characterisation and testing

A two-tiered cell banking system of master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) has been developed and characterized according to ICH guidelines and is maintained in accordance with cGMP. The  cell  banks  are  well  characterized  and  the  specifications  established  are  satisfactory.  They  are monitored  to  ensure  their  stability  during  long  term  storage.  The  procedure  to  be  followed  for establishment of future cell banks is described and it is considered satisfactory.

## Genetic Stability

The  approach  used  to  study  genetic  stability  is  considered  adequate.  Moreover,  all  lots  met  the acceptance criteria, demonstrating the genetic stability of the production strain.

##  Controls of critical steps and intermediates

All  the  in-process  controls  for  critical  and  key  performance  parameters  have  been  described.  The manufacturing process is properly controlled and works in a consistent manner. Key parameters have been identified and action and rejection limits established.

##  Process Validation and/or Evaluation

The validation studies were carried out satisfactorily.

## Fermentation and Cell processing

The data presented provides evidence that the romiplostim fermentation and cell processing process at commercial  scale  is  successfully  validated,  as  demonstrated  through  evaluation  of  the  seed  flask, production fermentation, and cell processing steps.

## Purification

The contribution of each step to the purification of romiplostim has been analyzed. The integrity and purity of romiplostim measured at each purification stage was consistent from lot to lot. The process has been shown to be reproducible, robust and effective in removing impurities and contaminants.

##  Manufacturing Process Development

During development a second generation active substance manufacturing process was developed to optimize  the  process  for  commercial  production  without  changing  the  manufacturing  scale.  The fermentation process utilized the same basal media and overall production scheme. The purification process  used  the  same  sequence  of  chromatography  steps  and  process  chemistry.  Additionally,  an unnecessary  ultrafiltration  step  was  removed  from  the  process.    These  changes  in  manufacturing process  are  considered  minor,  and  were  made  to  improve  manufacturability  and  maintain  product quality.  Extensive  comparability  studies  have  been  carried  out  showing  a  good  consistency  of production through the different sites and scales. No significant differences among active substance lots across processes and sites were found.

##  Characterization

Characterization of the structure and identity of romiplostim was carried out in depth. The structure of romiplostim  was  elucidated  from  a  variety  of  biochemical,  biophysical,  and  biological  techniques using material from the second generation commercial process.

The resulting amino acid sequence was found to be consistent with that predicted from the genetic sequence. The predominant disulfide structure was confirmed to be consistent with that expected for IgG1 Fc. Molecular weight of native and reduced romiplostim has been verified using whole mass analysis  by  MS.  Charge  heterogeneity  of  romiplostim  was  assessed  from  Cation  Exchange  HPLC (CEX-HPLC). All observed contributions to charge heterogeneity were due to modifications within the Fc region. Evaluation of size heterogeneity was conducted using a wide variety of techniques (size exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC), sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC), SDSPAGE, and size exclusion HPLC with static light scattering detection (SE-HPLC-SLS)).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The biophysical properties of romiplostim were assessed by far and near UV and CD spectroscopy, FTIR,  fluorescence,  and  DSC  (differential  scanning  calorimetry)  to  ascertain  the  secondary  and tertiary  structural  conformations  and  relative  thermodynamic  stability.  The  biophysical  evaluation confirmed  the  romiplostim  structure  is  consistent  with  the  Fc  region  of  IgG.  Also  the  biological activity assay is considered adequate as a lot release assay. In summary, a comprehensive evaluation of the biochemical and biophysical structure and the biological characterization of romiplostim have been conducted.

## Impurities

Assessment  of  product  related  impurities  was  accomplished  through  forced  degradation  studies. Specifically romiplostim active substance was subjected to stress conditions, such as high temperature or various chemical conditions, and then analyzed by various analytical methods including determination  of  bioactivity.    The  results  of  these  studies  identified  product-  and  process-related impurities  and  shown  consistency  in  their  removal  though  the  purification  process.  Results  from  a large number of batches have been presented covering the development history of the manufacturing process. The information provided is considered satisfactory.

##  Specification

## Control of active substance

The  romiplostim  active  substance  is  routinely  controlled  by  a  range  of  chemical-physical  and biological  tests  (covering  appearance/color,  pH,  identity,  purity,  potency,  quantity  and  microbial content)  to  assure  consistent  production.  In  general,  the  analytical  assays  and  their  validation  are deemed acceptable.

##  Stability

The stability programme, including the testing intervals and temperature storage conditions, has been designed in accordance with the relevant guidelines.  The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.

Stability  of  the  active  substance  was  evaluated  at  the  recommended  storage  temperature  and  under other conditions. The stability program consisted of clinical lots, commercial lots and data from the initial  generation  process.    The  stability  data  provided  are  within  the  specifications  and  the  storage period at the recommended storage temperature is accepted.

## Medicinal Product

Romiplostim medicinal product, Nplate, is supplied as a  sterile,  preservative  free  lyophilized  white powder ready for reconstitution. It is supplied for single use in 5 ml Type I glass vials containing 250 or 500 μ g deliverable romiplostim, respectively. When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of sterile water for injections (WFI), romiplostim is at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The reconstituted product  is  a  clear  colourless  solution  practically  free  from  particles.  The  container  closure  system consists of a Type I glass vial, elastomeric stopper, and aluminium seal with flip-off cap.

Prior to administration, Nplate is reconstituted in the vial to 0.5 mg/mL (0.72 mL or 1.2 ml of sterile WFI is added to vials containing 250 μ g  or  500 μ g  of  romiplostim  respectively),  and  drawn  into  a syringe for subcutaneous injection.

##  Pharmaceutical Development

## Formulation development

Medicinal product formulation consists of a dilution of the active substance in a formulation buffer. The excipients used are commonly used in lyophilised products, and the concentrations employed are in the ranges commonly used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  development  history  includes  both  frozen  liquid  and  lyophilised  formulations.  For  the  early clinical trials a frozen liquid formulation was developed. Based on clinical dosing requirements and because  of  the  instability  trends  in  the  frozen  liquid  formulation  at  low  protein  concentrations  a lyophilised formulation was developed. L-histidine was used to maintain pH control at a target of 5.0. Dilute hydrochloric acid was added to adjust the pH to the acceptable range. Sucrose was incorporated as  a  stabilizer  and  mannitol  was  included  as  a  bulking  agent.  Several  formulations  were  tested. Polysorbate  20  was  chosen  as  a  stabilising  agent  to  minimise  aggregation  at  the  required  protein concentration  and  pH.  Moreover,  the  robustness  of  the  chosen  formulation  was  verified  Several experiments  were  performed  to  show  that  lyophilisation  did  not  alter  the  bioactivity  or  structural properties of the protein.

## Manufacturing Process Development

The medicinal product manufacturing process consists of thawing the active substance, a formulation step, followed by aseptic filtration, filling of the vials, partial stoppering, lyophilization and capping.

The  medicinal  product  was  initially  manufactured  as  a  frozen  liquid  formulation.    Subsequently,  a lyophilized  formulation  was  developed  and  manufactured.    As  part  of  further  development,  the lyophilization  process  and  the  active  substance  process  (second  generation)  were  concurrently optimized for commercial production.  The process was transferred to the commercial site and scaled up with minor changes made to accommodate facility differences.

Medicinal product comparability studies have been performed to support the process and site changes. The medicinal product assessment concluded that the medicinal product produced from the optimized process was comparable to the medicinal product produced from the initial process.

##  Adventitious Agents

Starting materials and reagents used in the production process of romiplostim made by using material of animal origin have been identified. It is concluded that the associated TSE risk of romiplostim is negligible.

The  measures  taken  to  prevent  microbiological  contamination  of  active  substance  and  medicinal product  during  the  production  process  include  sterilisation  or  filtration  of  fermentation  media  and other buffers used during manufacturing of the active substance and medicinal product. Additionally, excipients used in the formulation are controlled for microbiological contamination.

The MCB, WCB, and a sample after production fermentation, are routinely tested for contamination, including a bacteriophage test. Moreover, at several steps in the production process tests for bioburden and/or  bacterial  endotoxins  are  carried  out.  Validation  of  viral  clearance  is  not  applicable  for romiplostim since it is produced by microbial fermentation in E. coli .

##  Manufacture of the Product

## Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Control

The  manufacturing  process  of  Nplate  is  straight-forward  and  includes  preparation  of  a  formulation buffer,  thawing  of  the  active  substance,  a  two-step  formulation  of  the  medicinal  product,  sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, stoppering, capping, inspection, labelling and packaging.

In  general,  the  validation  studies  provided  have  confirmed  that  the  romiplostim  medicinal  product manufacturing process is robust and suitable for commercial, routine use and that a medicinal product (250 and 500  g) of an appropriate quality can be consistently produced at the commercial site.

## Control of Excipients

All excipients in the formulation comply with the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.), United States Pharmacopeia/National  Formulary  (USP/NF),  and  where  applicable  Japanese  Pharmacopoeia  (JP) standards.    The  medicinal  product  contains  no  excipients  of  human  or  animal  origin  and  no  novel excipients are used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Product Specification

The routine tests and corresponding specifications include a range of chemical-physical and biological tests, covering appearance/color and moisture content for the lyophilised product and appearance/color, identity, purity, sterility, potency, quantity, pH, polysorbate 20, sub-visible particles, and osmolality for the reconstituted medicinal product. The control of the medicinal product relies to a large extent on the same analytical methods as those used to control the active substance.  The tests and rationale for the acceptance criteria for the finished product were considered acceptable.

## Characterization of Impurities

The medicinal product was sufficiently evaluated for product-related and process-related impurities. In the medicinal product, the same product-related impurities were observed as in the active substance. It can  be  concluded  that  only  small  levels  of  product-related  impurities  are  found  in  the  medicinal product.

##  Stability of the Product

Long-term, accelerated,  photo-stability,  and  in-use  (reconstituted  medicinal  product)  stability  of  the medicinal product have been performed in accordance with the ICH stability guideline.

As for  the  active  substance,  stability  data  from  samples  stored  at  the  recommended  temperature  of storage and under different stress conditions showed that the medicinal product is quite stable. A shelflife of 36 months at 2-8ºC has been accepted.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The quality of this product can be recommended when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. The results of the tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the clinic.

At the time of CHMP opinion, all the minor issues raised during the procedure have been clarified and additional post-authorisation commitments have been agreed by the Company.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Safety studies and pharmacokinetic assay validation studies have been performed in accordance with GLP regulations. Pivotal toxicology studies, toxicokinetic studies, and most of the toxicology studies were conducted under GLP standards.

## Pharmacology

-  Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

Affinity of romiplostim for c-Mpl (thrombopoietin receptor) has been assessed in different species and in  comparison with different c-Mpl ligands. In studies R2006118 and R20070018 direct assessment methods  using  Biacore  2000  and  Biacore  3000  analysis  were  used  respectively.  The  K D of romiplostim to human c-Mpl was in a range between 0.51-14 nM, while affinity of thrombopoietin for the same receptor was calculated to be 33 nM. K D of romiplostim to murine c-Mpl was calculated to be 3.5 nM, while affinity of thrombopoietin for the same receptor was calculated to be 66 nM.

Study  102177  was  an  indirect  analysis  by  displacement  of  radiolabelled  ligands  in  platelets. Romiplostim affinity was tested for human, non-human primate, rabbit and rat c-Mpl. Romiplostim

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

showed a 17-59 fold lower affinity than TPO in the different responding species tested. There was observed no or very low binding for rabbit platelets.

Platelets  exposure  to  romiplostim  (1 μ g/mL) was assessed in study 00-111 and resulted in a similar response  (phosphorylation  of  c-Mpl  and  JAK2)  to  that  measured  in  response  to  the  megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF). This intracellular signalling  is  consistent  with  the  known effects  of  thrombopoietin  binding  to  the  same  receptor.  In  this  study  the  effect  of  romiplostim  on platelet  functionality  was  measured  as  platelet  response  to  a  range  of  ADP  concentration  in  the presence of romiplostim in final concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 ng/mL (see figure 2):

Figure 2. Effects of romiplostim on Human Platelet Function In Vitro .

<!-- image -->

Studies PP01103 and PP01104 were carried out to observe the capability of romiplostim to stimulate CFC-MK (colony-forming cells-megakaryocytes) to form colonies of mature megakaryocytes. These studies  were  conducted  using  LDBM  (low  density  bone  marrow)  cell  preparations  and  purified (CD34+)  cells.  Romiplostim  stimulated  the  growth  of  megakaryocyte-colony  forming  cells  from human, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey and baboon bone marrow in a dose dependent way and with a lower maximum response compared to MGDF. Romiplostim ED50 in cynomolgus and human LDBM were 76.67 ng/mL (1.3 nM) and 14.86 ng/ml (0.25 nM) respectively, and in cynomolgus and human  CD  34+  CFU-MK  0.18  and  0.52  nM  respectively.  If  MGDF  and  romiplostim  were  given together, no evidence was found of addition or synergism.

## In vivo studies

Study PP01197 was a dose-titration study with romiplostim in female BDF 1 mice. Groups of 20 mice received  a  single  subcutaneous  injection  of  vehicle  or  0.1,  0.3,  1,  3,  5,  10 μ g/kg  romiplostim (experiment 2) and vehicle or 100 μ g/kg romiplostim (experiment 1). A dose related and consistently statistically significant increase of platelets was seen at dose levels of 3 μ g/kg romiplostim and higher. A peak platelet count was seen on day 5 and 6 for experiments 1 and 2 respectively. The dose group at 100 μ g/kg  romiplostim  showed  a  decrease  of  red  blood  cell  parameters  (RBC,  hemoglobin, hematocrit) up to day 9, followed by a recovery thereafter.

Study PP01114 compares subcutaneous and intravenous injection route in female BDF 1 mice. Groups of 20 mice received a single subcutaneous injection of vehicle or 10, 30, 100 or 300 μ g/kg romiplostim or a single intravenous injection of 10, 30, 100 or 300 μ g/kg romiplostim. Platelets increased dosedependently  in  all  dose  groups,  without  difference  between  the  two  routes  of  administration  (see Figure 3). Decreased red cell parameters (RBC, Hb, Hct) were found at 300 μ g/kg (both routes) and for some of the parameters at 100 μ g/kg (both routes) and 10-30 μ g/kg (only SC). Elevated levels of neutrophils,  monocytes,  eosinophils  and  basophils  were  found  at  the  highest  doses  for  both  routes. Lymphocytes remained within the normal range.

The effect of romiplostim on platelets in splenectomised and intact (control) mice was investigated in study PP01126. Female BDF1 mice were injected subcutaneously with vehicle, or 10, 50 or 100 μ g/kg romiplostim.  The  baseline  platelet  numbers  of  splenectomised  mice  were  higher  than  those  of  the intact animals. The effect of romiplostim on platelets expressed as % change, was similar for all three dose levels in both splenectomised and normal mice.

In study PP01122 groups of 4 female CD rats received single doses of romiplostim at 10, 30, 100 or 300 μ g/kg via the subcutaneous or intravenous route. Negative control groups received buffered saline and 0.1% rat serum. Dose-related increase of platelets was found at all tested dose levels, with no clear difference between the two administration routes. The maximum platelet count was found at 6 -9 days, after which the count declined back to baseline at 21 days.

In study 100860 three male rhesus monkeys and three male cynomolgus monkeys received a single subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg romiplostim. Platelet counts started to increase at 5-7 days after treatment, peaked (200% of pre-study values in cynomolgus, 177% in rhesus monkeys) on days 7-11 after the injection, and returned to pre-treatment levels by day 17 (rhesus monkeys) or 21 (cynomolgus monkeys). Morphologically, large platelets and clumping platelets were seen on all days (including pre-treatment) in one or more cynomolgus monkeys, but only on days 5 -9 in rhesus monkeys. Indices of circulating erythrocyte mass (CEM), RBC, Hematocrit and hemoglobin decreased gradually up to day 7-9 and increased again gradually from day 11 to day 21. Reticulocyte counts increased at day 7, peaked on day 11 and decreased thereafter. Slight polychromasia was seen starting in some animals on day 5, in most animals on days 7-11 and decreasing thereafter. An increase of megakaryoblasts was seen on day 3. The lineage-specific effect was confirmed by immunostaining of bone marrow smears. The response of both species of monkeys was similar.

Study  PP01116  examined  the  effect  of  romiplostim  in  an  ITP  model  in  W/BF 1 mice  using subcutaneous  doses  of  50,  500  or  1000 μ g/kg.  The  onset  of  thrombocytopenia,  the  effect  of splenectomy  and  the  effect  of  romiplostim  treatment  was  investigated.  Male  mice  showed  a progressive  thrombocytopenia  associated  with  aging  while  female  littermates  did  not.  Splenectomy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was an effective  treatment  strategy  in  a  proportion  of  animals,  although  many  did  not  benefit.  The majority of mice that did show benefit from surgery would relapse into a thrombocytopenic state or die prematurely from unknown causes. Splenectomy non-responders and animals that relapsed both showed  a  significant  increase  in  platelet  counts  in  response  to  romiplostim  injections.  Over  time romiplostim  responders  occasionally  became  less  sensitive  to  the  drug,  and  in  these  animals  dose escalation  was  an  effective  strategy  without  any  discernable  side  effects.  Overall  treatment  with romiplostim  increased  platelet counts in both pre-and  post-splenectomy  settings.  No  survival advantage was offered by romiplostim treatment in this model.

-  Secondary pharmacodynamics

In study 100882 romiplostim was screened in  vitro (NOVA Screen) for receptor binding affinity to assess selectivity to sixty-three different receptors, enzymes, or ion channel targets. Romiplostim was tested at concentrations of 0.2 and 2 µM being the highest concentration least 10 fold higher than the highest concentrations found in monkey plasma following administration of romiplostim at a dose of 5.0  mg/kg.  Using  the  criterion  that  inhibition  of  &gt;  50%  constitutes  activity  at  a  give  receptor, romiplostim did not show activity for any of the receptors or enzymes tested. There were a few targets that  had  greater  than  20%  negative  inhibition  (e.g.  muscarinic  M1,  estrogen,  thromboxane  A2,  and neurokinin NK1) at 2.0 µM concentration.

-  Safety pharmacology programme

Study  101497  on  cynomolgus  monkeys investigated effects  on  the cardiovascular  system.  A single IV bolus dose of romiplostim was administered to 12 cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0, 500, 1000 and 5000 µg/kg. All evaluations were performed in conscious telemetered monkeys. Hemodynamic, electrocardiographic and body temperature data collection began on Days -6 or -5 and ended  on  Days  10  or  11.  There  was  no  effect  of  romiplostim  on  blood pressure, heart rate,  body temperature,  QT interval as well as other ECG parameters,  at  any  dose  level  either  acutely  or throughout the study.  Pharmacological response to romiplostim was observed as a 1.8, 1.6 and 2.5 platelet count increase from baseline to study day 10 for the 500, 1000 and 5000 µg/kg dose groups respectively.

Effects  on  the  central  nervous  system  were  investigated  in  study  101954  on  Sprague-Dawley  rats. Following single subcutaneous  doses of 0,  10,  30,  100 µg/kg romiplostim a functional  observation battery (FOB) was performed in 8 rats of each sex per group. There were no deaths during the study and no behavioural changes related to drug administration were noted. No effect was seen on body temperature neither on motor activity.

-  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted for romiplostim.

## Pharmacokinetics

PK  studies  were  conducted  in  mice,  rats,  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits,  and  rhesus  and  cynomolgus monkeys  following  single  or  multiple  IV  or  SC  dosing.  A  single  SC  dose  study  in  rats  was  also conducted  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  two  formulations  tested  along  romiplostim development program.

## Methods of analysis

ELISA  methods  were  developed  and  validated  to  quantify  romiplostim  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit  and monkey sera. Two additional validated assays were used to test for antibodies in animals. The first was a  surface  plasmon resonance-based immunoassay using the Biacore 3000 to detect and confirm the presence of binding antibodies. The second was an in vitro cell-based bioassay to detect neutralizing antibodies.  Species-specific  assays  were  developed  for  the  studies.  For  distribution  and  excretion balance studies in rats radiolabelled romiplostim ( 125 I) was used.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods in WinNonlin (Pharsight, Mountain View, California).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To  investigate  the  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  (PK/PD)  relationship  using  single  dose  data obtained in rats and in monkeys, compartmental modelling was employed. The general pharmacokinetic  model  comprised  a  depot  compartment  for  SC  dose  administration,  a  central compartment,  a  peripheral  tissue  compartment  and  a  receptor  binding  compartment.  Two  possible elimination  mechanisms  were  included  in  the  general  model,  a  linear  elimination  from  the  central compartment and a receptor mediated elimination by internalization of the receptor-drug complex. The PD model was composed of 20 transit compartments which depicted the progression of the platelets and the precursor cells through their lifespan. The final PK model for each species was adapted to fit the observed data from each individual species.

Validation of romiplostim quantification methods was conducted in GLP-compliant studies.

##  Absorption

Single-dose pharmacokinetics was studied in Sprague  Dawley  rats  (Study  100909),  Rhesus  (Study 100998) and Cynomolgus monkeys (101604) over a dose range of 30 to 300 μ g/kg in rats and 500 to 5000 μ g/kg  in  monkeys.  The  bioavailability  of  romiplostim  after  a  single  SC  dose  showed  similar values in rats (21 to 28%; dose range of 30 to 300 μ g/kg) and cynomolgus monkeys (19% at 5000 μ g/kg), whereas in rhesus monkeys it decreased from 74% at 500 μ g/kg to 45% at 5000 μ g/kg. The maximum concentration was achieved at a median t max of  8-16 hours post-dose in rats and at 4 to 8 hours post-dose in monkeys. The apparent terminal elimination t 1/2 was 19 to 21 hours, 296 hours and 110  to  195  hours  in  rats,  cynomolgus  and  rhesus  monkeys  respectively.  After  a  single  IV  dose administration the estimated systemic clearance (CL) was approximately 6.3 to 8.4 in rats, 17.3 to 20.1 in  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  7.4  to  7.8  mL/h/kg  in  rhesus  monkeys.  The  estimated  steady-state volume  of  distribution  was  approximately  114  to  139,  110  to  198  and  184  to  196  mL/kg  for  rats, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, respectively. The terminal elimination t 1/2 was approximately 17 to 19 hours in rats, 68 to 96 hours in cynomolgus monkeys, and 102 to 143 hours in rhesus monkeys.

Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in Sprague Dawley rats (Study 100876), Rhesus (Study 101158) and Cynomolgus monkeys (Study 100877). Doses ranged from 10 to 100 μ g/kg in rats and from  100  to  5000 μ g/kg  in  monkeys  for  4-weeks.  The  increase  in  exposure  was  greater  than  dose proportional in rats and was approximately dose proportional in cynomolgus monkeys. An overview on absorption data after romiplostim multiple administrations (IV or SC) in Cynomolgus monkeys is provided in Table 2.

-  Distribution

A  quantitative  whole  body  autoradiography  and  tissue  radioactivity  distribution  study  after  IV administration of 125 I-AMP2 was performed in 16 female Sprague Dawley rats (Study 101995). The TCA precipitated radioactivity accounted for 84 - 95% of the total radioactivity within 30 minutes after dosing. In the animals used for the tissue analysis, the percentage of the dose present in a number of  tissues  0.5  hour  post-dose  was  64.6  (blood),  15.8  (liver),  6.7  (muscle,  thigh),  4.74  (bone,  both femurs), 1.32 (bone marrow from both femurs), 3.57 (kidneys), 0.16 (thyroid). At 12 hrs post dose 25.2% was found in blood, at 72 hrs, 5.14% and at 168 hrs 1.72. In thyroid, the percentage at 12, 72 and 168 hrs was 0. In all tissues tested no accumulation was observed over time.

-  Metabolism

Metabolism studies have not been conducted for romiplostim.

-  Excretion

Excretion of romiplostim was evaluated in female rats following a single IV dose of 125 I-romiplostim at 300 μ g/kg. The major route of excretion of radioactivity was via the urine. At 168 hours post-dose, urine accounted for a mean value of 87.7% of the dosed radioactivity, and faeces accounted for 6.56%. Approximately 50% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the first 24 hours. The overall recovery of dosed radioactivity was 95.9%. TCA precipitation of urine showed approximately 9.5% of the total dosed radioactivity. The faeces showed a range of 45.9 to 49.2% precipitated radioactivity.

Results  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  splenectomised  rats  (Study  100995,  non-GLP  exploratory PKPD study) show only very little difference with regard to AMP2 exposure and platelet response with intact or sham operated animals and only at the lowest tested dose (100 μ g/kg IV).

-  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

No pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted for romiplostim.

-  Other pharmacokinetic studies

A single SC dose study in rats was performed to compare the pharmacokinetics of the frozen liquid formulation used in the preclinical program and early clinical studies and the lyophilized formulation used in the pivotal clinical studies. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single subcutaneous dose of romiplostim 30 μ g/kg. The pharmacokinetic profiles of both formulations were similar in rats. From the non-compartimental analysis based on composite mean serum concentrationtime  profiles,  C max values  of  the  two  formulations  were  similar  while  AUC 0-inf of  the  lyophilized romiplostim  was  approximately  10%  lower  than  of  the  frozen  liquid  formulation.  The  maximum concentration following administration of the frozen liquid formulation was achieved at 24 hours.

## Toxicology

The toxicological profile of romiplostim was evaluated in single and repeated-dose toxicity studies (up to  6  months) and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. Mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys (cynomolgus and rhesus) were used. In the in vivo studies romiplostim was administered by SC route, except  for  the  one  month  repeated-dose  studies  in  rat  and  rhesus  monkey  where  it  was  also administered intravenously.

-  Single dose toxicity

Subcutaneous  acute  toxicity  of  romiplostim  was  evaluated  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  in  study  No. 103974. Animals were administered 0, 100, 300 and 1000 μ g/kg /SC and were kept under observation for 16 days. One out of forty animals was found dead on day 9 after administration of 100 μ g/kg of romiplostim. It was an isolated case and there were no microscopic or macroscopic findings during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

examination. The study did not reveal high acute toxicity and the subcutaneous LD 50 was greater than 1000 μ g/kg in rats.

-  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

An overview of the repeated-dose toxicity studies are showed in T able 3.

## Antigenicity

Romiplostim was immunogenic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys (rhesus and cynomolgus). Binding antibodies  to  romiplostim  and  neutralizing  antibodies  were  observed  in  all  species  tested.  Some animals  developed  anti-TPO  binding  antibodies  post-dose  although  none  of  them  was  able  of neutralizing the biological effect of TPO in the cell based assay. No evidence of thrombocytopenia was  observed  in  the  animals  that  developed  anti-TPO  antibodies.  The  development  of  neutralizing antibodies in rats turned into a clear decrease of the platelet response.

Treated animals serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies by Biacore analysis (Studies PP01113 and PP01108). Mice administered romiplostim subcutaneously at doses of 50 or 100 μ g/kg every 21 days for 4 cycles generated antibodies that bound romiplostim in 60 and 80% of the animals respectively. This development was first detected within 1-2 weeks of a single exposure to the drug. The strongest serum interactions were to TMP. From studies of subsequent exposure to romiplostim, efficacy  to  lower  doses  (50  or  100 μ g/kg)  of  romiplostim  was  reduced.  Mice  did  not  develop thrombocytopenia. Dose-escalation to 500 and 1000 μ g/kg was an effective strategy to overcoming the antibody response.

## Immunotoxicity

Immunotoxicity studies have not been performed.

## Dependence

Studies on dependence have not been performed.

## Metabolites

No specific studies on metabolites were performed.

## Studies on impurities

A  toxicological  assessment  of  HMF  and  F  was  provided.  Romiplostim  medicinal  product  was evaluated for product related and process-related impurities. HMF and F were found as buffer matrix decomposition impurities after the lyophilisation process. HMF and F were quantified in the medicinal product being present below the limits established by the Applicant, even in heat-stressed material.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tissue Cross-Reactivity Study

The potential cross-reactivity of romiplostim for selected human and cynomolgus monkey tissues and a human megakaryoblastic cell line was evaluated in Study 101815. Cryosections of selected human and cynomolgus monkey tissues, human buffy coat, and human megakaryoblastic leukemia MEG-01 cells,  as  well  as  human  peripheral  blood  smears  were  used.  Various  concentrations  of  romiplostim were  examined,  ranging  from  1  to  50 μ g/mL.  Indirect  immunoperoxidase  procedures  were  used  to demonstrate  reactivity  of  the  unconjugated  or  fluoresceinated  forms  of  the  test  article  with  the cryosections or blood smears. No specific reactivity for romiplostim was observed.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment has not been submitted.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

In 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit and  haemoglobin  was  observed.    There  was  also  a  stimulatory  effect  on  leukocyte  production,  as peripheral  blood  counts  for  neutrophils,  lymphocytes,  monocytes,  and  eosinophils  were  mildly increased.    In  the  longer  duration  chronic  monkey  study,  there  was  no  effect  on  the  erythroid  and leukocytic  lineages  when  romiplostim  was  administered  for  6  months  where  the  administration  of romiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly.

It  is  unlikely  that  other  biological  effects  other  than  the  intended  action  results  from  romiplostim binding.  The  Applicant  provided  a  justified  discussion  on  thrombopoitein  receptor  expression  on different  cell  lines  including  myeloid  leukemia  cells,  and  also  justified  the  lack  of  an  adequate validated in vivo model to address this concern in a chronic study. Nevertheless, at least two cases of tumour  development  were  observed  in  humans,  one  case  of  myeloma  and  one  case  of  B-cell lymphoma. Considering these findings, the risk of potential carcinogenicity of romiplostim remains unknown  and  should  be  further  studied.  To  address  this  concern  the  Applicant  has  committed  to provide experimental ( in vitro ) data on the potential of romiplostim to stimulate proliferation of solid tumour cells  expressing  c-MPL. This commitment has been included as a follow-up measure to be submitted post-approval.

Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at all tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week post-treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility.

Metabolism  studies  have  not  been  conducted  for  romiplostim.  Its  expected  metabolism  is  the degradation  to  small  peptides  and  individual  amino  acids  mediated  by  proteases  and  according  to Guideline on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH topic S6), classical biotransformation studies are not needed for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals.

No  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  The  potential  interactions  of  romiplostim  with  coadministered  drugs  due  to  binding  to  plasma  proteins  remain  unknown  and  a  warning  has  been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

Due  to  romiplostim  protein-based  nature  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  topic  6  guideline,  neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. A warning has been included in section 5.3 of the SPC.

Due to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were often decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction of  the  antibodies  with  the  measured  concentrations.  Although  high  doses  were  tested  in  the  animal studies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins cannot be reliably estimated.

In  all  developmental  studies  neutralising  antibodies  were  formed,  which  may  have  inhibited romiplostim  effects.  In  embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  mice  and  rats,  reductions  in  maternal body weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

slight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross the  placental  barrier  in  rats  and  may  be  transmitted  from  the  mother  to  the  developing  foetus  and stimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats.

The Applicant has not performed specific local tolerance studies. Despite of it, effects of romiplostim administration  in  the  injection  site  were  evaluated  in  all  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted. Most of the findings were reverted after the recovery period or its severity was reduced.

On the basis of the Guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00, proteins are exempted of ERA because they are unlikely  to  result  in  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Romiplostim  is  an  Fc  fusion  protein  and therefore  this  assessment  is  not  provided.  The  excipients  used  have  an  extensive  history  of  use  in medicinal products and are not considered hazardous to the patient or the environment. Romiplostim medicinal  product is considered to be a non-hazardous, biodegradable product.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical development program included 9 clinical studies in subjects with ITP, 2 pharmacology studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  2  studies  in  other  indications.  In  total  294  subjects  received romiplostim.  Two  pivotal  phase  3  efficacy  and  safety  studies  were  performed:  Study  20030105  on splenectomised  subjects  (42  romiplostim,  21  placebo)  and  Study  20030212  on  not  splenectomised subjects (41 romiplostim, 21 placebo).

On 14 September 2005 the Company requested scientific advice for their product. A follow-up advice was requested on August 2006. The main issues dealt with in these advice procedures were:

-  Definition  of  the  target  population  to  be  included  in  pivotal  clinical  trials.  The  CHMP proposed  to  complement  the  inclusion  criteria  with  additional  features  in  order  to  better delineate a population in real need of further line therapies. This applied to both splenectomised  and  non-splenectomised  patients.  Apparently,  this  recommendation  was  not taken on board by the Applicant.
-  The CHMP also advised to consider the evaluation of the primary endpoint (durable response) both on-therapy and off-therapy.
-  The importance of presenting a sufficient set of patients treated at least during 12 months was also highlighted. This should include data on BM biopsies after long-term therapy.
-  The MAH proposed plans to assess inmunogenicity of romiplostim and the potential for crossreactivity with eTPO was deemed acceptable.
-  The preliminary outline of the RMP in order to manage the main identified and potential risks associated to romiplostim use was also deemed acceptable.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Two Phase 1, single-dose studies were conducted to characterize the PK profiles of romiplostim in healthy subjects, including a study in predominantly white or Caucasian subjects (Study 20000109) and a study in Japanese subjects (Study 20040134). The PK of romiplostim with once-weekly, weightbased dosing in subjects with ITP  were  evaluated in 1 additional dose-finding study in a predominantly white (Study 20000137B) population. Limited trough PK samples were collected from 2  pivotal  trials  (Study  20030105  and  Study  20030212)  and  an  open-label  extension  study  (Study 20030213)  in  subjects  with  ITP  to  support  safety  assessment.  One  subset  study  was  conducted  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  with  ITP  participating  in  the  open-label  study  to  assess  the  comparability  of  PK  (Study 20030213-Subset B) of the P1 and P2 materials. For a summary of the studies see Table 7.

b Intensive samples were collected to provide PK or PD profiles; sparse samples were collected once weekly or less frequently d Subjects on previous studies could carry their doses forward into this study; the maximum dose across previous studies was 30 µg/kg. Subjects who were receiving a dose &gt; 10 µg/kg prior to the amendment were allowed to remain  on  that  dose;  however,  the  subject's  dose  could  not  be  further  increased.  If  the  subject's  dose  was decreased after enrolment, the dose could not be subsequently increased to &gt; 10 µg/kg.

c A planned maximum planned dose of 3.0 µg/kg in Study 20040134 was not reached because stopping rules for excess elevation of platelet count were reached at the next lower planned dose.

e 22 of 41 subjects were qualified for inclusion in the analysis

## Analytical Methods

Serum concentrations of romiplostim were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was used and validated at two sites. In the validation report for Study 101903, the calibration curve ranged from 15-500 pg/ml. Accuracy and precision ranged from 96-104% and 2-9%, respectively.  The  LLOQ  was  defined  as  18  pg/ml.  In  the  second  method  validation  report  (Study 108854) the calibration curve ranged from 15 to 1500 pg/ml. Accuracy and precision ranged from 93108% and 2-13%, respectively. The LLOQ was defined as 15 pg/ml.

## Pharmacokinetics data analysis

The estimated initial concentration at time zero (C 0 ) for the IV groups was calculated by linear backextrapolation to time zero using the first two observed concentration values. The maximum observed concentration (C max ) after SC dosing and the time of C max (t max ) were reported as observed values from the concentration vs. time data. The area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to  the  last  time  point  with  quantifiable  concentration  (AUC 0-t )  was  calculated  by  the  linear/log trapezoidal method. Linear regression was used to estimate the rate constant for the terminal log-linear phase  of  the  concentration-time  curve  ( λ z ).  The  terminal  half-life  (t ½,z )  was  calculated  as  ln2/ λ z . Systemic clearance (CL) and the clearance after subcutaneous administration (CL/F) were calculated as dose divided by AUC inf,  IV and AUCinf, SC , respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss ) was calculated as mean residence time multiplied by the clearance (MRT*CL).The distribution volume of the central compartment after IV dosing (V c ) was calculated as the nominal IV dose divided by C0 .

## Statistical analysis

Routinely, descriptive statistics were provided. In the comparability exercise in Study 20030213, 90% confidence intervals were estimated.

##  Absorption

In  Study  20000109, healthy subjects were administered 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 2.0 µg/kg romiplostim as a single  SC  injection.  After  SC  administration  of  2  µg/kg  to  healthy  subjects,  romiplostim  t max was observed between 24 and 36 hours after dosing. In Study 20040134, healthy Japanese subjects were administered 0.3, 1.0 or 2.0 µg/kg romiplostim as a single SC injection. For the 2 µg/kg blood samples were  taken  for  PK  analysis.  Serum  concentrations  above  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ) were observed in 2 out of 8 subjects dosed at the 2 µg/kg dose level.

In Study 20000137B, ITP patients were administered 1.0 (n=8), 3.0 (n=5) or 6.0 (n=1) µg/kg SC once weekly for 6 weeks. Serum exposure to romiplostim was highly variable among subjects. Most of the serum romiplostim concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ = 18 pg/ml) and non-compartmental analysis was not performed. At 3.0 µg/kg, the serum romiplostim concentrations were lower and the platelet counts were higher at week 6 than at week 1.

In  the  open-label  extension  study  (Study  20030213  Subset  B)  in  subjects  with  ITP,  romiplostim maintenance doses were administered from 3 to 15 µg/kg SC. Combining data for all patients and dose levels, maximum serum romiplostim concentrations were observed at a median t max of 14 hours (range = 6.9 to 50 hours). Mean individual serum concentration-time profiles of romiplostim are presented in Figure  4.  Serum  exposure  to  romiplostim  was  highly  variable  among  subjects  and  within  the  same dose,  higher  exposure  was  observed  in  subjects  with  lower  platelet  counts.  Maximum  steady  state romiplostim serum C max of  2574  pg/ml  and  AUC of 117 hr.ng/ml was observed in a single patient after a 5 µg/kg dose. At a 10 µg/kg dose C max ranged from 119 to 1443 pg/ml, and AUC from 10.3 to 66.3 hr.ng/ml.

In Study 20000137B, 4 of 8 ITP patients at 1.0 µg/kg had measurable concentrations for one or more time  points.  In  comparison,  no  measurable  concentrations  were  observed  in  healthy  subjects administered  a  single  1.0  µg/kg  SC  dose  of  romiplostim  in  Study  20000109.  These  results qualitatively  suggest  serum  exposure  to  romiplostim  may  be  higher  in  subjects  with  ITP  than  in healthy  subjects.  As  circulating  platelets  play  an  important  role  in  the  elimination  of  romiplostim (target-mediated clearance), the difference could potentially be attributable to differences in platelet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

counts between these 2 populations; the baseline platelet counts were much lower in subjects with ITP (&lt; 30 x 10 9 /L) than in healthy subjects (201 to 259 x 10 9 /L).

## Bioavailability

In  Study  20000109,  romiplostim  was  administered  to  healthy  subjects  both  via  IV  and  SC administration.  Only  partial  PK  profiles  were  observed  following  SC  administration  and  absolute bioavailability  could  not  be  estimated.  Serum  exposure  to  romiplostim  after  SC  administration  was lower than that after IV administration.

Comparability  of  the  clinical  process  material  (P1)  and  commercial  process  material  (P2)  was conducted  in  ITP  patients  (Study  20030213-Subset  B).  In  total  20  ITP  patients  completed  the treatment  phase  and  received  both  the  P1  and  P2  materials.  Nineteen  of  the  20  subjects  received  a stable dose throughout the study period. One patient changed dose, and data from this subject as well as  those  for  another  subject  (due  to  sample  mishandling  during  the  study)  were  excluded  from  the comparability evaluation. The  doses of romiplostim ranged from  3 to 15 µg/kg. After  SC administration of the P1 and P2 materials, maximum serum romiplostim concentrations were observed at  a  median  t max of  14  hours  (range  =  6.9  to  50  hours).  No  clear  relationship  between  the  serum concentration profile and level of romiplostim C max of  AUC was observed. Results of the statistical analyses showed that the point estimate of the mean AUC ratio (P2 to P1) was 1.41 with the 90% confidence interval of 1.13 to 1.76, and the point estimate of the mean C max ratio (P2 to P1) was 1.75 with  the  90%  confidence  interval  of  1.25  to  2.46.  Results  of  the  statistical  analyses  using  platelet corrected values for C max and  AUC (mixed effect modelling) showed that the point estimate of the mean AUC ratio (P2 to P1) was 1.17 with the 90% confidence interval of 0.98 to 1.41, and the point estimate of the mean Cmax ratio (P2 to P1) was 1.33 with the 90% confidence interval of 1.01 to 1.74.

##  Distribution

In  healthy  volunteers  study  20000109  showed  that  the  volume  of  distribution  (V d )  was  assessed following IV administration of romiplostim. V d was 122, 78.8, and 48.2 ml/kg for IV doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10 µg/kg, respectively.

##  Elimination

Maintenance doses of romiplostim ranging from 3 to 15 µg/kg were applied in subjects with ITP in study 20030213-Subset B. The median t 1/2 was 85 h (range 24-826 h), i.e., 3.5 days (range 1-34 days).

##  Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Results from IV administration of romiplostim in healthy volunteers (Study 20000109) demonstrate that the PK of romiplostim is nonlinear in a dose range of 0.3 to 10 µg/kg and exposure increases more than proportionally with increased dose (see Table 8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a Individual AUC and C max were assigned a value of zero for 3 subjects in this cohort who had no measurable serum concentrations to compute the mean (SD).

b Data from one cohort only. Other data were not analyzed since most PK observations were BLQ.

Time dependency was analysed in study 20000137B, where it was shown that after repeated weekly administration  of  romiplostim  for  6  weeks  at  3.0  µg/kg  in  ITP  patients,  the  serum  romiplostim concentrations appeared to be lower and the platelet counts were higher at week 6 than at week 1. In addition,  data  from  study  20030213-Subset  B  showed  a  correlation  between  serum  exposure  (AUC and  C max )  and  pre-dose  platelet  counts.  Romiplostim  exposure  was  low  when  the  pre-dose  platelet counts were high, and vice versa.

-  Special populations

Clinical studies of romiplostim did not include a sufficient number of healthy subjects and subjects with  ITP  for  each  dose  level  to  determine  the  effects  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment.  In  addition, studies  did  not  include  a  sufficient  number  of  subjects  to  determine  the  effects  of  gender,  age  or weight.

Pharmacokinetics of romiplostim following SC administration were assessed in non-Japanese (Study 20000109) and Japanese subjects (Study 20040134). However, due to the limited amount of PK data no comparison was possible.

Romiplostim pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in children and adolescents.

-  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted.

-  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies using human biomaterials were performed.

## Pharmacodynamics

Two phase 1, single-dose studies were conducted to characterize the PD profiles of romiplostim in healthy subjects, including a study in predominantly white or Caucasian subjects (Study 20000109) and a study in Japanese subjects (Study 20040134). Two dose-finding studies, each with 2 doses of romiplostim  given  2  or  3  weeks  apart,  were  conducted  in  subjects  with  ITP  to  explore  dosing frequency  and  to  evaluate  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  romiplostim  with  weight-based  dosing (Study20000137A) and unit-dose administration (Study 20010218). The PD of romiplostim with onceweekly, weight-based dosing in subjects with ITP were evaluated in 2 additional dose-finding studies in predominantly white (Study 20000137B) and Japanese (Study 20050162) populations. See table 9 for a summary of the studies performed.

b Intensive samples were collected to provide PK or PD profiles; sparse samples were collected once weekly or less frequently a The dose unit is µg/kg, except for µg unit dosing in Study 20010218; all doses were given by the SC route except for three cohorts in study 20000109 that had romiplostim given by the IV route

c A planned maximum planned dose of 3.0 µg/kg in Study 20040134 was not reached because stopping rules for excess elevation of platelet count were reached at the next lower planned dose.

e 22 of 41 subjects were qualified for inclusion in the analysis d Subjects on previous studies could carry their doses forward into this study; the maximum dose across previous studies was 30 µg/kg. Subjects who were receiving a dose &gt; 10 µg/kg prior to the amendment were allowed to remain  on  that  dose;  however,  the  subject's  dose  could  not  be  further  increased.  If  the  subject's  dose  was decreased after enrolment, the dose could not be subsequently increased to &gt; 10 µg/kg.

## Platelet counts in healthy volunteers

In healthy volunteer Studies 20000109 (non-Japanese volunteers) and 20040134 (Japanese volunteers), romiplostim induced a dose-dependent increase in platelet counts in healthy subjects after a single IV dose ranging from 0.3 to 10 µg/kg or a single SC dose ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 µg/kg. At the same dose level, platelet responses were similar after IV and SC administration, although exposure to  romiplostim  was  markedly  lower  (or  not  measurable)  after  SC  administration  relative  to  that observed after IV administration (see Figure 10). Results also demonstrated no apparent difference in the platelet response between non-Japanese and Japanese populations.

Figure  10.  Mean  (SD)  serum  romiplostim  concentration-  and  platelet-time  profiles  in  healthy subjects after a single 1 µg/kg IV or SC dose of romiplostim (Study 20000109)

## Pharmacodynamics in ITP patients

Romiplostim stimulates the production of platelets in subjects with ITP apparently through the same mechanism as in healthy subjects by binding to c-Mpl. Large intersubject variability was observed, as some subjects did not respond to the romiplostim treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Romiplostim caused a dose-dependent increase in platelet count in ITP patients. Individual platelet count-time  profiles  for  the  1.0,  3.0,  6.0  and  10.0  µg/kg  cohorts  in  Study  20000137A  are  shown  in Figure 6.

b Subject received 2 nd dose 2 weeks after the 1 st dose.

- a Subject received only one dose.

c Subject received 2 nd dose 3 weeks after the 1 st dose.

Comparing data from Study 20000137B (non-Japanese ITP patients) and Study 20050162 (Japanese ITP  patients)  administered  1.0,  3.0,  and  6.0 μ g/kg  romiplostim,  platelet  responses  were  similar between Japanese and non-Japanese populations who had ITP.

## Comparability on the clinical formulation P1 and commercial formulation P2 (Study 20030213-Subset A)

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing of romiplostim subjects with ITP, doses were individually  adjusted  as  needed  for  each  subject  to  keep  platelet  counts  within  the  target  range.  A subset of subjects was evaluated to compare the clinical process material (P1) and commercial process material (P2) with respect to the PD properties of romiplostim. A total of 22 subjects were included. Subjects  received  once-weekly  treatment  with  the  P1  material  for  three  months,  followed  by continuous  once-weekly  SC  treatment  of  the  P2  material  for  three  subsequent  months.  PD  was assessed during the last 30 days of the first (P1) period and the adjacent first 30 days of the second (P2) period.

Mean platelet counts over 30 days pre-switch and 30 days post switch were 111.1 x 10 9 /L and 113.9 x 10 9 /L for the P1 and P2 materials, respectively. The mean difference in platelet counts in the 30-day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

periods before and after the switch was -2.8 x 10 9 /L and the 90% confidence interval for the difference was -19.2 to 13.7 x 10 9 /L. The average weekly doses, the proportion of subjects reporting the use of any  rescue  medications  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  requiring  more  than  1  dose  change  were  all comparable  between  treatment  with  the  P1  material  and  the  P2  material.  Comparison  of  the  post treatment  romiplostim  serum  levels  was  made  using  data  from  11  out  of  22  patients  (serum  levels BLQ in the rest of the patients). The mean P2-to-P1 ratio for romiplostim post treatment trough levels was 0.91. The 90% confidence interval was 0.67-1.24.

No specific secondary pharmacology studies have been conducted with romiplostim.

##  PK/PD model

The  PK/PD  relationship  between  serum  romiplostim  concentrations  and  platelet  counts  have  been described in study 108644 using a linked PK/PD model. This PK/PD modelling approach is supported by published data on eTPO, the endogenous ligand of c-Mpl receptor, and the proposed mechanism of action of romiplostim.

The  PK/PD  model  (see  Figure  6)  contained  PK  and  PD  models  that  were  linked  by  a  stimulatory function.  The  PK  model  comprised  a  depot  compartment  for  SC  dose  administration,  a  central compartment, a peripheral-tissue compartment, and a drug-receptor complex compartment to which the circulating pool of platelets also contribute. Three elimination mechanisms were included: a linear elimination process, a Michaelis-Menten process operated in parallel from the central compartment, and a receptor-mediated internalization of the drug-receptor complex  from  the  drug-receptor compartment. The PD model described the distribution of romiplostim to the highly perfused bone marrow and the stimulation of proliferation and maturation of megakaryocyte progenitors, leading to a series of signal transduction and cell turnover rate processes and resulting in the increase in platelet counts of the subjects. This cascade of pharmacologically induced biologic events was mimicked by a series of transit compartments that represented the proliferation and progression of precursor cells and platelets through their lifespan.

The PK/PD model was implemented in NONMEM version V; PK/PD analysis was conduced using first order conditional estimation method (FOCE). The minimisation was performed according to the first order conditional estimation method up to 3 significant digits.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

The  pharmacokinetics  of  romiplostim  involved  target-mediated  disposition,  which  is  presumably mediated  by  TPO  receptors  on  platelets  and  other  cells  of  the  thrombopoietic  lineage  such  as megakaryocytes. Romiplostim is expected to be cleared for a major part by proteolysis. In addition, plasma protein binding studies have not been performed as romiplostim is expected to predominantly bind to the target receptors on platelets in circulation.

No formal clinical studies have been performed in special populations. Patients with renal and hepatic impairment and elderly should be cautious when using this product. In addition, no studies have been performed  in  children  and  its  use  in  this  population  is  not  recommended.  Adequate  warnings  have been included in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC.

No  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  and  the  potential  interactions  of  romiplostim  with  coadministered  drugs  due  to  binding  to  plasma  proteins  remain  unknown.  Pharmacokinetic  drug-drug interactions  are  unlikely  for  proteins  like  romiplostim  and  the  absence  of  these  studies  is  therefore acceptable.

Medicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with romiplostim in clinical studies included  corticosteroids,  danazol,  and/or  azathioprine,  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIG),  and anti-D immunoglobulin. Corticosteroids, danazol, and azathioprine use may be reduced or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinued when given in combination with romiplostim. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining  romiplostim  with  other  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  ITP  in  order  to  avoid platelet counts outside of the recommended range. A warning addressing this risk has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

No  specific  secondary  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted  with  romiplostim  due  to  the specificity  of  the  molecule  for  a  single  receptor,  however,  it  was  considered  necessary  to  perform proliferation assays to assess the effect on the hepatocellular carcinoma cells line Hep 3B that has been shown to express c-Mpl at the mRNA level. The Applicant will submit such studies as a follow-up measure.

## Clinical efficacy

-  Dose response studies

The dose selected for the main studies was based on results of 2 completed dose-finding studies in healthy  subjects  (i.e.,  20000109  (N=48)  and  20040134  in  Japanese  subjects  (N=30)  and  4  in  ITP subjects  (20000137  part  A  (N=24),  20000137  part  B  (N=21),  study  20010218  (N=16),  and  study 20050162  in  Japanese  subjects  with  ITP  (N=12).  In  these  studies  PK  and  platelet  profiles  were evaluated for doses that would increase the platelet counts to a target level, which was defined as the peak  platelet  count  achieving  a  doubling  of  baseline  platelet  counts  and  within  the  range  of  50 x 10 9 /L and  450 x 10 9 /L, in the absence of rescue medication. Based on these studies a starting dose of 1 μ g/kg, administered subcutaneously once weekly was selected (see summary of the design and outcome of these studies is provided in Table 11).

## Study Participants

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  the  same  in  both  pivotal  studies  (Study  20030105  and  Study 20030212) except that subjects in Study 20030105 were refractory to splenectomy:

## Inclusion criteria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- A serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2 mg/dL ( ≤ 176.8 μ mol/L).
- Adequate liver function, as evidenced by a serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the laboratory normal range
- Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL.

Exclusion criteria (if they fulfilled any of the following criteria)

Disease Related:

-  Any known history of bone marrow stem cell disorder (any abnormal bone marrow findings other than  those  typical  of  ITP  had  to  be  approved  by  Amgen  before  a  subject  could  be  enrolled  in  the study).

-  Any  active  malignancy;  if  prior  history  of  cancer  other  than  basal  cell  carcinoma  or  cervical carcinoma in situ, no treatment or active disease within 5 years before randomization.

- Protocol 20030212 only: have had a splenectomy.

Medications:

- IVIg or anti-D Ig within 2 weeks before the screening visit.
- Rituximab (for any indication) within 14 weeks before the screening visit or anticipated use during the time of the proposed study.

-  Received  haematopoietic  growth  factors,  including  IL-11  (oprelvekin)  within  4  weeks  before  the screening visit.

- Received any alkylating agents within 8 weeks before the screening visit or anticipated use during the time of the proposed study.

Other  more  general  exclusion  criteria  were  the  following:  currently  enrolled  in  or  had  not  yet completed at least 4 weeks since ending other investigational device or drug trial(s), or receiving other investigational  agent(s);  past  or  present  participation  in  any  study  evaluating  PEG-rHuMGDF, recombinant  human  thrombopoietin  (rHuTPO),  romiplostim,  or  related  platelet  product;  Subject  of child-bearing potential evidently pregnant (e.g., positive HCG test) or breast-feeding Subject not using adequate  contraceptive  precautions,  known  hypersensitivity  to  any  recombinant E  coli -derived product;  any  kind  of  disorder  that  compromised  the  ability  of  the  subject  to  give  written  informed consent and/or to comply with all study procedures.

## Treatments

Both pivotal studies used a starting dose of 1 μ g/kg, administered subcutaneously once weekly (based on data from dose finding studies 20000137A, 20000137B and 20010218). Concurrent ITP therapies were permitted if at constant dose and schedule; reductions in these could occur once platelet counts were &gt; 100 x 10 9 /L.

Dose  adjustments  were  made  throughout  the  treatment  period  according  to  rules  for  the  2  pivotal studies (see Table 13). The desired platelet range in which a constant dose was to be maintained was 50  x  10 9 /L  to  200  x  10 9 /L.  In  the  phase  3  pivotal  studies  the  maximum  dose  was  15 μ g/kg.  The maximum dose of romiplostim in the open-label extension study was initially 30 μ g/kg, which was reduced  to  15 μ g/kg,  and  further  to  10 μ g/kg  because  of  the  lack  of  additional  clinical  benefit  to incremental  doses  above  10 μ g/kg.  Dosing  was  to  be  stopped  at  any  time  during  the  study  if neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim or eTPO were detected. Rescue medication was permitted for bleeding or wet purpura, or if the investigator felt the study was at immediate risk. However, subjects who received rescue medications at any time during the treatment period were considered not to have had a durable platelet response. In addition, platelet counts within 8 weeks of rescue medication were excluded for other response analyses.

After 24 weeks of treatment, study medication was discontinued and platelet counts were monitored during weeks 26 through 36. Subjects completed the study when their platelet counts below 50 x 10 9 /L or at week 36, whichever occurred first.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the pivotal trials was to evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult subjects with ITP, as measured by durable platelet response during the last 8 weeks of treatment.

The secondary objectives were:

- To evaluate the overall safety of romiplostim.
- To evaluate possible reductions in concurrent ITP therapies while receiving romiplostim.
-  To evaluate changes in Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) and Health Resource Utilization due to treatment with romiplostim.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint in the pivotal studies was the incidence of durable platelet response, defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet responses (platelet count ≥ 50 x 10 9 /L) during the last 8 weeks of treatment with no rescue medications administered at any time during the treatment period.

Key secondary endpoints included were:

- Incidence of Overall Platelet Response (Durable and Transient Responders)
-  Number of Weekly Platelet Responses (defined as a platelet count of  50  x  10 9 /L on the weekly scheduled dose day from week 2 to week 25 inclusive)
- Proportion of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medications
- Incidence of Achieving Durable Platelet Response With Stable Dose (defined as a dose maintained within ± 1 µg/kg during the last 8 weeks of treatment)

In addition the following efficacy endpoints were included:

- Incidence of &gt; 25% reduction from baseline or discontinuation of concurrent ITP therapy
- Total number of weekly platelet counts increased by ≥ 20 x 10 9 /L from baseline
- Incidence of ≥ 20 x 10 9 /L increase from baseline in platelet count
- Time to first weekly platelet count increased by ≥ 20 x 10 9 /L from baseline
- Incidence of platelet response
- Time to first weekly platelet response
- Weekly platelet counts

A sample size of 60 subjects (40 romiplostim, 20 placebo) was chosen to provide a 87% power to detect the difference in the incidence of durable platelet response between romiplostim and placebo using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test at a significance level of 0.05. The probability of achieving durable platelet response with romiplostim and placebo was estimated at 50% and 10%, respectively.

## Randomisation

Randomization  was  stratified  by  baseline  concurrent  ITP  therapy  (yes  or  no)  within  each  study following a 2:1 treatment ratio. Subjects entering the screening period (defined as the point at which the subject signs the informed consent) received a unique 5-digit subject identification number from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).

## Blinding (masking)

The study was double-blinded.

## Statistical methods

The primary statistical inferences were based on the analysis of results from the Cochran -MantelHaenszel test for the odds ratio of the 2 treatment groups, including p-values and 95% confidence (CI) and adjusting for prior splenectomy status and baseline concurrent therapy.

The randomization was stratified to balance the treatment groups within the concurrent ITP therapy (yes or no). Efficacy was primarily assessed by comparing the incidence of durable platelet response between  the  romiplostim  and  placebo  groups.  The  null  hypothesis  was  that  there  would  be  no difference  between  the  groups  when  individual  dose  adjustment  based  on  platelet  counts  was permitted.

Descriptive statistics for demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized for all randomized  subjects.  For  categorical  variables,  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  in  each category were summarized. Continuous variables were summarized by n, mean, SD, median, Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), minimum, and maximum values.

## Recruitment

In  study  20030105  a  total  of  63  subjects  (21  placebo  and  42  romiplostim)  were  enrolled.  In  study 20030212  a  total  of  62  subjects  were  enrolled  (21  placebo  and  41  romiplostim).  The  duration  of treatment was 24 weeks and the follow-up was until week 36 or until patient had a platelet count &lt;50. 10 9 /L.

## Conduct of the study

In study 20030105 all randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of investigational product.  More than half of the subjects in the  placebo  group  (57.1%)  discontinued  investigational  product prematurely,  compared  with  4.8%  subjects  in  the  romiplostim  group.    Many  of  these  subjects continued on study with regard to tests and observations.  Similar proportions of subjects completed the study (90.5% vs 95.2% for placebo and romiplostim, respectively).

In  study  20030212  all  randomized  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  investigational  product. Subject 3651  randomized  to  placebo  inadvertently  received  3  doses  of  romiplostim.    Subjects  were analyzed  according  to  their  randomized  treatment  group  -  therefore,  the  1  subject  randomized  to placebo who inadvertently received 3 doses of romiplostim is counted in the placebo group.  Thus, these  analysis  sets  included  62  subjects  (21  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  and  41  subjects  in  the romiplostim group).

## Baseline data

Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the placebo and romiplostim groups within both pivotal studies (see Tables 14-16).

Study 20030213: 'An Open Label Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Long-Term Dosing of romiplostim in Thrombocytopenic Subjects with Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic

## Purpura (ITP)'

The study was designed to assess the safety and durability of platelet count increases with romiplostim treatment over an extended period. Subjects who had completed a prior romiplostim treatment study and whose platelet count subsequently fell below 50 x 10 9 /L could receive romiplostim. Subjects from Studies 20000137 or 20010218 entered at the initial weekly dose of 1 μ g/kg. Subjects entering from a blinded  study  (20030105  and  20030212)  were  un-blinded,  and  if  previously  receiving  romiplostim, entered the study on the same weekly dose as in the prior study. Placebo subjects began at the initial weekly dose of 1 μ g/kg and were adjusted accordingly. Dose adjustment rules for this study are shown in Table 20.

A total of 137 subjects were enrolled: 91 women (66.4%) and 46 men (33.6%). The median age was 53.0 years (range 42 to 63 years). Of the 137 subjects enrolled, 136 subjects received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. As of the data cut-off date (28 November 2006), 120 subjects (87.6%) are continuing the study and 17 (12.4%) have discontinued (7 due to withdrawn consent, 5 due to an adverse event, 3 due to death, 1 due to protocol-specified, and 1 due to other criterion).

At the time of data cut-off platelet response (doubling of baseline platelet count and platelet count ≥ 50 x 10 9 /L at any time on study in the absence of rescue medication within 8 weeks) was achieved in 82% of  subjects  (95%  CI:  75%,  88%).  Platelet  count  increase  of ≥ 20  x  10 9 /L  from  baseline  was reached in 86% of subjects; platelet count ≥ 50 x 10 9 /L was reached in 82% of subjects; platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 9 /L was reached in 75% of subjects; and platelet count ≥ 150 x 10 9 /L was reached in 64% of subjects.

One week after the first dose of romiplostim (i.e., at week 2), the proportion of subjects with platelet responses was 31%. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first platelet response was 2 weeks (95% CI: 2, 3) for the 50th percentile (median) and 7 weeks (95% CI: 5, 11) for the 75th percentile. The median romiplostim  dose  prior  to  first  platelet  response  was  3 μ g/kg  (range,  1  to  18 μ g/kg).  From  week  4 onwards, weekly incidence of response was in the range of 47% to 72%.

Median platelet count at baseline was 20 x 10 9 /L, and median platelet count 1 week after the first dose was 40 x 10 9 /L.

The overall subject incidence of rescue medication use was 34.6%. The rescue medications with the highest  subject  incidence  of  use  were  IVIG  and  corticosteroids.  The  subject  incidence  of  usage  of rescue medication decreased with time on study: the incidences at weeks 1 (n = 136), 13 (n = 100), 25 (n = 89), and 37 (n = 70) were 25%, 16%, 19%, and 15%, respectively.

Twenty-two percent of subjects (30/136) entered this study on concurrent ITP therapy. In most of the 30 subjects, a single therapy was being used. In 13 of these subjects (13/30 = 43%), concurrent ITP therapy was discontinued during the present study; and in 6 of these subjects (6/30 = 20%), dosage was reduced by &gt; 25%.

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  weekly  platelet  counts ≥ 20  x  10 9 /L  over  baseline  increased  more rapidly  for  subjects  who  had  previously  received  romiplostim  than  for  subjects  who  had  received placebo (week 1: 5.9% placebo, 13.8 romiplostim; week 2: 38.2% placebo, 66.7% romiplostim; week 3: 47.1% placebo, 73.8% romiplostim; week 4: 57.6% placebo, 72.6% romiplostim).

## Studies 20000109, 20040134 and 20040209

Supportive studies for the ITP indication were the 2 healthy subject studies, Studies 20000109 and 20040134.

Study  20040209  is  an  ongoing  open  label  individual  patient  protocol  of  romiplostim  in  severely refractory thrombocytopenic subjects with immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (and who did not qualify for ongoing romiplostim ITP studies). Romiplostim was administered by subcutaneous injection  at  a  starting  dose  of  3  µg/kg  once  weekly.  As  of  31  July  2006  a  total  of  17  subjects  had enrolled  in  the  study  with  a  median  age  of  52  years  (65%  women  and  35%  men).  At  baseline  the median platelet count was 10 x 10 9 /L. Peak platelet counts reached while on romiplostim ranged from 10 x 10 9 /L to 1672 x 10 9 /L with a median peak platelet count of 468 x 10 9 /L. Eight subjects responded in the absence of concomitant ITP medications.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Results  obtained  from  the  pivotal  studies  showed  that  the  efficacy  of  romiplostim  is  superior  to placebo. The efficacy database is robust and consistent and supported by the findings on both primary and secondary endpoints. In addition the long term extension study ITP showed that platelet response was durable in most patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In view of the CHMP bleedings should have been a secondary efficacy endpoint, however the data on bleedings  are  presented  under  the  safety  section.  From  the  submitted  data  reduced  bleedings  in romiplostim-treated patients supports efficacy shown in terms of durable platelet response. Although no  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  overall  incidence  of  bleeding  events  were  observed between  romiplostim  and  placebo  treated  patients,  bleeding  events  that  were  grade  2  or  higher  ( ≥ moderate) or grade 3 or higher ( ≥ severe, defined as clinically significant bleeding events) were less frequent in patients treated with romiplostim. However, this data cannot be regarded as conclusive and an  effect  of  romiplostim  in  terms  of  reduced  rate  of  bleedings  cannot  be  concluded.  A  warning addressing this uncertainty has been included in section 5.1 of the SPC.

In early clinical studies, the maximum dose of romiplostim was 30 µg/kg. This was later reduced to 10 µg/kg  due  to  lack  of  additional  clinical  benefit  of  doses  above  this  level.  Based  on  pre-clinical studies, no adverse effects were seen in rats given a single dose of 1000 μ g/kg or in monkeys after repeated administration of romiplostim at 500 µg/kg (100 or 50 times the maximum clinical dose of 10 µg/kg, respectively). In the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase above the normal range. Platelet counts should be monitored and appropriate treatment should be given (see section 4.2 of the SPC).

A loss  of  response  or  failure  to  maintain  a  platelet  response  with  romiplostim  treatment  within  the recommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity and increased bone marrow reticulin (see safety section).

Patients  already  receiving  ITP  medical  therapies  at  a  constant  dosing  schedule  were  allowed  to continue  receiving  these  medical  treatments  throughout  the  studies  (corticosteroids,  danazol  and/or azathioprine). Twenty-one non-splenectomised and 18 splenectomised patients received on-study ITP medical treatments (primarily corticosteroids) at the start of study. All (100%) splenectomised patients who were receiving romiplostim were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue the concurrent  ITP  medical  therapies  by  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  compared  to  17%  of  placebo treated  patients.  Seventy-three  percent  of  non-splenectomised  patients  receiving  romiplostim  were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of the study compared to 50% of placebo treated patients.

No overall differences in efficacy have been observed in patients &lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years of age, although care is advised considering the small number of elderly patients included in the clinical trials so far. In addition romiplostim is not recommended for use in children below age 18 and hepatic or renal impaired patients due to insufficient data on efficacy. These limitations have been included in section 4.2 of the SPC.

In  non-splenectomised  patients,  splenectomy  is  still  considered  as  a  potentially  curative  option. Therefore for this patient population the indication has not been granted as initially claimed by the applicant and it has been restricted to those patients in which splenectomy is contraindicated.

## Clinical safety

The clinical safety program of romiplostim included 14 clinical studies; 2 in healthy volunteers, 10 studies  in  patients  with  ITP  and  2  in  other  indications,  myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS)  and thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy (CIT). The safety database included 451 subjects (392 romiplostim-treated  subjects)  and  a  total  of  308  ITP  subjects  (271  romiplostim-treated  subjects).  A summary on the safety program is shown in Figure 9.

In the phase 3 ITP safety subset (subjects who where randomized to and received romiplostim in the phase  III,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  studies,  including  the  two  pivotal  studies  20030105  and 20030212) 84 patients were exposed to romiplostim with a median duration of exposure of 24 weeks. The  median  average  weekly  dose  for  these  patients  was  2.48  g/kg,  and  the  maximum  dose  was 15  g/kg. The median cumulative dose was 4098  g. In the phase 3 ITP long-term safety set subset (the phase 3 ITP safety subset plus the single arm extension study 20030213) 117 subjects received romiplostim  and  the  median  duration  of  exposure  for  these  patients  was  69.1  weeks.  The  median average weekly dose was 3.15  g/kg, and the maximum dose was 18  g/kg. The median cumulative dose was 8525  g.

##  Adverse events

The  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  for  ITP  patients  treated  with  romiplostim  was  91.5% (248/271).  Serious  adverse  events  that  were  related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator  were  observed with an incidence of 8.5% (23/271). The incidence of patients that reported at least 1 serious adverse event  was  25.5%  (69/271).  A  total  of  38  treatment-related  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  23 treated subjects. Table 22 shows the incidence of adverse events adjusted to study duration (per 100 patient-years).

N = number of subjects who received at least one dose of investigational product over the course of all ITP studies.

a Serious adverse event includes any event that is fatal, life-threatening (places subject at immediate risk of death), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other significant medical hazard.

Pt-yr = Total subject years on study.  n = Number of adverse events.  r = Study duration adjusted event rate per 100 subject-years (n / Pt-yr * 100).

Multiple occurrences of the same non-fatal event for a subject are counted as separate events. Multiple fatal adverse events for the same subject were counted once.

In the phase 3 ITP safety set, 84 (100%) romiplostim-treated subjects and 39 (95.1%) placebo-treated subjects  reported  an  adverse  event.  The  most  common  adverse  events  were  headache,  fatigue  and epistaxis  (see  Table  23  for  a  summary  of  adverse  effects).  Treatment-related  adverse  events  were reported in 34 (40.5%) patients treated with romiplostim and in 11 (26.8%) treated with placebo (see Table 23).

In this phase 3 ITP safety set the incidence of patients reporting at least 1 serious adverse event was 16.7% (14/84) in romiplostim-treated subjects and 19.5 (8/41) in placebo-treated subjects. There were 22  serious  adverse  events;  8  (19.5%)  occurred  in  placebo  subjects  and  14  (16.7%)  occurred  in romiplostim subjects. There were multiple reports for each of the following serious adverse events: gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  (2  romiplostim  subjects);  intracranial  haemorrhage  (1  subject  each  for placebo and romiplostim); pneumonia (2 placebo subjects); and platelet count decreased (2 placebo subjects and 1 romiplostim subject); all other serious adverse events were reported once.

-  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

During romiplostim clinical development 11 patients died in ITP studies and 3 in other indications (2 subjects during MDS studies and 1 subject during a CIT study). The fatal events in the ITP clinical studies occurred in 8 (2.5%) romiplostim-treated subjects and in 3 (6.5%) placebo-treated subjects. In 1  case  death  was  considered  to  be  related  to  romiplostim  therapy,  a  case  of  aplastic  anaemia.  See Table 25 for a summary of the fatal events.

a The subject was hospitalized for an intracranial hemorrhage that was moderate in severity.  A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed 5 to 7 mm hyperdensity in the right parietal white matter, and a chest radiograph showed an area of questionable right lobe pneumonia.

b The autopsy report noted the cause of death as acute cardiorespiratory failure secondary to overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis due to S pneumoniae .

c The clinical database erroneously included the cause of death for a subject 91701 in Study 20040209 as thrombophlebitis superficial.  The sponsor confirmed from the site that the subject did not die of this reported event, but instead died approximately 3 months after study discontinuation of a bleeding event related to ITP.

## Discussion on clinical safety

nd  bone  marrow  fibrosis,  thrombocythemia,  thromboembolic  events,  malignancies  and The size of the safety database is considered reasonable for a rare indication, especially considering that the treatment is intended for refractory patients. The main risks identified are increased reticulin formation  a bleedings due to lack of efficacy. In addition, immunogenicity has been identified as a risk as known for all therapeutic proteins. There are special warnings in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC addressing these risks:

considered. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in Increased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. Increased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can be  detected  through  bone  marrow  biopsy.  Therefore,  examinations  for  cellular  morphological abnormalities  using  peripheral  blood  smear  and  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  prior  to  and  during treatment  with  romiplostim  are  recommended.  If  a  loss  of  efficacy  and  abnormal  peripheral  blood smear  is  observed  in  patients,  administration  of  romiplostim  should  be  discontinued,  a  physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow biopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including consideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP treatment options should be reassessed.

a  theoretical  risk  for  thrombotic/thromboembolic Platelet  counts  above  the  normal  range  present complications.  However  an  association  between  these  events  and  elevated  platelet  counts  was  not observed and will be further investigated as part of the follow-up clinical studies that the Applicant has committed to perform in the post-approval phase.

ion  and  there  is  a  theoretical  concern  that There were cases reported of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in patients with MDS. The relationship to romiplostim treatment is unclear, however TPO receptor stimulators are growth factors  that  lead  to  thrombopoietic  progenitor  cell  expans they  may  stimulate  the  progression  of  existing  haematopoietic  malignancies  or  MDS.  Romiplostim should therefore not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials.

ith romiplostim. There  is  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding  associated  to  thrombocytopenia  if  romiplostim  treatment  is discontinued.  Patients  should  be  closely  monitored  for  a  decrease  in  platelet  count  and  medically managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment w he ns There is a potential risk for immunogenicity due to romiplostim treatment. To minimise this risk t Applicant  has  committed  to  provide  anti-romiplostim  and  TPO  antibody  testing  to  physicia whenever there is a suspicion that antibodies might be present.

d (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parameters have been observed in nonAlterations in re clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) but not in ITP patients. Monitoring of these parameters should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim and a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC.

In addition, there were 7 subjects experiencing renal dysfunction in the phase III studies and at least 1 had a potential  underlying  risk  factor  for  renal  impairment.  A  correlation  between  romiplostim  and renal impairment has not been observed however it is not clear whether romiplostin may have had a role in the deterioration of renal funtion in a limited number of patients. To address this concern the Applicant has committed to include renal impairment as a potential risk in the RMP as a follow-up measure post-authorisation.

, both in number of patients and length of follow up, mmitments: Overall a larger safety database is highly desirable especially  taking  into  account  that  romiplostim  is  a  first  in  class  drug  with  a  novel  mechanism  of action. For this purpose Applicant has committed to perform three follow-up clinical studies that will be submitted as post-authorisation co

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic activity of romiplostim and were similar regardless related to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at all tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week posttreatment recovery period, indicating reversibility.

s  when  romiplostim  was  administered  for  6  months  where  the  administration  of In 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit and  haemoglobin  was  observed.    There  was  also  a  stimulatory  effect  on  leukocyte  production,  as peripheral  blood  counts  for  neutrophils,  lymphocytes,  monocytes,  and  eosinophils  were  mildly increased.    In  the  longer  duration  chronic  monkey  study,  there  was  no  effect  on  the  erythroid  and leukocytic  lineage romiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly.

the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins cannot be reliably estimated.

The  carcinogenic  potential  of  romiplostim  has  not  been  evaluated.  Therefore,  the  risk  of  potential carcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown.

In  all  developmental  studies  neutralising  antibodies  were  formed,  which  may  have  inhibited romiplostim  effects.  In  embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  mice  and  rats,  reductions  in  maternal body weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a slight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross tal  barrier  in  rats  and  may  be  transmitted  from  the  mother  to  the  developing  foetus  and the  placen stimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats.

Patients had The efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry.  Study 20030105 evaluated patients  who  were  splenectomised  and  continued  to  have  thrombocytopenia.  In  addition  to  a splenectomy,  patients  had  a median  of  6  treatments  for  ITP  prior  to study  entry  including corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab, danazol, cytotoxic therapies, and azathioprine. Patients had a median platelet count of 14 x 10 9 /l at study entry.

Patients received single subcutaneous weekly injections for Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 10 9 /l) platelet counts. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3 µg/kg and for non-splenectomised patients was 2 µg/kg.

ents  during  the  6 month  treatment  period  in  the  placeboEfficacy has been shown in terms of a durable platelet response. A significantly higher proportion of patients  receiving  romiplostim  achieved  a  durable  platelet  response  compared  to  patients  receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study romiplostim maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 x 10 9 /l  in  between  50%  to  70%  of  pati controlled  studies.  In  the  placebo  group,  0%  to  7%  of  patients  were  able  achieve  a  platelet  count response during the 6 months of treatment.

However,  this  data  cannot  be  regarded  as Although  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  the  overall  incidence  of  bleeding  events  were observed  between  romiplostim  and  placebo  treated  patients,  bleeding  events  that  were  grade  2  or higher ( ≥ moderate) or grade 3 or higher ( ≥ severe, defined as clinically significant bleeding even were  les conclusive and an effect of romiplostim in terms of reduced rate of bleedings cannot be concluded.

## Safety

se events are headache Based on an analysis of all patients receiving romiplostim in the two ITP placebo-controlled studies, adverse  events  were  reported  in  39  (95.1%)  patients  while  receiving  placebo  (n = 41)  and  in 84 (100%)  patients  while  receiving  romiplostim  (n = 8 4).  Of  these  adverse  events  27.4%  were classified as severe. The incidences of the most frequent treatment-related adver (19% romiplostim treated patients; 7.3% placebo), myalgia (8.3% romiplostim; 0% placebo), fatigue (6% romiplostim; 2.4% placebo) and arthralgia (6% romiplostim; 0% placebo).

t  to  characterise  the  exact  magnitude of the risk. Additional potential The main risk identified is increased reticulin formation and bone marrow fibrosis. At least 10 out of 271  romiplostim-treated  patients  (3.7%)  reported  bone  marrow  abnormalities  during  ITP  studies. Histological samples have been obtained only for a limited amount of patients and the data provided by the Applicant is insufficien risks  identified  include  thrombocythemia,  thromboembolic  events,  malignancies,  immunogenictcity and effects on renal function.

Overall a larger safety dataset would have been highly desirable, especially taking into consideration that  romiplostim  has  a  novel  mechanism  of  action.  For  this  purpose  the  risks  associated  with romiplostim  treatment  will  be  prospectively  assessed  by  the  Applicant  in  the  context  of  post-

## Risk-benefit assessment

from the one that the Applicant initially applied for based The benefits of romiplostim in terms of platelet count have been demonstrated and replicated in two independent randomised clinical trials. This strength of evidence is uncommon in an orphan condition like  ITP  and  the  effect  of  romiplostim  should  be  placed  in  the  context  of  a  life  threatening  disease where limited therapeutic alternatives are possible. In splenectomised patients refractory to first line therapies  (corticosteroids  and  Iv  Ig)  and  in  non-splenectomised  patients  in  which  splenectomy  has been contraindicated romiplostim covers an unmet medical need. The indication for nonsplenectomised patients has been restricted on  the  fact  that  for  non-splenoctmised  patients,  splenectomy  is  a  therapeutic  option  that  could potentially affect the course of the disease.

r assessed in a larger population, and the compelling Considering  identified  and  potential  risks  and  uncertainties  (increased  reticulin  formation  and  bone marrow  fibrosis,  thrombocythemia,  thromboembolic  events,  malignancies,  immunogenitcity  and effects on renal function) that need to be furthe efficacy evidence shown in favor of romiplostim, it can be concluded that the benefits of the treatment overweight the risks for this patient population.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- routine pharmacovigilance were needed  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  additional risk minimisation activities were required.

Based consen on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by sus that the risk-benefit balance of Nplate indicated for:
