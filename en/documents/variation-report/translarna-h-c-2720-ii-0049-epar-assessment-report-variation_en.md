## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, PTC Therapeutics International Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 16 November 2018 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                                           | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.13                | C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | Type II | None               |

Submission of the final CSR for study PTC124-GD-030-DMD (Study 030) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 2 Study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy (nmDMD). This submission is also made in accordance with the requirements of the Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. The requested variation proposed no amendments to the Product Information. 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance The applicant proposes no amendments to the SmPC based on the results from Study 030. The interim report for this study, Study 030, was submitted in support of the extension of the indication to include nmDMD patients ranging 2-5 years of age. This was during procedure EMEA/H/C/002720/II/0037. In brief the study was a 4 week PK study, with an extension to 52 weeks, and an interim analysis at 28 weeks. The efficacy data comprised 28 week and 52 week assessment of the TFT and NSAA. The safety data contained reported adverse events and measured laboratory findings during the course of the study. There was no control arm included in the study. For the 28 week interim report the applicant submitted comparison to the historical data set CINRG. The 28 week data provided were considered not robust on their own, as there are too many factors which influence the interpretation and question the effect size and clinical relevance. However, the preliminary short term safety data seems in line with ≥5 years of age nmDMD patients. The reported adverse events in nmDMD patients 2-5 years of age were also in line with the patients aged ≥5 years of age and childhood illnesses. Moreover, from a treatment perspective, treatment should be initiated as early as possible. As the plasma concentration levels between the two groups, i.e. patients ≥2 to &lt;5 years of ag e and those ≥5 years of age, were comparable, a similar efficacy and safety profile could be assumed. This was already incorporated in the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For the 52 week assessment, no comparative data to historical data set is provided. Therefore, the previous conclusion remains, e.g. no conclusion can be drawn on the submitted data. However, based on comparable  plasma  levels  and  safety  profile,  also  a  comparable  efficacy  is  anticipated.  Thus,  the benefit-risk balance of ataluren, remains positive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ataluren is currently approved under conditional MA. The applicant is conducting a confirmatory safety and efficacy study in nmDMD patients aged &gt;5 years of age, study 041. To confirm the long term efficacy and safety in nmDMD patients aged 2-5 years of age, data will be collected in study 025o, an open label long term safety study.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                                            | Type Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| C.I.13               | C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | Type II None            |

In July 2018 the CHMP approved the extension to include patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years of age during the procedure EMEA/H/C/002720/II/037.  The data package included up to 28 week data of the current, study 030.

Submission of the final CSR for study PTC124-GD-030-DMD (Study 030) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 2 Study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy (nmDMD). This submission is also made in accordance with the requirements of the Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. is recommended for approval. Amendments to the marketing authorisation The variation leads to no amendments to the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation. The MAH already committed to include patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years of age in the long term observation study, Study 025o. This study includes both long term safety and long term efficacy assessments. 4. Introduction Ataluren (Translarna™) is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene (nmDMD), in ambulatory patients aged ≥ 2 years. Ataluren was granted a conditional market authorization in 2014 for ambulatory nmDMD patients aged ≥ 5 years of age. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH has now completed study 030 and in line with the PIP requirements has submitted the study results of a 52-week treatment period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

No new PK data was submitted by the applicant.

The PK data was assessed during the request for extension to include patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years of age during the procedure EMEA/H/C/002720/II/037.

## 6. Clinical Efficacy aspects

6.1. Study design/ method Study 030  was  a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  ataluren  in  subjects  aged  ≥2  to  &lt;5  years  old  with  nmDMD.  This  study included a 4-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period (the first 4 weeks of which included PK parameters), and a 4-week follow-up period for subjects who completed the treatment period (60 weeks total duration) (see Table 1). The objective of the extension period (treatment period after PK parameters have been completed) was to assess the long-term safety of chronic administration of ataluren in this patient population. The study report contains all efficacy, safety, and PK data. Dosing based on body weight was employed. Such dosing is common in pediatrics and reduces potential variability  in  exposure  by  accommodating differences in patient size across the span of ages of the patients who participated in the clinical study.

Evaluable Population: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of ataluren and had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measurement for TFTs, NSAA, or response to the palatability of ataluren questions. The evaluable population was used for the efficacy analyses. Table 2: Subject disposition A summary of demographic data is provided in Table 3. The mean age of subjects was 3.4 years, ranging from 2 to 4. All of the subjects were male. Six (42.9%) of the subjects were taking corticosteroids at baseline. All of the subjects reported taking concomitant medication during the study. Overall, the most common concomitant medications were taken for the alimentary tract and metabolism (12 subjects [85.7%]), including vitamins and supplements, ondansetron, simethicone, and macrogol. Nine (64.3%) subjects took ibuprofen and 7 (50%) took paracetamol at some point during the study. Systemic antiinfectives were taken by 8 subjects (57.1%) and systemic corticosteroids were taken by 7 (50%) subjects. Drugs for the respiratory system were used by 7 (50%) subjects and included salbutamol, brompheniramine, cetirizine hydrochloride, cyproheptadine, fluticasone propionate, and montelukast sodium. In addition, 1 subject was given IV heparin for prophylaxis and another subject was given batroxobin for a pre-existing indication. Medicinal product no longer authorised

CHMP Comments Generally, the patients agreed with the flavour of ataluren. Two patients (14.3%) did not agree with the flavour, which hampered the administration of ataluren as can be anticipated. 6.2.3. Time function test A summary of Timed Function Test results by visit is provided in Table 5,Table 6,Table 7 and Table 8, for each parameter assessed. Individual results are provided. All assessments showed overall improvements from baseline. The mean (SD) time taken to descend 4 standard stairs decreased by 7.17 (26.433) percent and 24.22 (28.322) percent at Week 28 (Visit 5) and Week 52 (Visit 7), respectively. A similar trend was seen for the stair climbing test, which demonstrated mean (SD) improvements of 9.10 (29.630) percent and 23.36 (26.249) percent at Week 28 and Week 52, respectively. Improvements in the stand from supine position assessment were similar at Week 28 and Week 52. The ten meter run/walk assessment showed mean (SD) improvements of 8.35 (22.778) percent at Week 28 and 14.54 (14.862) percent at Week 52. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## CHMP Comments

The current 28 week data presented differs slightly from the previous presented data submitted in the interim  report.  This  difference  cannot  be  explained  solely  on  the  differences  in  number  of  subjects included in the analysis. However, as these are minor differences and do not impact the outcome, this issue will not be pursued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP Comments

No conclusion can be drawn from this data, as no comparative data are provided. The patients in this population still develop and improve on the assessment scales used. The marginal improvement seen, could be due to the general development of this population. Moreover, the clinical relevance of the effect size is questionable.

## 6.2.4. North Star Ambulatory Assessment

16-Item Scale A summary of the 16-Item North Star Ambulatory Assessment total score by visit is provided in Table 9.

CHMP Comments: There appear to be minor changes in the assessment scores. However, no conclusions can be drawn from the data provided, see previous comments for the TFT. 6.3. Discussion Generally the data presented are in line with the previous submitted data, however minor differences in either the baseline mean values or treatment visit value at week 28 are observed between the interim report and current report for both TFT and NSAA. However, as these do not affect the outcome, this issue is not pursued. On the data itself no conclusions can be drawn, as there is no comparator arm included. Generally, a slight improvement  from  baseline  is  observed  for  both  TFT  and  NSAA,  however,  as  these  patients  are developing, this could reflect the general development of the patient population. The previous comments that the data are not considered robust on their own, as there are too many factors which influence the interpretation and question the effect size and clinical relevance, remain, thus no amendments to the SmPC are required.

7.2. Adverse events All 14 subjects in the study experienced at least 1 TEAE and 5 of these subjects had TEAEs classified as possibly  related  to  the  study  medication  (table  13).  No  subject  experienced  an  SAE  or  prematurely discontinued study drug due to an AE. Table 14 lists TEAE by incidence in the PK and extension phases. The most common TEAE was pyrexia, affecting 6 (42.9%) subjects at some point during the study. The next most common TEAEs were ear infection affecting 5 (35.7%) subjects, nasopharyngitis affecting 4 (28.6%) subjects, vomiting occurring in 4 (28.6%) subjects, rash affecting 3 (21.4%) subjects, and cough affecting 3 (21.4%) subjects. The TEAEs classified as possibly related to ataluren were rash, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting. All TEAEs possibly related to ataluren were classified as mild, except for 2  occurrences  of  vomiting  which  were  classified  as  moderate.  There  was  one  case  of  constipation classified as severe; this was not related to ataluren treatment. The dose of the drug was not changed as a result of any TEAE.

## CHMP Comments:

As mentioned during the analysis of the interim report, the reported adverse events are either in line with the adverse events known for the patients aged ≥5years of age or common childhood illnesses. There was no difference between the events reported in the interim report at 28 weeks and the current report at 52 weeks.

## 7.3. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Hematology : There were no clinically significant changes in any of the tests.

Biochemistry: No clinically significant changes were observed in biochemistry values after administration of  ataluren.  All  14  of  the  subjects  showed  abnormally  high  levels  of  ALT,  AST,  CK,  and/or  lactate dehydrogenase, which were observed before the first dose of ataluren. These were considered likely related to the pathophysiology of nmDMD and associated muscle loss observed in this patient population.

Urinalysis: Seven of the subjects showed abnormal urinalysis results at different timepoints during the study. These included ketones in the urine for 2 subjects at screening and occult blood, glucose, protein, nitrite, and leukocyte esterase in the urine for 6 subjects at scheduled study visits. Given the sporadic nature of these findings, often observed before treatment exposure, the abnormal findings are of no clinical relevance.

CHMP Comments The  biochemistry  and  urinalysis  data  presented  showed  abnormalities  generally  before  treatment exposure. It is therefore agreed with the MAH that these are likely related to the pathophysiology of nmDMD. 7.4. Vital signs and Electrocardiogram No clinically significant mean change from screening was observed in any vital sign parameter. No clinically significant abnormal results were found. CHMP Comments These findings correspond with the known effects of ataluren in DMD patients aged ≥5 years of age. 7.5. Discussion No unexpected safety issues were encountered. The adverse events reported are in line with the adverse events known for the patients aged ≥5years of age and some are common childhood illnesses. Medicinal product no longer authorised
