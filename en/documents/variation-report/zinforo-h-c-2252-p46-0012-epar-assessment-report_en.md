## 1. Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

This submission for Ceftaroline, in the treatment of cSSTI and CAP, relates to the submission of the results  from  the  clinical  study  P903-31  /  D3720C00007  (randomised,  observer-blinded  study  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone in  paediatric  patients,  ages  2  months  to  &lt;  18  years,  with  CAP  requiring  hospitalization)  which  is  a completed study from the EU Risk Management Plan and Paediatric Investigation Plan.

The  full  benefit  and  risk  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  will  be  evaluated  when  the  additional studies in this plan have been completed. Paediatric patient exposure will continue to be specified as missing information in the EU Risk Management Plan until the completion of the paediatric studies. In view of this no changes to the SPC and proposed at this stage.

The overall benefit to risk balance for Zinforo is not affected by this new information  and therefore does  not  require  taking  further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing  authorization  for  Zinforo  at  this stage.

## About the product

Ceftaroline fosamil is the prodrug of ceftaroline and is rapidly converted to microbiologically active drug after intravenous (iv) administration. Ceftaroline, inhibits bacterial cell growth by interfering with cell wall  biosynthesis.  Ceftaroline  has  high  affinity  for  PBP2a  and  is  highly  potent  against  resistant staphylococci.  Ceftaroline  has  also  been  shown  to  bind  with  high  affinity  to  PBPs  in  S.  pneumoniae including modified forms of PBP2x which are common in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP).

Ceftaroline is approved for treatment of adult patients with cSSTI and CAP in the EU since August 2012. The recommended dosing regimen is 600 mg (reduced to 400 mg for patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 to ≤50 mL/min) administered as a 60-minute infusion every 12 hours (q12h) for 5 to 14 days for cSSTI and 5 to 7 days for CAP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Clinical

As  part  of  the  EU-RMP  and  PIP,  the  MAH  conducted  the  clinical  study  P903-31  /  D3720C00007  (A randomised,  observer-blinded  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ceftaroline  versus ceftriaxone in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with CAP requiring hospitalization).

The study is described briefly below (for further details please refer to the full CSR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study D3720C00007

## Study design

This was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone in pediatric subjects aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years with CABP requiring hospitalization.

Subjects were stratified by age cohort and region and were randomly assigned to treatment in a 3:1 ratio, ceftaroline fosamil to ceftriaxone. The following age cohorts were defined:

Cohort 1: children from 12 years to &lt; 18 years

Cohort 2: children from 6 years to &lt; 12 years

Cohort 3: children from 24 months to &lt; 6 years

Cohort 4: young infants/toddlers from 2 months to &lt; 24 months

A minimum of 7 intravenous (IV) doses was required for subjects randomized to ceftaroline fosamil. A switch to open label oral study drug (amoxicillin clavulanate) was allowed on or after Study Day 4 if a subject met the protocol-specified criteria.

## Study site and dates

The  study  was  conducted  by  Cerexa,  US  between  14/01/2013  and  10/04/2014.  The  study  had appropriate ethics approval and was performed according to GCP. Fifty sites were enrolled but only 34 actually enrolled patients for the study.

## Study Objectives

## Primary

-To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone in pediatric subjects, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) requiring hospitalization

## Secondary

-To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ceftaroline  versus  ceftriaxone  in  pediatric  subjects  with  CABP  requiring hospitalization

-To  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  ceftaroline  in  pediatric  subjects  ages  2  months  to  &lt;  18 years with CABP requiring hospitalization ( This analysis is reported separately )

## Study population

Male  and  female  subjects  2  months  to  &lt;  18  years  of  age;  CABP  (meeting  the  protocol-specified criteria) requiring hospitalization and IV antibacterial therapy; acute onset or worsening within 5 days before randomization of at least 2 clinical signs or symptoms of CABP (ie, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, grunting,  sputum  production,  chest  pain,  cyanosis,  evidence  of  pneumonia  with  parenchymal consolidation, increased work of breathing) and at least 1 of the following: organism consistent with a typical respiratory pathogen identified or isolated from a respiratory or blood culture, leukocytosis, &gt; 15% immature white blood cells, leukopenia or hypoxemia.

## Study medications

## Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

IV ceftaroline fosamil infused over 60 (± 10) minutes every 8 hours (q8h [± 1 hour]) as follows: Children ≥ 6 months: ceftaroline fosamil 12 mg/kg for subjects weighing ≤ 33 kg or 400 mg for subjects weighing &gt; 33 kg

Children &lt; 6 months: ceftaroline fosamil 8 mg/kg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:

IV ceftriaxone at a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 4 g/day, given in equally divided doses, each infused over 30 (± 10) minutes every 12 hours (q12h [± 2 hours]).

## Optional Oral Switch, Dose and Mode of Administration:

Amoxicillin  clavulanate  was  the  drug  specified  to  be  administered  for  the  optional  oral  therapy.  A recommended total daily dose of up to 90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin clavulanate was to be divided equally q12h.

## Duration of Treatment

Total duration of study drug therapy was 5 to 14 days, inclusive; a minimum of 3 days (7 infusions for subjects randomized to ceftaroline fosamil) of IV study drug therapy was required. The total duration of subject participation was expected to be 26 to 50 days, inclusive.

## Criteria for Evaluation

-Clinical  and  microbiological  outcomes  by  subject  and  by  baseline  pathogen  at  TOC  in  the mMITT and ME populations

- -Clinical relapse at Late Follow-up (LFU) in the MITT Population
- -Emergent infections in the mMITT Population
- -30-day all-cause mortality in the MITT Population

## Safety:

Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs; clinical laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements

## Statistical methods

## The following study populations were defined:

-ITT  Population:  all  randomized  subjects  with  study  drug  assignment  designated  according  to  initial randomization,  regardless  of  whether  subjects  receive  study  drug  according  to  the  randomization schedule, or receive a different drug from that to which they were randomized

-Safety Population: all randomized subjects who received any amount of study drug

-MITT Population: all randomized subjects who receive any amount of IV study drug and who have a confirmed diagnosis of CABP.

-CE Population: a subset of the MITT Population and will include subjects who meet minimal disease criteria for CABP and all evaluability criteria as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

-mMITT Population: a subset of the MITT Population, including subjects for whom at least 1 typical bacterial pathogen had been identified from an adequate microbiological specimen at baseline

-ME Population: all subjects who met the criteria for both the CE and mMITT populations.

-PK Population: all randomized subjects who received a known amount of ceftaroline fosamil and who had  had  at  least  1  PK  sample  collected  (excluding  those  who  received  blood  or  blood  component transfusions within 24 hours before any PK sample was drawn)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy: Efficacy response was analyzed using the MITT, CE, mMITT, and ME populations. Proportions of  subjects  with  favorable  efficacy  responses  were  displayed  by  treatment  group,  both  overall  and within  each  age  cohort.  The  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  efficacy  response  rates  was calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both the within-group response rates and the between-group difference for each efficacy response.

Safety:  Safety  parameters  (AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  and  vital  signs measurements) were summarized for the Safety Population.

## Study monitoring

An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established to review safety data from this study,  and  other  ongoing  pediatric  studies  of  ceftaroline  fosamil,  at  prespecified  intervals  to  ensure safety of all subjects enrolled.

## Results

Study Disposition

Subjects were stratified  by  region  and  age  cohort.  A  total  of  161  subjects  were  randomized  3:1  to receive  study  drug  (122  subjects  to  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  39  subjects  to  ceftriaxone)  (ITT Population). All but 1 subject were treated with study drug and were included in the Safety Population.

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

The  majority  of  subjects  were  white,  with  a  mean  age  of  4.19  years  (range  10  weeks  through  17 years). Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The majority of subjects had normal renal function, and no subjects had moderate or severe renal impairment.

## Efficacy

-The clinical response and stability at Study Day 4 were similar between the 2 treatment groups in the MITT Population: 69.2% and 66.7% of subjects were responders and 34.6% and 36.1% of subjects were clinically stable in the ceftaroline and ceftriaxone groups, respectively.

## Safety results

Study drug exposure was similar between the ceftaroline and ceftriaxone groups. The median duration of IV treatment was 5.0 and 6.0 days, respectively. More than half of the subjects switched to oral study drug; the median duration of oral study drug treatment was 6 days in both the ceftaroline and ceftriaxone groups.

Similar percentages of subjects in each treatment group reported at least 1 TEAE. (45.5% and 46.2% in the ceftaroline and ceftriaxone groups, respectively). The incidence of SAEs was low. Seven subjects reported SAEs, with the overall percentage in each group low (5% in the ceftaroline group and 2.6% in the  ceftriaxone  group).  No  SAEs  were  related  to  study  drug.  Two  subjects  in  the  ceftaroline  group discontinued IV study drug due to an AE. No deaths were reported during the study.

No  trends  were  seen  in  changes  from  baseline  for  clinical  laboratory  parameters.  The  incidence  of potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities was low and no subject met potential Hy's law criteria.  Mean  changes  over  time in  vital  signs  measurements  were  similar between  both  treatment groups and consistent with improvement in the underlying infection over the course of the study.

## Applicant's Conclusion

Safety data indicate that treatment of pediatric subjects with CABP with ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated. The clinical outcomes in the ceftaroline treatment group were comparable to those in the ceftriaxone treatment group.

## 2.3 Discussion

The  study  was  designed  to  primarily  look  at  safety  and  tolerability  of  ceftaroline  in  the  mentioned doses in patients with CABP requiring hospitalisation. Ceftriaxone was selected as an active comparator agent for its microbiological spectrum of activity, effectiveness as treatment for CABP, its widespread global  use,  and  acceptance  as  a  therapy  for  CABP  based  on  expert  opinion  and  national  adult  CAP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

guidelines.  The  switch  to  oral  therapy  at  the  investigator's  discretion  is  based  on  normal  clinical practice.

In the study there were no unexpected safety issues, the tolerability was good and efficacy was similar to the comparator. Although PK results will be reported separately, it appears the choice of doses for the various cohorts was appropriate based on the efficacy seen.

In  addition  to  this  study,  further  studies  are  planned  as  part  of  PIP.  Therefore  no  further  action  is proposed at this stage.

## 2.4 Changes to the product information

The MAH proposed no changes to the Product Information, which is acceptable at this stage as further paediatric studies are planned.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Based  on  the  results  of  the  newly  completed  study  which  evaluates  the  safety  and  tolerability  of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with CAP requiring hospitalization,  it  is  considered  that  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ceftaroline  in  this  population  is acceptable and no unexpected concerns have been identified.

Therefore this does not change the benefit/risk balance.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  benefit/risk  balance  remains  positive  in  the  approved  indications  at  present.  A  final  decision regarding any change to the product literature related to the paediatric population will be taken upon completion of all the clinical studies planned in this population under the PIP.
