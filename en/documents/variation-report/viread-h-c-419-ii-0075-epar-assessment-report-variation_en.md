## Introduction

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) is the salt of the oral prodrug of tenofovir. Tenofovir, a nucleoside  monophosphate  (nucleotide)  analogue  is  metabolised  to  the  active  metabolite,  tenofovir diphosphate,  a  competitive  inhibitor  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  reverse transcriptase.  Tenofovir  has  an in  vitro and in  vivo antiviral  activity  against  retroviruses  and hepadnaviruses, including HIV-2 and hepatitis B Virus (HBV).

Viread (tenofovir DF), 245 mg film coated tablets in a once daily regimen is approved in the European Union (EU) for the therapeutic management of HIV-1 infected adult patients since 5 February 2002. Tenofovir DF is also approved in fixed-dose combination products (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients as part of a combination antiretroviral therapy.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for an extension of the therapeutic indication of Viread  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  Hepatitis  B  adult  patients  in  the  present  type  II  variation application.

Hepatitis B infection represents a major global health problem with nearly 350 million people being infected. In Europe the carrier rate varies from around 0.5% in the northern regions to 1-8% in the Mediterranean and Eastern regions. The goal of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infected adult patients is to prevent progression to cirrhosis and /or hepatocellular carcinoma and the current treatment strategy is  the  achievement  of  a  profound  and  durable  suppression  of  HBV  DNA.  Current  inter-/national guidelines  recommend  treatment  in  patients  with  HBeAg-positive  and  HBeAg-negative  chronic hepatitis  B  with  moderate/severe  hepatitis  on  biopsy,  serum  HBV  DNA  (&gt;10 5 copies/ml  and  &gt;10 4 copies/ml, respectively) and elevated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels.

Currently available treatment options include in addition to interferon the following anti-virals:

-  Lamivudine: rapid development of resistance if used as monotherapy (about 2/3 after 4 years);
-  Adefovir dipivoxil: estimated cumulative resistance at 5 year about 25%;
-  Entecavir: reduced activity in case of lamivudine resistance;
-  Telbivudine: selects for mutants cross-resistant to lamivudine/entecavir. Sparse long-term data available;

There is  a  medical  need  for  new  therapeutic  options  for  naïve  patients  as  well  as  for  patients  with resistant  HBV  with  improved  efficacy  and  safety  profiles,  with  durable  response  and  with  low potential for developing viral resistance.

## Non-clinical aspects

Comprehensive non-clinical study programmes have been performed and reviewed at the time of the Marketing Authorisation Applications  (MAA) of tenofovir  DF, or  fixed  combination  products  with tenofovir DF, for the treatment of HIV infection. A summary of non-clinical pharmacokinetics and toxicology with the key findings was submitted together with new non-clinical pharmacology data in relation to the applied therapeutic indication.

## Pharmacology

## Mechanism of action

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir by serum esterases. Intracellularly, tenofovir is phosphorylated into its active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate was reported in  human  hepatic  cells,  and  in  primary  human  hepatocytes  with  a  half  life  of  95  hours.  Tenofovir diphosphate  inhibited  recombinant  HBV  polymerase  with  a  kinetic  inhibition  constant  (Ki)  of 0.18 μ mol/l.  Inhibition  of  viral  polymerases  occurs  by  direct  binding  competition  with  the  natural deoxyribonucleotide  substrate  (deoxyadenosine  triphosphate  -  dATP)  and,  after  incorporation  into DNA, by DNA chain termination.

## In vitro anti-HBV activity

The in vitro antiviral  activity  of  tenofovir against an HBV laboratory strain, assessed in the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line, was characterised by EC50 values in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 μ mol/l, with CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values &gt; 100 μ mol/l. Tenofovir inhibited various wild-type HBV clinical isolates (genotypes A, C, D) with a comparable activity with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 μ mol/l.

## In vitro resistance

No  HBV  polymerase  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  tenofovir  DF  have  been  currently identified.

An  HBV  rtA194T  mutation,  developed  in  the  background  of  the  rtL180M + rtM204V  lamivudine associated  combined  mutation,  was  reported  in  two  patients  receiving  antiretroviral  treatments including  tenofovir  DF  and  lamivudine.  Studies  showed  that  rtA194T  mutation  alone  has  no significant  effect  on  tenofovir  DF  susceptibility  (1.5-fold  increase  in  tenofovir  EC50).  The  rtA194T mutation in combination with the rtL180M + rtM204V mutations led to a 2.4-fold increase in tenofovir EC50 which is not significantly different from the 2.1-fold increase observed with rtL180M+rtM204V mutations alone.

Clinical studies have shown that tenofovir DF inhibited lamivudine-resistant HBV suggesting that a 2to 3- fold change in in vitro susceptibility to tenofovir is not clinically relevant.

Tenofovir DF demonstrated similar activity against all four major patterns of lamivudine resistance mutations identified in patients who failed lamivudine therapy.

Table 1 . In vitro antiviral activities against lamivudine resistant hepatitis B virus

| HBV mutant                  | Tenofovir       | Lamivudine        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Wild type                   | EC50 (µM) 0.77  | EC50 (µM) 0.06    |
| rtL180M + rtM204V           | 0.8 fold change | >700 fold change  |
| rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V | 1.8 fold change | >1000 fold change |
| rtM204I                     | 2.1 fold change | >1000 fold change |
| rtL180M + rtM204I           | 0.7 fold change | >1000 fold change |

In  cell  based  assays,  HBV  strains  expressing  the  rtV173L,    rtL180M,  and  rtM204I/V  mutations associated  with  resistance  to  lamivudine  and  telbivudine  showed  a  susceptibility  to  tenofovir  DF ranging from 0.7 to 3.4-fold that of wild type virus.

HBV  strains  expressing  rtA181V  and  rtN236T  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to  adefovir dipivoxil showed a 2.9- to 4.5-fold reduced sensitivity to tenofovir DF in vitro .  The effects of other adefovir  resistance  associated  mutations  or  combinations  of  mutations,  rtA181T,  rtA181V/rtN236T and rtA181T/rtN236T resulted in a reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir of 1.5-, 10- and 3.0-fold each, respectively. The clinical significance of these in vitro results is currently unknown.

| A181T        | 1.5                 | 1.2                 |

The mutations conferring resistance to entecavir have been identified as changes at rtI169T, rtT184G, rtS202I/G and rtM250V in combination with the pre-existing lamivudine resistance mutations. In vitro phenotypic analysis showed that the tested entecavir resistance mutations resulted in increased EC50 values for tenofovir DF ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold.

Laboratory isolates. a) Clinical isolates

In  vitro activity  of  tenofovir  is  similar  to  that  of  adefovir.  Combinations  of  tenofovir  DF  with lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, adefovir and emtricitabine resulted in additive to slightly synergistic anti-HBV activity. Tenofovir DF has shown activity against lamivudine, telbivudine and entecavir  resistant  HBV  and  appears  to  retain  activity  against  some  adefovir  resistant  HBV  strains. Mutations in the HBV polymerase associated with resistance to tenofovir DF are currently unknown.

## In vivo efficacy in animal models

An in  vivo study  in  HBV infected woodchucks showed that tenofovir DF administered orally at 15 mg/kg  for  48  weeks  produced  a  mean  serum  viral  load  reduction  of  2.9  log10  copies/ml  and combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine resulted in a reduction of 5.8 and 6.1 log10 copies/ml, respectively. There was no evidence of toxicity in woodchucks treated with tenofovir DF, either alone or in combination. There were 11 deaths during the study. Post mortem findings in 7 cases included hepatocellular carcinoma. Group sizes were small to allow a definitive conclusion.

## Pharmacokinetics

The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of tenofovir/tenofovir DF were evaluated in a variety  of  animal  models  in  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  studies  at  the  time  of  the  MAA  of tenofovir DF, or fixed combination products with tenofovir DF. In addition, the in  vitro interaction profile was characterised with human cytochrome 450 (CYP) isoforms and renal transporters.

Upon hydrolysis, the prodrug forms two molecules of formaldehyde for each molecule of the active compound.  Formaldehyde  exposure  was  estimated  to  be  0.5  mg/kg/day  for  a  70  kg  person.  The potential  effects  of  formaldehyde  were  discussed  in  a  comprehensive  summary  of  long  term  oral studies  in  rats.  Based  on  a  no-observed-effect  level  (NOEL)  of  30  mg/kg/day  for  gastro-intestinal toxicity in the chronic rat study, a 6-fold safety margin relative to formaldehyde exposure in humans following  a  300-mg/day  dose  of  tenofovir  DF  could  be  determined.  Mouse  and  rat  carcinogenicity studies  previously  performed,  concluded  that  there  were  no  significant  concerns,  regarding  the carcinogenic potential of tenofovir DF in patients.

Little or no inhibition of CYP P450 isozymes was observed in human hepatic microsomes. The protein binding of tenofovir DF was low. Tenofovir was excreted unchanged in the urine of all animal species tested,  and  renal  excretion  was  identified  as  the  primary  route  of  elimination.  Results  of in  vitro studies indicate that active renal tubular secretion of tenofovir DF in humans is mediated by the uptake of tenofovir from the plasma into proximal tubule cells by the influx transporters hOAT1 and hOAT3 (human organic anion transporters 1 and 3) and its efflux from proximal cells into the urine by the MRP4 (multidrug resistant protein 4). The active transporters involved in the luminal transport and the possibility of polymorphism in these were further discussed has predictor factors of renal toxicity. The currently available information is limited and not consensual to allow a conclusion.

## Toxicology

High doses of tenofovir DF have been coupled to nephrotoxicity resulting in acute renal failure. No effect dose levels were identified in monkey and dogs. Clinical data on long-term use of tenofovir DF

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  HIV-1 infected  patients  suggests  no  causal  association  between  tenofovir  DF  therapy  and  renal events.  However, postmarketing safety data indicates that tenofovir DF may, in rare circumstances, cause  renal  adverse  reactions,  including  renal  failure,  Fanconi  syndrome,  and  other  proximal tubulopathies.

The potential for renal toxicity of tenofovir DF is well known and has been documented clinically. Management of the risk of renal toxicity is recommended in the product information.

In  rat  and  monkey,  tenofovir  DF  was  shown  to  decrease  serum  phosphate  levels.  Clinical  data (studies GS-98-902 and GS-99-907) showed that the incidence of hypophosphatemia in the tenofovir DF group was slightly higher than in the placebo group following 24 weeks of treatment (13% vs 8% of patients). The rate of occurrence of hypophosphatemia does not appear to increase over time.

In  non-clinical  studies,  the  bone  was  a  target  organ  (osteomalacia  or  reduction  in  bone  mineral density).  Currently,  there  is  no  evidence  from  clinical  studies  that  dosing  with  tenofovir  DF  is associated with an increased risk of fractures. Long-term clinical data demonstrated a minimal risk of bone toxicity. Osteomalacia, occurring as a result of tenofovir DF associated proximal tubulopathy, was identified as a rare adverse reaction during postmarketing surveillance.

No  marked  hepatotoxicity  of  tenofovir  DF  was  reported  in  non-clinical  studies.  Tenofovir  is  not metabolised, does not interact significantly with P450 enzymes, and is not excreted to any significant extent  by  the  liver.  Results  from  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment demonstrated  that  tenofovir  DF  300  mg  once  daily  may  be  administered  without  regard  to  hepatic function.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An  ecotoxicology/environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  according  to  the currently applicable guidelines  was  submitted.  In  Phase  I  a  worst-case  PEC  (predicted  environmental  concentration)  in surface  water  of  3.0  µg/l  was  calculated.  This  was  higher  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/l  and  a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was performed.

The phase II analysis did not indicate any environmental concerns with the use of tenofovir DF. The final  report  of  study  AD-104-2007  ( Tenofovir  Disoproxil  Fumarate -Aerobic  and  Anaerobic Transformation  in  Aquatic  Sediment  Systems  Following  OECD  Guideline  308 )  for  which  interim results were available will be provided as a post-approval follow-up measure.

## Clinical aspects

The main clinical data to support this application included efficacy and safety information of tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily in patients with chronic HBV from two identical randomised, 48 week doubleblind, controlled phase III studies evaluating tenofovir DF vs adefovir dipivoxil:

- -in HBeAg negative patients: Study GS-US-174-102;
- -in HBeAg positive patients: Study GS-US-174-103;

Supportive data included interim data from two phase II, randomised, double-blind studies:

- -blinded efficacy and safety data from GS-US-174-106 exploring tenofovir DF vs emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF  fixed  dose  combination  in  patients  currently  receiving  adefovir dipivoxil with persistent viral replication;
- -blinded safety data from study GS-US-174-108, which compares tenofovir DF, emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, and entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects with decompensated liver disease.

In addition, data from study GS-00-484 (ACTG 5127), a randomised, double-blind, study comparing tenofovir DF with adefovir dipivoxil in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B with prior lamivudine experience and data from a pharmacokinetic study (GS-US-174-105) evaluating the potential interactions between the combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and tacrolimus in healthy volunteers were also provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

The results of pharmacokinetic studies of tenofovir DF, including studies in HIV-1 infected subjects, special populations, and drug interaction studies, have been previously submitted and are reflected in the product information for Viread.

One new clinical pharmacology study (GS-US-174-105) was submitted. This is an interaction study, evaluating potential pharmacokinetic interaction between tacrolimus and the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF.

## Target population

No pharmacokinetics studies have been performed with tenofovir DF in patients with hepatitis B virus infection.  Due  to  the  renal  excretion  of  tenofovir  and  to  the  low  degree  of  protein  binding  no pharmacokinetic differences are expected as compared to healthy subjects.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  in  non -HIV-1  and  non-HBV  infected  subjects  with either normal renal function or varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD)  requiring  hemodialysis,  is  mainly  based  on  study  GS-01-919  results.  The  current  dosing recommendation  (interval  adjustment)  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  various  degrees  of  renal impairment is based on limited data and at the time considered not an optimal option. However, as no other  alternative  dosage  formulation  was  available  and  due  to  the  identified  medical  need  it  was agreed not to absolute contraindicate the use of tenofovir DF in severe renal impairment HIV infected patients.

The main clinical studies  submitted in  support  of  tenofovir  DF  in  HBV  infected  patients,  excluded patients with creatinine clearance &lt;70 ml/min. This again raised concerns regarding the appropriateness  of  the  current  dose  recommendation  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal impairment in cases where treatment benefit outweighs the risk in this new patient population.

The  MAH  presented  simulated  tenofovir  steady-state  pharmacokinetic  parameters  following  doseinterval  adjustment  for  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment  from  study  GS-01-919 (Table 4), based on which estimations for each 24 hours over the week were done in subjects with severe renal impairment (Table 5).

a  Represents  alternating  twice  weekly  Q 96  followed  by  Q 72  dosing  and  recalculated  from  simulated  steady-state tenofovir concentration-time data presented in the GS-01-919 Clinical Study Report.

Even considering that the estimated in vitro hepatocellular half-life is 95 hours, the consequences of having Cmin values ranging from 1.75 to 157 (Table 4) in the severe renal impairment group and with a dosing interval of 72-96 hours cannot be clearly determined.

The  exposure  for  each  24  hours  for  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  illustrates  variability  in addition to difference in renal function. The exposure is very high during the days of dosing (3-6 times higher than subjects with creatinine clearance &gt;50 ml/min but with a wide range at later hours). The CHMP  agrees  that  the  current  dosing  is  not  optimal.  However,  it  is  acknowledge  that  due  to circumstances of medical need, in which tenofovir DF could be the only option even in the setting of moderate  or  severe  renal  compromise  with  end-stage  liver  disease,  lamivudine-resistant  virus  or persistent viral replication on adefovir dipivoxil treatment, the CHMP agrees that tenofovir DF should not be absolute contraindicated in severe renal impairment patients. Rather a strong warning stressing that  tenofovir  DF  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with  chronic  HB  and  moderate/severe  renal impairment,  if  the  potential  benefits  of  treatment  outweigh  the  potential  risks,  was  included  in  the SPC. Consequently the wording on dosing regimens was amended.

The  MAH  committed  to  generate  additional  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal impairment  and  chronic  HBV  infection,  including  safety  data  and  steady-state  pharmacokinetics. A comprehensive  plan  of  action  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  approval  for  the  hepatitis  B indication.  A  new  study  in  HBV  patients  with  decompensated liver disease with baseline creatinine clearance  between  20  and  60  ml/min  will  be  submitted, and  data  will  be  collected  from  2  ongoing studies (study GS-203-107 in stable subjects who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation with calculated clearance ≥ 40 ml/min and study GS-174-108 in subjects with decompensated liver disease with calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min).

In  addition  to  the  above  plans  pertaining  to  moderate/severe  renal  impairment, there will  be a 250patient,  multicenter,  randomised study including participants with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min) and lamivudine-resistant HBV.

Furthermore, the MAH has undertaken the post-approval commitment to provide the CHMP with the status of the development of an alternative dosage formulation.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir after a 300 mg dose of tenofovir DF were studied in non HIV-1 infected  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment  according  to  the  Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT)  classification  (Study  GS-01-931  A/B).  Tenofovir  pharmacokinetics  were  not  substantially altered as compared with unimpaired patients. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment.

## Gender

An Ad hoc analysis of study GS-US-174-102 comparing tenofovir DF pharmacokinetic parameters in female and male subjects with chronic HB showed no major difference in plasma pharmacokinetics. However, based on the average profiles it seems as the plasma concentration time profile differs i.e. females have higher Cmax (65%) and slightly higher AUCtau (22%). From the findings in the HIV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

programme it is  agreed  that  in  general  tenofovir  plasma  exposure  are  similar  between  females  and males.

## Elderly

Pharmacokinetics has not been studied in the elderly population (subjects&gt;65). Considering that this population is more likely to have a decreased renal function, caution should be exercised when treating elderly with tenofovir DF.

## Interactions

Study GS-US-174-105, an open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study evaluated the effect of coadministration  of  tacrolimus  on  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF fixed  dose  combination  in  31  healthy  volunteers  (18-45  years  of  age).  The  pharmacokinetics  of tacrolimus was not altered upon coadministration with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF.

The  geometric  mean  Cmax  for  tenofovir  was  the  only  pharmacokinetic  parameter  with  the  90% confidence intervals (CI) upper bound above the predefined limit of 125%. The 13% increase in Cmax of tenofovir in the presence of tacrolimus, is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.

The possibility  that  tacrolimus  inhibits  any  of  the  transport  proteins  involved  in  active  secretion  of tenofovir,  potentially  increasing  the  risk  for  renal  toxicity  was  further  discussed,  as  well  as  other possible inhibitors of transport proteins (e.g cyclosporine) expected to interact with the luminal efflux transport.  Based  on  the  currently  available  data,  no  renal  drug  interactions  caused  by  inhibition  of these transport proteins have been identified.

All  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  tenofovir  DF  and  other  antiretroviral drugs tested are reflected in the interaction section of the SPC. Furthermore, it has been shown that the co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir with tenofovir DF increased tenofovir exposure. A precautionary statement was included in the SPC to inform prescribers that, in case of coadministration,  the  higher  tenofovir  concentrations  could  potentiate  tenofovir  associated  adverse events, including renal disorders. In vitro studies suggested that the mechanism is mediated through inhibition of intestinal p-glycoprotein (p-gp) by these protease inhibitors.

Based on raw data no interactions have been currently observed between entecavir and tenofovir DF. This information is reflected in the interactions table of the product information.

No  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  have  been  identified  when  a  single-dose  of  adefovir dipivoxil was co-administered with tenofovir DF in healthy volunteers. However, given their common renal  toxicity,  their  co-administration  is  not  recommended.  A  warning  statement  was  therefore included in the SPC and referred in the interactions table.

## Clinical efficacy

## Dose-response studies

No dose-activity studies were conducted in patients with chronic HB. The Ki of tenofovir against HBV polymerase (0.18 µmol/l) was similar to the Ki against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (0.02-1.6 µmol/l). Similar  concentration  produced  50%  inhibition  of  viral  replication  (EC50) in vitro (HBV  EC50 = 0.14 -2.5 μ mol/l, HIV EC50 = 0.5 -2.2 μ mol/l). Since 300 mg of tenofovir DF has been established as the optimal dose for HIV-1, it is also considered to be optimal for HBV.

However, given the potency of the drug, it cannot be excluded that a lower dose could have allowed to obtain an acceptable efficacy level with an improved renal tolerance as compared to that observed in HIV infected patients.

## Main Studies

The 48 week results from two pivotal phase III studies (GS-US-174-102 and GS-US-174-103) were submitted. These studies were similar in design, involving 48 weeks of double blind therapy with TDF 300  mg  once  daily  (QD)  or  adefovir  dipivoxil  (ADV)  10  mg  QD,  followed  by  open-label  TDF treatment through week 240 (ongoing). An overview of the main clinical studies is presented in the table below.

The inclusion criterion on renal function was considered too restrictive. Although the criteria for study -103 seemed consistent with the inclusion of the HBeAg+ target population on need for HBV therapy, a necroinflammatory score ≥ 4 (rather than ≥ 3) should have preferably been chosen.

## Endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  both  studies  was  complete  response  at  week  48  (HBV  DNA levels &lt; 400 copies/ml  and  histologic  improvement  defined  as  at  least  a  2-point  reduction  in  the Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score).

The secondary endpoints included histology, virologic response, biochemical and serology response, and genotypic changes from baseline.

In line with the EU guideline on anti-HBV drugs development the composite primary endpoint should have encompassed the biochemical response. The MAH was therefore requested to present the studies results  as  recommended  in  the  guideline,  i.e.  combining  virological,  histological  and  biochemical response (see the 'efficacy results' below).

For both studies, primary efficacy analyses were performed using the randomised-and-treated (RAT) analysis set, which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication, with no data exclusion.

The population for ALT normalisation analyses was all RAT subjects with an ALT value above the ULN at baseline. In study -102 subjects with a normal ALT value at baseline were excluded from these analyses. This population is referred to as the biochemically evaluable RAT analysis set.

For study -103 the population for analyses of HBeAg loss and seroconversion was all RAT subjects with a baseline value of positive for HBeAg status. Subjects with a value of negative at baseline for HBeAg  were  excluded  from  all  serology  related  analyses.  This  population  is  referred  to  as  the serologically evaluable RAT analysis set.

Efficacy analyses were adjusted for the covariate baseline ALT ( ≤ 2 × ULN or &gt; 2 × ULN for study -102 and ≤ 4 × ULN or &gt; 4 × ULN for study -103) but not for the geographical region nor for prior lamivudine or emtricitabine experience for study -102.

## Results

## Population

The majority of patients in both studies completed the first year of blinded treatment: 95.6% (239/250) in the TDF group vs 92.8% (116/125) in the ADV group in study -102 and 89.8% (158/176) in the TDF group vs 93.3% (84/91) in the ADV group in study -103.

In  both  studies,  screening  failure  accounted  for  nearly  70%  due  to  failure  in  meeting  the  eligibility criteria for ALT levels, HBV DNA levels, or both. The ALT criterion was the main reason for screen failure in both studies, in a higher percentage in HBeAg+ study (30% in study -103 vs 17% in study 102). The lower bound for ALT criteria for HBeAg+ patients was consistent with the EU guidelines. These screening failures do not hamper the extrapolation of the data to the target population in clinical practice .

Some demographic and baseline disease characteristics of patients from studies -102 and -103 (RAT population) are displayed in Table 6, below. Seven and 6 patients did not receive study medication in study -102 and -103, respectively.

For  both  studies,  the  baseline  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  tenofovir  and  the adefovir treatment groups. The European population was well represented (62.4% in study 102 and 54.9% in study 103). The genotype distribution reflects the ethnicity of the enrolled patients.

Approximately  17%  and  16%  of  patients  in  study  -102  and  -103  respectively  had  prior  interferon exposure.

Overall  approximately  20%  percent  of  patients  in  study  -102  had  cirrhosis  at  baseline;  a  similar percentage was seen in study -103, 18%.

## Study -102

The mean reduction from baseline in plasma HBV DNA at week 48 was significantly greater in the tenofovir  DF  group  ( -4.57  log10  copies/ml)  than  in  the  adefovir  dipivoxil  group  (( -4.07  log10 copies/ml (p &lt; 0.001)). Nearly all subjects treated with tenofovir DF reached the assay LLQ (lower limit of quantification).

Most biochemically evaluable subjects in both groups had normalised ALT at week 16 even though at baseline, normal ALT was uncommon (5.6% in both groups).

At week 48, mean change from baseline in ALT was -95.0 U/l (102.31) in the tenofovir DF group and was -124.4 U/l (137.23) in the adefovir dipivoxil group (p = 0.040). Mean (SD) baseline ALT was higher,  however,  in  the  adefovir  group  (163.6  U/l  [146.02])  than  in  the  tenofovir  group  (127.5  U/l [101.21]).

## Study -103

A significant higher percentage of patients achieved the primary endpoint in the tenofovir DF group compared  to  the  adefovir  dipivoxil  group.  This  superiority  of  tenofovir  was  mainly  driven  by  the higher virological response (HBV DNA &lt;400 copies/ml), with a difference estimate between arms of 65.9%.

The mean reduction from baseline in plasma HBV DNA at week 48 was significantly greater in the tenofovir  group  ( -6.17  log10  copies/ml)  than  in  the  adefovir  group  ( -3.93  log10  copies/ml) (p &lt; 0.001). The observed mean change in the tenofovir DF group was limited by the LLQ (lower limit of  quantification)  of  the  assay,  since  the  majority  of  subjects  in  that  group  reached  the  LLQ. Borderline significant superiority in terms of normalised ALT was also demonstrated.

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  HBV  DNA  &lt;  400  copies/ml  over  time  showed  that  virological response was rapidly achieved in the tenofovir DF group, where more than 50% of patients had HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/ml after 24 weeks of treatment.

Although few patients achieved HBsAg loss (n= 5), a statistically significant difference in number of patients who achieved HBsAg loss is reported in the tenofovir DF group. Two subjects in the tenofovir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DF treatment group had achieved HBsAg seroconversion (defined as HBsAg loss and positive result for anti-HBs) at week 48.

In  line  with  the  virological  response,  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  in  terms  of biochemical response in the tenofovir DF group as compared to the ADV group.

However, the high difference in terms of virologic response was not associated with any statistical difference in terms of histological response, with most of the patients having no change in the fibrosis score. The magnitude of the treatment difference in terms of histological response is around 10% of that in terms of virologic response. Nevertheless, the histological response is expected to take more time  to  develop  and  48  weeks  might  not  be  sufficient  to  observe  any  translation  of  the  virological suppression on the progression of the disease.

The  MAH  was  requested  to  present  combining  virological,  histological  and  biochemical  results reported with and without adjustment for base stratification variables. An adjusted analysis as regards the  protocol  defined  primary  endpoint  was  also  requested.  ALT  change  [from]  baseline  data  using baseline ALT level as covariate was also needed. A secondary analysis using a combined endpoint was  performed.  Consistent  with  the  protocol-specified,  composite,  primary  endpoint,  tenofovir  DF was  superior  to  adefovir  dipivoxil  (p &lt; 0.001)  for  the  triple  combined  endpoint.  Results  for  both studies  were  similar  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  statistical  analyses  were  adjusted  for  baseline ALT. However, the CHMP request was only partially addressed. The combined endpoint for HBeAg+ patients  (study  -103)  did  not  include  HBeAg  loss.  Given  that  no  statistically  significant  difference between tenofovir DF and ADV was achieved on HBeAg loss, the superiority of tenofovir DF might have been lost on this combined endpoint.

In  addition,  the  CHMP  requested  an  analysis  with  and  without  adjustment  for  base  stratification variables which was not provided. ALT change from baseline using baseline ALT level as covariate was not provided for study-103.

Given the  reliability  of  the  efficacy  demonstration  on  the  HBV  DNA  driven  primary  endpoint,  the CHMP agreed that the remaining points could be addressed in a post approval follow-up measure.

The viral  response  data  (as  plots  of  viral  load  over  time)  reported  separately  for  patients  with  and without HBeAg seroconversion at week 48, showed that for the subgroup of seroconverters in both tenofovir  DF (n = 36)  and  adefovir  dipivoxil (n = 16)  groups,  mean  HBV  DNA  at  the  time  of seroconversion was 2.51 log10 copies/ml and 3.68 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Twenty-four weeks after  seroconversion,  the  mean change  in  HBV  DNA  (log10 copies/ml)  was -0.27  and -0.69  for tenofovir DF-treated subjects (n = 19) and adefovir dipivoxil-treated subjects (n = 7), respectively.

Overall, seroconverters had a more pronounced decrease in HBV DNA during the first 24 weeks of treatment, however no major difference in mean change in HBV DNA was observed in tenofovir DFtreated patients with vs without seroconversion. The MAH did not provide the evolution of HBV DNA after  conversion,  precluding  further  discussion  on  the  durability  of  seroconversion.  This  will  be address by the MAH as a post-approval follow-up measure.

The  per  protocol  analysis  result  requested  by  the  CHMP  for  both  studies  were  consistent  with  the results from the ITT analysis, providing further confidence in the superiority of TDF over ADV on the primary endpoint and viral suppression in the pivotal studies.

## Resistance analysis Study -102

Genotypic testing was performed in all 50 viremic subjects (13.3% of the total RAT population) as a component of the year 1 resistance surveillance. After 48 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF, 4/250 (1.6%) subjects had active viral replication (HBV DNA levels &gt; 400 copies/ml) without experiencing viral rebound during the study. Four of 250 (1.6%) subjects had experienced viral rebound. No subject in the tenofovir DF group discontinued after week 24 with active viral replication. No subject in the tenofovir DF group had conserved site change at week 48.

At  baseline  two  individuals  in  the  tenofovir  group  harboured  virus  with  lamivudine  resistance mutations.  Both  achieved  full  suppression  (&lt;LOQ).  At  baseline  one  subject  in  the  adefovir  group harboured virus with lamivudine resistance mutations and also achieved full suppression (&lt;LOQ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No conserved site  mutations  were  detected  in  association  with  tenofovir  DF  therapy  for  48  weeks. However, at this stage it cannot be excluded that mutations in polymorphic sites may be associated with reduced sensitivity. It is expected that this issue will be addressed in patients with rebound viral failure in the ongoing resistance follow-up.

## Study -103

Genotypic testing was performed in all 106 viremic subjects (39.8% of the total RAT population 13) as a component of the year 1 resistance surveillance. After 48 weeks of treatment with tenofovir DF 24/176  (13.6%)  subjects  had  active  viral  replication  (HBV  DNA  levels ≥ 400  copies/ml)  without experiencing viral rebound during the study. Six of 176 (3.4%) had viral rebound 1 ,  and 1 additional subject discontinued after week 24 with active viral replication (6.1-log10 decrease from baseline in HBV DNA at time of discontinuation). Two subjects in the tenofovir DF group had conserved site changes at week 48 with decreases in HBV DNA levels ranging from 5.3 to 6.6 log10 copies/ml. These conserved-site changes occurred at the following loci: rtS74 and rtH156.  The clinical significance of these  changes  is  currently  unknown. The  fact  that  certain  mutations  in  polymorphic  sites  may  be associated with reduced sensitivity cannot be excluded.

Overall, 426 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive subjects were evaluated for genotypic changes in HBV polymerase and no nucleoside-naïve or nucleoside-experienced subject treated with tenofovir DF for 48 weeks developed mutations associated with tenofovir DF resistance.

The activity of tenofovir in case of lamivudine resistance has been documented in in vitro studies and in some literature data. Given the limited in vitro cross resistance, the MAH will conduct a phase IIIb study in lamivudine-resistant subjects for which the protocol synopsis will be submitted to the CHMP as a post-approval follow-up measure.

Resistance will be monitored quarterly in all patients without viral suppression in the HBV pivotal studies. Quarterly results should be reported yearly with PSURs submission or upon CHMP request.

## Results of sub group analyses

Integrated  subgroup  analyses  were  performed.  For  each  treatment  group  the  effect  of  several demographic (age, gender and race) and baseline disease characteristics (HBV DNA, ALT, Knodell necroinflammatory and fibrosis  scores,  genotype  [A -D],  prior  lamivudine/emtricitabine  experience) on  complete  response  and  its  components  (HBV  DNA  response  and  histological  response)  were assessed. Age subgroups were examined within each rather than across each of the two studies due to the known age difference between HBeAg+ and HBeAg -subjects.

The histological results reported in the sub-group of patients having cirrhosis at baseline (81 in the tenofovir group and 42 in adefovir group) were similar to those reported in each treatment group in the whole chronic HBV population. No advantage of tenofovir DF over adefovir dipivoxil was seen in this subgroup of patients.

A marginal influence of baseline HBV DNA level on complete response and the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/ml at week 48 was observed. This finding was more pronounced within the  adefovir  dipivoxil-treated  subjects,  leading  to  an  overall  larger  difference  between  treatment groups in favour of tenofovir DF in the subjects with baseline viral load above the median across the two studies.

In both studies, the percentage of tenofovir DF treated subjects achieving complete response (73% and 69%)  and  HBV  DNA  below  400  copies/ml  (90%  and  88%)  were  similar  in  treatment-experienced subjects (n = 51) and treatment-naïve subjects (n = 375), respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of potential predictors of response for the tenofovir DF-treated subjects using the endpoint of HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/m at week 48 were performed using pooled data from the two pivotal studies. Baseline HBV DNA ( ≤ 9 log10 copies/ml vs. &gt; 9 log10 copies/ml) (p &lt; 0.0001) and baseline body mass index  (BMI)  (&lt; 30  vs. ≥ 30)  (p = 0.0052)  were  the  two  identified  baseline  factors  significantly associated with virologic response. However, considering the under-exposure of patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, the MAH will comment on the possibility to recommend a higher dose in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. This will be address as a post-approval follow-up measure.

Moreover,  results  showed  response  at  24-week  as  a  strong  positive  predictive  value  on  treatment response at week 48 in both populations. However, given the poor negative predictive value of the 24week results on treatment response at week 48 in HBeAg positive and negative patients, this cannot be used to support therapeutic decision. The analysis of the predictive value of the 24-week response on treatment-emergent resistance will have to be assessed when long-term data are available. In addition the MAH will assess predictive factors of seroconversion.

## Supportive studies

Twenty-four  week  interim  data  from  a  phase  II,  randomised,  double-blind  study  GS-US-174-106 exploring  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  tenofovir  monotherapy vs emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF  fixedcombination in the treatment of HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic HB infected patients being treated with adefovir dipivoxil and having persistent viral replication was submitted.

The majority of subjects were male (76%), mean age 39 years and mean baseline HBV DNA 5.97 log10 copies/ml. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA levels &lt; 169 copies/ml  (LLQ)  at  week  48.  A  total  of  105  patients  were  randomised  and  treated  and 60 individuals  were  evaluated  for  efficacy  at  week  24:  46/60  (76.7%)  subjects  showed  HBV  DNA &lt;400 copies/ml and 37/60 (61.7%) had plasma HBV DNA level &lt;LLQ (169 copies/ml).

## Clinical studies in special populations

A  prospective  'Adult  AIDS  Clinical  Trials  Group'  study-  ACTG  study  A5127  -  performed  in HIV/HBV co-infected patients was provided. This was a randomised, 48 week double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of 10 mg daily of adefovir dipivoxil vs 300 mg of tenofovir DF in patients with HBV and HIV co-infection on stable ART, with serum HBV DNA &gt; 100,000 copies/ml, and plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 10,000 copies/ml.  The study was closed early as interim results showed that the primary non inferiority end point had been achieved without safety issues.

Fifty-two  subjects  were  randomised.  At  baseline,  73%  of  subjects  had  a  plasma  HIV-1  RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml, 86% were HBeAg+, 94% were lamivudine resistant, median serum ALT was 52 IU/l, and  98%  had  compensated  liver  disease.  The  mean  time-weighted  average  change  in  serum  HBV DNA from baseline to week 48 was -4.44 log10 copies/ml for tenofovir DF and -3.21 log10 copies/ml for adefovir.

No  difference in terms of toxicity between the 2 treatment groups was observed. Eleven patients  (5  adefovir  group  and  6  tenofovir  DF  group)  experienced  elevations  of  serum  ALT  on treatment but none accompanied with signs of hepatic decompensation. Over 48 weeks, treatment with either adefovir or tenofovir DF resulted in clinically important suppression of serum HBV DNA.

## Clinical safety

The safety assessment was based on the data from the main pivotal studies (GS-174-102 and GS-174103). Additional safety data was provided from blinded phase of study GS-US-174-108, comparing tenofovir  DF,  emtricitabine/tenofovir  DF,  and  entecavir  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  in subjects with decompensated liver disease.

## Patient exposure

In the two pivotal studies, a total of 603 subjects (94%, 399/426 in the tenofovir DF group and 95%, 204/215 in the adefovir group) completed 48 weeks of double-blind treatment. The mean duration of exposure was similar between treatment groups (328.9 in the tenofovir DF group and 327.4 in adefovir group). Long-term data (exposure more than one year) for tenofovir DF in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B is currently not available. The 96 week and the final 240 week report for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

two pivotal studies will be provided to substantiate the long term safety of tenofovir in chronic HB patients.

Cumulative worldwide exposure to tenofovir DF (mainly in HIV-1 indication) since 26 October 2001 to 31 May 2007 is estimated to be 1,364,784 patients-years of treatment.

Adverse events (AEs)

The overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events, 48 weeks data is presented below.

The more commonly reported adverse events in the tenofovir DF group irrespective of causality were gastro-intestinal disorders. Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea were reported at a higher frequency in tenofovir DF treatment compared to treatment with adefovir. This is in line with the current safety profile of tenofovir DF in HIV-1 infected patients.

The  higher  frequency  of  nausea  in  the  overall  tenofovir  DF  group  was  mainly  due  to  the  greater frequency of this adverse event reported in in HBeAg+ patients (13.6% in tenofovir DF group vs 1.1% in  adefovir  group)  compared  to  HBeAg-  patients  (6.4%  in  tenofovir  DF  group vs 4.0%  in  adefovir group).  The  large  difference  observed  in  the  reporting  of  nausea  between  tenofovir  group  in  each studies is unclear.

## Serious adverse events (SAE) and Death

No deaths were reported in the two pivotal studies -102 and -103. However, 3 subjects died during the course of study -108, in subjects with decompensated liver disease. None were considered related to study  medication.  The  data  are  still  blinded  for  study  -108  therefore  this  will  be  further  discussed when the final report for this study is provided.

Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in both treatment groups (6.3%  tenofovir  DF  and  6.5%  adefovir  dipivoxil).  The  most  frequently  SAE  reported  was  ALT increased, reported in 9 patients (2.1%) treated with tenofovir DF and in 4 patients (1.9%) treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Increased in ALT in 5 (1.2%) of the 9 patients was considered related to tenofovir DF treatment. Other SAEs reported in more than 1 subject was AST increased in 4 subjects (3 on tenofovir  DF  and  1  on  adefovir  dipivoxil)  with  1  considered  related  to  tenofovir  treatment. Thrombocytopenia,  and  hepatitis  B  (ALT  flare)  were  also  reported  as  SAE  related  to  tenofovir treatment (1 subject each).

Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  and  hepatitis  B  were  reported  in  three  patients  on  tenofovir  DF treatment, compared to none on adefovir. Further information provided is not sufficient to determine the causality to tenofovir DF. HCC will be specifically monitored in future PSURs and in any ongoing or planned clinical studies.

## Adverse events of interest

## Liver toxicity

## ¾ ALT flares

In  the  pivotal  studies,  a  slight  trend  towards  a  higher  proportion  of  on-treatment  ALT  flares 2 was observed in tenofovir DF treated patients (2.6%, n=11) compared to adefovir-treated (1.9%, n=4).

Most of ALT flares occurred in patients with HBeAg+ chronic hepatitis B (8/11 tenofovir DF-treated and 3/4 adefovir -treated). Among the 8 in the tenofovir DF group, 5 had a seroconversion to antiHBe at week 24 or 36. Among the 3 in the adefovir group, 1 seroconverted to anti-HBe at week 8. The majority  of  ALT  flares  occurred  in  patients  with  baseline  ALT  &gt;  2N  or  with  baseline  HBV  DNA &gt; 7.88 log10 copies/ml. No patients with ALT flares had signs of hepatic decompensation.

2 Defined by: elevation of ALT &gt; 2 × baseline and &gt; 10 × ULN with or without associated symptoms or, abnormal laboratory  parameters suggestive  of  worsening  hepatic  function  (abnormal  bilirubin ≥ 2  mg/dl  above  baseline, abnormal PT ≥ 2 sec above baseline, international normalised ratio (INR) ≥ 0.5 over baseline, abnormal albumin ≥ 1 g/dl decrease from baseline, or elevated serum lactate levels &gt;2 × ULN) along with any ALT elevation (i.e., 1-grade shift or 2 × previous value).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  tenofovir  DF,  all  except  one  patient  experienced  ALT  flares  during  the  first  two  months  of study. All patients responded to tenofovir DF treatment and had concomitant decreases in HBV DNA.

Overall, on-treatment ALT flares reported in tenofovir DF-treated patients seemed more likely related to  immunologically-mediated inflammatory response associated  with viral  clearance  since  all  had  a reduction from baseline in HBV DNA that coincided with the ALT flare.

A warning on the risk of exacerbations of hepatitis in some patients with serum HBV DNA levels decrease and on the higher occurrence observed in HBeAg+ chronic HB patients was added to the SPC.

Study  drug  discontinuation  with  treatment-free  follow-up  was  contraindicated  for  subjects  with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis due to the potential risk of exacerbation of hepatitis.

As of 25 January 2008, post-treatment exacerbation developed in 3 patients in study -102 and in no patient  in  study  -103 . Lesser ALT elevations were observed in 3 additional patients (1 from study -102  and  2  from  study  -103)  who  had  grade 3  ALT  levels ≥ 2  months  following  study  drug discontinuation with no other liver function test abnormalities coincident with grade 3 ALT elevation.

Of the 3 subjects with post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis B, 1 with cirrhosis who discontinued study  -102,  developed  flare  with  concomitant  grade  3  bilirubin  (3.7  mg/dl).  Commercial  anti-HBV treatment  (entecavir)  was  started  within  2  days  of  flare  onset  with  resolution  of  the  exacerbation episode.

Data  on  post-treatment  exacerbation  of  hepatitis  B  following  discontinuation  of  tenofovir  DF  is currently  limited  due  to  the  small  sample  size  and  incomplete  (currently  ongoing)  follow-up.  Posttreatment flare is a known consequence of withdrawal of oral nucleoside or nucleotide treatment.

In case of treatment discontinuation, hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and  laboratory  follow-up  for  at  least  several  months.  Warnings  on  post-treatment  hepatic  flare  are included in the SPC.

A specific section pertaining to all cases of on-treatment and post-treatment ALT flares reported in chronic HB patients should be presented and discussed in each future PSUR for tenofovir DF.

## ¾ Hepatic events

Hepatitis and increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase) have been identified as potential adverse drug reactions from postmarketing HIV experience.

Fourteen patients (3.3%) treated with tenofovir DF for chronic HBV and 13 subjects (6.0%) treated with adefovir dipivoxil experienced treatment-emergent hepatobiliary disorders by week 48. Only 2 were  considered  to  be  related  to  tenofovir  DF  and  one  related  to  adefovir  dipivoxil.  All  cases  of hepatic events will be closely monitored.

## Renal toxicity

The number of patients with renal impairment studied in tenofovir DF clinical trials is very low. The clinical studies performed  in patients with HBV  excluded  patients  with  creatinine clearance &lt;70  ml/min.  Therefore,  the  patient  population  possibly  more  prone  to  experience  safety  problems (renal and possibly bone) with tenofovir DF, has not been studied.

Renal/urinary  adverse  events  considered  treatment-related  were  seen  in  7/426  patients  (1.6%)  on tenofovir DF and in 7/215 patients (3.3%) on adefovir dipivoxil. Overall the percentage of patients with renal and urinary adverse events was 6.5% tenofovir DF vs 5.1% adefovir dipivoxil. Confirmed decreased in serum phosphorus &lt; 2mg/dl was reported in 1.4% of patients on tenofovir DF vs none adefovir group. One case of drug-related hypophosphatemia was reported in the tenofovir DF group. No renal event or laboratory abnormality resulted in dose modification, interruption, or discontinuation of treatment.

The MAH provided a summary report regarding renal and bone safety in all patients (HIV and HBV) with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 80 ml/min), who were long-term exposed to tenofovir in clinical studies by CHMP request.

Data  from  the  pivotal  HBV  studies  showed  that  none  of  the  25  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  with creatinine clearance &lt; 80ml/min at baseline had experienced significant alteration in renal function. Data available from other studies (GS-US-174-106 and GS-US-174-108) are limited and the treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

remains blinded. Data from HIV development program regarding subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min to &lt;80ml/min) from HIV studies is very limited (GS-99-903, GSUS-934 (n=28) and GS-104-235 (n=5)).

From the clinical experience of tenofovir in the treatment of HIV infection, it is clear that the renal safety of tenofovir is compromised in patients with moderate renal dysfunction or with concomitant therapy  including  medicinal  products  that  (moderately)  lower  tenofovir  clearance.  Hence,  for  the present dosage 300 mg QD, patients with a clearance of ~50-70 ml/min will be studied separately with focus  on  renal  (tubular)  as  well  as  bone  safety.  The  MAH  will  conduct  a  phase  3b  study  in lamivudine-resistant patients. This patient population will include patients with mild renal impairment (with a lower threshold for creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min). A protocol synopsis will be provided to the CHMP within 3 months of approval of the indication of hepatitis B.

The renal monitoring should be focused on parameters related to tubular damage (serum phosphorus, urine-albumin,  urineβ 2  microglobuline)  rather  than  renal  function  as  measured  by  creatinine clearance.  As  retrospective  dosages  of  urineβ 2-microglobulin  and  bone-specific  ALP  from  stored samples are not feasible, the MAH will conduct DEXA scans of the spine and hip at regular intervals (every 6 to 12 months) through week72- 240 for patients in studies GS-US-174-102 and -103.

The CHMP agreed not to absolute contraindicate tenofovir DF in severe renal impairment patients. Rather a strong warning  stressing that tenofovir DF  should  only be used in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment if the potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks was included in the SPC. Consequently the wording on dosing regimens was restricted accordingly.

## Bone toxicity

In  the  pivotal  studies  in  HBV,  bone  toxicity  was  monitored  by  phosphorus  levels  in  serum  and  by reported  fractures.  Other  serum  bone  markers  were  not  reported  and  DEXA  scanning  was  not undertaken. This issue was more intensely studied in the treatment of HIV-infection.

Tenofovir does not appear to be bone toxic per se . However, as tenofovir will be given to patients with chronic  hepatitis  B  for  long  time  periods,  including  women  (with  higher  background  incidence  of osteoporosis), the renal function of these patients will eventually decrease, as part of aging process and this way increasing the group of patients which might be more prone to tenofovir toxicity.

Renal - and bone - toxicity is better studied in HBV patients than in HIV patients. In the former group tenofovir DF is given as a single agent, and co-morbidities and other complicating factors are likely to be  more  common  in  HIV  patients.  Hence,  the  MAH  will  include  DEXA  scanning  as  part  of  the requested safety study in patients with moderate renal dysfunction.

## Gastro-intestinal toxicity

The  most  commonly  gastro-intestinal  disorders  in  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  are  nausea  and vomiting. A slightly higher incidence of mild nausea (20%) was observed among tenofovir DF-treated subjects  compared with control subjects (15%) in  a pooled analysis. Similar  trend was observed in tenofovir DF clinical program in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Nausea  was  more  frequent  among  females  treated  with  tenofovir  DF  (23.7%)  than  among  females treated with adefovir (7.4%). In males, the incidence of nausea was slightly higher in tenofovir DF but the difference was less pronounced than in female patients.

Overall,  female  patients  on  tenofovir  DF  experienced  more  gastro-intestinal  disorders  than  female patients on adefovir and with a higher rate compared to male patients. Similar differences are observed for most gastro-intestinal disorders, fatigue and dizziness.

## Discontinuation due to AEs

No major difference was observed between both treatment groups. The proportion of patients having discontinued  study  treatment  was  similar  in  tenofovir  DF-treated  patients  and  adefovir-treated patients.

Dose  modifications  and  interruptions  were  also  reported  in  a  similar  number  of  patients  in  each treatment group (0.9% for both adefovir and tenofovir DF). In tenofovir DF group, the reasons for interruption or dose modification included nausea, vomiting and headache in one subject and cervical haemorrhage, head injury and increased creatinine phosphokinase in one subject each.

## Special populations

Safety data of tenofovir DF used in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects are available from study ACTG A5127;  from  small  subsets  of  co-infected  subjects  who  participated  in  clinical  studies  in  HIV-1 infection  (studies  GS-99-903,  GS-01-934,  GS-99-907  and  GS-98-902)  and  from  investigators-led studies on HIV/HBV co-infected subjects.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  tenofovir  DF  in  subjects  with  HIV/HBV  co-infection  did  not  seem  to differ  from that in subjects with HBV mono-infection. However, due to the risk of development of HIV  resistance,  tenofovir  should  only  be  used  as  part  of  an  appropriate  antiretroviral  combination regimen in HIV/HBV infected patients.

No data are available for the use of tenofovir DF in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Special attention should be paid to the off label use of TDF in this specific population of patients since they are  at  higher  risk  of  having  underlying  renal  insufficiency  (the  authorisation  did  not  include  liver transplant  patients).  Moreover,  the  potential  for  an  increased  risk  when  tenofovir  is  combined  with other nephrotoxic medicinal products must be taken into account.

## Risk management plan

The MAH submitted a revised risk management plan (RMP), which covered the approved indication in  HIV-1  infected  patients  and  the  applied  indication  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  HBV  infected patients.

Furthermore the MAH will distribute a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) to all new concerned Health Care

in  order  to  adequately  inform  them  of  the  risk  of  renal  toxicity  associated  with  tenofovir  and  the existence  of  specific  recommendations  to  manage  the  renal  tolerance.  A  draft  DHPC  letter  will  be provided for CHMP agreement on the final wording at the April 2008 plenary meeting.

A  summary  of  the  RMP  for  tenofovir  DF  highlighting  the  associated  safety  concerns  is  presented below:

In addition to the above identified safety concerns and activities, the MAH will include black patients as important missing information in the next update of the RMP. Comparing HBV-infected patients to HIV-infected patients in clinical studies, there were more Asian (32.3% vs 0.7%) and less black (5%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vs 16.4%)  in  HBV-infected  patients  treated  with  tenofovir  DF.  The  information  in  this  population (only 39 HBV-infected black patients treated with tenofovir DF) is therefore limited.

## Overall conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment

The data provided showed superiority of tenofovir DF over adefovir dipivoxil in term of proportion of patients  with  a  complete  response  (defined  as  HBV  DNA  &lt;  400  copies/ml  and  histological improvement indicated by at least a 2-point in Knodell necroinflammatory score without worsening in Knodell fibrosis score) at week 48 in both populations of Hbe Ag positive and negative patients.

The  superiority  of  tenofovir  DF  was  mainly  driven  by  the  virological  response.  No  significant difference was seen in terms of histological and serological responses.

No mutations demonstrated to be associated with viral failure have been detected for tenofovir DF in the  submitted  studies  at  week  48.  Resistance  will  be  monitored  every  quarterly  and  results  will  be reported yearly.

As for the HIV infected patients the prominent aspects of tenofovir DF safety profile remains. The renal  safety  that  would  need  particular  monitoring  is  already  recommended.  A  strong  warning stressing that tenofovir DF should only be used in patients with chronic HB and moderate/severe renal impairment,  if  the  potential  benefits  of  treatment  outweigh  the  potential  risks,  was  included  in  the SPC.  Additional  data  in  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  and  chronic  HBV infection,  including  safety  data  and  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  will  be  provided. In  addition,  a study  including  participants  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  lamivudine-resistant  HBV  will  be conducted. A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) will be send to all concerned Health Care professionals in order to adequately inform them of the risk of renal toxicity associated with tenofovir and the existence of specific recommendations to manage the renal toxicity.

Regarding bone toxicity, periodic DEXA scanning will be performed ongoing HBV pivotal trials and in  the  planned  study  in  lamivudine  resistant  patients.  Warning  regarding  potential  ALT  flares,  ontreatment and post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis, are reflected in the product information and will be periodically monitored.

Long term efficacy and safety data will be provided from ongoing and planned studies as committed by the MAH.

In conclusion, the benefit/risk balance for tenofovir DF in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis is positive.

## Conclusion

On 19 March 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
