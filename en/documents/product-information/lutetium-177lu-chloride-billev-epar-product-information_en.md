## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev 51.8 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

1 mL solution contains 51.8 GBq lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART) corresponding to maximum 12.6 micrograms of lutetium ( 177 Lu) (as chloride).

The ART is defined as the end of production. The minimal specific activity is 3000 GBq/mg lutetium ( 177 Lu) at the ART.

Each 5 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 4 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 5.2 to 207.2 GBq at ART.

Each 10 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 8 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 5.2 to 414.4 GBq at ART.

The activity at the date and time ordered by the customer, indicated as CAL (calibration), is determined by the time elapsed from the ART and the half-life of lutetium ( 177 Lu).

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) has a half-life of 6.7 days. Lutetium ( 177 Lu) non carrier added is produced by neutron irradiation of enriched ytterbium ( 176 Yb). Lutetium ( 177 Lu) decays by β -minus emission to stable Hafnium ( 177 Hf), with the most abundant β -minus (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 497 keV. Also, low gamma energy is emitted, for instance at 113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution.

Clear colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and it is not intended for direct use in patients. It is to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling.

## Posology

The quantity of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev required for radiolabelling and the quantity of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

For more information concerning paediatric use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## Method of administration

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products which are subsequently administered by the approved route.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev should not be administered directly to the patient.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6).

For information on contraindications to particular lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates.

## Renal impairment and haematological disorders

Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible. It is recommended to perform individual radiation dosimetry assessments of specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy.

## Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours (see section 4.8). This should be taken into account when considering the benefit/risk, especially in patients with possible risk factors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (such as alkylating agents).

## Myelosuppression

Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur during radioligand therapy with lutetium ( 177 Lu). Most events are mild and transient, but in some cases patients have required blood and platelet transfusions. In some patients more than one cell line may be affected and pancytopenia requiring treatment discontinuation has been described. A blood count should be taken at baseline and monitored regularly during treatment, in accordance with clinical guidance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal irradiation

Radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been reported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other radioisotopes. Renal function should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance.

## Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in patients with liver metastases undergoing treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. Liver function should be monitored regularly during treatment. Dose reduction may be necessary in affected patients.

## Hormone release syndromes

There have been reports of carcinoid crisis and other syndromes associated with release of hormones from functional neuroendocrine tumours following lutetium ( 177 Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, which may be related to irradiation of tumour cells. Reported symptoms include flushing and diarrhoea associated with hypotension. Observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be considered in some cases (e.g. patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of hormonal crises, treatments may include: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or vomiting.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported following lutetium ( 177 Lu) radioligand therapy. Patients with a history of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk and should be treated with increased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be assessed at baseline and during treatment.

## Extravasation

There have been reports of extravasation of lutetium ( 177 Lu) labelled ligands in the post-marketing setting. In case of extravasation, infusion of the medicinal product should be immediately ceased, and the nuclear medicine physician and the radiopharmacist should be promptly informed. Management should be in accordance with local protocols.

## Radiation protection

Point-source approximation shows that the average dose rate experienced 20 hours after administration of a dose of 7.3 GBq Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev labelled radiopharmaceutical (residual radioactivity 1.5 GBq) by a person at 1 meter distance from the patient's body centre with an abdominal radius of 15 cm is 3.5 μ Sv/h. Doubling the distance to the patient to 2 meters reduces the dose rate by a factor of 4, to 0.9 μ Sv/h. The same dose in a patient with an abdominal radius of 25 cm yields a dose rate at 1 meter of 2.6 μ Sv/h. The generally accepted threshold for discharge of the treated patient from the hospital is 20 μ Sv/h. In most countries, the exposure limit for hospital staff is set the same as for the general public at 1 mSv/year. When taking the 3.5 μ Sv/h dose rate as an average, this would allow hospital staff to work approx. 300 hours/year in close vicinity of patients treated with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev labeled radiopharmaceuticals without wearing radiation protection. Of course, the nuclear medicine staff is expected to wear standard radiation protection. Any other person in close vicinity of the treated patient should be informed about possibilities to reduce his/her exposure due to radiation emitted from the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Specific warnings

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)labelled medicinal products refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Further precautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed.

For information concerning interactions associated with the use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of 177 Lu -labelled medicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test.

## Pregnancy

The use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded due to the risk of ionizing radiation to the foetus (see section 4.3).

## Breast-feeding

Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be given to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breastfeeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should be interrupted, and the expressed feeds discarded.

## Fertility

Effects of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride on male and female fertility have not been studied in animals. Low exposures could be demonstrated for male and female sexual organs. It cannot be excluded that 177 Lulabelled medicinal products lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic damage in male testes or female ovaries.

Further information concerning the use of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products concerning fertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions following the administration of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Dry mouth

Dry mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving PSMA-targeted lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled radioligands and has been transient.

## Alopecia

Alopecia, described as mild and temporary, has been observed among patients receiving lutetium ( 177 Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The presence of free lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i.e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.

The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes:

- -Ca-DTPA (trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or
- -Ca-EDTA (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)

These chelating agents help with the elimination of lutetium ( 177 Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion in the complex and the lutetium ( 177 Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound lutetium ( 177 Lu) are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.

One gram of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 - 250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection).

The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval &gt; 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.

In any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity.

The toxicity of free lutetium ( 177 Lu) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10X

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacodynamic properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) emits β -minus particles of moderate maximum energy (0.498 MeV) with a maximum tissue penetration of approximately 2 mm. Lutetium ( 177 Lu) also emits low-energy γ -rays which allow scintigraphic, biodistribution and dosimetry studies with the same lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric patients. This waiver does however not extend to any therapeutic uses of the medicinal product when linked to a carrier molecule (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetic properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## Distribution after inadvertent intravenous administration of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride

Data from experiments on mice, rats and rabbits indicate that more than half the lutetium ( 177 Lu) entering the systemic circulation is deposited in the skeleton with only small amounts going to the liver and kidneys. Lutetium ( 177 Lu) has a biological half-life of between 10 and 40 days in the soft tissue in mice and rats but has a very long biological half-life in the skeleton. However, these long half-life values in skeleton are not of relevance for lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride n.c.a., since it completely decays with a half-life of 6.7 days following administration, preventing any accumulation over time. After intravenous injection of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, lutetium ( 177 Lu) is predominantly but slowly excreted in the urine. Some faecal elimination is also observed.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The toxicological properties of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

The toxicity of non-radioactive lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian species and using different administration routes. The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be approximately 315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular function were observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride contains 2.4 μg lutetium, corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 μg/kg. This dose is approximately 7 orders of magnitude lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than 5 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL observed in cats. Therefore, lutetium metal-ion toxicity of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal products can be excluded.

## 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

## 6.1 List of excipients

Hydrochloric acid, diluted

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

Radiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates, with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.

It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.

In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal products other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled.

## 6.3 Shelf life

Up to 11 days from the date of manufacture.

From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of withdrawal from the vial or any insertion into the vial preclude the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Store in the original package in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.

Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive materials.

This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

Clear type I glass 5 mL or 10 mL vial either conical or flat bottom, respectively, with a Teflon coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper, closed with an aluminum cap.

The vials are placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed into a polystyrene box and an outer carton.

Pack sizes:

5 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials

10 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is not intended for direct use in patients.

## General warning

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this container is compromised it should not be used.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with patients injected with lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The use of television monitor systems to monitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of lutetium ( 177 Lu), it is specially recommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason it is mandatory to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising radiation exposure resulting from repeated exposition there is no recommendation except the strict observance of the above ones.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

The radiation dose received by various organs following intravenous administration of a lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product will be dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled.

Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the radiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

The dosimetry tables below are presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated lutetium( 177 Lu) to the radiation dose following the administration of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev.

Dose calculations (absorbed normalised doses for target organs [mGy/MBq] and effective normalised doses [mSv/MBq]) were performed in Olinda/EXM 2 dose calculator using the mean Â value (mean between the Â values obtained from each considered animal study) for each source organ after administration of 1000 MBq. Organ doses are listed below for an adult male and female model as well as for 15-year, 10-year, 5-year, 1-year and newborn male and female models, according to ICRP 89 (International Commission on Radiological Protection).

The results show osteogenic cells, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen as the significant target organs for the biodistribution of lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride.

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation chamber.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionization chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.

Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.

Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated application system.

If the integrity of this vial is compromised, the medicinal product should not be used.

The complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride. Free lutetium ( 177 Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in osteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with free lutetium ( 177 Lu), if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of lutetium ( 177 Lu).

Adequate quality control of the radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after radiolabelling with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev should be assured. Limits for radiochemical impurities should be set recognising the radiotoxicological potential of lutetium ( 177 Lu). Free nonbound lutetium ( 177 Lu) should be consequently minimised.

Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.

## 1. What Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is and what it is used for

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the active substance lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride which gives off beta-minus radiation.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is not intended to be used on its own. Before use it has to be combined with other medicines (so called carrier medicines) that have been specially developed for use with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride. This process is called radiolabelling.

These carrier medicines may be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cell in the body. The carrier medicine is given to the patient according to the instructions in that medicine's product information. It then carries the radiation to where it is needed in the body, to treat disease or to obtain images on a screen that are used to diagnose illness.

The use of a medicine radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev does involve exposure to radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of using Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev outweighs the risk due to radiation.

For more information, refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev.

## 2. What you need to know before Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is used

## Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev must not be used

- -if you are allergic to lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6);
- -if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant.

For more information, refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev.

## Warnings and precautions

Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev is not to be administered directly to patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Take special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev:

- -if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease.

Treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) may lead to the following side effects:

- -a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia);
- -a reduced number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), which are important to stop bleeding;
- -a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are important for protecting the body against infection.

Most of these events are mild and temporary. A reduced number of all 3 types of blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells - pancytopenia) has been described in some patients. Treatment has to be stopped in patients with pancytopenia.

Because lutetium ( 177 Lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before you start and at regular intervals during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience shortness of breath, bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from your gums, or if you develop a fever.

When this medicine is used to radiolabel carrier medicines called somatostatin analogues used to treat cancers called neuroendocrine tumours, the radiolabelled carrier medicine is excreted by the kidneys. Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney function before you start and during treatment.

Treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) may affect the way your liver works. Your doctor will take a blood test to check your liver function during treatment.

Lutetium ( 177 Lu)-labelled medicines may be given directly into a vein through a tube known as a cannula. There have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue (extravasation). Tell your doctor if you get any swelling or pain in your arm.

After neuroendocrine tumours are treated with lutetium ( 177 Lu), you may get symptoms associated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your doctor if you feel faint or dizzy or have flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment.

Treatment with lutetium ( 177 Lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, a condition resulting from the rapid breakdown of tumour cells. This may lead to abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will carry out blood tests to monitor you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of breath.

Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev for additional warnings and precautions.

## Children and adolescents

Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. Use of Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev in children and adolescents under 18 years old depends on the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of that medicine.

## Other medicines and medicines radiolabelled with Lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride Billev

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the procedure.

It is not known whether lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies have not been carried out.
