Scientific discussion 2.1.  Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Hypertension  has  been  identified  as  a  major  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  diseases  such  as  stroke, myocardial  infarction, and  heart  failure. It  is  widely  recognised  that  an  adequate  control  of hypertension is important in order to significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The international  guidelines  for  the  management  of  hypertension  recommend  a  general  target  blood pressure (BP) of less than 140/90 mm Hg for most hypertensive patients. A lower BP target (&lt;130/80 mm Hg) is recommended in high-risk patient populations such as those with target organ damage, diabetes, or renal disease.

Several  therapeutic  choices  are  currently  available  to  lower  blood  pressure,  including  diuretics,  βblockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and calcium channel antagonists.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an effective way to intervene in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders. Renin is the enzyme  responsible for the conversion of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) transforms angiotensin I into  the  active  octapeptide  angiotensin  II,  which  acts via type-1  angiotensin  II  receptors  (AT1)  to increase arterial tone, adrenal aldosterone secretion, renal  sodium  re-absorption,  sympathetic neurotransmission, and cellular growth.

Some  of  currently  used  antihypertensive  drugs  intervene  at  different  points  of  renin-angiotensin system:

-  β  blockers  reduce  the  release  of  renin  from  the  juxtaglomerular  apparatus  and  lower  blood pressure.
-  ACE-inhibitors reduce the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They also inhibit the inactivation of bradykinin and substance P, causing some typical side-effects of ACE inhibitors, such as cough and angioedema.
-  Angiotensin-receptor  antagonists  (ARB)  block  the  interaction  of  angiotensin  II  with  the  AT1 receptor.
-  Renin-inhibitors directly inhibit renin, blocking the RAS at its very origin.

Despite the availability of several therapeutic choices, in a large portion of hypertensive patients blood pressure  cannot  be  adequately  controlled  by  one  antihypertensive  drug  alone.  For  the  majority  of patients,  a  combination  of  two  or  more  antihypertensive  medications  will  be  required  to  reach  an adequate  blood  pressure  control.  In  this  scenario,  development  of  new  fixed-dose  combinations  of different antihypertensive drugs helps to improve patient compliance over the free combination of the single monotherapies and the safety profile related to the current available treatments.

This is  an  application  for  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination at doses of 150 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/5 mg/25 mg, 300 mg/10 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/10 mg/25 mg proposed as substitution therapy in adult patients adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, taken either as three single-component formulations or  as  a  dual-component  and  a  single-component  formulation,  given  concurrently,  at  the  same  dose level as in the combination.

## 2.2.  Quality aspects

## 2.2.1.  Introduction

Rasitrio film-coated tablet is a new  fixed  combination medicinal product that  combines  two antihypertensive  compounds,  aliskiren  and  amlodipine,  with  complementary  mechanisms,  and  a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), to control blood pressure in patients with hypertension.

The claimed indication concerns the use of the FDC 150 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/5 mg/25 mg, 300 mg/10 mg/12.5 mg, 300 mg/10 mg/25 mg as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination.

Aliskiren  hemifumarate  (SPP100)  is  an  anti-hypertensive  agent  that  inhibits  the  renin-angiotensin system  and  Amlodipine  besylate  is  a  dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blocker.  Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a well-known thiazide diuretic commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, thanks to its  effect  on  volume/sodium  depletion.  Aliskiren  hemifumarate,  amlodipine  besylate  and  HCTZ  are already present in mono and combination products already approved.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  combination  of  a  direct-renin  inhibitor,  a  calcium  channel  blocker,  and  a  thiazide  diuretic  is considered  as  logical  because  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  the  3  drugs  are  complementary,  each typically  working  on  a  separate  mechanism,  thus  blocking  different  effector  pathways.  This  fixed combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ has been developed since a number of hypertensive patients require three or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve adequate blood pressure control.

The primary packaging for the tablets consists of Polyamide/Aluminium/Polyvinylchloride (PA/AL/PVC) blister packs (Alu blisters) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PCTFE)/PVC blister packs backed with a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil

## 2.2.2.  Active Substance

## Drug  Substance  (to  be  changed  in  the  EPAR  to  'Active  Substance') Aliskiren hemifumarate

Aliskiren hemifumarate has already been authorized via the centralised procedure both in monotherapy and  in combination  products, owned  by  the  Applicant Novartis for Rasilez  (product  number EMEA/H/C/000780 authorised on 22/08/2007).

Aliskiren hemifumarate exists as a white to slightly yellowish powder. It has four chiral centres, but is obtained as a single diastereoisomer, all S-configured.

Sufficient scientific information has been presented for the physicochemical properties such as appearance,  solubility  in  standard  aqueous  buffers  and  non-aqueous  solvents,  pKa,  specific rotation, log P, melting point and thermal behaviour. This molecule shows polymorphs.

<!-- image -->

The structure of aliskiren hemifumarate (SPP100) is supported by the synthetic routes. Its structure has  been  fully  elucidated  with  usual  techniques  such  as  elementary  analysis,  Infra-Red  (IR) spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H-NMR and  13 C-NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy (by ESI, Electron Spray Ionisation) and X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), optical rotation (single diasteroisomer), particle size analysis.

Manufacture Aliskiren hemifumarate (SPP100) is manufactured according to two synthetic pathways: routes B and C. The  active  substance  is  manufactured  with  total  synthesis  including  ten and  six  main  stages  using routes [synB] and [synC], respectively. Addition of synthesis C in alternative to synthesis B has been the object of a type II variation (EMEA/H/000780/II/0002 and follow up). The alternate synthesis C has been developed to reduce the complexity of the process, while improving the overall quality and safety. Adequate in-process  controls including  the  control  of  the  stereochemistry  and  control  of  the  critical steps have been applied as well as controls of the reagents, solvents, catalysts, starting materials, and intermediates used in the manufacture of aliskiren hemifumarate. Materials used in the manufacture of aliskiren  hemifumarate  are  all  of  synthetic  origin;  therefore  do  not  pose  a  risk  of  TSE/BSE contamination. Adequate specification has been included for the starting materials, solvents, and intermediates. Validation data are available and the robustness of the process has been demonstrated.

## Specification

The active substance specification using the different syntheses differs only  in  the  requirements  for residual solvents and impurities.

Appropriate specification has been set up for the active substance obtained by route B and route C and includes  appearance,  particle  size,  appearance  of  the  solution,  identification  (IR,  XR  and  optical rotation),  residual  solvents  (Gas  Chromatography  GC),  water  content,  sulfated  ash,  heavy  metals, related substances, assay (titration and HPLC), assay of the salt (fumaric acid), microbiological quality. The skip-testing approach for the microbiological quality is considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Specification of the active substance including residual solvents (in line with ICH requirements) and impurities  (justified  by  toxicological  data)  was  appropriately  justified.  An  overview  on  the  related substances  of  aliskiren  hemifumarate  has  been  presented  covering  potential  process  impurities  and degradation products (from synthesis B and C). Levels observed and the origin of related substances has been extensively discussed and found satisfactory. The limits are in line with ICH Q3A. The level of polymorphs is adequately controlled

Analytical methods  have  been  adequately  detailed and  non-compendial  methods  validated  in accordance with ICH guidelines.

The bulk of the active substance is packed in very tight packaging. The bags are stored in drums with a tamper resistant seal.

Batch analysis from batches obtained by the route B (12 batches) and the route C (6 batches) has demonstrated the uniformity and the consistency of the syntheses.

Data presented show the release testing of batches manufactured by syntheses B and A which were used in clinical  trials,  toxicological  studies  and  /  or  primary  stability  studies.  Comparative  analytical data of three more recent batches of aliskiren hemifumarate manufactured by the synthetic route B and three batches of drug substance manufactured by the synthetic route C. All the results were found compliant with the specification.

## Stability

## Stability summary and conclusions for synthesis B

Stability  data  on  three  pilot  batches  have  been  carried  out  under  ICH  long  term  (24  months, 25°C/60%RH)  and  accelerated  conditions  (6  months,  40°C/75%RH)  as  well  as  photostability  and stress testing under different conditions. Very tight packaging has to be used.

In  addition  six  production  batches  have  been  placed  under  stability. The stability  reports  submitted contain data covering 36 months of long term and 6 months of accelerated stability studies.

The  parameters  tested  were  including:  appearance,  identity  (IR,  X-ray  diffraction,  optical  rotation), impurities (HPLC), water content (Karl-Fischer), clarity and colour of the solution and assay (HPLC). All parameters  were  found  in  accordance  with  the  specification  and  no  major  degradation  could  be observed under long-term and accelerated conditions.

## Stability summary and conclusions for synthesis C

Stability data on four development batches and three production-scale batches have been carried out under ICH long term and accelerated conditions (24 months, 25°C/60%RH, 30°C/ 65% RH and 40°C/ 75% RH and 18 months respectively). The results obtained show that they are similar to the data obtained for aliskiren hemifumarate manufactured by synthesis B and confirm the storage precautions (store below 25°C, protect from light in very tight packaging).

Based on the discussion above, the data for synthesis B support a retest period of 30 months stored not  above  25°C  in  a  very  tight  packaging.  Stability  data  on  pilot  and  commercial  batches  from synthesis C are available for up to 24 and 18 months, respectively, and a re-a test period of 24 months stored not above 25°C in a very tight packaging can be granted.

## Drug  Substance  (to  be  changed  in  the  EPAR  to  'Active  Substance') Amlodipine Besilate

Amlodipine  besilate  (INN)  is  described  in  the  Ph.Eur  and  is  manufactured  by  two  active  substance manufacturers. Both manufacturers have presented Certificates of Suitability (CEP). The three CEPs, current version, are provided in the regional section of the dossier

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Amlodipine is a white or almost white powder. Physico-chemical properties such as solubility in various solvents, melting point, polymorphism and chirality have been described. The substance is used as a racemic mixture (R and S isomers). There is no polymorphism of Amlodipine besylate described in the literature.

All  the  information  relating  to  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of  materials,  critical  steps  and intermediates, manufacturing development, elucidation of the structure and impurities is covered by the CEP therefore no information was included in the dossier.

## Specification

Adequate specification  from  the  active  substance  suppliers  includes  the  following  tests:  description, particle size (laser diffraction), appearance of solution, identity (IR, XR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl-Fisher), sulfated ash (Ph.Eur.), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (ICP-OES), microbial contamination.

Upon receipt from the commercial manufacturers, the active substance is tested in accordance with internal Novartis testing monographs specific for each supplier.

The  monographs  are  based  on  the  requirements  for  amlodipine  besilate  as  found  in  the  Ph.  Eur. monograph, and include additional tests needed to conform to Novartis internal standards.

The  applicant  has  put  in  place  additional  tests  needed  by  comparison  to  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  to ensure  the  consistency  of  quality  for  the  active  substance  between  and  within  each  supplier.  The specification has been adequately justified and especially limits for impurities, heavy metals, residual solvents have been toxicologically justified.

In addition, amlodipine besilate is controlled for the content in besylate esters that are known to be genotoxic.  Moreover,  according  to  the  Q&amp;A  document  on  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Limits  of Genotoxic Impurities (EMA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007) the tolerated amounts of besylate esters should not be cumulated since the benzenesulfonate impurities are structurally related. The limits for besylate esters in amlodipine besylate have been restricted to NMT 75 ppm each and NMT 150 ppm for the sum. This was found acceptable.

In  summary,  the  active  substance  is  controlled  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  Ph.  Eur. monograph with  the  addition  of  the  following  tests,  which  are  not  source  specific:  identification  by XRPD and HPLC, Heavy metals, clarity of solution, colour of solution and microbial limits. Requirements for  additional  impurities  and  residual  solvents  are  included  in  the  specifications  and  are  active substance source specific.

All  analytical  procedures  used  for  testing  the  active  substance  have  been  properly  described. Compendial  methods  are  used  for  clarity  and  colour  of  the  solution,  identification,  water  content, sulphated ash, optical rotation, related substances and assay.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In-house analytical methods are used for particle size determination, identification, impurities, residual solvents, heavy metals and microbial enumeration test. Non-compendial methods have been validated in line with ICH guidelines.

Nine batches from both active substance manufacturers were tested for compliance against the test monographs. Certificates of analysis showed that all the batches meet the Ph.Eur. test requirements and all additional testing requirements from the applicant. Results demonstrate that the quality of the active pharmaceutical ingredient batches of both suppliers is comparable.

For  one  manufacturer,  the  drug  substance  is  filled  in  clear  polyethylene  bag,  tied  in  a  black polyethylene bag, tied and in HDPE container. For the other manufacturer, it consists of a polyethylene inner bag in a black polyethylene outer bag in or without (Process II) a cardboard box or polypropylene

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pail  with  lid. The  certificates  of  compliance  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  the  foodstuff  legislation  for  the packaging materials have been provided

## Stability

For one manufacturer, a retest period of 5 years and 1 year (depending on the synthetic route) have been granted on the CEPs. For the other manufacturer, the CEP provides no re-test period, long-term and accelerated stability data are provided but the Applicant commits to test each batch of amlodipine besilate before producing the drug product. Testing will be performed until an in-house re-test period is specified.

## Drug Substance Hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ

Hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ (INN) is a white to almost white powder, controlled according to PhEur monograph. Its chemical structure is represented as follow:

<!-- image -->

General  properties  such  as  solubility  in  various  aqueous  and  non-aqueous  solvents,  dissociation constants,  distribution  coefficients,  optical  rotation  (inactive  since  does  not  possess  an  asymmetric center),  water  sorption  properties  (non-hygroscopic)  and  polymorphism  (Form I  is  the  normally isolated crystalline form of the active substance) have been extensively studied.

## Manufacture

Both  suppliers  posses  a  CEP.  Both  manufacturers  supplying  the  'crude'  HCTZ  comply  with  PhEur requirements.

Commercially available hydrochlorothiazide (or 'crude' HCTZ) from both suppliers is further purified by recrystallization  and  micronised  by  the  applicant.  The  final  HCTZ  is  tested  against  the  applicant's testing monograph.

Satisfactory control of reagents and solvents has been presented. No critical process steps have been identified and no intermediate product is formed during manufacture of hydrochlorothiazide. No process validation was deemed necessary.

The  structure  of  HCTZ  is  supported  by  the  synthetic  route  and  has  been  elucidated  by  elemental analysis,  ultraviolet  (UV)  and  infrared  (IR)  spectroscopy,  proton  ( 1 H-NMR)  and  carbon  ( 13 C-NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance. A comprehensive analysis of polymorphism was carried out using X-ray powder diffraction  spectra,  Raman spectra,  DSC curves and thermogravimetry.  The analysis showed that forms I and II could be distinguished and differentiated from solvate forms. Form I is the form usually obtained when hydrochlorothiazide is manufactured.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eur. analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and in-house methods have been validated in accordance with ICH requirements.

Analytical results of six batches of micronized hydrochlorothiazide obtained from the different suppliers were presented and in line with the retained specification. Results confirm batch to batch consistency and uniformity of the quality of the substance and indicate that the process is under control.

The analytical results of three batches of micronized hydrochlorothiazide are presented.

Bulk hydrochlorothiazide is stored in metallic drums lined with two polyethylene bags which are sealed with a plastic closure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is packed in polyethylene bags and wrapped with kraft paper kept in a fiber drum. Appropriate specification for primary packaging material including identification test by IR, appearance, size and microbiological tests was provided along with certificate of analysis.

## Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  by  the  applicant  on  eight  production  batches  of  micronized hydrochlorothiazide  under  ICH  long  term  storage  conditions  (up  to  5  years,  25°C  /  60%  RH), accelerated conditions (6 months data, 40°C / 75% RH), stress testing and photostability testing. The quality  characteristics  (e.g.  physical  characteristics  like  clarity  and  absorbance  of  the  solution  in dimethyl sulfoxide, impurity profile and assay) of the active substance are unchanged as demonstrated by comparative analytical data. Results of data at the long term storage conditions of 25°C / 60% RH up to 5 years and 6 months data at accelerated storage conditions of 40°C / 75% RH were provided. The data support 5 years re-test period for micronized hydrochlorothiazide when protected from light. 2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product The  aim  of  the  formulation  development  of  Rasitrio  film-coated  tablet  was  to  obtain  an  immediate release  tablet  combination  product  that  would  be  bioequivalent  to  the  marketed  products  containing each active substance individually. The five different tablet strengths with the following aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide ratios are described as follows: 150/5/12.5 mg: Violet white film coated tablet, ovaloid convex with bevelled edges, with  debossing 'YIY' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet. 300/5/12.5 mg : Light pink  film  coated  tablet,  ovaloid  convex  with  bevelled  edges,  with  debossing 'LIL' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet. 300/10/12.5  mg:  Light  red  film  coated  tablet,  ovaloid  convex  with  bevelled  edges,  with  debossing 'UIU' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet. Medicinal product no longer authorised

300/5/25  mg:  Pale  orange  brown  film  coated  tablet,  ovaloid  convex  with  bevelled  edges,  with debossing 'OIO' on one side and  'NVR' on the reverse  side of the tablet.

300/10/25  mg:  Brown  film  coated  tablet,  ovaloid  convex  with  bevelled  edges,  with  debossing  with 'VIV' on one side and 'NVR' on the reverse side of the tablet.

The excipients used for the core tablets are common  standard pharmaceutical excipients: microcrystalline  cellulose,  crospovidone,  povidone, magnesium  stearate,  silica  colloidal  anhydrous, ethanol with 5% isopropanol.

The  Coating  premixes  (white,  yellow  and  red)  are  commercially  available  materials  containing  iron oxides and/or titanium oxides, macrogol, talc and hypromellose.

There  are  difference  in  the  ratios  of  the  film-coating  pre-mixes  that  make  the  various  strengths distinguishable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The component of the premixes are given and comply with the standard of the Ph.Eur. or with the Directive  2008/128/EC.  The  difference  in  the  premixes  is  the  colourant  (iron  oxide  and  titanium dioxide).

The primary packaging consists of tablets are PA/AL/PVC blister packs (Alu blisters) and PCTFE/PVC blister packs backed with a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil.

## Pharmaceutical development

Aliskiren  is  a  single  diastereoisomer  with  4  S-configured  chiral  centers.  Its  hemifumarate  salt  was selected  for  the  drug  product,  because  it  was  the  only  one  which  showed  crystallinity.  Aliskiren hemifumarate is a white to slightly yellowish hygroscopic crystalline powder with high solubility and low permeability according to the BCS (class 3). Aliskiren does not possess adequate compactability properties therefore needs granulation. Aliskiren has shown very good chemical compatibility with all the  excipients  used in  the  formulation,  proved  by  previously  approved  formulations.  Given  the  high solubility,  particle  size  is  not  a  concern  however  the  particle  size  is  checked  to  be  under  1000  µm (90%). The crystalline form is checked in the specifications.

Amlodipine besylate is described in the US Pharmacopoeia and Ph.Eur.  From the literature it is known to be well absorbed (90% in humans) and with a good solubility. No classification according BCS is given, however given the low dose it may be considered as a high solubility drug. Particle size may be an issue and therefore is controlled by laser diffraction. Amlodipine besylate is sourced from two drug substance suppliers with CEPs.

HCTZ is described in USP and European Pharmacopeia. It is a white to almost white powder and very slightly  soluble  in  water  and  in  acidic  medium.  Solubility  increases  at  alkaline  pH  but  still  remain slightly  soluble. Two  polymorphic  forms  of  hydrochlorothiazide  have  been  identified:  form I  and form II.  The final crystallization step of current manufacturing process is performed in methanol and water and yields predominately form I. The two forms show similar solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate in physiological media. No impact on bioavailability is foreseen.

The  excipients  selected  are  standard  ingredients  in  tablet  formulations,  and  are  in  compliance  with internationally accepted pharmacopoeial standards.  The concentrations of each excipient are within the usual range of application.

No specific compatibility studies between the three drug substances are presented and compatibility with excipients is claimed on the basis of previous authorizations. In addition, in this application, adequate compatibility studies between the three active substances and the excipients were performed, along with stability data. The results confirm there is no incompatibility observed.

The  tablet  cores  are  coated  with  a  non-functional  coating  to  provide  a  distinctive  tablet  colour  to identify the different dosage strengths.  The basic coating premixes are a combination of ingredients established for use in medicinal products.

The premixes themselves do not appear in any pharmacopoeia; but the ingredients meet compendial requirements and/or international standards.

The development of the combination product was initially based upon the formulation and manufacturing process of the already authorised products Rasilez HCT (aliskiren/HCTZ) and Exforge (valsartan/amlodipine).

## Overages

A 20 % overage is included in the film coating suspension to compensate for any losses that may occur during the film-coating  process.

## Dissolution

Dissolution studies were presented to demonstrate drug release.  The methodology selected was based on the methods used for existing marketed products Rasilez and HCT/Rasilez HCT. The method was similar to the USP method for hydrochlorothiazide tablets and amlodipine tablets.

The sink conditions are respected for all actives given the low dosage of amlodipine and hydrochlorthizide.  The  choice  of  the  medium  is  acceptable  since  the  method  has  already  been approved for marketed formulations. The discriminative power of the method to distinguish different formulations was demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To  support  biowaivers,  dissolution  data  for  the  Rasitrio  film  coated  tablet  formulations  (five  dosage strengths,  in  dissolution  media  under  the  same  conditions  are  presented  in  comparison  with  the dissolution of the biobatch. Based on the f 2  values the dissolution profiles are considered similar in all media.  Based  on  the  above,  the  Biowaiver  can  be  accepted  in  line  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on Bioequivalence.

Based on the available stability data, the following packaging materials are claimed to be sufficiently protective  and  compatible  with  the  film-coated  tablets: PA/AL/PVC  blister  packs  (Alu  blisters)  and PCTFE/PVC blister packs.

## Adventitious agents

There are no excipients of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of the finished product .A declaration that the magnesium stearate used is of vegetable origin is provided.

## Manufacture of the product

Details of the manufacturing process and appropriate in-process controls including parameters such as mean mass, individual mass, thickness, hardness, friability, disintegration time have been provided.

The  manufacture  of  the  tablets  can  be  summarised  as  follows  and  this  applies  to  all  five  strengths: formation of the aliskiren granulate, formation of the amlodipine/HCTZ granulate, final blending followed by compression and film-coating.

The  manufacturing  process  presents  some  critical  points,  especially  concerning  the  homogeneity  of blends, due to the low concentration (0.5-2.5%) of amlodipine and HCTZ.

Since both amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide amlodipine are dosed at very low concentrations, the applicant has discussed the criticality of the blending step. Adequate discussion on the assessment of blending times and conditions has been provided. The blending times are included in the updated flow chart of the manufacturing process.

A summary of the process validation scheme is available in section 3.2.R. The sampling plan contains the sampling points, tests, sample quantities and acceptance criteria for final blend, compression and film-coated  tablets.  Since  the  manufacturing  process  is  not  considered  standard  (due  to  the  low content of two of the active substances) validation results for three full scale batches of each strength have been required preapproval. The validation data submitted show that the manufacturing process is robust and consistently yields drug product, which meets the predetermined quality characteristics.

## Control of Excipients

All the excipients used in the core formulation comply with the quality requirements of the applicable compendial monograph.

Monographs  for  the  premixes  themselves  do  not  appear  in  any  pharmacopoeia,  however,  their respective  ingredients  meet  compendial  requirements  and  international  standards.  These  include, Macrogol/PEG 4000 (Ph. Eur.), Talc (Ph. Eur.), Hypromellose (Ph. Eur.), Titanium dioxide (Ph. Eur.) and iron oxides (red, yellow) controlled according to commission directive 2008/128/EC and the NF.

Eur),  and  microbial  limit  tests  (Ph  Eur),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

residual solvents (GC) - The specification for the drug product is considered acceptable and the limits for the  degradation  products  are  justified  based  on  stability  data  and  do  not  raise  any  concern  from  a toxicological point of view.

Analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH guidelines Q2R1.

## Batch analytical data

Batch results have been provided for at least 3 pilot batches per strength, the results were found in compliance with the specification and confirm the consistency of the process and the performance of the analytical testing.

## Container closure system

The primary packaging for the film-coated tablets are PA/AL/PVC blister packs (Alu/Alu) and PCTFE/PVC blister packs backed with a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil. Testing Monographs for PA/AL/PVC forming foil, for PCTFE/PVC forming foil and for Aluminium lidding foil are presented. The components of the PA/AL/PVC and PCTFE/PVC blisters are tested for cleanliness, total thickness and identity (IR). In addition the Applicant states that the packaging components comply with Ph. Eur. requirements (where applicable, e.g. PVC, PA) and/or foodstuff legislation. Stability of the product Stability results have been presented 15 pilot batches (three batches per strength) kept in the commercial packaging. The batches have been stored under ICH long term testing at 25°C/60%RH and intermediate testing 30°C/65%RH  (12  months),  accelerated  testing  at  40°C/75%RH  (6  months),  as  well  as  other temperatures (e.g. -20°C, 5°C and 50°C). Special tests (e.g. photostability and microbial enumeration) have also been performed. The characteristics tested during the stability study were: appearance, water content, besylate esters, dissolution (all actives), assay and degradation products (all actives), microbial limits. Parameters remained within the specification when the product was kept at 25°C and 30°C and no significant change could be observed, slight increase was observed under accelerated conditions but all results remained within the specification. Photostability data showed that the product is stable in the proposed packages. Stability data support the proposed shelf life under the precautions of storage described in the Product Information. 2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The active substance aliskiren hemifumarate is optically active with four chiral carbons but exists as a single  diastereoisomer.  It  is  manufactured  via  2  stereochemically  controlled  syntheses  (route  B  and route  C).  Controls  of  stereochemistry,  polymorphism  and  impurities  have  been  fully  discussed. Appropriate  specification  has  been  presented.  Stability  studies  conducted  according  to  the  ICH guidelines  showed  that  aliskiren  hemifumarate  is  stable.  Based  on  the  discussion  above,  the  data support  synthesis  B  support  a  retest  period  of  30  months  stored  not  above  25°C  in  a  very  tight packaging. Stability data on pilot and commercial batches from synthesis C are available for up to 24 and 18 months, respectively, and a re-a test period of 24 months stored not above 25°C in a very tight packaging can be granted.

The active substance amlodipine besilate is covered by Certificates of Suitability CEP from 2 suppliers. Adequate specification has been presented. For one manufacturer, a retest period of 5 years and 1 year (depending on the synthetic route) have been granted on the CEPs. For the other manufacturer,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  CEP  provides  no  re-test  period.  Long-term  and  accelerated  stability  data  are  provided  but  the Applicant commits to test each batch of amlodipine besilate before to produce the drug product.

The active substance Hydrochlorothiazide or HCTZ (INN) is covered by Certificate of Suitability CEP and ASMF  procedure.  The  last  steps  of  crystallisation  and  micronisation  are  performed  by  the  applicant. Adequate specification has been presented. Results of data at the long term storage conditions of 25°C / 60% RH up to 5 years and 6 months data at accelerated storage conditions of 40°C / 75% RH were provided. The data support a 5 years re-test period for micronized hydrochlorothiazide when protected from light.

Rasitrio  film-coated  tablets  are  formulated  as  an  immediate  release  formulation  with  well-known excipients.  Compatibility  with  regard  to  excipients  is  justified  by  stability  results.  The  pharmaceutical development is comprehensive and adequate. Manufacturing method has been described and allows the production of a consistent and homogeneous product. The manufacturing process is not a standard one, since two of the actives are present in very low concentrations (ranging from 0.5 to 2.5% approx) and the applicant has presented an adequate validation protocol as well as validation results for three full scale batches of each strength. The validation data submitted show that the manufacturing process is robust and consistently yields drug product, which meets the predetermined quality characteristics.

The  description  and  choice  of  the  container  is  acceptable  based  on  stability  data.  Drug  product specification is satisfactory and in line with ICH guidelines. Stability results have been presented on 3 pilot batches for each strength in two different packaging configurations (PA/AL/PVC (Alu) blister packs and in PCTFE/PVC blisters). Stability data support the proposed shelf life under the precautions of storage described in the Product Information. 2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this medicinal product is considered satisfactory when used with the conditions defined in the SPC. The documentation provided for the active substances aliskiren hemifumarate, amlodipine besilate  and  HCTZ  is  comprehensive  and  adequately  detailed.  The  pharmaceutical  development  is adequate and took into consideration the properties and the stability of the three active substances. The  excipients  used  are  common  excipients  for  immediate  release  dosage  forms.  Similarly,  the packaging material is well documented and no incompatibility has been noticed. The validation of the manufacturing  process  ensures  consistency  and  reproducibility  of  the  finished  product.  The  finished product has been satisfactorily controlled and stability studies conducted under ICH conditions showed that the product is stable throughout the proposed shelf-life. 2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development None 2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1.  Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  preclinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted  with  Rasitrio.  The  available  evidence  from literature, concerning the single components, was submitted. The lack of preclinical pharmacology data is justified by the lack of adequate animal models. This is considered acceptable. No specific safety or pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  and  reference  is  made  to  the  evidence concerning single components. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the individual components of SAH100, aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, have been characterized and studied preclinically  as  well  as  clinically.  No  preclinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  with Rasitrio.

With respect to the toxicological studies, extensive preclinical safety studies were conducted in mice, rats,  and  marmosets  during  the  development  of  the  aliskiren,  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. General toxicity studies in rats with durations up to 13 weeks were also conducted with the  combination  of  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide  as  well  as  the  combination  of  aliskiren  and amlodipine. There were no new toxicities identified from these toxicity studies. In view of considerable preclinical and clinical safety data, it was not deemed necessary to conduct preclinical toxicity studies with Rasitrio.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2.  Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

Studies on pharmacodynamics for were not conducted primarily due to the lack of appropriate animal models. The testing of human renin inhibitors in experimental animals is significantly hampered by the species  specificity  exhibited  by  renin  and  the  human  renin  inhibitor,  aliskiren,  has  relatively  weak potency against rat renin, and consequently shows poor efficacy in this species. Due to the lack of appropriate animal models, pharmacology results for the FDC were not generated.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No specific preclinical secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Rasitrio, due to the lack of appropriate animal models as described above.

Safety pharmacology programme There were no safety pharmacology concerns with the individual components of Rasitrio and therefore, further investigations were not conducted for the fixed combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, which is consistent with the recommendations of the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions The  safety  of  aliskiren,  amlodipine,  and  hydrochlorothiazide  has  been  demonstrated  in  preclinical studies,  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  programmes.  Given  the  distinct  mechanism  of  action  of aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide, the combination of these drugs is not expected to be of concerns with respect to drug-drug interactions. 2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics Aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are approved and marketed products in both, the EU and USA. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the individual components (aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) are well characterised and have been extensively studied preclinically as well as clinically. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the single components of Rasitrio have been reviewed and data  for  the  combinations  aliskiren/amlodipine  and  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  are  also  reported. There are a number of preclinical studies described in the literature. Special non-clinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies were not performed with Rasitrio. The individual components are not anticipated to behave or act differently when combined. No specific studies with the FDC were conducted on distribution, placental passage or concentration in milk as based on the behaviour of the monocomponents, these were deemed unnecessary. The metabolic and excretion pathways of aliskiren, amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  were  briefly  reported  and  do  not  indicate  the  need  for  specific studies  with  the  FDC.  The  different  clearance  mechanisms  of  the  individual  components  (i.e. hydrochlorothiazide: renal clearance, amlodipine: metabolism clearance and aliskiren: biliary clearance) do  not  suggest  an  obvious  potential  interference  on  the  disposition  of  the  components  when administered  in  a  combined  manner.  In  addition,  preclinical  as  well  as  clinical  evidence  for  the monotherapies suggests a low drug-drug interaction potential at the biochemical level of transporters and P450 inhibition. Thus, a clinically significant drug-drug interaction on the basis of inhibition is also not likely for Rasitrio. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A brief overview of the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual monocomponents as derived from the submitted data based on literature recherché is described below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

The  rate  of  absorption  of  aliskiren  was  rapid  in  mice,  rats,  and  moderate  in  dogs  and  marmosets. Aliskiren has very a low bioavailability (1%-3%) in all studied species but dogs. After oral dosing, the concentration-time  profiles  of  aliskiren  (and  total  radioactivity  with  administration  of  radiolabelled compound) were highly  variable  and  peaked  between  0.25  and  3  hours  in  all  species  investigated. Hydrochlorothiazide is well absorbed in all tested animal species and is largely excreted in unchanged form with urine. Oral doses of amlodipine were well absorbed in mice, rats and dogs.

## Distribution

The volume of distribution (Vss) of aliskiren at steady-state was high in the rat, moderate in humans and  mice,  and  low  in  marmosets. Binding  of  aliskiren  to  plasma  proteins  was  moderate  with  free fractions (fu) of 29% (mouse), 38% (rat) and 50% (human). Amlodipine was highly distributed into tissues with a large volume of distribution around 21-32 L/kg across various tested species. Amlodipine was  highly  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  (98%  at  a  drug  concentration  of  50  ng/mL).  Protein binding was similar in dogs and rats (97% and 94% respectively). Hydrochlorothiazide binds to plasma proteins only to a low extent and is moderately distributed in body tissue with a volume of distribution following oral administration corresponding to 0.83 L/kg.

Interactions on a pharmacokinetic basis, in terms of enzyme induction, inhibition or substrate, as well as  protein  binding,  were  reviewed  for  the  single  components  of  Rasitrio.  The  different  clearance mechanisms  of  the  individual  components  of  Rasitrio  (i.e.  hydrochlorothiazide:  renal  clearance, amlodipine:  metabolism  clearance,  aliskiren:  biliary  clearance)  do  not  suggest  an  obvious  potential interference  on  the  disposition  of  the  components  when  administered  in  combination.  In  addition, preclinical  as  well  as  clinical  evidence  for  the  monotherapies  suggests  a  low  drug-drug  interaction potential  at  the  biochemical  level  of  transporters  and  P450  inhibition  manner.  Thus,  a  drug-drug interaction  on  the  basis  of  inhibition  is  not  likely  for  the  triple  combination  of  Rasitrio.  Therefore, additional non-clinical studies on the interaction potential of the triple combination were not deemed necessary.

Metabolism Aliskiren was metabolised to a low to moderate extent in humans, marmosets, rats and mice (about 15% to 25% of dose). The most abundant component in plasma and excreta was unchanged aliskiren. Primary  metabolic  pathways  involved  oxidative  reactions  on  the  phenol  moiety  of  aliskiren,  like  Odealkylation,  and  further  oxidation  to  the  carboxylic  acid  leading  to  metabolites  M1  to  M4.  These oxidation processes had been found to be catalyzed largely by CYP3A4/5 enzymes. Minor metabolic pathways  were  the  formation  of  glucuronide  metabolites  (M5  and  M6)  and  hydrolytic  cleavage  of aliskiren at the amide bond leading to M10 and/or M11. All metabolites observed in plasma were also found  in  the  excreta  either  in  free  or  conjugated  form.  Amlodipine  was  eliminated  mainly  through extensive, though slow metabolism and with low first pass extraction in mouse, dog and humans. The metabolites showed negligible calcium channel antagonist activity relative to amlodipine. Only a small fraction of the dose (up to 5%) was recovered in urine as unchanged drug. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized to a relevant degree and the bulk of the dose (95% of dose) is excreted unchanged in urine. Excretion In mice, rats, marmosets and humans, aliskiren and its metabolites were predominantly excreted into faeces  (≥88%  of  the  absorbed  oral  dose)  indicating  high  biliary/faecal  elimination  of  the  absorbed fraction of the administered dose. Renal excretion was generally low in all investigated species (≤4.5%, p.o. and ≤15%, i.v.), including humans. Excretion was complete within 7 days, with the main fraction of  a  radioactive  dose  recovered  within  24-48  hours.  About  50%  of  an  oral  dose  of  amlodipine  was recovered in urine and feces of rats and dogs and orally administered hydrochlorothiazide is excreted largely unchanged with urine. In humans, &gt;95% of the absorbed hydrochlorothiazide was excreted in urine. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.4.  Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity studies were fully evaluated for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide as part  of  their  mono-therapy  development  programs.  The  findings  from  these  studies  were  generally consistent with those anticipated for the drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system; further single dose toxicity studies were therefore not conducted

<!-- image -->

Amlodipine  was  evaluated  for  toxicity  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  in  which  higher  doses  of  amlodipine resulted  in  compound-related  effects  with  little  relevance  to  humans  at  clinical  doses.  In  the  acute toxicity studies, amlodipine caused severe peripheral vasodilation and hypotension in dogs, and caused mortality in mice and rats. In oral subacute/chronic toxicity studies in rats, there was thickening of the adrenal zona glomerulosa, hepatotoxicity, decreases in body weight, and decreases in plasma sodium, chloride and calcium and increases in plasma urea. In oral subacute/chronic toxicity studies in dogs, treatment-related effects included diuresis, increases in heart rate and lesions in the gingiva and the wall of right atrium.

Repeat dose toxicity Repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, as well as  for  the  combinations  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine,  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide.  The  toxicity findings  from  these  studies  were  generally  consistent  with  those  of  each  component  from  the previously  conducted  toxicity  studies.  There  were  no  new  toxicity  findings  or  more  severe  toxicities noted from the treatment of the combinations in durations up to 13 weeks. In view of the considerable safety  data  available  for  each  component  of  Rasitrio  and  the  approved  double  combinations,  it  is expected that safety profile of Rasitrio is similar to those of the double combinations. Therefore, no additional repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted. Aliskiren Aliskiren was  evaluated  for general toxicity  in  rats  and  marmosets.  Premature  deaths  were encountered  at  doses ≥ 200  mg/kg/day  in  oral  (gavage)  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  rats.  As aliskiren  is  a  local  irritant  and  can  cause  necrosis  of  the  respiratory  epithelium,  the  deaths  were attributed  to  aspiration  of  the  dosing  solution  into  the  respiratory  tract  rather  than  systemic  toxic effects.  In  marmosets,  two  incidences  of  urinary  stasis  in  decedent  animals  were  attributed  to hypotension and poor renal perfusion. Other changes in marmosets included reductions in erythropoietic parameters probably due to the effect of the renin-angiotensin system on the production of  erythropoietin  in  the  kidney.  Similar  findings  have  been  previously  observed  with  a  variety  of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Arteriolar or juxtaglomerular hypertrophy/hyperplasia were also  recorded  in  the  kidneys  and  were  considered to  be  due to  the  hypertrophy/proliferation  of  the renin  secreting  periarteriolar  cells  of  the  juxtaglomerular  apparatus.  These  changes  were  not accompanied  by  adverse  effects  on  the  renal  vasculature  or  the  urinary  system  and  they  were regarded as exaggerated pharmacological effects. Amlodipine Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hydrochlorothiazide

Toxicity studies with hydrochlorothiazide were conducted in mice and rats by dietary administration for 15-days,  13-weeks  and  2-years.    No  rats  died  during  the  15-day  or  13-week  studies  at  dietary concentrations of up to 50,000 ppm. Increased nephrosis and mineralisation at the renal corticomedullary junction were the primary toxic effects in rats. Deaths of male mice in the high-dose group in the 13-week study were likely to be related to compound administration and resulted from nephrosis, calculi, inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia in the urinary bladder.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Aliskiren/amlodipine

The nonclinical safety profile of aliskiren/amlodipine was evaluated in general toxicity studies in 2- and 13-week oral (gavage) toxicity studies in rats. The 2-week rat study was a dose range-finding toxicity study. The toxicity findings in this study included those in large intestine at doses of 100/3 and 300/10 mg/kg/day,  and  characterised  as  inflammation  and  hypertrophy/hyperplasia.  The  changes  are consistent with those previously observed for aliskiren in repeated-dose toxicity study in rats. In the 13-week rat study with aliskiren/amlodipine, the adverse effects were mainly in the high dose group of the  combination  (300/10  mg/kg/day),  aliskiren  or  amlodipine  alone  groups.  The  findings  included premature deaths and clinical signs of shallow/deep/laboured breathing, abnormal breathing sounds and salivation.  The findings were consistent with those observed in the previous 13-week rat study with  aliskiren  and  associated  with  local  irritation  of  aliskiren  as  a  result  of  aspiration  of  the  dosing solution into the respiratory tract rather than systemic toxic effects. Minimal changes were noted in clinical  pathology  parameters,  including  decreases  in  mean  lymphocyte  counts  and  decreases  in globulin concentrations in the combination group and the amlodipine alone group.  The pathological findings included pale discoloration or foci of the adrenals and corresponding histopathological changes of  minimal  hypertrophy/vacuolation  of  the  zona  glomerulosa  in  rats  treated  with  amlodipine  at  10 mg/kg/day and SPA100 at 300/10 mg/kg/day.

No genotoxic potential was identified for aliskiren or amlodipine. Genotoxicity studies conducted with hydrochlorothiazide included: Salmonella (Ames test), chromosomal aberration (in vitro cytogenetics), drosophila  (sex-linked  recessive  lethal/reciprocal  translocation),  mouse  lymphoma  assay  and  sister chromatid  exchange  assay  (in  vitro  cytogenetics).  Mouse  lymphoma  assay  and  sister  chromatid exchange assay had positive results, whilst the other tests were negative. Based on all the available literature, the in vivo genotoxic potential of hydrochlorothiazide is low. Since the genotoxic potential of alikiren,  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  was  fully  evaluated  individually,  no  additional  genetic toxicity tests were performed for the triple combination.

Aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide Preclinical safety studies conducted with SPH100 included 2- and 13-week oral (gavage) repeated dose toxicity  studies  in  rats.  In  the  2-week  rat  study,  the  dose  of  300/25  mg/kg/day  (aliskiren  and hydrochlorothiazide)  resulted  in  morbidity  and  an  early  group  sacrifice.  Increased  plasma  urea  and creatinine concentrations and basophilic tubules, hyaline casts and tubular necrosis in the kidney were frequently observed and suggest that the moribund condition of the animals was attributed to marked hypotension  and  poor  renal  perfusion  associated  with  exaggerated  pharmacological  effect  of  the combination. In the 13-week rat study, the toxicity findings included mild effects on the kidneys and adrenal  glands  at  doses  up  to  150/12  mg/kg/day  (aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide)  that  were consistent  with  the  pharmacological  effects  of  aliskiren  and/or  hydrochlorothiazide.  Alterations  in kidney function were seen at all doses of the combination and with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide treatment alone and comprised reversible decreases in serum potassium and chloride concentrations and increased urine volume but there were no corresponding histopathological alterations. Minimally increased cellular vacuolation in the zona glomerulosa was observed in the adrenal glands of animals treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone and among all groups treated with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide. These alterations  persisted  on  completion  of  the  4-week  recovery  period  for  animals  treated  at  the highest  dose  of  the  combination.  No  changes  were  observed  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  of  these animals.  In  conclusion,  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  was  generally  well  tolerated  by  rats  and  the findings observed in the toxicity studies were clearly attributable to the exaggerated pharmacological effects of aliskiren and/or hydrochlorothiazide. Genotoxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenic potential of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide was fully evaluated individually and no carcinogenic potential was identified for either substance. No additional carcinogenicity studies were performed for the triple combination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reproduction Toxicity

Reproduction and developmental toxicity for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were fully evaluated individually. There were no reproductive and/or developmental toxicity noted with aliskiren in  rats  and  rabbits  and  with  hydrochlorothiazide  in  rats  and  mice.  Amlodipine  was  not  teratogenic, however prolonged the duration of gestation and labour in rats, decreased the litter size and increased the number of intrauterine deaths at 10 mg/kg/day, which is likely to be connected with exaggerated pharmacological effect. In view of the existing data for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, it is  considered  that  additional  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  with  Rasitrio  were  not necessary.

## Toxicokinetic data

The toxicokinetic analyses were included in the evaluation of repeat toxicity studies for the individual components and/or the double combinations and no safety signals have been identified.

<!-- image -->

Local Tolerance No specific local tolerance studies were conducted with Rasitrio since local tolerance via the intended clinical route administration (oral) was assessed during the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats for each mono-therapy and for the approved double combinations. No concerns were identified. Other toxicity studies The available nonclinical safety data for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide do not indicate any potential for antigenicity, immunotoxicity or dependency. In view of these data and the available clinical experience with each of the mono-therapy components, further nonclinical studies to evaluate these  effects  for  SAH100  are  not  considered  necessary  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005. 2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) submitted for Rasitrio was prepared in compliance with the CHMP  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  The  active  molecules  have  been  assessed  separately. Predicted  environmental  concentrations  exceeded the  threshold  value  of  0.01  μL  and  triggering  a Phase II - Tier A for all three active pharmaceutical ingredients. Aliskiren shows low acute and chronic toxicity towards aquatic organisms. Based on the low adsorption coefficient determined for sludge, partitioning to soil is not expected for aliskiren. Bioaccumulation is not expected. The value of log Koc &lt; 4 in the adsorption/desorption study suggests a low to moderate sorption to soil and sludge. Due to the absence of UV absorption above 290 nm, photodegradation is expected  to  be  minimal.  Aliskiren  has  no  significant  potential  to  inhibit  the  microbial  activity  of activated  sludge,  even  at  high  concentrations,  and  is  not  readily  biodegradable.  The  assessment  of transformation in aerobic water sediment systems showed values that exceed the trigger level for a Tier B sediment assessment of 10 % of drug substance in sediment after 14 days. Although a highly conservative approach in predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) calculation has been adopted, the PEC water  /PNEC surfacewater , PEC microorg  /PNEC microorg , PEC groundwater  /PNEC groundwater  values are well below the  recommended  threshold  values  indicated  in  the  regulatory  guidelines.  Results  of  Tier  B  risk assessment on sediment dwelling organisms, in particular on the midge larvae Chironomus riparius , suggests  that  no  risk  for  the  sediment  compartment  due  to  exposure  to  aliskiren  is  expected. Considering the recent evaluation of SVP100 (aliskiren/valsartan) and SPA100 (aliskiren/amlodipine) and the evidences provided, the ERA on aliskiren can be considered in compliance with EMA guidelines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Amlodipine  shows  significant  chronic  toxicity  to  aquatic  species  with  the  green  algae  species Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata being the most sensitive species tested. Amlodipine has the potential to inhibit the microbial activity of activated sludge at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L. However, amlodipine  is  neither  considered  to  be  stable  in  surface  water,  based  on  its  photolability,  nor  is  it persistent in sediment compartments. Although a highly conservative approach in PEC calculation has been adopted, the PEC water  /PNEC surfacewater , PEC microorg  /PNEC microorg , PEC groundwater  /PNEC groundwater  values are below the recommended threshold values indicated in the regulatory guidelines. Amlodipine is not expected to bio-accumulate. Nevertheless, clarifications were requested by the CHMP on the degree of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adsorption to sludge and partitioning into sediments, and on the types of sludge tested for amlodipine. These issues were clarified and it was agreed that amlodipine exhibits moderate sorption to sludge and even  if  the  testing  protocol  did  not  entirely  adhere  to  the  OECD  106  guideline,  the  moderate  Koc values found for amlodipine make significant increases of adsorption in different sludge types unlikely. On the other hand, according to the results of the Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems test, more than 10% of the test substance is present in the sediment after 14 days, which triggers a Tier B risk assessment on sediment dwelling organisms. According to OECD 308 guideline, metabolites with concentration &gt;10% in total system water/sediment are to be identified, thus the CHMP recommended that  Tier  B  risk  assessment  on  amlodipine  (toxicity  to  sediment-dwelling  organisms  OECD218)  is provided.

Hydrochlorothiazide shows low chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms. It has no significant potential to inhibit  the  microbial  activity  of  activated  sludge  and  is  not  readily  biodegradable.  No  significant adsorption  on  sludge  has  been  observed  and  therefore  the  potential  to  partition  into  terrestrial compartments  via  the  potential  spreading  of  STP  sludge  on  agricultural  soils  is  considered  to  be negligible. The study on transformation in water/sediment systems revealed significant partitioning of hydrochlorothiazide into sediments, thus indicating the need for a sediment risk assessment. After 14 days, 17 % and 24 % of the dose applied to the water/sediment systems were present as extractable parent hydrochlorothiazide in the sediment phase of the low organic carbon and high organic carbon sediment, respectively. Consequently, a toxicity study with the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus  riparius was  conducted  and  a  sediment  risk  assessment  is  described  in  Tier  B. Hydrochlorothiazide  is  not  expected  to  bio-accumulate.  The  highest  risk  ratio  has been  found  for sewage treatment plants. Hydrochlothiazide has been found to be non-toxic to the sediment-dwelling larvae of C. riparius up to a limit concentration of 10 mg/kg, no risk to the sediment compartment is expected.

## 2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No specific studies with Rasitrio were conducted concerning primary and secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, animal pharmacokinetics, single-dose toxicity, genotoxic potential, carcinogenic potential,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  and  special  toxicity  studies.  For  all  of  the  above aspects,  reference  was  made  to  previous  studies  conducted  with  the  single  components  aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, assuming that the individual components of the fixed association were not expected to behave differently when given in combination. As far as pharmacodynamics was concerned,  the  lack  of  special  studies  was  also  justified  by  the  unavailability  of  appropriate  animal models. The effort to reduce to a minimum the number of experimental animals -taking into account the indications of the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005 guideline- is considered acceptable.

After  the  initial  marketing  authorization  of  the  anti-hypertensive  agent  aliskiren,  several  fixed associations  -including  aliskiren  as  a  component-  have  been  developed,  namely  the  associations between  aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide,  valsartan  or  amlodipine.  These  were  supported  by  nonclinical development including 2-weeks and 13-weeks toxicity studies in rats. In addition, there is some

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinical experience available to date with the use of these combinations in practice. Thus, the currently provided literature recherché is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The  CHMP,  however,  raise  a  concern  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  and  in  the  context  of technical and scientific progress, recommended that the applicant provides the Tier B assessment on amlodipine (toxicity to sediment-dwelling organisms OECD218) and conducts a shortened version of the OECD308 study to allow for identification of Metabolite 1.

## 2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

No  specific  studies  with  the  fixed  combination  Rasitrio  were  conducted  concerning  primary  and secondary  pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology,  animal  pharmacokinetics,  single-dose  toxicity, genotoxic potential, carcinogenic potential, reproductive and developmental toxicity and special toxicity studies.  Justification  for  the  lack  of  non-clinical  testing  has  been  provided  along  with  the  literature overviews  available  for  the  mono-components  and/or  double  combinations.  This  is  considered acceptable  and  in  line  with  the  current  CHMP  guidelines.  The  environmental  toxicity  profile  of amlodipine should be better characterised and the CHMP recommended conduct of additional testing.

The regulatory requirements relevant for fixed dose antihypertensive drug combinations are described in  the  following  regulatory  guidance  documents  that  have  been  taken  into  account  during  the assessment of this marketing authorization application:

2.4.  Clinical aspects 2.4.1.  Introduction The marketing authorisation application is made for the fixed combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide  (Rasitrio)  in  doses  of  150  mg/5  mg/12.5  mg,  300  mg/5 mg/12.5  mg,  300  mg/5  mg/25  mg,  300  mg/10  mg/12.5  mg,  and  300  mg/10  mg/25  mg  for  the treatment of hypertension. The original application claims the following indication: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults. Rasitrio is indicated as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a singlecomponent formulation, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. Indication granted by the CHMP: Rasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  adequately  controlled  on  the  combination  of  aliskiren, amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  given  concurrently  at  the  same  dose  level  as  in  the combination.

Guidance on the clinical development programme from the CHMP was not sought.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In the context of the assessment of the application of Rasitrio, the CHMP requested a GCP inspection of the  clinical  study  SAH2302  (pivotal  efficacy  study  for  Rasitrio  application)  to  be  performed  at  one clinical investigator site in Latvia, and in two in Canada.

The GCP inspection raised a number of issues which might have an impact on the assessment of the efficacy of Rasitrio. The most relevant are listed below:

 A large number of aberrant BP readings, which have not resulted in repeat measurements.  Failure to ensure standardised conditions during BP measurements.  Too few or too many readings were done for many patients, without any documentation to explain why and with no explanation why specific data were chosen and not others.  The interval between readings was usually 1 min or less, thus disregarding CHMP instruction.  A  substantial  amount  of  the  deviations  concerning  primary  efficacy  parameters  were  not discovered  by  the  clinical  research  associate  (CRA)  and  consequently  did  not  result  in corrective actions. Due  to  the  lack  of  focus  from  the  sponsor  on  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  including  lack  of appropriate  quality  control  (monitoring),  it  was  suspected  that  the  issues  relating  to  the  primary efficacy parameter are global in nature and other sites are likely to reveal the same kind of deviations. For  the  sake  of  completeness,  it  should  be  noted  that,  as  study  SAH2302  was  also  part  of  the application for Rasilamlo double  combination  (aliskiren/amlodipine). As concerns  the current application, the CHMP required discussion on the following issue: reliability of the method used for the measurement of the BP. It is of paramount significance due to the fact that all primary and secondary endpoints are based on or are deducted from two variables, that precise measurements of the SBP and DBP are performed. In response to the CHMP question, all inspection findings were addressed. The issues regarding the assessment of efficacy were discussed and further analysis of data were provided. The following claim was put forward by the applicant:  The presence of aberrant readings (SBP variation  10 mmHg) in the eCRF for some patients was not necessarily an indication that the protocol was not observed.  The percentages of patients with aberrant readings were uniformly distributed in all treatment groups, which indicates that if there were any effects of the aberrant readings on the efficacy data, this effect would have been equally balanced in all groups; Medicinal product no longer authorised

Additional  analyses  were  performed  by  comparing  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  vs.  patients  with  and without aberrant readings. The analysis of the change of msSDP and msDBP from baseline to end of study, showed similar results in all groups (with or without aberrant readings). On the basis of these results, it was assumed that the triple combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, in both patient  groups,  with  and  without  aberrant  values,  is  still  superior  to  the  corresponding  double combinations as previously demonstrated. The CHMP noted that data with exclusion of aberrant BP readings  were  reported  without  statistical  analysis in  subgroups  without  aberrant  readings.  Thus, further re-analysis was presented and the results stratified by the following age groups: &lt;65 years, ≥65 years-&lt;75 years and ≥75 years. Such statistical analysis of the treatment-induced BP lowering effect for all study groups after the exclusion of aberrant readings was submitted and the results of this additional analysis are discussed in section on Clinical Efficacy.

##  Tabular overview of clinical studies

The  original  clinical  development  program  supporting  the  registration  of  the  fixed  combination  of Rasitrio in the treatment of hypertension consists of a pivotal efficacy and safety Study SAH2302, a long-term  efficacy  and  safety  Study  SAH2301  and  four  supportive  studies  in  patients  whose  blood pressure was not controlled by aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide double combination Study SPP2344, Study SPP2411,  and  Study  SPP2360  and  in  patients  whose  blood  pressure  was  not  controlled  by aliskiren/amlodipine double combination Study SPA2301. All studies were multicenter with the majority

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

being multinational. Overall, the initial clinical program included a total of 3910 hypertensive patients, of  which  1155 patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  any  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination:  568 patients  received  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide  combination  for  at  least 180 days (6 months) and 182 patients received the combination for at least 360 days (1 year). Further supportive results  were  submitted  from  4  additional  clinical  trials,  Study  SPA2307,  Study  SPAUS02, Study SPADE01, and Study SPHDE01. An overview of studies, their purpose and other sources of data used are provided in the table below.

## 2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics

Rasitrio is a fixed combination  of three drug  substances  already approved  in EU, aliskiren, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. According to the relevant CHMP Guideline on clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products the following studies are needed:

-  Bioequivalence (BE) studies demonstrating BE between the free combination of the recognised reference  formulations  of  the  individual  mono-components  and  the  fixed  combination  final marketing  formulation  (FMI).  In  addition,  because  the  pivotal  clinical  study  was  performed using  the  free  combination  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  clinical  service  formulations (CSFs) (in addition to aliskiren commercial tablets), BE between these CSFs and the FMI fixed dose combination has to be demonstrated. Three Bioequivalence studies were provided initially (CSAH100A2104, CSAH100A2105, CSAH100A2102) and two additional trials were conducted on request of the CHMP (SAH100A2110, SAH100A2111).
-  Drug-drug interaction (DDI) study SAH100A2302.

In  addition,  due  to  the  recognised  food  effect  on  aliskiren,  a  food-effect  study  was  performed  to evaluate  the  impact  of  a  high  fat  meal  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  aliskiren,  amlodipine,  and hydrochlorothiazide  following  the  administration  of  the  300/10/25  mg  fixed  combination  FMI  tablet (CSAH100A2101).

Bioequivalence: BE development programme was conducted with the fixed combination tablets and the 3 individual monotherapy products in free combination to allow bridging to the existing efficacy and safety  data  generated  for  the  monotherapies  and  to  support  the  substitution  therapy  indication. In response to the CHMP request, two additional bioequivalence studies under light meal conditions to demonstrate bioequivalence between the Rasitrio 300/5/25 mg and 300/10/25 mg final market image (FMI) and the EU approved formulations of respective monotherapies (study SAH100A2110 and study SAH100A2111) were also performed. Both studies are completed and the clinical, bio-analytical, and pharmacokinetic data bases have been locked. The study reports were provided and assessed before the finalisation of the CHMP opinion. All  BE  studies  were  performed  according  to  a  single  dose,  cross-over  design. A  definitive  BE  study CSAH100A2102 demonstrated BE between the selected FMI formulation (300/5/25 mg dose strength) and  the  individual  mono-therapy  components.  The  individual  mono-components  used  in  this  study were the same as those used in the pivotal clinical study: Aliskiren tablets were from the commercial formulation  registered  in  EU,  amlodipine  capsules  were  commercially  available  Norvasc ®   tablets  in capsules  without  backfill  (Norvasc  over-encapsulated  5  mg  tablets),  and  hydrochlorothiazide  was supplied as a clinical service formulation capsule. Therefore, the definitive BE study bridged the pivotal clinical study to the FMI fixed dose combination tablets. For  the  sought  substitution  indication,  BE  should  be  demonstrated  between  the  FMI  tablet  and  the recognised reference formulations of the individual mono-components. This requirement was fulfilled for aliskiren. With regards to hydrochlorothiazide, BE was demonstrated between the FMI tablet and the CSF capsule. A separate study demonstrated BE between the hydrochlorothiazide CSF capsule and the  EU-registered  HCTZ  tablets  (Exidrex®).  However,  even  though  FMI  tablet  and  EU-registered hydrochlorothiazide tablets are both bioequivalent to the hydrochlorothiazide CSF capsule, this does not  imply  that  the  FMI  tablet  is  bioequivalent  to  the  EU-registered  hydrochlorothiazide  tablet.  With regards to amlodipine, BE was demonstrated between the FMI tablet and amlodipine capsules, which were over-encapsulated Norvasc ®  tablets in capsules without backfill. In order to support BE between Norvasc ®  tablets and over-encapsulated Norvasc tablets, in vitro dissolution data showing similarity in drug release were submitted. However, the data are insufficient to demonstrate BE between the FMI tablet and the EU reference amlodipine formulation (Norvasc ®  tablet). Additional investigations on the BE  between  the  FDC  300/5/25  mg  FMI  tablet  and  the  free  combination  of  the  mono-components showed  adequate  bridging  between  the  main  clinical  studies  and  the  FMI  formulation,  but  not  for demonstrating BE between the FMI tablet and the free combination of the EU recognised reference formulations of the individual mono-components. Furthermore, BE was demonstrated for amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. For aliskiren, however, BE was demonstrated in terms of AUC, but the lower boundary  of  the  90%  CI  for  C max   ratio  was  slightly  lower  than  0.80  (90%  CI:  0.76-0.90).  it  was claimed that the failure in demonstrating BE for C max  should not be clinically relevant. It is noted that, aliskiren  is  a  highly  variable  drug  (with  regards  to  C max ),  as  defined  by  the  new  BE  guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). If an intra-subject CV% of about 50% is applied, the 90% CI for C max  ratio would be within the widened acceptance interval, as calculated following the new BE guideline.  However,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  according  to  the  current  guidelines  a  widened acceptance interval should be prospectively defined, and a post hoc justification cannot be accepted. Therefore,  the  proof  of  BE  between  the  FMI  and  the  recognised  reference  formulations  of  the monocomponents  was  not  sufficient  and  the  CHMP  considered  this  to  be  a  major  objection  during evaluation process.

In BE studies, drug products were administered under fasting conditions, whereas the proposed SmPC recommends that Rasitrio should be taken with a light meal, in agreement with similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

recommendations for Rasilez (aliskiren) and Rasilez HCT. On one hand, it must be considered that BE studies  conducted  under  fasted  condition  are  more  sensitive  in  detecting  differences  between  drug products and therefore consist of the 'worst case' to test bioequivalence. In addition, available data suggest that for aliskiren the food effect is mainly intrinsic to its physicochemical properties. On the other hand, comparison of all available food effect data show that AUC reduction range from -60% to 80%,  which  suggests  that  the  food  effect  may  also  be  partially  dependent  on  the  formulation. Therefore, this issue was raised as a major objection by the CHMP.

In  response  to  the  objections  raised,  two  new  BE  studies  (SAH100A2110  and  SAH100A2111)  were conducted.

Study  CSAH100A2110 investigated  the  BE  between  the  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 300/10/25  FMI  tablets  and  the  free  combination  of  the  reference  products:  Rasilez®  300  mg, Norvasc® 10 mg, Esidrex® 25 mg. A total of 124 healthy male/female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age were enrolled and randomized to one of the two treatments, 111 subjects completed both treatments in three periods of the study.

Study  CSAH100A2111 investigated  the  BE  between  the  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 300/5/25 FMI tablets and the free combination of the reference products: Rasilez® 300 mg, Norvasc® 5 mg, Esidrex® 25 mg. A total of 124 healthy male/female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age were enrolled and randomized, 110 subjects completed both treatment in three periods of the study. These studies were performed under light meal conditions. A widened acceptance interval for C max  ratio was  prospectively defined in the study protocols, and  the replicate study design allowed a determination of the within-subject CV% for C max . Therefore, objections related to previous BE issues are considered resolved. Food effect : A food-effect study evaluating the impact of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide following the administration of the 300/10/25 mg fixed combination FMI tablet was conducted. The intake of food did not influence absorption of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide but reduced aliskiren AUC and C max  by 79% and 89%, respectively, as compared to fasted conditions. This study further confirms the marked decrease in aliskiren bioavailability elicited by food. The mean decrease found in the present study (AUC: -79%) is similar to that found with the aliskiren/amlodipine fixed-dose combination (-80%) but higher than that found with aliskiren alone or aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (AUC reduction -60 to -70%). This suggests that the food effect may also be dependent on formulation. Biowaiver: The  biowaiver  requested  for  3  dose  strengths  (150/5/12.5  mg,  300/10/12.5  mg  and 300/5/12.5 mg) was based on: 1) Pharmacokinetic linearity of the three active substances in the clinical dose range; 2) The same manufacturing process as that of the 300/10/25 mg or 300/5/25 mg FMI tablets used in the BE studies; 3) Compositional similarity or proportionality in active and inactive ingredients with the dose strengths used in the BE studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dissolution data showing similarity in the in vitro dissolution profiles support the biowaiver request and the approach is acceptable because the criteria for biowaiver of the BE guideline are satisfied. Yet the dissolution data demonstrate similarity with the FMI formulations used in the BE studies, which were initially  not  demonstrated  to  be  bioequivalent  to  the  EU  reference  formulations  of  the  monocomponents, as discussed above. It should also be noted that calculation of similarity factor f2 was in several cases not in agreement with the BE guideline requirement that there should be no more than one  mean  value  of  &gt;  85%  dissolved  for  each  formulation  was  often  not  fulfilled.  With  the  use  of several buffers, one or more active substances dissolved more than 85% already at the second timepoint (20 min). Therefore, it is concluded that these dissolution data do not support the application and the CHMP requested the submission of appropriate dissolution testing by including more time points to ensure  that  at  least  three  time  points  are  used  in  the  f2  similarity  calculation.  The  newly  provided dissolution data fulfilled the guideline requirements for a biowaiver request. Yet, the batches used in the repeated dissolution testing are the same as the ones used in the earlier testing. Following further request of the CHMP, additional dissolution testing was performed with the bio-batches used in the new bioequivalence trials SAH100A2110 and SAH100A2111. Dissolution similarity was demonstrated and granting of biowaiver is agreed.

Drug-drug  interactions: Investigations  on  the  interactions  between  aliskiren  and  amlodipine,  or aliskiren  and  hydrochlorothiazide,  were  conducted  as  part  of  the  development  programme.  It  was found that amlodipine increased aliskiren AUC at steady-state by 29% and aliskiren did not change amlodipine pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, hydrochlorothiazide slightly reduced aliskiren C max  by 22%, with no effect on aliskiren AUC. Aliskiren slightly reduced both hydrochlorothiazide C max  (-26%) and AUC (-10%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  drug-drug  interactions  were  evaluated  in  a  sub-population  of  patients  of  the  pivotal efficacy and safety study CSAH100A2302, using both, non-compartmental methods and a population pharmacokinetics approach. This was a parallel group study and samples were collected after 6 weeks of treatment  from  all treatment  cohorts (aliskiren  300  mg/amlodipine  10  mg;  aliskiren  300 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg; amlodipine 10 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg; aliskiren 300 mg/amlodipine  10  mg/hydrochlorothiazide  25  mg)  from  0  (pre-dose)  to  12  hours.  A  total  of  77 patients  participated  in  the  pharmacokinetic  substudy,  with  17  patients  in  aliskiren/amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide  combination,  19  patients  in  the  amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide,  18  patients  in aliskiren/amlodipine,  and  23  patients  in  aliskiren/ hydrochlorothiazide  dual  combination  treatment arms.  The  comparative  demographic  and  clinical  data  between  all  patients  in  the  study  and  the pharmacokinetic  substudy  population  show  that  the  pharmacokinetic  subpopulation  is  reasonably representative of the whole trial population. For non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, basic pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated; comparison of the mean C max  values and AUC (tau) , at a steady state, for each of the individual drug were calculated. Lack of clinically significant drug-drug interaction due to the addition of the third drug was claimed based on the comparison of the geometric mean ratio and 90% CI for AUC (tau)  and C max values of individual drug from the triple and double combinations. The  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  used  mixed  effects  modelling  and  was  performed  using NONMEM. A single  pharmacokinetic  model  was  built  for  each  of  the  three  compounds,  with  model parameters used to capture differences between the four treatment cohorts. During model development, a number of different  diagnostic tools  were  applied  at  each  modelling  step.  The  final three models were qualified with residual diagnostics, predictive checks and bootstrapping. Drug-drug interactions were assessed via comparison of the population C max  values and AUC 0-24  at six weeks for each of the individual drugs. Lack of significant drug-drug interaction due to the addition of the third drug was claimed based on the comparison of the population geometric mean ratio and its 90% CI for AUC0-24  and C max  values of individual drugs from the triple and double combinations. Both, the noncompartmental  and  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  gave  similar  results,  showing  that  in patients  no  clinically  significant  interaction  occurred.  Patients  of  the  triple  therapy  group  tended  to have lower levels of all drugs, but it was convincingly demonstrated that this trend is not related to lower compliance and is not considered clinically relevant. Nevertheless, as described earlier, healthy subjects showed that amlodipine may increase the exposure to  aliskiren.  Aliskiren  related  data  showed  that  exposure  is  50%  higher  in  elderly  subjects,  as compared  to  young  subjects  and  thus,  the  CHMP  requested  data  on  systemic  exposure  to  the  3 components  in  the  elderly.  It  was  clarified  that  the  pharmacokinetic  subpopulation  only  included  1 patient  aged  &gt;65  years  treated  with  the  triple  therapy  and  1  patient  &gt;  65  years  treated  with aliskiren/amlodipine.  Therefore,  valuable  data  of  systemic  exposure  in  the  elderly  could  not  be provided at this stage the claim of a substantial similarity in the safety profile of the triple and dual combinations is not supported by the CHMP. The lack of data of pharmacokinetic data for Rasitrio in the elderly and the increased risk of AEs potentially related to hypotension for the triple combination should is therefore reported in section 5.2. of the SmPC. Absorption, Distribution and Elimination Medicinal product no longer authorised

Aliskiren: In fasting studies, following oral administration, aliskiren is rapidly absorbed with a T max  of 13 hours. The absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2.6% and its oral bioavailability was greater  following  administration  of  capsules  than  oral  solution  (1.9  ±  0.7%).  The  absorption  of aliskiren shows high variability. Typically, coefficients of variation for the plasma aliskiren AUC are in a range of 40-60% after an oral dose.  The exposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the  increase  in  dose.  After  single  dose  administration  in  the  dose  range  of  75  to  600  mg,  a  2-fold increase  in  dose  results  in  a  ~2.3  and  2.6-fold  increase  in  AUC  and  C max ,  respectively.  The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren is  linear  over the  therapeutic  dose  range  of  150-300  mg. At  a  steady state, the non-linearity may be more pronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have  not  been  identified.  Administration  of  aliskiren  FMI  tablets  with  a  high  fat  meal  resulted in  a decrease in C max  and AUC of aliskiren by 85% and 71%, respectively. This issue is addressed in other chapters of this report. Aliskiren is moderately bound to human plasma protein (47-51%). The total plasma clearance (CL) is 9 L/h and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is 135 L indicating  substantial  distribution  into  the  extra-vascular  space. In  vitro studies  have  demonstrated that aliskiren does not inhibit any of the CYP450 enzymes at therapeutic concentrations (IC50 &gt; 200 μM). Following a p.o. administration of 300 mg [14C]-aliskiren, 91.5% of the radioactivity is recovered within 7 days. The majority of the radioactive dose (91%) is eliminated in the feces as unchanged drug (mostly unabsorbed) and 0.6% of the radio-labelled dose is eliminated in the urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Amlodipine is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability is between 52% and 88%. Plasma concentrations of amlodipine rise gradually to peak 6-9 hr after oral administration. Changes in the dissolution rate do not influence the bioavailability of amlodipine. This was evidenced by the lack of a difference in the bioavailability of amlodipine when administered as suspension  or  immediate  release  tablet  and  as  solution  or  immediate  release  capsule.  Amlodipine exhibits  linear  pharmacokinetics  in  dose  range  of  5-10  mg. Oral  absorption  of  amlodipine  is  not influenced by the presence of food. In healthy volunteers, amlodipine has a high volume of distribution of  21  L/Kg, which could  be due to high membrane affinity of amlodipine. Amlodipine is extensively (about  90%)  converted  to  inactive  metabolites  via  hepatic metabolism  with  10%  of  the  parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. After a single intravenous or oral dose, the elimination half-life of amlodipine was approximately 40 hours.

Hydrochlorothiazide  is  rapidly  absorbed  after  p.o.  administration  (T max   about  2  hours).  Absolute bioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 60-80% after p.o. administration, with greater than 95% of the absorbed dose excreted in the urine. There is no change in the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is minimal when dosed once-daily to healthy subjects. Concomitant administration with food has been reported to both increase and decrease the systemic availability  of  the  drug  compared  with  the  fasted  state.  The  magnitude  of  these  effects  is small and not clinically important. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum proteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. After an i.v. [ 14 C]-labeled dose of hydrochlorothiazide to two subjects, 90-93% of the dose was recovered in the urine and 1-4% in the feces. The majority of the dose was recovered in the  first  12  hours  after  dosing.  After  a  p.o.  administration,  about  95%  of  the  absorbed  dose  is excreted as unchanged hydrochlorothiazide, and about 4% as the hydrolysate, 2-amino-4-chlorombenzenedisulfonamide. The distribution and elimination kinetics have generally been described by a biexponential decay function, with an apparent terminal elimination T 1/2  of 6-15 hours. Dose proportionality and time dependencies No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. Special populations No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies The potential for drug interaction aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated in study CSAH100A2302 and this is described in sections above. No additional pharmacokinetic studies with the fixed combination formulation were conducted. Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. Pharmacodynamics Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  specific  pharmacodynamic  studies  investigating  mechanism  of  action  or  primary  and  secondary pharmacological properties of the aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination were performed. The pharmacodynamic properties of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are well characterised and relevant information is reflected in their SmPCs. Furthermore, due to the differences in the mechanism of action of these drugs, pharmacodynamic interaction of aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide is unlikely.

## 2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The submitted clinical pharmacology studies focused on the evaluation of bioequivalence, drug-drug interactions and the food-effect.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioequivalence studies aimed to bridge FMI Rasitrio tablet with the free combination of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide clinical service formulations (CSFs) used in the pivotal clinical study along with the aliskiren  commercial  tablets.  Furthermore,  the  studies  aimed  to  demonstrate  BE  between  the  free combination of the recognised reference formulations of the individual mono-components and the fixed combination marketing formulation, which was only fulfilled for aliskiren. For hydrochlorothiazide, BE was demonstrated between the FMI tablet and the CSF capsule. A separate study demonstrated BE between the hydrochlorothiazide CSF capsule and the EU-registered tablets (Exidrex ® ). However, these data were insufficient for demonstration of BE between FMI tablet and the EU-registered hydrochlorothiazide.  For  amlodipine,  BE  was  demonstrated  between  the  FMI  tablet  and  amlodipine capsules,  which  were  over-encapsulated  Norvasc ®   tablets  in  capsules  without  backfill.  In  order  to support BE between Norvasc® tablets and over-encapsulated Norvasc tablets, in vitro dissolution data showing similarity in drug release were provided but were insufficient to demonstrate BE between the FMI tablet and the EU reference amlodipine formulation (Norvasc® tablet). In order to resolve these BE issues, two additional studies SAH100A2110 and SAH100A2111 were performed under light meal conditions  in  order  to  investigate  BE  with  the  EU  reference  hydrochlorothiazide  and  amlodipine formulations.  Widened  acceptance  interval  for  C max   ratio  was  prospectively  defined.  The  concerns regarding BE were therefore solved.

Rasitrio  is  a  fixed  combination  of  aliskiren,  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide,  which  are  already approved  in  the  EU.  Their  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  profiles  have  been  adequately characterised  during  the  drug  development  of  each  substance.  Several  issues  were  identified specifically  during  Rasitrio  development. These  concerned  the  demonstration  of  bioequivalence between free combination of the recognised reference formulations of the individual mono-components and the fixed combination marketing formulation, conduct of clinical testing under fasting conditions and  not  with  a  light  meal  as  recommended in  the  Rasitrio  SmPC,  and  adequacy  of  submitted dissolution  data  in  support  of  the  biowaiver  approached  for  three  dose  strengths,  150/5/12.5  mg, 300/10/12.5 mg, and 300/5/12.5 mg.

The  BE  studies  were  conducted  under  fasting  conditions,  whereas  the  proposed  SmPC  recommends Rasitrio  to  be  taken  with  light  meal.  While  it  must  be  considered  that  BE  studies  conducted  under fasted  condition  are  more  sensitive  in  detecting  differences  between  products  and,  in  addition, available  data  suggest  that  for  aliskiren  the  food  effect  is  mainly  intrinsic  to  its  physicochemical properties, comparison of all available food effect data show that AUC reduction range from -60% to 80%, which suggests that the food effect may also be partially dependent on drug formulation. The request for biowaiver for 3 dose strengths (150/5/12.5 mg, 300/10/12.5 mg and 300/5/12.5 mg) was supported by dissolution data showing similarity in the in vitro dissolution profiles. Although the presented approach is acceptable, the dissolution data demonstrate similarity with the FMI formulations  used  in  the  BE  studies,  which  were  not  demonstrated  to  be  bioequivalent  to  the  EU reference formulations of the mono-components.  Therefore,  dissolution testing was  repeated; especially  with  the  biobatches  used  in  the  two  newly  submitted  bioequivalence  studies  and  the biowaver concept was acceptable. Drug-drug interactions were evaluated in a sub-population of patients of the pivotal efficacy and safety study CSAH100A2302 and based on its results, no clinically significant interactions occur between the three mono-components. The demographic and clinical data demonstrated that the sub-population of the  study  is  representative  of  the  whole  population  of  study  CSAH100A2302.  It  is,  however, acknowledged  that  in  healthy  subjects  amlodipine  may  increase  the  exposure  to  aliskiren,  and  the aliskiren data showed that exposure is 50% higher in elderly subjects, as compared to young subjects. drug interaction should also be evaluated in elderly subjects. The lack of data of pharmacokinetic data for Rasitrio in the elderly and the increased risk of adverse events potentially related to hypotension for the triple combination is therefore reported in the SmPC. 2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Medicinal product no longer authorised

BE was correctly demonstrated between the FMI FDC formulation and the free combination of the EU reference  products,  under  both  fasting  and  fed  (light  meal)  conditions.  The  biowaiver  approach  for three dose strengths is acceptable. The comparative dissolution data fulfil the guideline requirements for biowaiver. With respect to the examination of potential drug-drug interactions, the results of the pharmacokinetic sub-study of the clinical trial CSAH100A2302 indicated the lack of clinically significant interactions.  Nevertheless, it  is  known  that  amlodipine  may  increase  exposure  to  aliskiren,  and  the aliskiren data showed that exposure is 50% higher in elderly subjects, as compared to young subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  are  no  adequate  pharmacokinetic  data  available  for  the  elderly  and  thus,  the  lack  of this information is captured in Rasitrio SmPC.

## 2.5.  Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies)

Rasitrio clinical programme includes two pivotal studies (one short-term and one long-term) and no dose-response study. Doses of the 3 components in the combination are approved for marketing on the basis of experiences from earlier clinical studies and development programmes. The selection of doses for Rasitrio was based on current marketed and most commonly used doses of the individual components  for  the  treatment  of  hypertension.  The  proposed  range  of  Rasitrio  doses  is  based  on approved  doses  of  the  monotherapies,  on  the  known  dose  dependent  adverse  reaction  profile  of amlodipine in the dose range 5-10 mg (e.g. oedema) and hydrochlorothiazide in the dose range 12.525  mg  (e.g.  hypokalaemia)  and  the  relative  absence  of  dose-dependent  adverse  reactions  with aliskiren in the range 150-300 mg. Considering that the indication is requested for substitution therapy, the lack of complete data about efficacy and safety of lower doses of one or two components of the triple combination does not constitute an issue.

Study SAH 2302 is considered pivotal for the applied indication and will be described in details in the following  sections.  Data  from  other  clinical  trials  are  presented  appropriately  in  the  discussion  on certain clinical aspects.

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) In  support of the marketing authorisation application for Rasitrio, the following main clinical studies have been presented: Main studies: Study SAH 2302: Pivotal, 8 week double-blind active controlled study, to prove the superiority of the triple  combination  to  double  combination  of  aliskiren/amlodipine,  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide  in  lowering  blood  pressure  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe hypertension. Study SAH 2301: Long-term efficacy  safety  study  with  28  week  treatment periods  with  the  highest dose of the triple aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination. Supportive studies: Study SPP 2344: double-blind active controlled 36 week study; the hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine were administered 'on demand'. Study SPP 2411: double-blind 8 week, active controlled dose escalation study. The use of amlodipine was 'optional'. Study  SPP  2360: open  label  24  week  non  comparative  study.  The  use  of  hydrochlorothiazide  and amlodipine was 'optional'. Study SPA 2301: open-label 54 week study. The use of hydrochlorothiazide was 'optional'. During  the  course  of  evaluation  of  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Rasitrio,  results  of further supportive clinical studies were provided; mainly in response to the objections and concerns raised by the CHMP. These are described in the appropriate sections of this report. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Summary of studies with the use of the aliskiren/amlodipine/HcTz combination in patients whose BP was not controlled by double combination therapy (Studies SPP2344, SPP2411, SPP2360,and SPA2301)

<!-- image -->

## Methods

## Study Participants

Patients enrolled in the study SAH 2302 were 18 years or older, male or female, with either a diagnosis of moderate to severe hypertension (msSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg, and/or msDBP ≥ 100 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg) at Visits 4, 5 or 6 (Qualifying BP visit), OR msSBP ≥ 180 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg with msDBP ≥ 95 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg, or msDBP ≥ 110 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg with msSBP ≥ 150 mmHg and &lt; 200 mmHg after at least one week of treatment with placebo (Visit 3 and on).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main exclusion criteria were: Patients with an msSBP ≥ 200 mmHg or msDBP ≥ 120 mmHg at any time during the placebo run-in period were to be discontinued from the study, patients on four or more antihypertensive drugs at Visit 1, patients with previous or current diagnosis of hear failure, MI, heart block, atrial fibrillation, evidence of hepatic or severe renal impairment, history of TIA, cerebrovascular accident.

## Treatments

The following drugs were provided in blisters that were identical in appearance:

Aliskiren 150 mg (aliskiren 150 mg) tablet, Aliskiren 300 mg (aliskiren 300 mg) tablet; Amlodipine 5 mg capsule, Amlodipine 10 mg capsule; Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg capsule.  Control drugs: placebos to Aliskiren 150 mg (aliskiren 150 mg) tablet, Aliskiren 300 mg (aliskiren 300 mg) tablet, Amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg capsule, Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and 25 mg capsule. Patients were instructed to take two capsules and two tablets by mouth, with water each day in the morning at approximately 8am.  A total of four pills were taken daily.

The study SAH 2302 comprised three periods. Period 1 (Washout): maximum 4 wk, only for patients who were on antihypertensive medications, not requested for newly diagnosed patients who were enrolled directly into the 1 to 4 week single-blind placebo run-in period. Period 2 (Single-blind placebo run-in): 1-4 week single-blind placebo run-in period to establish baseline BP and eligibility, weekly visits until BP requirements well fulfilled. If after a total of 4 weeks of singleblind placebo run-in treatment the patient did not meet the randomization criteria, the patient was to be discontinued from the trial and was not randomized. Period 3 (Double-blind therapy): At Visit 6 (Day 1), patients were randomized in a double blind fashion to one of four treatment groups: aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg, aliskiren 150 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, aliskiren  150  mg/ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for 3 days, then aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg/ hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. Patients remained on these doses for 4 weeks, and then were force titrated upward to the following doses for another 4 weeks: aliskiren 300 mg/amlodipine 10 mg aliskiren 300 mg/ hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg amlodipine 10 mg/ hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg aliskiren 300 mg/amlodipine 10 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg A  subgroup  of  patients  participated  in  the  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring  (ABPM)  substudy. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected on week 6 (Visit 11) of the study in a subgroup of patients. Objectives The primary objective of the study SAH 2302 was to demonstrate that a once daily dosing regimen of the triple combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide is superior to the double combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in  lowering  mean  sitting  systolic  blood pressure  (msSBP)  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe hypertension. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Secondary objectives included evaluation of the blood pressure control rates (msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg) of  the  triple  combination  in  comparison  to  the  three  double  combinations  in  patients  with moderate to severe hypertension; evaluate the DBP responder rates (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg and/or ≥ 10 mmHg  reduction  from baseline)  of  the  triple  combination  in  comparison  to  the  three  double combinations in patients with moderate to severe hypertension; evaluation of the SBP responder rates (msSBP  &lt;  140  mmHg  and/or  ≥  20  mmHg  reduction  from baseline)  of  the  triple  combination  in comparison to the three double combinations in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, and other parameters. The CHMP considered the objectives of the study as adequately defined.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy variable: change from baseline (Visit 6) in msSBP.

Secondary  efficacy  variables: Change  from  baseline  (Visit  6)  in  msDBP,  percentage  of  patients achieving  the  BP  control  (msDBP  &lt;  90  mmHg  and  msSBP  &lt;  140  mmHg),  percentage  of  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

achieving the SBP response (msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg or at least 20 mmHg reduction from baseline in msSBP), percentage of patients achieving the DBP response (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or at least 10 mmHg reduction  from  baseline  in  msDBP),  change  from  baseline  in  24-hour  ABPM  (diastolic  and  systolic), change from baseline in daytime and nighttime ABPM (diastolic and systolic), biomarkers related to hypertension-related cardiac or renal risk were evaluated in this study, including, PRA and PRC.

## Sample size

Approximately 2400 patients were planned to be screened worldwide to randomize approximately 1160 patients (290 randomized patients per treatment group).  A sample size of 984 completed patients was targeted (246 per treatment arm).  Assuming a drop-out rate of 15%, 1160 patients were planned to be  randomized.    The  sample  size  was  calculated  for  the  primary  variable,  change  from  baseline  in msSBP,  assuming  a  standard  deviation  of  15  mmHg.  The  objective  was  to  show  that  the  triple combination  was  statistically  superior  to  all  three  corresponding  double  combination  treatments.  To achieve this objective with an overall power of 90%, the sample size was calculated to simultaneously detect  a  treatment  difference  of  at  least  5  mmHg  for  all  three  corresponding  pair  wise  treatment comparisons, at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Since it was necessary to show that the triple combination  was  statistically  superior  to  all  three  double  combination  treatments,  no  multiplecomparisons adjustment of the type 1 error was needed.

To assess the primary objective for the superiority of the triple combination of Rasitrio compared to the three  double  combinations  in  lowering  msSBP,  the primary  variable  at  Week  8  endpoint  (last  postbaseline measurement prior to or on Week 8) was analysed using the ANCOVA model with treatment and region as two factors, and baseline as a covariate. The primary variable was also analysed at Week 8 for the Per-protocol population. Secondary efficacy analysis: the same analysis for msSBP was also performed  for msDBP.  The  blood  pressure  control  rates  and  responder  rates  were  analysed  using logistic regression models. For the low-dose combination treatments, all the analyses done at Week 8 endpoint were performed at Week 4 endpoint for the FAS population. Week 4 endpoint measurement was last post baseline measurement prior to or at Week 4. For patients who discontinued the study prematurely, the LOCF (last observation carried forward) approach was used to obtain their endpoint values for efficacy analyses.

For the critical secondary variables, a sample size of 592 completed patients (148 per arm) was needed to detect a 5 mmHg difference in the change from baseline in MASBP (mean 24-hour systolic ABP) with 80% power. This calculation was based on a standard deviation of 13mmHg. Assuming a drop-out rate of 15%, a total of at least 700 patients (175 per arm) was necessary. Randomisation At Visit 6, all eligible patients were given a randomization number that assigned them to one of the treatment arms. The interactive voice response system (IVRS) was used to assign treatment following confirmation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the given patient. Blinding (masking) Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock, using the following methods: (1) randomisation data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and were only accessible to authorized personnel, (2) the identity of the treatments was concealed by the use of study  drugs  that  appeared  identical  in  packaging,  labeling,  and  schedule  of  administration,  (3)  the appearance, weight, and odor of each study drug and its matching placebo was identical. Unblinding only occurred in case of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of the study SAH 2302. Statistical methods Medicinal product no longer authorised

## From medical history snd prior medication.

The CHMP noted that a total of 228 elderly patients (&gt;65 years), 20% of randomised hypertensive subjects, were included in the study SAH 2302. Most of them (186 patients) were aged between 65 and  74  years  (40-55  patients/arm).  A  total  of  42  patients  were  randomised  with  age ≥ 75  (&lt;14 patients/arm).  Assuming a per-protocol set of 80%, there are complete data in 32-40 patients/arm in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the age group 65-74 years and less than 11 patients/arm in the age group ≥ 75 years. The number of elderly subjects is too small to allow for any general claim in the elderly group.

## Numbers analysed

In  study  SAH100A2302  approximately  2400  male  and  female  patients,  with  moderate  to  severe hypertension (msSBP of ≥160 mmHg and &lt;200 mmHg, and/or msDBP ≥100 mmHg and &lt;120 mmHg) were  planned  to  be  screened  worldwide  in  order  to  randomize  approximately  1160  patients  (290 randomized patients per treatment group). Overall, 287 patients were randomized to aliskiren/amlodipine, 298 to aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide, 296 to amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, and 310 to aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide.

After 8 week treatment (high dose): The differences in observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction at the study end are summarised in the following tables.  The smallest difference was  found  in  the  comparison  of  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide  to  aliskiren/amlodipine (msSBP/DBP = 6.6/2.6, addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg to aliskiren/amlodipine), the largest difference was found in the comparison of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide to aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (msSBP/DBP = 9.9/6.3, addition of amlodipine 10mg to aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide).

The observed blood pressure reduction was higher with the triple combination than with the double combinations after first 4-week treatment with the low-dose combinations (msSBP/msDBP = 31/16 vs 22-25/11-14) and after further 4-week treatment with the high-dose combinations (msSBP/msDBP = 38/21 vs 28-31/14-18). At both time points, the difference in the blood pressure reduction between  triple combination and double combinations tended to be small  when aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide was compared to aliskiren/amlodipine. Analyses of 95%CIs indicate that, for msDBP, this difference was significant. When the percentage of patients with BP control (msSBP &lt;140 mmHg and msDBP&lt;90 mmHg) was analysed by a logistic-regression model, 62.3%  of  patients  achieved  BP  control  in  the  triple  combination  group  at  week  8  and  this  was statistically greater than each of the respective dual-combination groups as summarised in the table below.

Analyses by age groups indicated that the reduction in msSBP and msDBP for age categories of &lt;65, &gt; 65 and &gt; 75 were greater for the triple  combination  group  compared  to the  respective  dualcombination groups. In addition, a higher percentage of patients aged &lt;65 years and &gt; 65 years, at week 8 achieved BP control with the triple combination than with the respective dual-combination therapies, indicating that aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination was effective irrespective of age.

Following  the  outcome  of  the  GCP  inspection  requested  by  the  CHMP,  which  identified  a  high number  of  aberrant  BP  readings  that  were  not  repeated,  the  CHMP  asked  for  the  conduct  of statistical analyses excluding patients with aberrant readings in the overall study population as well as  in  patients  aged  &gt;65  years  and  &gt;75.    Least  squares  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  msSBP (primary  variable)  and  msDBP,  confidence  intervals,  and  p-values  from  an  ANCOVA  model (containing treatment and region as factors and baseline as a covariate) are presented in the table below.

These 3 patients were excluded from the analysis and post text tables. Despite the reduction in sample size due to the exclusion of patients with aberrant readings, the triple combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide achieved the primary objective of the study, demonstrating clinically meaningful and statistically significant greater reductions in msSBP compared with each dual combination therapy group at study endpoint. The superiority of the triple combination over each double combination was also demonstrated in msDBP. Importantly, the magnitude of the blood  pressure  reductions  in  these  repeat  analyses  excluding  patients  without  aberrant  readings  is comparable to the one seen in the overall population supporting that the exclusion of these patients does not affect the validity of the study conclusions.

| Design                    | This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, active-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ in patients with moderate to severe hypertension (msSBP ≥ 160 and < 200 mmHg, and/or msDBP ≥ 100 mmHg and < 120 mmHg) at the qualifying BP visit). In addition, at the visit immediately prior to the qualifying visit, patients were also to have msSBP ≥ 145 mmHg and < 200 mmHg and msDBP ≥ 95 mmHg and < 120 mmHg). Alternatively, patients could be randomized if msSBP ≥ 180 mmHg and < 200 mmHg with msDBP ≥ 95 mmHg and < 120 mmHg, or msDBP ≥110 mmHg and < 120 mmHg with msSBP ≥ 150 mmHg and < 200 mmHg after at least one week of treatment with placebo. The study comprised a washout, a single-blind placebo run-in and a double-blind treatment phase. During the first four weeks of double-blind treatment, patients received low doses of either triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ or double combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/HCTZ, and amlodipine/HCTZ. Patients were forced uptitrated to higher doses after 4 weeks for additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. authorised | This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, active-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ in patients with moderate to severe hypertension (msSBP ≥ 160 and < 200 mmHg, and/or msDBP ≥ 100 mmHg and < 120 mmHg) at the qualifying BP visit).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) Pooled analysis of clinical data was performed to evaluate the efficacy of aliskiren on blood pressure by gender based on placebo-controlled studies of aliskiren (8 weeks duration). The below table presents the aliskiren results for msDBP and msSBP change from baseline with and without placebo-subtracted values for males and females. Change from baseline to endpoint in msDBP and msSBP by gender with aliskiren - pooled placebo controlled studies (ITT population) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Females had a slightly greater placebo response than males for reductions in SBP and DBP for both, the responder rate and the control rate. When the placebo-subtracted responses were compared, they were similar for both genders. There is no evidence of a gender difference in response to aliskiren.

In an effort to more precisely prospectively identify patients that would most benefit from the triple combination, additional analyses were performed. One dataset consisted of studies that permitted the optional  addition  of  hydrochlorothiazide  to  patients  not  achieving  blood  pressure  control  with  the double combination aliskiren/amlodipine. The second dataset consisted of studies that permitted the

optional  addition  of  amlodipine  to  patients  not  achieving  blood  pressure  control  with  the  double combination  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide.  The  population  characteristics  of  the  patients  that  were adequately treated with a double combination or that required the triple combination were generally similar and representative of the enrolled hypertension population. Patients with higher baseline blood pressures and diabetic patients were more likely to require triple therapy. Other baseline characteristics male gender, black ethnicity, overweight and overweight-associated disorders (metabolic  syndrome  and  diabetes)  were  weak  predictors  of  the  need  of  the  triple  combination  for adequate hypertension control.

No studies in special populations relevant to the triple combination have been included.

## Supportive studies

Study SAH100A2301: This is a long-term uncontrolled clinical study pertinent to the claimed indication. A 28 to 54-week, open-label, multicenter study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with essential hypertension. Efficacy was the secondary objective of the study and the key efficacy variables included msSBP/msDBP reduction from baseline,  BP  control  and  response  rate:  %  of  patients  achieving  the target of &lt; 140/90 mmHg, and achieving a response in msDBP (msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease from baseline) and msSBP (msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg or a ≥ 20 mmHg decrease from baseline). The  study  was  comprised  of  two  periods:  washout  and  treatment  period. A  total  of  635  patients entered the washout phase, but 71 patients (11.2%) discontinued due to abnormal test or not fulfilling the  BP  criteria.  A  total  of  493  patients  (87.4%)  completed  the  study;  the  main  reason  for discontinuation was an adverse event. It was noted that only 206 patients completed both periods of the study (2x6 months) and they received only the high dose combination (aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 300/10/25 mg), which is acceptable only for screening of the most serious AEs. In general, based on the results of this study, the safety profile of the combination appears to be consistent with that observed in previous short term studies. The majority of reported AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Study  SPP100A2411 : An  8-week  randomised,  double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, activecontrolled  dose  escalation  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aliskiren  HCTZ  (300/25  mg) compared to HCTZ (25 mg) in older patients with stage 2 systolic hypertension. Results of this study are not relevant for the claimed indication for the triple combination because only 29 patients received aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ triple combination treatment. Such a small number do not  allow  any  conclusion  on  the  BP  lowering  effect  of  the  triple  combination.  Results  of  the  study duplicate  the  previous  evidence  that  HCTZ  and  aliskiren,  when  combined  in  a  FDC  independently contribute in lowering BP levels. This evidence was adequately showed in the studies included in the dossier of Rasilez HCT FDC as stated by the Applicant in the Introduction of the two pivotal studies.

Study  SPP100A2344 : A  36-week  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group,  multicenter,  activecontrolled,  optional  titration  study  comparing  an  aliskiren-based  regimen  (150  mg-300  mg)    to  a ramipril-based regimen (5 - 10 mg) in patients &gt; 65 years old with systolic essential hypertension. Initially, aliskiren or ramipril was administered at day 1. In patients with uncontrolled blood pressure, the study protocol included the administration of hydrochlorothiazide as a second optional drug at visit 7 and of amlodipine also as a third optional drug at visit 9. This study is of limited relevance for the triple combination. The subgroup treated for at least 24 weeks with the triple combination accounted for  7% of the enrolled cohort; the number of patients treated for at least 24 weeks with the triple combination (n=31) is far below the minimum threshold requested by CHMP guidelines for long-term studies on safety.

Study SPA2301: This was a 54-week, open-label, multicenter study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability  of  the  combination  of  aliskiren  300mg/amlodipine  10mg  in  patients  with  essential hypertension.  Results  of  this  study  are  not  essential  for  the  claimed  indication;  its  design  includes administration of hydrochlorothiazide as a third optional drug only in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure  and  only  after  72  days  of  treatment  with  aliskiren/amlodipine.  The  results  are  certainly affected  by  a  substantial  selection  bias  because  the  subgroup  treated  with  hydrochlorothiazide accounted for 15.5% of the enrolled cohort.  Moreover, the total number of patients completing the study was 81 at 6-month end-point and 74 at 12-month end-point and these numbers are far below the minimum required threshold.

Study SPP2360: This  was  a  24-week,  open-label, non-comparative,  multicenter  study  to  assess  the efficacy  and  tolerability  of  an  aliskiren-based  treatment  (150mg  -  300mg)  in  patients  with  mild  to moderate  hypertension.  First  step  of  treatment  was  the  administration  of  aliskiren  at  day  1.    In patients with uncontrolled blood pressure, the study protocol included the administration of hydrochlorothiazide as a second optional drug at visit 5 and of amlodipine also as a third optional drug at visit 7. The study is of limited relevance as the subgroup treated with the triple combination, for at least 8 weeks, accounted for only 24% of the enrolled population (62/256), and 0% of the enrolled population was treated with the triple combination for 10 or more weeks (0/256).  For the subgroup of 62 patients with complete 8-week data, the design of the study (open label and without control), the selection  bias  (24%  of  the  original  cohort),  and  the  limited  sample  size  (n=62)  make  the  results unreliable for evaluation of both efficacy and safety.

Study SPA2307 was a randomised, double blind, parallel group study. After washout and placebo runin, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1:2 ratio to one of three treatment groups: aliskiren 150 mg (N=318), amlodipine 5 mg (N=316) or the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine 150/5 mg (N=620) for 8 weeks. There was forced titration in each group so that by the start of week 16 patients in all three groups were receiving aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg. At the start of week 24, patients with uncontrolled BP (msSBP &gt; 140mmHg or msDBP &gt; 90mmHg) received hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg in addition to their regimen for additional 8 weeks. The number and percentage of patients who did not achieve  BP  control  with  aliskiren/amlodipine  was  221  (36.6%)  in  the  total  study  population.  In  the subgroup of patients who had not reached BP control while on dual therapy with aliskiren/amlodipine, msSBP/msDBP  was  148/85  mmHg  in  the  total  population  at  week  24.  The  triple  combination  of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide produced additional reductions in msSBP and in msDBP across the three randomized groups, as summarised in the table below. Additional reductions in msSBP and msDBP from week 24 to week 32 by randomized treatment regimen in patients who received Ali/Aml/HCTZ (Study SPA2307) Ali/Aml regimen Ali regimen Aml regimen Week 24 Change Week 24 Change Week 24 Change N 164 164 79 79 83 83 msSBP (mmHg) 146.9 -5.0 148.1 -6.9 148.0 -3.7 msDBP (mmHg) 84.1 -1.8 84.9 -2.8 87.9 -2.1 The additional reduction in msSBP/msDBP was significant only in one of the three original arms, i.e., the  arm  which  was  originally  treated  with  aliskirenamlodipine.  Moreover,  compared  to  the  dual combination  aliskiren/amlodipine,  the  triple  combination  of  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide produces  a  significant  reduction  of  blood  pressure  only  in  a  limited  percentage  of  patients  with uncontrolled hypertension.  Moreover, the lack of a parallel arm maintained on the dual combination aliskiren/amlodipine  raises  the  possibility  that  results  were  affected  by  seasonal  effects  or  other confounders. Study SPAUS02 : was an 8-week, prospective, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, active controlled, parallel-group  forced  titration  study  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a  triple  combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide treatment regimen to a double combination aliskiren/amlodipine regimen in patients of self-identified minority background, with Stage 2 hypertension  (baseline  msSBP  ≥160  mmHg  and  &lt;200  mmHg).  A  total  of  203  patients  were randomised to the triple combination regimen and 209 patients to the aliskiren/amlodipine regimen. Study medication was administered without regard to meals. Mean age was approximately 55 years in both  arms.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  age ≥ 75  years  was  low, ≤ 3%  in  the  two  arms.  The percentage of patients achieving BP control was greater in the aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide at week 2, week 4 and week 8. Nevertheless, the 1-week duration of each step in this forced titration study (1 week - 1 week - 2 weeks - 4 weeks) cannot rule out the possibility that the progressive reduction in blood pressure in steps after week 1 reflected not only the effect of the change in the treatment but also the effects of the prolongation of the treatment of the preceding step. The limited duration of the study does not allow for firm conclusions on safety. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study  SPHDE01 and Study  SPADE01: were  non-responder  design  trials  in  patients  not  adequately controlled  on  dual  therapies  and  were  conducted  in  Germany.  Study  medication  was  administered without regard to meals in Study SPHDE01 and with a light meal in Study SPADE01.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Supportive  Study  SPHDE01  was  a  multicenter,  sequential,  open-label  trial  where  after  a  2-week washout period, hypertensive patients (n=186) with a msDBP between 100-109 mmHg were treated in Phase 1 (4 weeks) with candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 16/12.5 mg for 1 week and force titrated to 32/25 mg. Patients with an inadequate response  (n=123) were treated in Phase 2 (4 weeks) with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  300/25 mg. Patients with an inadequate response (n=61) after Phase 2 received  triple  therapy  with  aliskiren/amlodipine/  hydrochlorothiazide  300/5/25  mg  for additional  4 weeks.  Study  medication  was  administered  without  regard  to  meals.  Clinically  relevant  further reductions  in  both  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  were  observed  with  the  triple  combination. Administration of  the  triple  combination  allowed  36.1%  of  the  patients  not  controlled  at  the  end  of Phase 2 to achieve control of their blood pressure levels. The lack of a parallel arm maintained on the dual  combination  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide raises  the  possibility  that  results  could  have  been affected by seasonal effects or other confounders.

Supportive Study SPADE01 was similar in design to Study SPHDE01; a multicenter, sequential, openlabel trial where after a 2-week washout period, hypertensive patients (n=342) with a msDBP between 100-109  mmHg  and  msSBP  between  160-179  mmHg  were  treated  in  Phase  1  (4  weeks)  with olmesartan/amlodipine force titrated to 40/10 mg. Patients with an inadequate response were treated in  Phase 2 (4 weeks) with aliskiren/amlodipine  300/10 mg. Patients whose blood pressure was not controlled  (n=65) after Phase 2 received triple therapy with aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 300/10/12.5 mg for additional 4 weeks. Study medication was administered with a light meal. Mean age of patients was approximately 60 years. The CHMP noted that the percentage of patients with age ≥75 years  was  not  given.  Clinically  relevant  additional  reductions  in  both  msSBP  and  msDBP  were observed in patients who received triple therapy as shown in the table below.

The  present  application  for  marketing  authorisation  of  Rasitrio  is  based  on  the  wide  therapeutic experience  of aliskiren, amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide. The  CHMP  Guideline  on  clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of hypertension (CPMP/EWP/238/95 Rev. 3) states that  a  fixed  combination  can  be  approved  solely  on  the  basis  of  bioequivalence  studies  if  all components  of  the  combination  have  a  wide  therapeutic  experience.  If  this  condition  is  not  met, additional clinical trials including factorial and long term safety studies are requested to support the safety  and  efficacy  of  the  proposed  combination.  Following  the  CHMP's  request  to  submit  sufficient epidemiological  or  other  data  to  support  the  claim  that  there  is  a  wide  therapeutic  experience  of aliskiren,  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  use  in  combination,  further  data  were  provided  to demonstrate that:

The lack of  a  parallel  arm  maintained  on  the  dual  combination  aliskiren/amlodipine  raises  the  possibility  that results were affected by seasonal effects or other confounders. Furthermore, the 1-week duration of the  step  after  the  wash-out  period  in  this  forced  titration  study  (week  -  1)  cannot  rule  out  the possibility  that  the  maximal  antihypertensive  effect  was  not  yet  reached  by  the  combination olmesartan/amlodipine when uptitration to the triple combination was performed. In general, the CHMP considered that the newly submitted results from these four additional clinical trials are of limited significance and provide only limited information about the efficacy and safety of the triple combination as compared to the double combination. 2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Aliskiren  has been evaluated in more than 37,000 patients in clinical trials during its development and  after  its  registration,  either  as  aliskiren  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  other  antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren tablets (150 mg and 300 mg) are now approved in over 101 countries worldwide and are being used in adults for the treatment of hypertension. Based on a review of the prescription databases in 6 countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Canada, and US), it can be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

estimated that a total of 756 041 patients received aliskiren monotherapy from launch to January 2010 and that among these, 82 690 (11%) patients are estimated to have also received amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.

-  Clinical  data  from  two  pivotal  studies  (SAH2302  and  SPA2301)  and  from  8  supportive  trials  were provided to support the benefit/risk profile of the combination.

- In support of the substitution indication, an exhaustive bioequivalence program was conducted.

The  rational  for  the  selection  of  the  five  doses  for  Rasitrio  (aliskiren/amlodipin/hydrochlorothiazide 150/5/12.5  mg;  300/5/12.5  mg;  300/10/12.5mg;  300/5/25  mg  and  300/10/25  mg)  has  also  been discussed; the main reason for this selection was the inclusion of combinations of 300 mg aliskiren with low doses of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide in order to limit the well known dose-dependent adverse  reactions,  mainly  oedema  and  hypokalaemia,  associated  with  the  use  of  amlodipine  and hydrochlorothiazide.  In  principle,  this  does  not  solve  the  issue  of  the  lack  of  complete  data  about efficacy and safety of the combination with lower doses of one or two components of the triple FDC. However, once the combination product is in therapeutic use, it will be possible to prescribe it only to patients who are adequately controlled with the concomitant administration of the already used doses of the three monocomponents.

- Most  of  the  efficacy  data  of  the  triple  combination  originate  from  the  pivotal  short  term  study SAH100A2302, which aimed to evaluate efficacy of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with uncomplicated stage 2-3 hypertension (moderate to severe). No relevant information on the efficacy of the triple combination may be inferred from the supportive studies submitted with the present application due to the following reasons:  The  scattered  number  of  patients  receiving  triple  FDCs  makes  supportive  studies  of  limited value for the proposed FDCs.  Supportive studies suffer from the design bias of having selected those patients for the triple FDC combination, who were not adequately controlled by either monotherapy or association therapy  with  two  monocomponents.  This  design  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  triple combination shows increased efficacy.  In  several  supportive  trials,  the  lack  of  a  parallel  arm  maintained  on  the  dual  combination aliskiren/amlodipine  raises  the  possibility  that  results  were  affected  by  seasonal  effects  or other confounders.  The studies do not add significant information about the efficacy of the triple combination in patients with age ≥75 years, a point which is unsolved in the overall clinical programme of this triple combination. In  course  of  the  clinical  assessment,  the  CHMP  raised  several  questions  that  had  to  be  addressed during the procedure:  Aliskiren's pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are greatly influenced by meal. The study protocol disregards the SmPC recommendation to administer aliskiren after a light meal  in  order  to  reduce  the  variability  of  PK  and  PD  parameters.  New  additional  analyses investigating the correlation between plasma levels of aliskiren and blood pressure reduction, in  a  subset  of  patients  enrolled  in  study  SAH2302  were  submitted  to  address  this  issue. Although  results  from  these  analyses  might  suggest  that  there  is  no  correlation  between plasma levels of aliskiren and the extent of blood pressure reduction, the limited number of patients included in the analysis may have negatively impacted on the results and no sound conclusion may be drawn from these results. However, it is recognised that the issue has a minor  impact  for  the  indication  'substitution  therapy',  and  this  particular  concern  may  be considered as resolved. Medicinal product no longer authorised
-  The  full  antihypertensive  effect  of  aliskiren  is  stable  at  6-8  weeks.  According  to  the  study protocol, patients were treated with the low dose of each of the three components of the triple combination for 4 weeks, and were then force- titrated upwards to the high dose of the three components and maintained on these doses for another 4 weeks. The forced up-titration after only 4 weeks of treatment would appear to underestimate the efficacy of 150 mg aliskiren, and may potentially overestimate the efficacy of 300 mg aliskiren. To solve this concern, data have been provided to show that a large fraction of the maximum antihypertensive effect is achieved by  4  weeks  of  continuous  treatment.  Considering  the  variability  in  the  patient  response  to blood  pressure  lowering  agents  in  the  clinical  setting,  these  data  confirm  that  4  weeks  is indeed the minimum period of time that is necessary to wait before considering up-titration of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aliskiren.  The  incremental  blood  pressure  reduction  seen  at  week  8  compared  to  week  4  is therefore attributable to the increase in dose.

-  In the elderly population, 75 mg aliskiren has effective blood pressure lowering effect in the majority  of  patients,  whereas  no  difference  between  the  antihypertensive  effect  of  150  mg aliskiren and  300  mg  aliskiren is apparent. Thus, most  of elderly subjects in study SAH100A2302 might have been exposed to excessively high doses of aliskiren. Appropriate statements have been included in the Rasitrio SmPC, advising on the recommended aliskiren starting dose and on the limited effect of the increased dose in the elderly patients.

Given  the  limited  number  of  patients  in  the  age  group  65-75  years  and  &gt;  75  years,  and  the  high percentage of patients with aberrant readings, additional analyses of efficacy data after the exclusion of  aberrant  readings  have  been  requested  by  the  CHMP  in  order  to  support  the  evaluation  of  the benefit  of  Rasitrio  in  the  elderly  population.  After  the  exclusion  of  aberrant  BP  readings,  the  triple combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide still induced a statistically significant greater reduction in msSBP  compared  to  each  dual  combination  therapy  group  at  study  endpoints. Importantly, the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction, excluding patients with aberrant readings in  the  requested  analyses  is  comparable  to  the  one  seen  in  the  overall  population.    However,  the results of the additional analyses performed in elderly patients showed that, after exclusion of patients with  aberrant  BP  readings,  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  between  the  triple combination  and  the  aliskiren-amlodipine  double-combination  in  patients  with  age  ≥65  years. Furthermore, the number of patients ≥75 years old was too small to perform a statistical analysis and to allow for definitive conclusions on the comparison among different treatments.

Data on the efficacy of the high dose of the triple combination are confirmed by the results of the longterm  uncontrolled study  SAH100A2301 , showing  that,  in  patients  with  uncomplicated  stage  2-3 hypertension, the triple combination of high dose of Rasitrio produced stable (at week 54 endpoint) reduction  in  msSBP  and  in  msDBP.  Similarly  to  the  effects  observed  in  the  short-term  study,  the number of elderly subjects aged ≥75 years (a total of 27 patients) is too small to allow any conclusion on this subgroup of patients. The choice of the high dose of each of the three components of the triple combination  in  the  long-term  study SAH100A2301  and  the  forced  titration  design  gives  limited information  about  efficacy  of  the  triple  combination  with  lower  doses  of  one  or  two  components. However, the lack of information on the long-term BP lowering effect of the lower strengths of the FDC is a minor issue considering that Rasitrio is intended for 'substitution therapy'.

Thus, a warning was requested by the CHMP to be included in the SmPC for the prescriber stating the there  is  evidence  of  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  events  related  to  hypotension  in  patients  over 65 years treated with Rasitrio (please see section Clinical safety). Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients over 65 years. Furthermore, the prescriber is also advised that only very limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older.  The  use  of  Rasitrio  in  patients ≥ 75  years  should  be  restricted  to  patients  for  whom  blood pressure control has been  established for the free combination  of aliskiren,  amlodipine  and hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular hypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended. Given the paucity of data in the elderly population, the CHMP has requested collection of additional efficacy, safety and tolerability data for the triple combination in a sufficient number of elderly subjects. In this regard, it is noted that the Apollo trial started on January 2011. The study will explore whether intensified  therapy  with  aliskiren  given  with  amlodipine  or  hydrochlorothiazide  reduces  the  risk  of cardiovascular  events  when  compared  to  similar  placebo-based  treatment  regimens  and  has  been included in the Rasitrio Risk Management Plan. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The originally requested indication was amended on request of the CHMP for reasons of clarity and ease of understanding for the prescriber.

No short-term or long-term data have been submitted on the efficacy and safety of Rasitrio in subjects with essential hypertension and major vascular co-morbidity (myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertensive retinopathy, heart failure NYHA  class  III &amp;  IV, significant heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy  or  cardiac  dysrhythmia).  The  exclusion  of  patients  with  major  cardiovascular  comorbidities from Rasitrio clinical trials raises concerns, since in a real life setting, significant number of patients with hypertension and co-morbidities need triple combination of antihypertensive drugs. The lack of data in patients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC. The results of the additional analyses performed show that higher pre-treatment blood pressure,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

male  gender,  black  ethnicity,  overweight  and  overweight-associated  disorders  (metabolic  syndrome and diabetes) were weak predictors of the need of the triple combination for adequate hypertension control.

## 2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

It  is  concluded  that  the  overall  clinical  data  available  for  the  combination  of  aliskiren  with  both amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide provide sufficient grounds for granting the indication 'substitution therapy'  in  hypertensive  adult  patients.  The  efficacy  profile  of  Rasitrio  has  been  confirmed  by statistical analyses performed after the exclusion of aberrant BP readings following the GCP inspection. There is, however an extreme caution required when treating patients &gt; 75 years. Patients with comorbidities are also to be monitored. The limited information on the efficacy of Rasitrio in the elderly and very elderly patients, as well as the lack of efficacy data in patients with co-morbidities is reflected in the SmPC. Long-term (&gt; 1 year) efficacy data for the triple combination will be derived from the Apollo study.

Study SAH100A2301 is a 28/54-week, open-label, multicenter study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in moderate to severe hypertension.

The indication applied for: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults. Rasitrio is indicated as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, taken either as three single-component formulations or as a dual-component and a singlecomponent formulation, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. Indication granted by the CHMP: Rasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  adequately  controlled  on  the  combination  of  aliskiren, amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  given  concurrently  at  the  same  dose  level  as  in  the combination. The originally requested indication was amended on request of the CHMP for reasons of clarity and ease of understanding for the prescriber. 2.6.  Clinical safety The  clinical  program  includes  one  main  pivotal  short  term  study, one long-term study  and  several supportive studies. The supportive studies submitted initially are not relevant for the applied indication and only limited safety information can be derived from the additional supportive studies submitted during the evaluation procedure. Thus, the assessment will focus only on short-term and long-term data about safety information derived from studies SAH2302 and SAH2301, respectively. Pivotal Study SAH100A2302 is an 8 week, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, active controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in moderate to severe hypertension.

## Adverse events

In  the  short-term  study  SAH100A2302 the  triple  combination  was  associated  with  the  highest incidence of AEs (ca 3% higher than double combinations) with approximately 60% of the AEs being of mild degree. However, the severity of AEs was slightly higher in the arm of the triple combination. The below table summarises the most frequently reported AEs in the short-term study; peripheral oedema was the most common AE.

| Edema peripheral   | 23 (8.0)   | 8 (2.0)   | 12 (4.1)   | 22 (7.1)   |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|

Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency. as reported in the AlivAml/HCTZ column.

Diarrhoea had the highest incidence in the aliskiren/amlodipine group (1.4%) and the lowest incidence (0.6%) in the aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide group. No patients discontinued study drug due to diarrhoea in any treatment group.

The incidence of any AE potentially related to hypotension was 4.9% with the triple therapy and 1.73.7% with  the  respective  dual  therapies.  There  was  no  dose  dependent  increase  in  frequency  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

titration to the triple 300/10/25 mg dose. None of the patients on Rasitrio discontinued from the study due to hypotension related adverse events.

In both the short-term and long-term study dizziness was the most frequently reported adverse event related  to  hypotension.  In  the  short  term  Study  SAH2302,  dizziness  was  more  frequent  in  patients treated with Rasitrio (3.6%) compared to the overall study population (2.8%). All other adverse events related  to  hypotension  occurred  in  ≤0.5%  of  the  patients. Analysis  of  adverse  events  related  to hypotension by age group (older and younger than 65 years of age) shows that dizziness was the most frequent  adverse  event  related  to  hypotension  for  both  patients,  65  years  of  age  and  older  and younger than the age of 65 years.

Pre-treatment orthostatic blood pressure changes largely differed among groups (orthostatic change = SBP decrease of at least 20 mmHg or DBP decrease of at least 10 mmHg from sitting to standing). The treatment with the combination did not increase the incidence of orthostatic BP changes with the use of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide but increased the incidence of orthostatic BP changes with the use of other combinations (approximately 2- or 3-times).

From the long-term study SAH100A2301, the number of patients and incidence of total and common AEs is summarised in the table below. Hypotension was reported in 6 patients (1.1%); all enrolled in the Rasitrio arm of study SAH100A2301. Of  these,  5  cases  (0.9%)  were  suspected  to  be  drug-related  and  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  the study drug in 4 patients. Dizziness was reported in a total of 15 patients (2.7%), of whom 6 (1.1%) were suspected to be drug-related and resulted in discontinuation in 1 patient. Three cases of syncope, all  in  the  Rasitrio  arm,  were  suspected  to  be  drug-related.  All  other  adverse  events  related  to hypotension occurred in ≤0.5% of the patients. Analysis of adverse events related to hypotension by age group (older and younger than 65 years of age) shows that dizziness was the most frequent AE related to hypotension for both patients 65 years of age and older, and younger than the age of 65 years.  In  the  subgroup of patients ≥65 years of age, the number of adverse events in the Rasitrio group related to hypotension was too small (n=8 in study SAH2301 and n=6 in study SAH2302) to provide any meaningful insights into the seasonal variation for hypotension related adverse events.

Orthostatic blood pressure change (decrease ≥ 20 mmHg in SBP or ≥10 mmHg in DBP when moving from sitting position to standing position) was reported in three patients, it was suspected to be drugrelated and resulted in discontinuation in one patient.

In study SPAUS02 , t he overall incidence of AEs was 40.2% in the dual aliskiren/amlodipine group and 34.2% in the triple combination group aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. The most frequently reported  AEs  were  headache  (aliskiren/amlodipine,  8.6%;  triple  combination,  10.9%)  and  dizziness (aliskiren/amlodipine,  2.9%;  triple  combination,  4.0%). The  limited  duration  of  the  study  does  not expand the previous evidence about long-term efficacy and long-term safety of the triple combination. In  study  SPHDE01, the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  in  each  treatment  phase  p  1:  11.8%; phase 2: 9.8%; and extension: 13.1%). The most frequently reported AE in the extension phase was cervicobrachial syndrome (2 patients, 3.3%). All other AEs in the extension phase occurred in 1 patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each and there were no reports of events potentially related to hypotension. The proportion of patients with suspected drug-related AEs was 4.3% in phase 1, 3.3% in phase 2, and 1.6% in the extension phase.

In study SPADE01, the overall incidence of AEs was similar in each treatment phase (phase 1: 12.9%; phase  2:  10.1%;  and  extension:  10.8%).  No  AEs  occurred  in  more  than  one  patient  during  the extension phase with the triple combination.  Dizziness was reported in one patient (1.5%) and was of mild severity. No other AEs potentially related to hypotension were reported. The limited duration of the study weakens the overall conclusions about safety.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In the short-term study SAH100A2302 there were no deaths or cases of angioedema reported after randomisation. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to AEs was higher in the triple combination group (aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide) than in other groups as summarised in the following table.

The below table shows the data of deaths, serious adverse events and adverse events in the long-term study SAH100A2301.  There was no death; there were 30 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, 6 of which were defined as severe.  The most common AE leading to discontinuation was peripheral oedema (13 patients, 2.3%). Other AEs leading to discontinuation in two or more patients included four cases of hypotension, three cases of tachycardia, two cases each of diarrhoea, erectile dysfunction, and hypokalaemia. In patients  receiving  the  triple  combination,  a  case  of  cerebrovascular  accident, palpitations,  renal  failure,  and  thrombocytopenia  suspected  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug  was reported.

## Laboratory findings

In the short-term study SAH100A3202, changes in haematology values were small (≤2 g/L in blood haemoglobin).  Incidence of notable changes in haematology parameters was very small and without significant differences between aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide group and the double combination  groups.  Hyperkalaemia  incidence  ranged  from  0.7%  to  3.0%.  The  incidence  of  serum potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L was higher in treatment groups containing hydrochlorothiazide but lower in treatment groups containing aliskiren, in line with the fact that hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren might have  balancing  effects  on  potassium  levels.  Shifts  in  creatinine  values  from  normal  to  high  were approximately  2-times  more  frequent  in  the  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  and  aliskiren/amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide  groups  (8.5%  and  8.3%,  respectively)  than  in  the  aliskiren/amlodipine  and amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide group (4.6% and 5.1%, respectively). Shifts from normal to high uric acid levels occurred in more patients in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide group (12.1%) than in the other  groups,  suggesting  that  the  effect  was  likely  driven  by  hydrochlorothiazide.  No  patient  in  the triple combination group discontinued from the study prematurely due to laboratory abnormalities.

In the long-term study SAH100A3201, shifts from normal to low for haemoglobin occurred in 2.8% of patients. Shifts  from  normal  baseline  to  high  post-baseline  values  were  noted  for  BUN  (7.8%), creatinine (12.8%), fasting glucose (9.1%), ALT/SGPT (8.2%), creatine kinase (10.9%), and uric acid (9.3%).    Shifts  in  potassium  from  a  normal  baseline  to  low  post-baseline  values  were  reported  in 11.4% of patients.

## Safety in special populations

No  data  have  been  submitted  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Rasitrio  in  subjects  with  essential hypertension and vascular co-morbidity (myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertensive retinopathy, heart failure NYHA class III &amp; IV, significant heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysrhythmia), in subjects  with  hypertensive  crisis  and/or  hypertensive  encephalopathy,  in  subjects  with  secondary hypertension,  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  dysfunction  or  renal  replacement  therapy. Only very limited data are available in elderly &gt; 75 years old and thus, appropriate request for caution is needed.

There is also no convincing clinical experience with the use of amlodipine in pregnancy. Hydrochlorthiazide crosses placenta. Intrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide,  is  associated  with  foetal  or  neonatal  thrombocytopenia, and  may  be  associated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. As a result, Rasitrio is contraindicated for use in second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during breast-feeding, as stated in the SmPC. Further warnings regarding the use in pregnancy are also introduced.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No safety interactions between the individual monocomponents of Rasitrio have been reported.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs was more incident with the triple combination than with the double combinations in the short-term study SAH100A3202 (3.6% vs 1.9%) and increased up to 6.4% in  the  uncontrolled  long-term  study  SAH100A3201.  The  most  common  cause  of  drug-related discontinuation was peripheral oedema, an AE which is secondary to the use of amlodipine.

<!-- image -->

Post marketing experience The fixed combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide was not marketed in any country at the time of the first MAA  submission for Rasitrio in  May  2010. Aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are currently approved in several EU countries worldwide either as monotherapy or as  free  combination. A  search  (cut  off  date  26-Nov-2009)  was  conducted  in  the  applicant's  safety database  for  all  spontaneous  reports  and  serious  solicited  (clinical  study  and  post  marketing surveillance)  reports  with  concurrent  use  of  aliskiren,  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide  (as  single active  ingredient  or  in  combination  products)  revealed  119  cases  reporting  427  events.  The  most frequently reported events (preferred terms reported more than 3 times in total; if an event occurred more than once in the same patients it was counted once) are presented in the table below. These events  are  either  known  to  be  associated  with  the  use  of  amlodipine  and/or  aliskiren  and/or hydrochlorothiazide  or  related  to  the  underlying  disease.  Therefore,  review  of  these  cases  did  not result in any new or additional safety findings. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Post-marketingAdverseEvents

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety Study  SAH2302  and  SHA2301  provide  the  safety  data  requested  by  current  CHMP  guidelines  for exposure of patients to short-term treatment and to long-term treatment, 8-week and 6-month/1-year respectively. However, the lack of compliance to the SmPC warning that aliskiren should be taken after a light meal is evident in both studies and thus, limits the interpretation of safety data and hampers their translation to the clinical setting. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

In the short-term study SAH100A3202, the triple combination was associated with approximately 3% higher  incidence  of  AEs  as  compared  to  double  combinations  (~36%  vs  ~33%).  Peripheral oedema was  the  most  common  AE,  followed  by  dizziness  and  headache,  nasopharyngitis  and  fatigue. Hydrochlorothiazide  did  not  reduce  the  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema  (aliskiren/amlodipine vs aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide=8.0% vs 7.1%). Diarrhoea had the highest incidence in the aliskiren/amlodipine group (1.4%) and the lowest incidence (0.6%) in the aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide group. No patients discontinued study drug due to diarrhoea in any treatment group.  The incidence of hypotension-related AEs in the short term Study SAH2302 was  at  least  32%  higher  with  the  Rasitrio  than  with  the  dual  therapies.  For  this  set  of  AEs,  the difference in the incidence of hypotension-related AEs between Rasitrio and the dual therapies rose up to  89%  in  patients  aged  ≥65  years  (10.2% vs 5.4%).  A  specific  warning  advising  caution  in  the population of elderly &gt;65 years old is present in the SmPC.

No  data  have  been  submitted  on  the  safety  of  Rasitrio  in  subjects  with  essential  hypertension  and major  vascular  co-morbidity  (myocardial  infarction,  stroke,  hypertensive  retinopathy,  heart  failure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NYHA class III &amp; IV, significant heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysrhythmia) and this limits the drug's comprehensive evaluation of safety. Furthermore, the exclusion of patients with major CV co-morbidities from Rasitrio clinical trials raises concerns, as a significant number of patients with hypertension and CV co-morbidities need triple combination of antihypertensive drugs. The lack of data in patients with major CV co-morbidities has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC.

In  the  long-term  study SAH100A3201 ,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was approximately  50%.    Peripheral oedema was most common, followed by headache, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, diarrhoea, dizziness and influenza. The incidence of hypotension-related AEs is, quite surprisingly, not extensively high in the present set.

No deaths,  angioedema or  other  major  immunological  disorders  were  reported  after  randomisation. The  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  short-term  study  was  higher  in  the  triple  combination  group  than  in double combinations (~2% vs ~1%) and increased to ~3% in the long-term study. The incidence of discontinuations due to AEs in the short-term study was higher in the triple combination group than in double combinations and increased to ~7% in the long-term study. The most common AE leading to discontinuation  was  peripheral  oedema.  Cerebrovascular  accident,  palpitations,  renal  failure,  and thrombocytopenia were suspected to be related to the study drug in patients receiving Rasitrio. Overall, safety results do not indicate the need of any additional warning, with the exception of symptomatic hypotension, for the triple combination in comparison with the dual combination aliskiren/amlodipine.

The  safety  profile  of  the  FDC  in  the  adult  population  has  been  adequately  established  in  the programme of several clinical studies but relies mainly on the data obtained from the short-term and 1-year-treatment  clinical  trials SAH100A3202  and  SAH100A3201,  respectively.  The  main  concern highlighted  with  the  use  of  the  triple  combination  of  Rasitrio  is  the  increase  in  hypotension-related events. There is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients over 65 years treated with Rasitrio. In addition, only limited clinical data are available from the population of  patients  &gt;75  years  old.  Therefore  a  specific  warning  about  the  use  of  Rasitrio  in  the  elderly highlighting that extreme caution is recommended when administering the drug to patients &gt;75 years old was included in the SmPC on request of the CHMP. Additional long-term safety data in the elderly population  will  be  collected  in  the  context  of  the  ongoing  Apollo  trial.  No  data  are  available  on  the safety of Rasitrio in patients with major CV co-morbidities and the lack of this information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. Similarly, information on the potential need of dose adjustment of antidiabetic drug(s) in diabetic patients treated with Rasitrio is mentioned in the SmPC.

The incidence of notable changes in lab parameters exceeded 2% for hyperkalaemia with the triple combination and for hypokalemia in the arms with and without hydrochlorothiazide of the short term study SAH100A3202.   In patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypokalaemia was lower  with  aliskiren  than  without  aliskiren.  Shifts  in  creatinine  values  from  normal  to  high  were approximately  2-times  more  frequent  in  the  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  and  aliskiren/amlodipine/ hydrochlorothiazide groups than in the aliskiren/amlodipine and amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide groups. Shifts  from  normal  to  high  uric  acid  levels  were  driven  by  the  presence  of  hydrochlorothiazide.  No patient  in  the  aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide  group  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to laboratory abnormalities. In  the  long-term  study,  shifts  from  normal  to  low  for  haemoglobin  occurred  in  ~3%  of  patients. Incidence of shifts  from  normal  baseline  to  high  post-baseline  values  was  ~8%  for  BUN,  ~13%  for creatinine, and ~8-10% for ALT/SGPT, creatine kinase, uric acid, and fasting glucose. It is known that thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance, and dose adjustment of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medicinal products may be required. It is also known that overt diabetes mellitus may occur during thiazide therapy and indeed the submitted data seem to indicate that impairment of glucose tolerance is present following the Rasitrio administration. The lack of information on the need of dose adjustment of antidiabetic drug(s) in diabetic patients treated with Rasitrio is included in the warnings' section of the Rasitrio SmPC.  Overall, laboratory changes are in accordance with previous evidence for the three monocomponents. No interaction among the three components was reported. From  the  safety  database,  all  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing experience with the mono components or the marketed double combinations have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 2.6.2.

There is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients over 65 years treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised. The use of Rasitrio in patients ≥75 years should be restricted to patients for whom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular hypotension (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). Contraindicated in patients with severe hypotension (Section 4.3): Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 4.4): Symptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non- complicated hypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients over 65 years. Symptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non- complicated hypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide.

A number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, which in some cases followed use of other medicinal product that can cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] (See section 4.8). Patients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during treatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely monitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. If angioedema occurs, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided.

| Renal dysfunction including blood creatinine increased | Routine pharmacovigilance activities. Medicinal product          | SmPC Posology and method of administration (Section 4.2): Rasitrio is contraindicated for use in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( estimated GFR 89-60 ml/min and 59-30 ml/min, respectively) Contraindication (Section 4.3) Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 4.4): Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment due to the absence of safety information for Rasitrio in this patient population. As for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. There is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently undergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. Renal artery stenosis No controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products acting on the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal no longer authorised |

Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 4.4): Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemic alkalosis, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8). As for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. Hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral electrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction (Section 4.5): Medicinal products affecting potassium : The potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, corticosteroids, ACTH, no longer authorised |

Moderate Pgp inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in plasma levels of aliskirenAUC, respectively. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). With concomitant use with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin in young patients and with diltiazem in elderly patients, the plasma concentration of amlodipine increased by 22% and 50%, respectively. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. It cannot be ruled out that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, no adverse events attributable to such interaction have been no longer authorised |

Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors: Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). |

A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women planning to become pregnant. Pregnancy: Rasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). If pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as possible. Breast-feeding: It is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of lactating rats. Since there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human or animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not advisable for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasitrio. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Rasitrio therapy taking into account the benefit of breast- feeding for the child and the benefit of no longer authorised |

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Reduction of blood pressure to the recommended targets has been shown to lower cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity: most patients need more than one drug to reach the desired blood pressure. Rasitrio  is  intended  for  substitution  therapy  in  adult  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, either as three singlecomponent  formulations or as a dual-component  and a single-component formulation, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination.

The bioequivalence program confirming the BE of the Rasitrio final market image formulation to the EU reference  products  under  light  meal  conditions,  and  to  the  clinical  formulation  used  in  the  pivotal studies in fasted conditions has been performed. In conclusion, the investigated strengths of the final

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

market Rasitrio formulation were bioequivalent to the free combination of the EU reference products when  administered  with  a  light  meal.  It  was  also  demonstrated  that  Rasitrio induces  statistically significant greater reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the component dual therapies in  adult  patients.  The  majority  of  patients  achieved  blood  pressure  control  defined  as  msSBP  &lt;140 mmHg and msDBP&lt;90 mmHg in the triple combination group and the blood pressure control rate with the triple combination at week 8 endpoint of the treatment was statistically greater than each of the respective dual-combination groups. After exclusion of aberrant blood pressure readings (see 2.5.1), the triple combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide still induced a statistically significant greater reduction in msSBP compared with each dual combination therapy group at study endpoints. Importantly, the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction, excluding patients with aberrant readings is comparable to the one seen in the overall population.

Furthermore,  the  once-daily  dosing  of  a  combination  tablet  may  lead  to  improved  compliance compared to the free combination of the monotherapies.

The minimally effective dose of the combination in the elderly has not been convincingly demonstrated. Evidence of the BP lowering effect of 75 mg aliskiren in the elderly has been included in the Rasitrio SmPC together with information on the recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients. The limited number of elderly subjects in the pivotal trials assessing the efficacy and safety of aliskirencontaining  products  is  a  major  problem  of  the  development  programme  of  aliskiren  and  aliskiren containing products. The SmPC includes appropriate wording that Rasitrio is to be used with extreme caution  in  patients  aged  75  years  or  older.  Further  data  will  be  collected  the  framework  of  Apollo clinical trial.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects Overall,  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  achieved  lower  BP  targets  (&lt;130/80  mmHg)  in  the  triple combination arm compared to the dual-combination treatments. However, no data from the patient population at risk of cardiovascular events are available for the use of the triple combination. The lack of information in patients with co-morbidities is, nevertheless, reflected in the relevant sections of the SmPC. The patients who could benefit most from aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination have  not  been  fully  characterised,  but  higher  pre-treatment  blood  pressure,  male  gender,  black ethnicity,  overweight  and  overweight-associated  disorders  (metabolic  syndrome  and  diabetes)  are weak predictors of the need of the triple combination for adequate hypertension control. The efficacy and safety of Rasitrio has not been established in subjects with essential hypertension and vascular comorbidity (myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertensive retinopathy, heart failure NYHA class III &amp; IV, significant heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysrhythmia). This information is correctly included in the SmPC. It is to be noted that the long-term (beyond 1 year) ability of Rasitrio to sustain an antihypertensive effect has not been established and will be addressed in the future. The clinical development programme for Rasitrio was conducted without attention to the fact that food is  known to affect the bioavailability of aliskiren and data were not collected to assess the timing of Rasitrio administration in relation to food. Study results are also confounded by the fact that aliskiren was administered not after a light meal as per the approved SmPC. Additional analyses investigating the correlation between plasma levels of aliskiren and blood pressure reduction in a subset of patients enrolled  in  study  SAH100A2302  were  hampered  by  the  limited  number  of  patients  and  a  sound conclusion  on  the  existence  of  a  correlation  between  aliskiren  plasma  levels  and  blood  pressure reduction was therefore not possible. However, this issue is not of a major importance for the applied tindication for 'substitution therapy' of the triple combination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The original  claim  that  once-daily  dosing  of  a  combination  tablet  may  lead  to  improved  compliance compared to the free combination of the monotherapies or the dual combination plus the monotherapy, remain to be demonstrated.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Treatment with Rasitrio may result in an increased incidence of angioedema. Furthermore, the use of Rasitrio  may  increase  the  risk  of  hypotension-related  events.  This  is  of  particular  concern  for  the elderly population. Both risks are reflected in the relevant sections of the SmPC for this product.

In line with the other approved aliskiren containing medicinal products (Rasilez and Rasilez HCT), there is a warning in the SmPC of Rasitrio to avoid administration of the FDC in patients at risk for gastrointestinal side effects, specifically diarrhoea.

A signal for aliskiren-induced toxic epidermic necrolysis was detected during the postmarketing use of aliskiren. These events will be closely monitored. Furthermore, in the postmarketing settings, cases of colorectal hyperplasia and colon cancer with aliskiren were identified and there is a concern that the presence of aliskiren in the fixed dose combination may increase the relative risk for solid tumours. The RMP addresses this potential carcinogenic concern.

Bioequivalence between the free combination of monocomponents and the fixed dose combination of Rasitrio has been demonstrated. The high number of aberrant BP readings, highlighted during the GCP inspection of 3 centres of the pivotal study SAH100A2302 did not influence the overall efficacy of the combination.  In  particular,  statistical  re-analyses  of  the  differences  in  the  blood  pressure  lowering effect  of  Rasitrio  over  the  dual  combination  of  aliskiren/amlodipine  and  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide after  the  exclusion  of  patients  with  aberrant  BP  readings  are  reassuring  of  the  efficacy  of  the  triple combination when compared to the dual combinations, in the general population. Further efficacy and safety data for patients aged &gt; 65 years will be collected in the long-term Apollo trial.

Data on the use of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below 18 years, pregnant or nursing females are not available. This information is adequately captured in the SmPC. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Long-term safety data from clinical trials are available only for one  year-long treatment. Long-term efficacy and safety data will be collected in the framework of the Apollo clinical trial. The biological mechanisms underlying the increased risk of angioedema due to the presence of aliskiren in the fixed dose combination have not been established. Benefit-risk balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects The current CHMP guidelines do not give a definite guidance on the requirements for the claim of 'wide therapeutic  experience',  which  is  the  ground  for  the  substitution  indication  sought  for  Rasitrio. Considering  overall  data  from  the  aliskiren  clinical  development  programme,  the  cumulative  postmarketing  data  available  for  aliskiren-containing  products,  as  well  as  the  previous  CHMP  positive opinion on the benefit/risk of the combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine and aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide, it is acknowledged that - with the exception of selected sub-populations of  patients,  including  the  elderly  population  and  patients  with  major  co-morbidities -  the  amount of data  now  available  for  the  combination  of  aliskiren  with  both  amlodipine  and  hydrochlorothiazide provide the base for the substitution indication in hypertensive adult patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The lack of clinical data for patients aged &gt; 65 years resulted in a specific warning on the elderly in the relevant section of the SmPC, in particular stating that Rasitrio is to be used with extreme caution in patients  aged  &gt;  75  years.    There  is  also  a  lack  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  patients  with  comorbidities, who represent a significant percentage of the hypertensive population treated with a triple combination of antihypertensive drugs.

## Benefit-risk balance

The decrease in blood pressure represents an established factor in lowering the risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders. The majority of patients need more than one drug to achieve the desired blood  pressure,  making  the  use  of  combination  of  antihypertensive  drugs  of  potential  help  for  a successful blood pressure control. The fixed dose combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (150/5/12.5 mg and 300/10/25 mg dose strengths) induces significantly  greater  reduction  of  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  than  the  component  dual therapies  in  adult  patients  without  major  co-morbidities.  Only  limited  long-term  clinical  data  are available at present. Elderly and very elderly patients are scarcely represented in the study population in which Rasitrio has been studied. In particular, the increase in hypotension and hypotension-related events, observed in the patients &gt; 65 years, limits the benefit of the triple combination in this age group. These findings have been reflected in the SmPC. The CHMP recommended strong cautionary statements for the use of Rasitrio in patients &gt;65 years old, including a specific warning that extreme caution  is  recommended  when  administering  the  drug  to  patients  &gt;75  years  old.  An  official commitment to provide additional long-term efficacy and safety data is included in the RMP.

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance The  overall  benefit/risk  of  Rasitrio  is  considered  positive  for  the  indication: treatment  of  essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. Concerns raised on the paucity of efficacy and safety data in the elderly population are solved by the specific warnings, agreed by the CHMP and included in the SmPC for the use of Rasitrio in patients &gt; 65 years and &gt; 75 years and as such, the SmPC adequately reflects the benefits and the restrictions or warnings for the use of this medicinal product. 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Rasitrio  in  the treatment  of  essential  hypertension  as  substitution therapy in adult patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination is favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
