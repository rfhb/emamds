## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)  is  a  common  cause  of  cardiovascular  mortality  and  morbidity.  Subjects  undergoing  major orthopaedic  surgery,  which  includes  hip  and  knee  arthroplasty  and  hip-fracture  repair,  represent  a group that is at particularly high risk for VTE, especially patients with risk factors (age &gt;60 years, cancer, prior VTE). Some uncertainty exists for what the spontaneous VTE rates would be without prophylaxis  when  up-to  date  surgical  technique,  early  mobilisation  and  other  non-pharmacological prophylactic  measures  are  undertaken.  It  may  be  that  some  estimations,  based  on  historical  data, overestimate the current risks but it is generally accepted that VTE risks in these patients remain high. Placebo-controlled  trials  in  such  populations  would  hardly  be  regarded  as  acceptable.  Estimations fetched  from  the  literature  and  cited  by  the  Applicant  are  that  calf  vein  thrombi,  proximal  DVT, clinical PE and fatal PE would be seen in 40-80%, 10-20%, 4-10% and 0.2-5% in such a population, respectively.

Thus, routine thromboprophylaxis has been the standard of care for more than 20 years in subjects at moderate and high risk for thromboembolism.

The Seventh ACCP  Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy (2004), an internationally  recognised  guidance  document  based  on  all  available  data  and  compiled  by  leading experts made the following major recommendations for the population targeted for Xarelto (strength of recommendations included within brackets):

Elective  hip  arthroplasty,  elective  knee  arthroplasty,  and  hip-fracture  surgery:  (1)  low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH, (2) fondaparinux, or (3) dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (Grade 1A) for at least 10 days (Grade 1A).

Hip-fracture surgery: (1) fondaparinux (Grade 1A), (2) LMWH (Grade 1C+), (3) dose-adjusted VKA (Grade 2B), or (4) LDUH (Grade 1B) for at least 10 days (Grade 1A).

For subjects undergoing elective hip arthroplasty and hip-fracture surgery, an extended prophylaxis for up to 28 to 35 days after surgery is recommended (Grade 1A).

Low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) is not recommended as the only method of thromboprophylaxis in subjects undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. LDUH, however, is recommended in subjects with hip-fracture surgery.

In Europe LMWH or fondaparinux are probably the prophylactic agents that are most commonly used in  these  patients,  also  in  hip  fracture  patients.  VKA  is  probably  used  for  prophylactic  purposes  in surgery to a smaller extent that in US.

LMWH provides  effective  and  safe  VTE  prophylaxis;  however  LMWH  needs  to  be  administered subcutaneously and may trigger heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II which is a rare but serious complication.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Xarelto  contains  rivaroxaban  as  the  active  substance.  It  is  presented  as  immediate-release film-coated tablet containing 10 mg of rivaroxaban for oral use.

Other ingredients in the core tablet include cellulose microcrystalline, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose  5  cp,  lactose  monohydrate,  magnesium  stearate  and  sodium  laurilsulfate.  The  film coating contains ferric oxide red, hypromellose 15 cp, macrogol 3350 and titanium dioxide

The  tablets  are  packaged  in  thermoformed  polypropylene  or  PVC/PVDC  blisters  with aluminium backing foil.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active Substance

The chemical name of Rivaroxaban is 5-Chloro-N-( { (5S)-2-oxo-3-[ 4-(3-oxo-4morpholinyl)phenyl ] -1,3-oxzolidin-5-yl } methyl)-2-thiophene-carboxamide. It is a white to yellowish powder with a molecular weight of 435.89. The empirical formula and the relative molecular mass of rivaroxaban have been confirmed by elementary analysis and mass spectrometry. The structure has been  confirmed  with  spectral  data:  IR,  UV-VIS, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR,  mass  spectrometry  and elementary  analysis.  The  1,3-oxazolidin  ring  system  has  in  position  5  a  chiral  carbon-atom  with  ( S ) configuration. Single-crystal x-ray structural analysis confirms the S configuration of the molecule

Rivaroxaban  is  only  slightly  soluble  in  organic  solvents  (e.g.  acetone,  polyethylene  glycol 400) and is practically insoluble in water and aqueous media with pH 1 - 9 (pH-independent 5 - 7 mg/L are soluble at 25 °C). The partition coefficient in octanol / water (log Po/w ) is 1.5.

Rivaroxaban has been tested for polymorphism and pseudo-polymorphism according to the ICH Q6A guideline  (decision  tree  4).  Rivaroxaban  crystallizes  in  three  polymorphs.  Polymorph  I  is  the thermodynamically stable one and has been used in all tablet formulations during clinical development and will be used in the commercial product. The identity of polymorph I is routinely controlled by Raman spectroscopy at release.

## · Manufacture

Rivaroxaban  is  synthesised  using  a  five-step  synthetic  process  using  4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3morpholinone as a starting material. Three key intermediates must be synthesised, which are then used in the reaction to form the active substance. After re-crystallization of rivaroxaban crude, the material is micronised.

The  route  of  synthesis  is  sufficiently  described,  and  the  main  steps  in  the  synthesis  are adequately monitored during the reaction. Based on batch analysis data adequate specifications have been  set  to control  the  quality of  the  starting  materials,  solvents  and  reagents,  and  isolated intermediates.

Eighteen  process  impurities  originating  from  the  starting  materials  and  the  synthetic  process have  been  identified.  The  origin  of  each  impurity  has  been  discussed  and  the  structure  of  each impurity has been described based on spectral analysis data (NMR and spectrometry). In practice, only 3 impurities (acetoxamide and bis-oxamine-urea and triamide) and enantiomeric purity are monitored in  batch  analysis.  No  single  structurally  known  organic  impurity  is  limited  above  the  limit  of max.0.15%, which would require specific toxicological qualification.

The  solvents  used  in  the  synthesis  have  been  shown  to  be  efficiently  removed  during  the purification and drying operations and appropriate specifications have been set.

## · Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, colour of solution, identification (IR, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), assay (HPLC), enantiomeric purity, polymorph I (Raman spectra), particle size (laser diffraction), related impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl-Fischer), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (Ph. Eur) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur).  The  analytical  methods  not  described  in  Ph.Eur.  have  been  sufficiently  validated  to  meet  the general  requirements  of  the  ICH  guideline  Q2R,  Validation  of  Analytical  Procedures:  Test  and Methodology.

The acceptance criteria in the active substance specifications have been set in accordance with ICH Q6A and are based on batch analyses of three representative pilot batches manufactured using the process described intended for marketing and 29 preclinical, clinical and stability batches. All results comply with the specification and demonstrate consistent quality of the batches produced.

## · Stability

Stability data have been provided for three batches of the active substance stored at 25 °C / 60 % RH for 18 months and at 40 °C /75 % RH for six months.

The parameters studied were appearance (material, colour), colour of solution, polymorphism, particle size, enantiomeric purity, organic impurities, assay and water content using the analytical test methods  intended  for  the  release  of  the  active  substance,  which  have  been  shown  to  be  stability indicating. In all cases the results met the predefined quality conditions set at the time of the testing. There was no degradation, or increase in the water content and no trends were identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional stability studies have been performed under stress conditions (thermal, hydrolytic and oxidative stress). The results of these studies show that rivaroxaban is a very stable substance with regards to thermal conditions and sufficiently stable with regards to hydrolytic stress.

The photostability of the active substance was tested according to the requirements of ICH Q1B. The results have shown that the active substance, when in solid state, is stable with regards to the influence of light and therefore there is no need to take any packaging and storage precautions against light.

## Medicinal Product

- Pharmaceutical Development

The development objective was to provide a small size immediate release tablet formulation of rivaroxaban. The active substance is practically insoluble in water and it has a high permeability as shown  by  the  results  of  a  validated  Caco-2  assay.  Therefore  it  could  be  classified  as  a  Class  II substance in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (low solubility, high permeability).

The problem of the low solubility of the active substance is addressed by reducing its particle size with micronisation to increase the particle surface area and thus facilitate dissolution. Dissolution profiles obtained on micronised batches of rivaroxaban were compared to non-micronised (crystalline) ones and  the  results  support  the  need  for  micronisation  of  the  active  substance.  When  comparing  the dissolution  kinetics  of  micronised  active  substance  within  the  specified  limits  of  particle  size distribution (e.g. X90 &lt; 15 µm), significant differences of dissolution kinetics can not be observed.

For  the  formulation  development  well-known  standard  excipients  that  are  often  used  in  immediate release tablet formulations were employed. Microcrystalline cellulose and lactose monohydrate act as fillers, croscarmellose sodium as a disintegrant, hypromellose 5 cp as a binder, sodium laurilsulfate as a wetting agent and magnesium stearate as a lubricant. Lactose monohydrate is produced from milk from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  conditions  as  milk  collected  for  human  consumption  and  the magnesium stearate used is of vegetable origin only.

A comprehensive discussion on process development has been provided by the applicant. A standard fluid  bed  granulation  process  has  been  developed,  followed  by  final  mixing,  tabletting  and  filmcoating. The impact of manufacturing process parameters on target properties of the final dosage form, such  as  tablet hardness,  disintegration, dissolution,  content  uniformity  and  stability  has  been investigated  during  development  and  scale-up  and  appropriate  operating  ranges  have  been  set  to ensure  that  the  finished  product  is  of  the  intended  quality.  The  tablet  composition  and  operating principles of all parts of the manufacturing process were not changed during scale-up.

The  tablet  dissolution  rate  is  a  critical  quality  attribute  of  the  product  and  is  influenced  by  active substance particle size. Therefore a discriminating dissolution test method has been developed for the release of the product. The dissolution test is performed in an acetate buffer of pH 4.5. Under these conditions  the  tablets  show  nearly  complete  dissolution  (&gt;  80  %)  within  30  minutes  meeting  the requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  developed  dissolution  test  is  able  to discriminate  between  tablets  containing  different  particle  sizes  of  the  active  substance.  A  series  of other properties of Rivaroxaban tablets that could potentially alter the dissolution profile and the invivo  bioavailability  were  also  investigated  and  the  suitability  of  the  test  method  to  differentiate between  batches  was  evaluated.  The  aspects  that  were  challenged  included  the  influence  of disintegrant; granulation time; blending time; addition of wetting agent; accelerated stability testing and compression force. In all cases the discriminatory power of the dissolution test was sufficiently demonstrated.

The  relevance  of  the  specifications  set  for  the  active  substance  particle  size  distribution  has  been confirmed by in vivo studies in dogs showing that the oral absorption is independent on API particle size after administration of tablets manufactured with API within the proposed specification limits.

Different product formulations have been used in the early studies. However bioequivalence between the clinical trial formulations and the one intended for marketing has been demonstrated.

Rivaroxaban  coated  tablet  10  mg  are  packaged  in  PP-  or  PVC-aluminium  blister.  The  immediate packaging materials are commonly used for these types of formulations and complies with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  stability  studies  indicate  that  the  primary  packaging  is  suitable  for maintaining drug product quality.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is a standard process for these kinds of formulations and consists of the following main steps: fluidised-bed granulation, mixing, tabletting and film-coating. All critical process parameters have been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls.

Although the proposed manufacturing process has not been validated at commercial scale, the batch analysis  data  collected  for  five  pilot  batches  and  three  production  scale  batches,  the  established  in process  controls  and  the  fact  that  the  process  is  standard  and  well-characterised  provide  sufficient grounds to  conclude that  it  is  sufficiently  robust  and  can  reproducibly  produce  finished  product  of consistent quality complying with the approved specification. In addition the applicant has committed to  perform  the  validation  with  three  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  in  accordance  with  the approved validation protocol as a post approval commitment.

## · Product Specification

The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for appearance,  identification  (TLC,  NIR  and  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.  Paddle apparatus), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur), impurities and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).

The  specification  and  control  tests  applied  for  the  finished  product  at  time  of  release  and throughout the life of the product, are in compliance with general pharmacopoeial standards (including Ph Eur) and ICH guidelines (Q3B and Q6A). The specifications for release and throughout shelf life are identical except uniformity of content and identification. These parameters will only be tested at release.

Batch analysis data from 5 pilot scale stability and 3 commercial scale batches have been presented. All batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies were carried out on 3 pilot scale batches of tablets according to the ICH requirements. Samples were stored at 25 o C/60 % RH and 30 o C/75 % RH for 24 months and in 45 o C/75 % RH for 6 months.

Additional stability data have been provided from thermal stress test conditions at 60 °C and 80 °C and high humidity stress test conditions (25°C / 60 % RH, 25 °C / 80 % RH, 30 °C / 75 % RH, 40 °C / 75 % RH) in open HDPE bottles for 12 months. Furthermore, bulk stability data at 25 °C / 60 % RH, 30° C / 75 % RH, and 45 °C / 75 % RH, and photostability data from studies performed in accordance with ICH requirements have been provided.

The  parameters  tested  were  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  hardness, disintegration, water and microbial purity (at selected time points). The methods used were the same as those used at release and are stability indicating.

The results of the accelerated and long term stability studies show a slight increase in water to an equilibrium state leading to a slight decrease in hardness. However in all cases the hardness results were within the acceptable ranges. No trend and no variability were observed in any of the other tested parameters.

The results from the stress studies show that there is no formation or increase of any of the known by-products of the active substance or any unknown compound. In addition the results of the photostability studies demonstrate that both the uncoated and coated tablets are stable upon exposure to light. Therefore there is no need to introduce any storage or transport restrictions in the SPC.

In conclusion the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of Xarelto is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  It  is  a  class  II  substance  in  the  BCS classification  system.  Its  low  aqueous  solubility  is  overcome  by  reducing  the  particle  size  with micronisation. Appropriate limits have been included in the active substance specifications to monitor the particle size and size distribution. Moreover the release of the active from the finished product is controlled routinely with a discriminatory dissolution test. The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. The packaging material is commonly used  and  well  documented.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  a  standard granulation, tabletting and coating process that has been adequately described. Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Rivaroxaban is a potent, selective, orally active direct inhibitor of the activated serine protease Factor X (FXa), which plays a central role in the blood coagulation. The agent acts at the convergence point of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. FXa catalyses the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin,  which  then  results  in  diminishing  of  thrombin-mediated  activation  of  coagulation.  Thus, inhibition of FXa is believed to be an effective strategy for the prevention of both arterial and venous thrombosis.

The  non-clinical  programme  documentation  for  rivaroxaban  is  comprehensive  and  extensive,  and provides  a  good  characterisation  of  the  pharmacological  properties  of  the  product.  It  includes investigations on primary and secondary pharmacology, characterisation of potential pharmacodynamic  interactions  between  rivaroxaban  and  other  antithrombotic  drugs  with  a  special focus on antithrombotic efficacy and potential risk of bleeding.

The  toxicological  and  toxicokinetic  profile  of  rivaroxaban  was  characterised  in  a  comprehensive program, including studies to investigate the systemic toxicity as well as exaggerated pharmacodynamic  effects  after  single  and  repeated  administration,  reproductive  toxicity  studies, genotoxicity studies and studies addressing specific toxicity issues.

All pivotal toxicity studies and most safety pharmacology studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practise (GLP).

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

The results of receptor binding and enzyme inhibition screens adequately demonstrate that rivaroxaban is  a  selective  FXa  inhibitor,  and  that  pharmacological  effects  due  to  interaction  with  unrelated receptors/enzymes are unlikely.

In the in vitro investigations, rivaroxaban competitively inhibited human FXa (Ki 0.4 nM) with a rapid onset  of  the  activity  and &gt; 10,000-fold  greater  selectivity  compared  to  other  serine  proteases. Rivaroxaban is a reversible inhibitor, with a mean half-lifetime of 200s. Rivaroxaban showed a low IC50 in the prothrombinase assay (2.1 nM), and demonstrated anticoagulant effects in human plasma, doubling  prothrombin time  (PT) and activated  partial  thromboplastin time  (aPTT)  at  0.23  and  0.69 µ M, respectively. Species differences in FXa inhibition were also discussed. Rivaroxaban inhibited endogenous FXa more potently in human (IC50 21 nM), rabbit (IC50 21 nM) and dog (IC50 114 nM) plasma  than  in  rat  plasma  (IC 50 290  nM).  These  species  differences  are  likely  to  be  the  result  of differences both in plasma binding and in the Ki of rivaroxaban for FXa. Nevertheless, the rat appears to be a sensitive species, which was seen in in vivo.

When given as prophylaxis in vivo , rivaroxaban produced antithrombotic activity in a dose-dependent manner in a variety  of  well-characterised  experimental  animal  models.  Antithrombotic  activity  was showed in venous (platelet-poor, fibrin-rich) and arterial (platelet-rich, fibrin-poor) thrombosis models in rats, in mice and in rabbits. Intravenously administered rivaroxaban (ED50 0.6-1 mg/kg iv )  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arterial thrombosis model tended to exhibit greater potency than the comparator enoxaparin (ED50 1-4 mg/kg iv ). Although lower doses of both rivaroxaban (ED50 0.1 mg/kg iv ) and enoxaparin (0.04 mg/kg iv ) were required to reduce thrombosis in the venous thrombosis model, enoxaparin was more potent than rivaroxaban.

In a rabbit model of venous thrombus growth, oral rivaroxaban given non-prophylactically at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg, reduced thrombus growth to a similar extent as a rivaroxaban dose of 1.0 mg/kg iv and known efficacious doses of the control agents nadroparin and fondaparinux. In a murine thromboembolic death model, rivaroxaban provided effective protection with an ED50 of 0.3 mg/kg iv , and greater potency than enoxaparin (ED50 7 mg/kg iv ).  In  a rat model of tissue factor (TF)-induced hypercoagulability, rivaroxaban dose-dependently inhibited formation of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), but low doses did not affect TAT generation. The direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran was also effective in inhibiting TAT generation at high dosages, but in contrast to rivaroxaban significantly increased TF-induced hypercoagulability at the lower doses.

Bleeding  time  models  in  rats  and  rabbits  were  used  to  evaluate  the  antihemostatic  effect  of rivaroxaban. Antithrombotic doses below the ED50 required for antithrombotic efficacy in the rat and rabbit AV-shunt models did not significantly affect bleeding times. At higher doses, bleeding times were  prolonged  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  The  ratio  'antithrombotic  activity/bleeding  risk'  of rivaroxaban was comparable to enoxaparin.

Rivaroxaban did not reduce the antithrombotic activity of enoxaparin and heparin in a rat AV-shunt model. Additive antithrombotic effect was observed after concomitant administration of rivaroxaban with either enoxaparin or heparin.

Rivaroxaban (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg iv ) was combined with anti-platelet drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 3 and 10 mg/kg po ) and clopidogrel (1 and 3 mg/kg po ) separately or in a combination. Concomitant use of rivaroxaban and ASA, rivaroxaban and clopidogrel, or rivaroxaban, ASA and clopidogrel may have greater antithrombotic potency than the individual treatments, but an increased bleeding risk at higher clopidogrel doses has to be considered.

In  general,  the  pharmacological  testing  demonstrated  that  rivaroxaban  inhibits  FXa,  leading  to secondary  changes  in  coagulation  parameters  like  aPTT  and  PT.  Efficacy  was  shown  in  various thrombotic models and there appears to be a dose margin between the antithrombotic effect and the risk for increased bleeding. However, variation between (and within) different animal models makes it difficult to estimate how large this margin is.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Secondary pharmacodynamics was evaluated in an extended screening of radio-ligand binding assays and  enzyme  assays.  No  non-specific  effect  was  observed  in  these  assays,  indicating  selectivity  of rivaroxaban for its target enzyme FXa.

Rivaroxaban has a structural similarity to the antibiotic linezolid, sharing the oxazolidinone structure. Oxazolidinones  are  clinically  used  as  antibacterial  agents  due  to  their  potential  to  inhibit  bacterial protein synthesis. Since originally, no studies investigating potential inhibitory effects of rivaroxaban on bacterial protein synthesis were submitted, this was raised as a major point during the evaluation. Consequently, data from tests involving three Gram positive strains of bacteria were presented.

These data suggest that neither rivaroxaban, nor metabolites M1, M2 or M15 have any antibacterial activity at relevant concentrations. An additional, related concern is the possibility of mitochondrial toxicity caused by rivaroxaban. Linezolid is known to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis leading to an eventual depletion of mitochondrial-derived proteins and a loss of mitochondrial function. The apparent absence of the antibacterial effect of rivaroxaban (and its metabolites) does not necessarily imply an absence of an effect on mitochondria. Based on request in the same major point, additional data about the effect of rivaroxaban on mitochondrial protein synthesis were provided in form of a study on incorporation of [ 35 S]-L-methionine in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Although non-clincial studies cannot completely rule out a potential for mitochondrial toxicity of rivaroxaban the results of the in  vitro study  show  that  it  might  be  low  and  thus  it  is  not  expected  to  be  of  concern  for  the currently approved short-term indication.  However, any mitochondrial toxicity is of greater concern

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for  long-term  treatment  and  exclusion  of  mitochondrial  toxicity  is  particularly  relevant  in  case  an extension to long-term thrombotic prophylaxis is considered in the future. Therefore, in order to avoid the limitations of the in vitro study, the mitrochondrial toxicity of rivaroxaban will investigated in a non-clinical setting.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

In safety pharmacology, the effects of rivaroxaban on vital organ systems (cardiovascular, respiratory and  central  nervous  system)  and  other  systems  (hematology  and  blood  coagulation,  gastrointestinal function, renal function, and metabolism) were investigated in several in vitro and in vivo studies. The overall results showed no biologically relevant adverse effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory system, renal function and metabolism, and gastrointestinal tract at the highest plasma levels achieved, which were 38-fold greater in rats and 31-fold greater in dogs than the therapeutic human plasma levels.

In studies addressing the risk for QT-prolongation in humans, no biologically relevant findings were observed in cardiovascular in vitro and in vivo studies.  Thus, there appears to be no indication of a proarrhytmic potential of rivaroxaban.

In  summary,  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  did  not  suggest  the  likelihood  of  any  acute  adverse pharmacological effects of rivaroxaban, except bleeding. However, it should be noted that the safety pharmacology  results  were  obtained  after  a  single  dose  of  rivaroxaban.  The  safety  pharmacology programme was not designed to detect any long-term pharmacological effects. Some of the findings in the repeated dose toxicology studies may, at least partly, depend on pharmacological mechanisms.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Studies with co-administration of rivaroxaban with drugs showing anticoagulant or antiplatelet activity (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, warfarin, and clopidogrel) were performed to investigate the potential for clinical interactions and to provide the respective pre-clinical safety data. Single oral administration  of  rivaroxaban  or  the  mentioned  anticoagulants  alone  prolonged  the  tail  transection bleeding  time  in  rats  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  After  co-administration  of  rivaroxaban  with antihemostatic drugs, only additive effects on bleeding time were observed. The additive effects were most  pronounced  with  naproxen  and  least  prominent  with  diclofenac.  Administration  of  activated charcoal together or shortly after dosing with rivaroxaban seemed to prevent or limit the absorption of rivaroxaban in rats.

The comprehensive set of non-clinical investigations characterises the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions  between  rivaroxaban  and  other  antithrombotic  drugs  regarding  antithrombotic  efficacy and  risk  for  bleeding.  It  appears  that  there  might  be  therapeutic  advantages  with  combined administration, particularly for a possible long-term use. Furthermore, some results indicate that the recombinant factor VII and factor VIII bypassing activity (FEIBA) might be useful antidotes in case of a rivaroxaban overdose. These assumptions must, however, be confirmed in clinical trials to establish their clinical relevance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

Non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted mainly in Wistar rats and dogs. Toxicokinetic data were collected from repeated dose studies in mice (CD-1), rats, dogs and female rabbits. General organ distribution was studied in Wistar rats and pigmented rats; placental transfer and excretion into milk was studied in female Wistar rats. Plasma protein binding and metabolism were investigated in vitro in  several  species,  including  Cynomolgus  monkeys  and  humans.  Several in  vitro studies  were conducted to characterise the involvement, inhibition and induction of cytochrome Ps (CYPs), P-gp and Bcrp. Finally, cell permeability was studied in Caco-2 cells.

Absorption  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  rivaroxaban  was  rapid  in  both  rats  and  dogs  with  maximal plasma concentration achieved in about 0.5 hours. The extent of absorption was somewhat lower in rats (67%) than in dogs (92%). After repeat dosing for 4 weeks, there was an increased absorption in rats, but not in mice or dogs. Higher exposure was observed in the female rats.

Protein  binding  varied  between  species,  highest  being  in  rat  (98.7%)  and  lowest  in  rabbit  (76.6%). Mechanistic studies showed that serum albumin is the main binding protein. However, a mechanistic study with human serum albumin (HSA) and oleic acid showed a striking difference in protein binding depending on the oleic acid concentration. This difference in protein binding is large enough to cover almost the entire range observed in different species.

Organ distribution after a single oral dose of rivaroxaban shows highest concentrations in the gastrointestinal  tract,  liver  and  kidneys,  lower  concentrations  in  the  brain.  Rivaroxaban  showed  minor affinity  to  melanin-containing  tissues,  such  as  pigmented  skin  areas  and  eyes.  After  repeated  oral administration  to  rats  (14  consecutive  daily  administrations),  radioactivity  showed  a  moderate accumulation  tendency.  A  slow  elimination  of  rivaroxaban  and  its  metabolites  from  bone  after repeated dosing raised a suspicion of a potential connection with skeletal malformations observed in the reproductive toxicity studies. However, the detailed review of the data revealed that the absolute retention  in  bone  is  unlikely  to  prolong  exposure  and  thus  cause  adverse  effects  on  skeleton. Nevertheless, the embryotoxic observation (see section on Toxicology) remains and is addressed in the SPC. Volume of distribution was moderate, amounting to 0.3 L/kg for the rat and to 0.4 L/kg for the dog.  Rivaroxaban  was  eliminated  from  rat  and  dog  plasma  with  half-lives  between  1  and  2  h. Rivaroxaban passes through the placental barrier but does not accumulate in the foetuses. In rats, the substance is excreted in milk.

Rivaroxaban is subject to oxidative metabolism in liver. The in vivo biotransformation pathways of rivaroxaban in man are similar to those in animals and are reflected in the in vitro investigation with liver microsomes and cultured hepatocytes from different species. The main metabolic pathway, the oxidative degradation of the morpholinone moiety, was catalyzed by CYP3A4/3A5 and CYP2J2 and lead via cleavage  of  the  ring  and  further  oxidation  to  the  formation  of  metabolite  M1.  Another pathway  is  the  hydrolysis  of  the  amide  bond,  generating  metabolites  M15  and  M13.  Besides unchanged rivaroxaban, metabolite M1 was identified as main metabolite in the excreta of animals and man. Qualitatively, the animal metabolism of rivaroxaban is similar to that of man and there are no unique human metabolites. There are quantitative differences but none of them represent a cause for concern.

Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma was rapid with no major circulating metabolites detected in plasma of rat, dog, and man. The main excretion routes in the investigated animal species and in man were  renal  and  faecal/biliary.  The  rat  differs  from  dogs  and  humans  by  a  higher  proportion  of rivaroxaban and metabolites excreted in bile/faeces, and a lower proportion excreted in urine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

The toxicological and toxicokinetic profile of rivaroxaban has been characterized in a comprehensive non-clinical  safety  program,  including  studies  to  investigate  the  systemic  toxicity  as  well  as exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects after single and repeated administration, reproductive toxicity studies,  genotoxicity  studies  as  well  as  studies  addressing  specific  questions,  such  as  phototoxicity, toxicity of impurities, mechanistic studies.

To  achieve  sufficient  exposure  levels  in  animals  a  specific  formulation  was  developed  allowing  a thorough characterization of the non-clinical safety profile of rivaroxaban. In the majority of pivotal repeat dose studies including the reproduction toxicity studies as well as in some of the dose-range finding investigations for the carcinogenicity studies rivaroxaban was administered using this specific formulation. Due to the specific manufacturing process of this formulation, it contains a significantly altered  impurity  spectrum.  Hence,  the  batches  used  in  these  studies  could  not  be  considered  as representative for drug substance and drug product. Therefore, a 4-week oral (gavage) toxicity study in rats was performed with selected batch of micro-crystalline rivaroxaban drug substance, specifically prepared to contain impurities relevant in rivaroxaban drug substance and drug product. Furthermore, representative batches of micro-crystalline drug substance were tested in in vitro genotoxicity studies.

## · Single dose toxicity

The acute toxicity of rivaroxaban was tested in male and female rats when administered orally and in mice of both genders when administered orally and intravenously.

No mortality was noted up to the highest technically feasible dose. Following i.v. bolus administration, apparent acute and transient clinical signs of toxicity appeared at the only tested dose of 25 mg/kg. Rivaroxaban was classified as moderately toxic in mice after intravenous and moderately toxic in both species  after  oral  administration.  No  major  toxicity  findings  were  noted  in  both  species  after  oral administration.

## · Repeat dose toxicity with toxicokinetics

Repeat peroral dose toxicity studies have been performed in mouse (4-13weeks), rat (4-13-26weeks) and in dog (4-13-52weeks) to support long term use in patients.

Target  toxicity  and  organ  toxicity  findings  examined  in  mice  with  the  low  tested  dose  were:  the significant decrease in leukocyte count and toxicity of liver. Decreased leukocyte count was evident in all toxicity studies. In case of low doses of the clinical crystal formulation of micronized rivaroxaban, focal liver necrosis together with increased liver weight and decrease in liver protein levels, e.g. serum ASAT and ALAT, activities of ECOD/EROD/ALD/GLU-T, were determined already at lowest dose level. Mice appear to be a sensitive species with regards to liver toxicity.

In  rat,  no  treatment  related  mortality  was  reported  in  the  toxicity  studies  with  orally  administered rivaroxaban. In the 13 week study using clinical crystal formulation of rivaroxaban, different treatment related effects were determined from the lowest dose levels tested: increased urine output, periportal inflammatory infiltrates/megakaryocytes in liver, transient increase in ALT and in the biomarker of cell leakage LDH,  decrease in glutamate dehydrogenase with highest activity in periacinar hepatocytes,  decrease  in  heart  weight,  pancreatic  acinar  hypertrophy,  unilateral  optic  nerve  fiber degeneration, and poplietal lymph node pigmentation. Sporadic liver lesions indicating induced liver necrosis were noted in single animal at higher dose level.

In the studies using the specific formulation of rivaroxaban, the main treatment related effects were: increased amount of IgG and IgA and increased incidence of pancreatic lesions. At higher doses, urine crystals  formation  together  with  increased  creatinine  and  urea  content  and  increased  incidence  of ovary  follicle  cysts  were  noted  in  the  26  week  study.  Studies  with  the  specific  formulation  also revealed that ALT increased transiently up to 1-3 month of treatment without any signs of liver lesions at autopsy, performed 2-3 months later. In addition, decrease in the absolute and relative heart weight was persistent. Myocardiopathy was noted in two female rats in the 26 week study and reduced heart weight in all studies conducted in rats, which was considered related to rivaroxaban.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  increased  incidence  of  pancreatic  lesions  reported  in  male  rats  is  of  concern  especially  when considering  the  possible  link  with  the  treatment  related  functional  effects  of  rivaroxaban  on  acinar pancreas observed in clinical trials, e.g. increased lipase and amylase levels. In addition, the exposure profile  of  the  compound  in  animals  is  relevant  to  that  in  humans.  The  detailed  review  of  the  data available  on  adverse  effects  related  to  pancreas  was  submitted  and  their  possible  relationship  to rivaroxaban cannot be excluded. This adverse reaction is appropriately reflected in the SPC.

Similarly, the SPC refers to the rivaroxaban related induction of the immunoglobulin levels. Although no apparent and consistent exposure related elevation can be claimed and the values did not generally differ  from  the  presented  historical  controls,  the  data  from  rat  studies  clearly  suggest  an  increased formation of immunoglobulins. In addition, the values fluctuated considerably (concurrent study mean controls  varied  greatly  between  33-113%  of  historical  mean  with  high  SD%  values).  The  overall increases were not restricted to one gender and consistent across studies. No evaluation of potential clinical safety impact has been provided.

In dog, the observed coagulation time (PT and/or PTT) suggested treatment resistance development. Consequently,  bleeding  related  observations  were  greater  at  week  13  than  at  week  52.  The  crystal formulation of rivaroxaban was not administered to dogs; instead the specific formulation was used. Slight dose dependent increase in liver weight was seen in the 4 week study, with minimal periportal vacuolation and centrilobular fat, but not in the longer studies. Four male dogs of the 52 week study had  minimal  to  slight  cytoplasmic  vacuoles  and/or  inclusions  in  the  liver.  Increased  level  of transaminase was detected at higher dose level in both studies. In the 52 week study, a tendency for an increased variability  in  heart  weight  was  seen. Treatment-related  increase in  the  incidence  of  small dense nuclei of collecting duct epithelial cells in kidney was reported in males in the 52 week study. Exaggerated pharmacological activity (inhibition of blood coagulation) lead to severe haemorrhages with secondary anaemia. However, no intrinsic organ specific toxicity of rivaroxaban was revealed up to the highest dose tested.

Although the non clinical safety data demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated in dogs, rats and mice, the persistent adverse effects on liver, including changes of hepatic enzyme and bilirubin levels and  incidence  of  liver  necrosis,  occurring  in  the  species  tested,  constituted  a  significant  concern. Further examination and a comprehensive comparison of hepatic data from all repeat dose studies in all  species  was  requested and provided. The finding of focal liver necrosis in orally treated mice is considered  related  to  rivaroxaban  treatment,  whereas  the  findings  in  rats  and  dogs  are  more ambiguous.  Thus,  the  concern  about  possible  hepatic  toxicity  remains  but  the  clinical  relevance  is uncertain.  Further  clinical  evaluation  and  risk  management  is  needed  and  additional  non-clinical studies  are  considered  unlikely  to  resolve  the  issue.  Analysis  of  the  clinical  liver  data  showed  that abnormalities of liver function test occurred with a comparable or lower incidence in rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin treated subjects and most of them occurred in the early phase after surgery. The elevations were transient and returned to normal in the majority of cases.

## · Genotoxicity

A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests was conducted and revealed no evidence for a genotoxic risk to patients under treatment. It was tested negative for in vitro mutagenicity and in vitro and in vivo clastogenicity. The effects of induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the mammalian cells were considered within historical control range rather than treatment related.

## · Carcinogenicity

Considering the anticipated short term therapeutic use, the negative results of the genotoxicity tests, no relevant  tissue  retention  and  no  evidence  for  any  pre-neoplastic  findings  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity studies, the justification for waiving carcinogenicity studies was accepted. However, carcinogenicity studies in rat and mouse to support future indications with chronic use are ongoing.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in rat and rabbit using the specific formulation of rivaroxaban. Fertility was unaffected by treatment of male and female animals, there was not obvious

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

negative  effect  on  pups  when  the  product  was  administered  to  dams.  Placenta  changes,  such  as necrotic borders, increased placenta weight or engorged-necrotic-pale, were seen in rat at low doses and in rabbit from mid doses upwards.

Increased  post-implantation  loss  was  observed  in  both  species  and  total  resorption  or  abortion  in rabbit. Adverse liver findings on foetal liver and spleen were observed in rat in form of dark coloured spots. Moreover, the target organs in foetus were skeleton, where significant incomplete progressed ossification-dysplasia and skeletal malformations were observed, and heart blood vessels, where artery position of rats and ventricular septum in rabbit were affected. Similarly, other related studies confirm these observations. Although no direct effect on male or female fertility was reported in the fertility and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  rat,  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  post-implantation  loss was  observed  already  at  the  lowest  dose.  The  increase  was  significant  at  the  higher  doses.  These observations were made in the embryo-foetal development study in rabbits.

The issues of post-implantation loss and developmental toxicity in animals were initially thought to be well within the range of historical control data. Neither can the malformation effects be considered related to reduced foetal weight or only to doses close to maternally toxic levels, since no supporting data  exist.  Thus,  the  increase  in  common  malformations  seen  in  both  species  at  clinically  relevant exposure  and  affecting  mainly  skeleton,  heart  and  vessels  appear  to  be  related  to  rivaroxaban's pharmacodynamic  activity.  Other  antithrombotic  medicinal  products  have  not  been  associated  with these  effects.  In  addition,  true  placenta  and  teratogenic  effects  of  rivaroxaban  cannot  be  excluded. Pregnancy and breastfeeding during rivaroxaban administration have therefore been contraindicated. The relevant information on placental toxicity, embryofoetal toxicity and teratogenicity are included in the SPC. In addition, pregnancy cases are routinely followed up and the measures related pregnancy are included in the Risk Management Plan.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic data were collected from repeated dose studies in mice (CD-1) rats, dogs and female rabbits.  General organ distribution was studied in Wistar rats and pigmented rats; placental transfer and excretion into milk was studied in female Wistar rats. Based on the data obtained, no relevant changes  in  exposure  were  observed  between  single  and  repeated  dosing  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  or between male and female mice and dogs.

Toxicokinetic evaluation showed that sufficient safety margins to humans were obtained in repeated dose toxicity studies and in reproduction toxicity studies.

## · Local tolerance

Local  tolerability  of  rivaroxaban  was  tested  in  dogs  after  intravenous/paravascular/intraarterial administration. It was concluded that the local tolerance of injected rivaroxaban was not different from saline, but due to the oral administration route to humans, these studies are not regarded as significant for the proposed clinical use.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Phototoxicity

Photosafety of rivaroxaban has been addressed an in vitro phototoxicity assay. The compound-related radioactivity was found to accumulate in skin but the parent drug showed minimal light absorption in the  range  290  to  300  nm.  Above  300  nm  no  light  absorption  was  seen.  Rivaroxaban  was  tested negative in a phototoxicity test in mammalian cell with or without irradiation.

## Mechanistic studies

A mechanistic study was performed to further explore the nature of the crystals found in the urinary sediment of rats in the 26-week study at doses of 50 mg/kg and above (PH-33611). Male and female rats were treated over 34 days with 200 mg/kg rivaroxaban. After microscopic examination of urine samples collected at day 24 the same crystals were found. Rivaroxaban was identified in the sediment which suggests that the crystals consist of rivaroxaban. Since rivaroxaban is excreted in rats via urine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(8.1 % of total radioactivity), it is most likely that the maximum solubility in the highly concentrated rat urine was exceeded, resulting in precipitation of unchanged drug.

## Studies on impurities

A  4  week  systemic  toxicity  study  in  rats  using  a  batch  of  micronized  drug  substance,  specifically prepared  to  contain  all  relevant  impurities  of  rivaroxaban  drug  substance  and  drug  product  was conducted. With exception of an increase in coagulation time (pharmacologically related effect), no treatment-related  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  rats  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested.  Furthermore, representative  batches  of  micro-crystalline  drug  substance  tested  in in  vitro genotoxicity  studies showed no genotoxic effects.

In  the  specific  formulation  of  rivaroxaban,  a  formulation  not  used  in  the  clinical  settings,  anilinomorpholinone,  an  impurity  formed  by  degradation  of  rivaroxaban  during  the  melting  process  was detected.  To  characterize  the  toxicological  profile  of  anilino-morpholinone  and  to  allow  a  clear distinction  between  potential  anilino-morpholinone  and  rivaroxaban-related  effects,  a  4  week  oral (gavage)  toxicity  study  with  anilino-morpholinone  was  conducted.  Anilino-morpholinone  was  well tolerated  by  rats  without  any  treatment-related  adverse  events  when  given  over  4  weeks  up  to  and including  40  mg/kg.  In  a  Salmonella/microsome  assay  anilino-morpholinone  showed  mutagenic effects.  The  impurities  present  in  drug  substance  and  drug  product  can  be  considered  as  qualified according to ICH Q3A guideline.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

A phase I environmental risk assessment has been submitted for rivaroxaban. There is no need for a phase II assessment for the planned use of rivaroxaban.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

This is a complete application for approval of a new direct factor Xa inhibitor for oral use, Xarelto, 10 mg film-coated tablets, which contain the active substance rivaroxaban. The development programme for rivaroxaban was extensive and included a large number of clinical trials. The active treatment with rivaroxaban was administered to more than 1000 subjects enrolled in phase I studies, more than 2000 in  phase  II  and  more  than  4500  in  phase  III.  Amongst  these  were  subjects  belonging  to  special populations, such as patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or mild or moderate hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh A and B).

In summary, the clinical investigations included single and multiple dose ascending studies to assess basic  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  characteristics  of  rivaroxaban  and  its  metabolites, studies  in  special  populations  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  intrinsic  factors  on  pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic  properties,  as  well  as  the  drug-drug  interaction  studies  guided  by  relevant  preclinical information.

Patients  in  the  phase  II  studies  were  administered  rivaroxaban  per  os  in  various  doses  and  safety, tolerability  and  efficacy  of  this  treatment  were  compared  to  that  of  subcutaneously  administered enoxaparin.  The  phase  III  programme  included  3  major  trials  with  patients  with  total  knee  or  hip replacement examining safety and efficacy of orally administered rivaroxaban.

## The claimed indication for Xarelto is:

Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs.

## The approved indication for Xarelto is:

Prevention  of  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  in  adult  patients  undergoing  elective  hip  or  knee replacement surgery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Formal scientific recommendations were given by the National Competent Authorities of France, UK, Spain, Germany and Sweden. The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP in the sought indication in July 2003 and in September 2005. Amongst the major discussion topics were: choice of a diagnostic  method  for  vein  thrombosis,  design  of  the  dose  confirmatory  phase  II  trials,  population selection in phase II trials, choice of the comparator, selection and definition of primary endpoints, characterisation and classification of bleeding events and others. The CHMP gave Scientific Advise also for different indications, as requested by the company.

During  the  clinical  development  programme  the  recommendations  provided  in  relevant  CHMP guideline within the therapeutic area: 'Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for Prophylaxis of High Intra- and Post-operative Venous Thromboembolic Risk\" (CPMP/EWP/707/98) were followed.

There is no paediatric investigation plan. According to the European legislation valid at the time of the submission, there was no requirement to submit a paediatric investigation plan before July 2008.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The CHMP requested a routine GCP-inspection at the sponsor site and at two investigator sites in Colombia and Peru.  Based  on  this  inspection,  the  general  performance  of  the  sponsor  can  be  considered  as  GCP compliant  and  the  data  reported  by  the  sponsor  for  the  Regulation  of  Coagulation  in  Orthopedic Surgery to prevent DVT and PE (RECORD) 2 study were deemed valid and reliable and can be used in the assessment of this marketing authorisation application.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban was evaluated in the phase I programme and additional data were also obtained from patients in three phase II studies. Plasma rivaroxaban concentrations were measured  using  a  validated  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  assay  with  tandem  mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS method). Rivaroxaban concentration in urine was measured using a validated HPLC assay with UV detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters in phase I studies were generally calculated by non-compartmental methods. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (population pharmacokinetic analysis) was used to evaluate pharmacokinetics in patients . The pharmacokinetic studies  included  single,  multiple  dose  trials,  examinations  of  metabolism  and  excretion  patterns, effects of age, gender, weight, race, renal and hepatic impairment and concomitant medication on the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug.

In  addition,  in  vitro  pharmacokinetic  investigations  pertinent  to  pharmacokinetics  using  human biomaterials  such  as  hepatocytes  microsomes,  recombinant  CYP  isoforms,  human  plasma,  Caco-2 cells and others, have been conducted in support of characterisation of rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic profile.

The  composition  of  the  tablet  formulation  used  in  the  phase  III  programme  for  VTE  prevention following  major  orthopaedic  surgery  is  identical  with  the  intended  commercial  formulation  and remained unchanged when compared to the phase I/II formulation studies, except the colour of the film-coat.

An overall description of rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics is displayed in the following figure.

## · Absorption

Following  the  oral  administration  of  5-10 mg  solution  of  rivaroxaban,  the  absorption  is  rapid  with Cmax reached after approximately 30 min. Upon administration of rivaroxaban tablet, a flatter profile was  observed  with  mean  peak  concentrations  occurring  after  2-4 h.  Rivaroxaban  terminal  half-life increases with dose and this suggests absorption limited elimination. In vitro data from a Caco-2 cell assay indicates intermediate permeability.

Food (a high-fat, high-calorie meal) did not affect the area under plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) and Cmax for the final 10 mg tablet, but absorption was delayed in the fed state showing a lagtime of approximately 0.5 h and a delay in median tmax of about 0.5 h. The Fabs was not determined for the 10 mg tablet, but was complete for 5 mg and around 66% for 20 mg dose in a fasting state. Based on this, on the dose-proportional exposure observed between 5 and 10 mg and the lack of food effect  for  the  10  mg  final formulation, the bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet seems to be 100% in healthy  volunteers.  However,  a  reduced  bioavailability  with  increased  dose  was  included  in  all population PK models of phase II data. The bioavailability seems to be about 80% at the 10 mg dose in patients. Rivaroxaban tablets were administered in the pivotal phase III trials irrespective of food intake and  the final formulation  was  used  in  phase  III studies, thus  omitting the need  for bioequivalence studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Distribution

Plasma protein binding for rivaroxaban in humans is high, approximately 92% to 95% in vitro ,  with serum  albumin  being  the  main  binding  component.  No  concentration-dependency  of  total  plasma concentration up to 3100 µ g/L rivaroxaban (approximately 20-fold  the  maximum  therapeutic concentration) was observed. Due to its high plasma protein binding rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialyzable. The binding of rivaroxaban to plasma proteins is fully reversible. The human plasma-toblood partition coefficient is 1.40. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) is approximately 50 L (0.62 L/kg), indicating a low affinity to tissues, which is in agreement with he observed data in animals.

Rivaroxaban  has  been  characterised in  vitro as  a  substrate  for  the  active  transport  proteins  Pglycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP ('breast cancer resistance protein').

## · Metabolism and elimination

Rivaroxaban  is  eliminated  via  three  major  routes.  Approximately  36%  of  the  dose  is  excreted  via kidney in form of the unchanged drug, involving the active transporter-mediated secretion by P-gp and BCRP. Further approximately 14% of the dose is eliminated via hydrolysis of the amide bonds and approximately  32%  of  the  dose  is  eliminated  via  oxidative  metabolic  pathways.  The  CYP3A4  and CYP3A5 isoforms are responsible for metabolizing around 18% and CYP2J2 around 14% of the dose.

After intravenous administration of rivaroxaban, the mean systemic clearance was 10.7 l/h. The renal clearance was 4.7 l/h, with the major part mediated by active secretion. Mean terminal elimination half-live of rivaroxaban after intravenous administration was 4.5 h. After the oral administration of 10 mg dose, elimination becomes absorption rate limited with terminal half-life of on average 7 to 11 hours.

In vitro metabolism of rivaroxaban was evaluated in liver microsomes and hepatocytes identifying 18 metabolites. After oral administration of [ 14 C]rivaroxaban 10 mg oral solution to humans, 66% of the dose  was  recovered  in  urine  and  28%  in  faeces.  In  total,  89%  of  the  dose  administered  could  be attributed to known structures. Unchanged drug was the main compound in plasma at all investigated time-points  and  accounted  for  89%  of  the  AUC(0-tn)  of  total  radioactivity.  No  major  or  active circulating metabolites were detected in plasma and the main metabolite in plasma, M1, accounted for about 3% of plasma radioactivity.

Approximately  36 %  of  the  dose  was  excreted  unchanged  in  urine.  Metabolites  M1  and  M4  were detected  in  urine  as  the  major  metabolites  and  accounted  for  around  13 %  and  8 %  of  the  dose, respectively.  The  main  constituents  in  human  faecal  extracts  were  the  unchanged  drug  (7 %  of  the dose) and the M1 metabolite (9 % of the dose). Urine and faeces excretion of M7 accounted for 6.6% of  the  dose.  Other  metabolites,  M2,  M5,  M6,  M8  and  M9  each  constituted  less  that  4%  of  the administered dose.

There is no indication of a potential metabolic interconversion of S- to R-rivaroxaban in humans.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Rivaroxaban displays a dose dependent pharmacokinetics with less than proportional increase in the AUC as the dose is increases. The non-linearity becomes evident in the fasting state at doses above 15 mg.  However,  the  pharmacokinetics  seems  to  be  fairly  proportional  up  to  30  mg  in  Caucasian volunteers and to 20 mg in Japanese and Chinese volunteers in the fed state. Overall, in the lower dose range  including  the  10  mg  dose,  no  major  deviation  from  linearity  for  rivaroxaban  was  observed. However, at higher doses a less  than  proportional increase  in  exposure  can  be  expected.  A  ceiling effect with no additional increase in exposure with increased dose is reached around 50 mg dose, even if taken with food by healthy elderly subjects.

## · Variability

Variability in pharmacokinetics is moderate with inter-individual variability (expressed as coefficient of variation) ranging from 18 to 33% for AUC, and from 16 to 39% for Cmax in Phase I studies. Intraindividual variability was reported to be on average (expressed as median) 14% for AUC, and 19% for Cmax.  In  the  PK  analyses  from  population  in  the  phase  II  studies,  inter-individual  variability  in clearance of 34-38% was observed at steady state (3-5 days after the operation) but was considerably higher on the first day after the operation, about 70%.

## · Special populations

Pharmacokinetics in special  populations  were  evaluated in  specific  phase  I  studies  in  subjects  with mild to severe renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment, elderly, subjects with high or low  weight.  In  addition,  differences  between  gender  and  different  race  were  evaluated  in  phase  I studies.

Gender, race and weight have none or only a small effect on rivaroxaban AUC. The drug exposure is increased  in  elderly,  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  and  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment (patients with cirrhosis classified as Child Pugh A or B). In addition, patients with renal and hepatic impairment are more sensitive to rivaroxaban and have a steeper PK/PD relationship resulting in a larger increase in PD effects than in PK effects.

Elderly  had  a  40-50%  higher  AUC.  In  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment rivaroxavan  AUC  increased  by  44%,  52%  and  64%,  respectively,  while  the  AUC  of  factor  Xa increased by 50, 86 and 100% and AUC of PT increased by 33, 116 and 144%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The group of patients with severe renal impairment included subjects with creatinine clearance 15-30 ml/min. A higher exposure and increase in factor Xa could be expected in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;15 ml/min. Rivaroxaban AUC was increased by 15% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A) and by 127% in those with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). The corresponding increase in unbound exposure was 157% in moderate hepatic impairment. The AUC for Factor Xa was increased 2.6-fold and for PT 2.1 fold in subjects with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  A  PK/PD  analysis  between  rivaroxaban  concentration  and  PT using  a  'close-to-linear'  model  indicated  a  steeper  slope  in  patients  with  reduced  renal  or  hepatic function.

Thus, safety in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment was a subject of discussion as a result of which, the SPC has been revised. In summary, the SPC proposes caution in patients with severe renal impairment  (creatinine  clearance  15-30  ml/min);  the  use  in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  &lt;15 ml/min is not recommended. Furthermore, a contraindication is captured in the SPC for rivaroxaban in patients with hepatic disease, which is associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk.  Caution  is  advised  for  cirrhotic  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  B). Patients at increased risk for bleeding are to be monitored.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The in  vitro non  clinical  studies  showed  a  low  potential  for  rivaroxaban  to  inhibit  CYP450 isoenzymes,  P-gp  and  BCRP.  This  was  confirmed in  vivo in  interaction  studies  with  midazolam (CYP3A4  substrate),  atorvastatin  (CYP3A4  and  Pgp  substrate),  warfarin  (CYP2C9  substrate)  and digoxin (Pgp substrate).

In vivo interaction studies are summarised in Table 1. To quantify the extent of interactions, in vivo drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  within  the  clinical  study  program  with  ketoconazole (strong  CYP3A4  and  P-gp  inhibitor),  ritonavir  (strong  CYP3A4  and  P-gp  inhibitor),  erythromycin (moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor), clarithromycin (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and moderate P-gp inhibitor) and rifampicin (potent inducer of CYP3A4). The results of the in vivo interaction  studies show  that  rivaroxaban  exposure  is  increased  by  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4,  P-gp  and  BCRP,  and  is decreased by CYP3A4 inducers. Doubling of rivaroxaban AUC was observed when co-administered with ketoconazol and ritonavir, while rivaroxaban AUC increased by 50% with clarithromycin and by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30% with erythromycin. Modelling studies with ketoconazole and ritonavir suggest that ketoconazole inhibits rivaroxaban hepatic clearance almost completely and also has a moderate effect on its renal secretion,  while  ritonavir  strongly  inhibits  renal  secretion  and  largely  affects  the  hepatic  clearance. Furthermore,  based  on  the  modelling  study  results,  the  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor  erythromycin inhibits  hepatic  clearance by  30%,  but  it  does  not  affect  renal  secretion.  It  is  of  note  that  observed effects of ritonavir and ketoconazole represent a worst case scenario with inhibition of both, the CYPmediated  metabolism  and  the  renal  secretion.  Strong  inhibition  of  either  cytochrome-mediated metabolism  or  renal  secretion  is  expected  to  result  in  lower  effects  than  that  observed  with ketoconazole and ritonavir together. Nevertheless, the SPC was amended appropriately to reflect the fact that the co-administration of rivaroxaban with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may lead to an increase in rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax, and moreover to a more  pronounced  pharmacodynamic  effects  along  with  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding.  The  use  of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with the azoleantimycotics  or  HIV  protease  inhibitors.  Fluconazol  is  expected  to  have  a  smaller  effect  on rivaroxaban exposure and can be co-administered with caution. The effects observed with clarithromycin and erythromycin were not considered clinically relevant.

The data from phase III studies indicate lower efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with concomitant CYP3A4  inducers.  The  AUC  of  rivaroxaban  decreases  by  50%  when  used  concomitantly  with CYP3A4 inducer  rifampicin.  Hence,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  other  inducers  may  have  a  similar clinically relevant effect on rivaroxaban. The SPC recommends that the co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers and rivaroxaban should be made with caution.

Two  specific  interaction  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  influence  of  antacids  and  H2receptor antagonists, on the absorption and oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban given as 30 mg tablets. Neither  ranitidine  nor  antazide  had  any  relevant  impact  on  pharmacokinetic  or  pharmacodynamic properties of rivaroxaban.

## Combination of risk factors

Patients with moderate renal and hepatic impairment or with moderate renal or hepatic impairment and concomitant  administration  of  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4,  P-gp  and/or  BCRP  could  have  a  very  large increase in rivaroxaban exposure and increased bleeding risk. The SPC includes a warning in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  moderate  renal  impairment  and  co-administration  with  other  drugs  increasing  rivaroxaban exposure.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Rivaroxaban is a competitive, selective, and a direct inhibitor of serine protease coagulation factor Xa (FXa). The activated FXa plays a central role in the cascade of blood coagulation. It is activated by both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. FXa directly converts prothrombin to thrombin through the prothrombinase complex, and ultimately, this reaction leads to fibrin clot formation and activation of platelets by thrombin.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The  pharmacodynamic  investigations  provided  evidence  of  a  dose  dependent  inhibition  of  FXa induced by rivaroxaban. The PT and aPTT were prolonged dose dependently, thus showing the anticoagulatory effect induced by rivaroxaban. The correlation between concentration and effect was well pronounced  for  the  PT,  followed  by  the  aPTT.  Rivaroxaban  had  no  effect  on  thrombin  content  in plasma and did not interact with antithrombin. This is in accordance with the normal activity profile of a direct FXa inhibitor.

Furthermore,  thrombin  generation  was  investigated  both  at  a  surface  and  a  tissue  factor  induced activation of the coagulation system. A significant reduction of thrombin generation by rivaroxaban in doses proposed for clinical use has been observed.

The  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  relationship  between  rivaroxaban  concentration  and several endpoints, such as FXa inhibition, PT, aPTT and Heptest, has been thoroughly evaluated. The relationship between rivaroxaban concentration and FXa activity was described by an Emax model. In the different studies EC50 ranged between 200 and 300 µ g/l and Emax approached complete inhibition. The  baseline  PT  was  influenced  by  the  surgery  in  the  patients  and  a  time-dependent  baseline  was incorporated in the model. A difference in the concentration-PT slope at post-surgery and at steady state  was  identified.  It  was  assumed  that  the  linear  PT  model  supports  the  use  of  PT  as  exposure marker in phase III trials for rivaroxaban concentrations up to 800 µ g/l. Although the PT may be used as  a  marker  for  rivaroxaban  exposure,  the  time  dependent  baseline  in  PT  post-surgery  and  the difference  in concentration-PT slope for different measurements indicate difficulties in using PT as exposure marker during the first days after surgery before steady state conditions have been reached. It is important to use the same method for all PT measurements.

An exploratory evaluation of the relation between PT and bleedings in phase III studies was conducted but PT threshold predictive of bleedings was not identified. Similar analysis for phase II data was also provided. The bleeding risk does increase with dose, but the dose-bleeding event relationship appears to be shallow. Neither PK parameters (AUC, Cmax or Cmin) nor PT can be used as indicator of bleeding risk due to the shallow concentration-response and overlapping concentrations/PT in patients with and without bleeding events in the studied dose range in the studied population. The relationship between Factor Xa and bleedings has not been evaluated, but is not expected to differ from that observed for PT and the different PK parameters. No specific PK/PD evaluation for clinical outcome (prevention of VTE) has been conducted.

There  is  a  need  to  develop  a  laboratory  test  for  detecting  increased  exposure  or  pharmacodynamic activity.  The  Applicant  has,  as  a  follow-up  measure,  undertaken  to  validate  modified  commercially available tests for estimations of the pharmacodynamic activity of rivaroxaban that could be used in routine clinical setting. Information on expected range of such a variable or corresponding rivaroxaban concentration after administration of rivaroxaban 10 mg q.d. could potentially be used in monitoring risk  patients,  and  be  used  in  dose  adaptation,  if  needed.  Information  regarding  range  of  PT (Neoplastin) at 2-4 h after dose at steady state (5th/95th percentiles ranged from 13 to 25 sec) and at baseline (mean 13 s 5th/95th percentiles ranged from 12 to 15 sec) is included in section 5.1 of the SPC, and can serve as a rough guide until a better laboratory test is available.

Although it may not be possible to identify the exact cut-off for hemorrhagic risk, for doses above 20 mg o.d. or conditions, which lead to an exposure equivalent to doses above rivaroxaban 20 mg o.d., monitoring of subjects for signs of bleeding complications after initiation of treatment is warranted. This issue is addressed in the SPC. This may be done by regular physical examination of the subjects, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of haemoglobin.

Although the non clinical investigations did not identify a QTc prolonging activity of rivaroxaban in hERG  channel  or  Purkinje  fibres  experiments  or  in  anesthetized  dogs,  a  comprehensive  study examining the potential for this effect was performed in accordance with the ICH E14 guidance. The results of this study in healthy volunteers did not indicate that rivaroxaban would induce a clinically relevant QTc prolongation.

Pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been performed with rivaroxaban and different agents with anti-haemostatic properties  (e.g.  enoxaparin,  aspirin,  naproxen,  clopidogrel).  The  results  from  these studies did not reveal any unexpected pharmacodynamic interactions. Co-administration of enoxaparin with rivaroxaban resulted in an additive pharmacodynamic effect, as measured by anti-FXa assay. The effect  of  bleeding  time  prolongation  during  the  co-administration  of  clopidogrel  seems  to  be  more pronounced.  The  present  warning  in  the  SPC  concerning  other  medicinal  products  affecting haemostasis therefore seemed to be sufficient in the orthopaedic patients, who are currently treated with rivaroxaban. The use of low doses of rivaroxaban and warfarin confirmed that no over-additive effects  were  observed  at  the  doses  investigated  and  this  forms  the  basis  for  further  planning  of confirmatory investigations.

From a clinical point of view, the primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects were considered to be sufficiently characterised.

## Clinical efficacy

## · Dose response study(ies)

Overall, three dose-ranging studies aimed do explore the dose range of rivaroxaban from 2.5 to 30 mg bid and  one  study  was  conducted  with  a  dose  range  from  5  to  40  mg  od.  All  trials  evaluated rivaroxaban  treatment  for  8-10  days  in  comparison  with  enoxaparin  40  mg  od sc or  30  mg  twice. Except for study 10942 (phase IIa) all phase IIb studies were performed as randomized, adequately controlled,  double-blind  studies  in  the  target  population  at  high  risk  for  VTE.  They  had  the  same primary  efficacy  composite  endpoint  (any  DVT  and  non  fatal  PE  and  death  from  all  causes)  and efficacy was measured with bilateral venography. This is in accordance with  the  CHMP recommendations.  While  three  dose  finding  studies  were  performed  in  elective  hip  replacement surgery (10942, 10944 and 11527), dose finding in knee replacement surgery was done only in one study (10945). Studies included in the phase II program were adequately designed and in accordance with the current recommendations made by the CHMP concerning the study design of such studies in the guideline on clinical investigations of drugs for prophylaxis of intra- and post-operative venous thrombotic risk (2000).

The  efficacy  primary  endpoint  was  almost  entirely  driven  by  asymptomatic  DVT.  No  clear  doseefficacy  response  relationship  could  be  established.  However,  the  relationship  can  be  regarded  as unexpectedly flat and the lowest dose seem to be associated with VTE incidence rates comparable to, or even lower than those associated with the standard enoxaparin regimen. It is not unreasonable to assume  that  these  might  be  highly  effective  dose  regimens  and  more  pronounced  effect  cannot  be gained  by  intensified  anticoagulation.  It  may  well  be  that  already  the  5  mg  dose  of  rivaroxaban provides  a  nearly  maximal  clinical  effect  that  is  achievable  by  the  type  of  pharmacological  effect exerted by rivaroxaban in this patient group. The flat dose relationship may give rise to some concerns related to a possible uncertainty about the true effects in modern orthopaedic treatment. It is, however, considered unethical to request placebo-controlled trials in this therapeutic area.

The incidence of bleedings seems to be clearly related to the dose differences. The higher bleeding rates  associated  with  10  mg  rivaroxaban  treatment  in  studies  10942  and  10944  as  compared  to  the enoxaparin regimen may be of some concern but the absolute figures are low. In addition, the design of  study  10942  was  open  labelled,  which  might  bring  bias  in  reporting  rates.  The  conclusion  that 10 mg od seems more favourable than 5 mg bd from a safety perspective does not appear very robust based on these data. On the other hand, the 5 mg bid regimen does not appear to carry any obvious advantages  and  10  mg  od  is  expected  to  be  associated  with  better  compliance  in  clinical  practice. Therefore, the compiled data on effect and safety of the product indicate that the choice of 10 mg od does not seem unreasonable.

With regard to efficacy, all four studies demonstrated good evidence for lower event rates and lower incidence  rates  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  all  rivaroxaban  treatment  groups  compared  to enoxaparin.

## · Main studies

The clinical efficacy of rivaroxaban in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs was investigated in 3 randomized, doubleblind  phase  III  trials vs enoxaparin:  Study  11354  (RECORD  1),  Study  11357  (RECORD  2)  in  hip replacement surgery and Study 11356 (RECORD 3) in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. In the studies RECORD 1 and RECORD 3, the treatment duration is essentially the same in the two treatment groups compared within the studies. However, RECORD 2 compares two groups that differ both, with regard to the prophylactic agents as well as to the treatment duration. Thus, it may in this study  be  partly  difficult  to  evaluate  to  what  extent  any  differences  in  efficacy  or  safety  results  are related to the study drugs or to the duration of treatment and this trial is considered supportive to the main RECORD 1 and RECORD 3 studies.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Men and women aged ≥ 18 years scheduled for elective total hip replacement (RECORD 2) or elective total knee replacement (RECORD 3) were eligible for the studies.

Among the exclusion criteria the following were of major importance:

- -Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding contraindicating treatment with low- molecular-weight heparin.
- -Significant liver disease (e.g. acute clinical hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis).
- -Contraindication  listed in the labelling or conditions precluding  subject treatment with enoxaparin  requiring  dose  adjustment  (e.g.  severe  renal  impairment  and  conditions  in  the national label of enoxaparin).
- -Pregnant and breast-feeding women and women with child-bearing potential not using adequate birth control method.
- -Patients with drug or alcohol abuse.
- -Ongoing oral anticoagulant therapy that could not be stopped in the opinion of the investigator.

Overall, a wide population of patients undergoing hip or knee replacement were eligible according to the inclusion criteria. There were not many exclusion criteria, which is thought to be advantageous. Hip fracture patients were not included and this is important to consider in relation to the wording of the indication as there is a lack of experience in this patient subgroup.

## Treatments

The 3 pivotal  phase  III  studies  used  different  regimens  for  investigation  VTE  prevention:  in  major orthopaedic surgery:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Extended prevention of VTE in Study 11354 (RECORD 1) (total hip replacement (THR) 5week administration of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin)
- -Extended vs short-term  prevention  of  VTE  in  Study  11357  (RECORD  2)  (THR,  5-week administration of rivaroxaban; 2-week administration of enoxaparin).
- -Short-term prevention of VTE in Study 11356 (RECORD 3) (total knee replacement (TKR), 2-week administration of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin).

Rivaroxaban was administered once daily at an oral dose of 10 mg and compared with subcutaneously administered 40 mg enoxaparin once daily. The treatment duration in the RECORD 1 study was 35 ± 4  days  for  rivaroxaban  and  36  ±  4  days  for  enoxaparin.  The  treatment  duration  in  the  RECORD  3 study was 12 ± 2 days for rivaroxaban and 13 ± 2 days for enoxaparin. Safety follow-up duration was 30  ±  5  days  in  both  studies.  The  first  dose  of  rivaroxaban  was  to  be  administered  6  to  8  h  postoperatively, whereas the first dose of enoxaparin was to be administered pre-operatively. Day 1 was defined as the day of surgery. In RECORD 2 study, rivaroxaban was administered as 10 mg tablets once daily (od) every 24 ± 2 h up to Day 35 ± 4 (the day prior to venography). All subjects in the rivaroxaban treatment group additionally received enoxaparin placebo sc injections once daily in the evening, starting on Day 0 (day before surgery) and ending on Day 12 ± 2 (last dose).

The  enoxaparin  regimens  are  approved  in  Europe  and  the  product  is  judged  to  be  a  relevant comparator.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the phase III trials were:

RECORD 1: To assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) 10 mg once daily dosing compared with once daily subcutaneously administered enoxaparin 40 mg in extended prevention of VTE in men and women aged 18 years or above undergoing elective THR.

RECORD 2: Comparison of the efficacy and safety of VTE prophylaxis with rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily administered for 5 weeks to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily administered for 10-14 days followed by placebo up to Day 35 in men and women aged 18 years or above undergoing elective THR. The efficacy  and  safety  parameters  of  primary  interest  were  centrally  adjudicated  by  Adjudication Committees.

RECORD 3: Assessment of the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) 10 mg once daily dosing for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in male and female subjects aged 18 years or above undergoing elective TKR.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The efficacy and safety endpoints of the phase III studies were as follows:

## RECORD 1:

The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint of:

- -Any deep vein thrombosis (proximal and/or distal),
- -Non-fatal pulmonary embolism,
- -Death from all causes,

The  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  solely  based  on  the  assessments  made  by  the Venography and VTE Adjudication Committees.

The main safety endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent major bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug. Major bleeding observed after this period was considered separately.

## RECORD 2:

The primary efficacy  endpoint  was  defined  as  a  composite  endpoint  of  any  DVT  (proximal  and/or distal) and non-fatal PE and death from all causes. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (and all  secondary efficacy endpoints related to VTE) was based solely on the assessments made by the Independent Central Adjudication Committee (ICAC) and VTE Adjudication Committees (AC/VTE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The main safety endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent major bleeding observed not later than  2  days  after  last  intake  of  study  drug.  Major  bleeding  observed  after  this  period  was  to  be considered separately. The analysis of the main safety endpoint was based solely on the assessment and classification made by the Bleeding Event Committee. Adverse events that started &gt; 2 days after the last intake of study drug were not considered to be 'treatment-emergent'.

## RECORD 3:

The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint of:

- -Any DVT (proximal and/or distal),
- -Non-fatal pulmonary embolism and,
- -Death from all causes.

The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (and all secondary efficacy endpoints related to VTE) was  based  solely  on  the  assessments  made  by  the  Independent  Central  Adjudication  Committee (ICAC) and VTE Adjudication Committees (AC/VTE). The major secondary efficacy endpoint was the  incidence  of  the  composite  endpoint  comprising  proximal  DVT,  non-fatal PE,  and  VTE-related death (i.e. 'major VTE').

The main safety endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent major bleeding observed no later than 2 days after the last intake of study drug. Major bleeding observed after this period was assessed separately.  The  analysis  of  the  primary  safety  endpoint  was  based  solely  on  the  assessment  and classification made by the Bleeding Event Committee. Adverse events that started &gt; 2 days after the last intake of study drug were not considered to be 'treatment-emergent'.

The  definition  of  the  primary  endpoint  is  in  agreement  with  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  received. Furthermore, a composite endpoint consistent with the CHMP guidance documents is included as the main  secondary  endpoint  and  all  phase  III  trails  followed  recommendations  given  in  the  European guideline applicable at the time of product development (\"Points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for prophylaxis of intra- and post-operative venous thromboembolic risk\"), now replaced  by  CPMP/EWP/707/98  ('Guideline  on  clinical  investigations  of  medicinal  products  for prophylaxis of high intra- and post-operative venous thromboembolic risk').

For the pre-specified pooled analysis of the three pivotal studies the following composite endpoints were used additionally:

- -Total VTE (Composite endpoint I), as defined for the individual studies.
- -Major VTE (Composite endpoint III), as defined for the individual studies.
- -Symptomatic VTE as defined for the individual studies.
- -Symptomatic VTE or death, the composite of symptomatic DVT (proximal and distal), PE and death (from any cause).

In summary the over-all design of the pivotal studies is believed to be acceptable and similar to the pivotal studies on which the approval of other prophylactic agents within this area have been based

## Sample size

In  summary  a  population  of  more  than  9500  subjects  was  enrolled  in  phase  III  studies,  which investigated rivaroxaban 10 mg od in comparison to enoxaparin 40 mg od.

## RECORD 1:

A  total  of  4541  subjects  were  randomized  at  218  centres.  4433  subjects  were  treated  with  study medication  (safety  population);  of  these,  3153  were  valid  for  the  modified  intent-to-treat  (MITT) analysis, 3029 were valid for the per-protocol (PP) analysis.

## RECORD 2:

A total of 2509 subjects were randomized at 123 centres. 2457 subjects were treated with study drug (safety population); of these, 1733 were valid for the modified intent to treat (MITT) analysis, 1615 were valid for the PP analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RECORD 3:

A total of 2531 subjects were randomized at 147 centres. 2459 subjects were treated with study drug (safety population); of these, 1702 were valid for the MITT analysis, 1631 were valid for the PP analysis.

## Randomisation

All subjects meeting the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were eligible for randomization. For  randomization,  an  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS)  was  used.  The  randomization  was done stratified by centre using permuted blocks: the centre-balancing list used internally by the IVRS provider  to  determine  the  randomized  treatment  assignment  (stratified  by  centre)  and  the  list  of random numbers used for packaging and labelling of the medication.

## Blinding (masking)

All studies had a double-blind, double-dummy design. The packaging and dosage were performed to ensure that the treatments between the different groups appeared identical. Subjects, investigators, and sponsor/contract research personnel remained blinded as to which study drug was administered. The Steering  Committee,  the  Independent  Central  Adjudication  Committee , the  VTE  Adjudication Committee, the Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee, and the Bleeding Event Adjudication Committee performed their assessments in a blinded manner. The DSMB reviewed unblinded data.

## Statistical methods

All variables were analyzed descriptively with appropriate statistical methods: categorical variables by frequency  tables  and  continuous  variables  by  sample  statistics  (i.e.  mean  standard  deviation, minimum,  median,  quartiles,  and  maximum).  If  not  mentioned  otherwise,  all  statistical  tests  were performed 2-sided with a type I error rate of α =5%.

In the studies in hip surgery, study RECORD 1 and RECORD 3, efficacy was assessed in two steps. First, a non-inferiority test was performed based on the PP population. If non-inferiority was shown, a superiority test was to be performed subsequently based on the modified ITT (MITT) population. In study RECORD 2, the primary efficacy analysis was performed in subjects valid for MITT analysis testing for superiority. The PP analysis was performed as a supportive analysis.

Pooled  analyses  were  pre-specified  for  symptomatic  events  during  treatment  until  day  12 ± 2  in subjects  valid  for  safety.  This  time  point  was  chosen  because  it  represents  the  treatment  duration shared by the active treatment schedules of all 3 studies. Also, symptomatic events can be assessed continuously throughout the study in contrast to the endpoints 'total VTE' and 'major VTE', which include asymptomatic components which were documented by venography at the end of the treatment phase. For the assessment of efficacy in subpopulations, the endpoints 'total VTE' and 'major VTE' were  evaluated  in  pooled  MITT  analyses.  All  pooled  efficacy  analyses  used  exact  study-stratified methods for the odds-ratio as a measure of treatment effect.

Demographic  variables  and  baseline  characteristics  were  summarized  by  treatment  group  for  all  3 analysis populations. Medical history findings and adverse events were coded by MedDRA codes and medications by ATC codes. Treatment group comparability was checked for each of the three analysis populations.  This  comparison  was  done  with  respect  to  age,  height,  weight,  and  body  mass  index univariately by 2-way analyses of variance. Categorical variables like gender and race were analyzed by a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for geographic region.

No interim analysis had been planned. However, there was an ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring by the DSMB who decided to review unblinded data. In case of an unacceptable efficacy and/or safety profile seen in any of the two treatment arms, the DSMB could have recommended to the Steering Committee the prematurely stop of the trial.

## Recruitment

Pivotal studies were conducted in Europe, Australia, USA, Canada, Asia, Latin and South America.

RECORD 1: 07 Feb 2006 - 13 Mar 2007 (218 sites)

RECORD 2: 19 Feb 2006 - 26 Jun 2007 (123 sites)

RECORD 3: 21 Feb 2006 - 18 Jan 2007 (147 sites)

Recruitment consistency across all regions was confirmed.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol for RECORD 1was amended 4 times, three amendments included only minor or editorial changes. Amendment 1 was a major amendment applicable to all participating countries and introduced a few major changes: adjudication by the AC/VTE refers to all symptomatic DVTs during treatment and follow-up, modification of the term 'significant liver disease' in the list of exclusion criteria,  elaboration  on  stopping  rules  related  to  liver  function,  addition  of  'net  clinical  benefit' assessed by the composite endpoint comprising major VTE and treatment-emergent major bleeding as a  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  addition  of  'incidence  of  surgical  site  bleedings  associated  with ≥ 2 g/dL fall in haemoglobin or leading to infusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or packed cells' as a safety variable,  introduction  of  univariate  comparison  by  2-way  analysis  of  variance  to  check  treatment group comparability, introduction of the 'modified ITT' population for efficacy analysis according to ICH-E9 Guideline, amendments to the primary efficacy analysis, which was to be performed in the PP population instead of the ITT population. The modified ITT analysis was specified as the next step in a hierarchical analysis plan. The PP population was the primary population for non-inferiority test and the  modified  ITT  population  was  the  primary  population  for  the  superiority  test.  New  assumptions were made for the non-inferiority testing, e.g. it was to be performed in the PP population primarily.

The original protocol of study RECORD 2 was amended once. Amendment 1 was major, applicable to all  participating  countries.  In  addition  to  some  minor  editorial  or  administrative  changes,  the amendment introduced a few major changes including the change of visit timing from Day 7 ± 2  to Day 6 ± 2, inclusion of clinical chemistry sample at Day 6 and liver enzyme monitoring and stopping rules.

Apart  from  the  amendment,  an  additional  change  related  to  the  data  analysis  was  implemented: Although  the  protocol-specified  time  period  to  perform  venography  was  31  to  39  days  following surgery  (Day  36 ± 4),  this  time  window  was  widened  to  29  to  41  (Day  36 ± 6)  days  at  the  Blind Review  Meeting  to  allow  for  a  greater  number  of  venographies  to  be  included  in  the  analysis.  In addition, this time window was also widened to 29 to 41 (Day 36 ± 6) for symptomatic VTE/death.

The original protocol for the RECORD 3 study was amended four times; three amendments included only minor or editorial changes. Amendment 1 was a major amendment applicable to all participating countries and was performed before inclusion of the first patient. Amongst the major changes were: change in blood sampling from Day 7 ± 2 to Day 6 ± 2, adjustment of liver enzyme monitoring and study drug discontinuation rules related to liver function test abnormality, addition of the incidence of surgical site bleeding associated with ≥ 2 g/dL fall in haemoglobin or leading to infusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or packed cells as an additional safety variable, modification of the term 'significant liver disease', addition of retention samples to be taken (HIV-, hepatitis A, B, and C-serology) for those subjects who had provided additional consent, for missing or venographies that were not performed or evaluable, measures were added to collect the reason for why the test was not done or not evaluable, clarification in the statistical analysis plan concerning study objective for US submission, removal of the enoxaparin 30 mg bid dose option (change implemented prior to enrolment of first subject).

Overall, the protocol amendments seem to have been appropriately performed and are judged not to affect the integrity of the studies.

## Baseline data

The  treatment  groups  in  studies  RECORD  1,  2  and  3  were  fairly  well  balanced  and  the  study populations  are  judged  to  be  reasonably  representative  for  a  target  population  undergoing  elective surgery.  Approximately  60  %  of  the  patients  in  the  hip  study  and  65  %  in  the  knee  study  had  the surgery performed under regional anaesthesia. Considering that rivaroxaban is given orally, it is of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interest to note that the differences between the treatment groups with regard to the primary endpoint seen in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia were consistent with the overall results.

The demographic data were provided for each subgroup in the relevant treatment arm with respect to gender,  race,  age,  weight  and  BMI.  The  study  populations  are  reasonably  representative  of  the European target population. The proportion of females was 55.5% in RECORD 1, 54% in RECORD 2 and 68% in RECORD 3 study. The mean age was 63, 61.5 and 67.6 years with approximately 13, 13.2 and 21% being &gt;75 years of age, in the RECORD 1, RECORD 2 and RECORD 3 trial, respectively. These data do not suggest relevant baseline differences indicated by the homogeneity testing in PP, MITT and safety population analysis.

## Numbers analysed

The number of patients per treatment arm was adequately reported for each pivotal study including the information on patients who discontinued the treatment and did not complete the protocol.

Efficacy data were obtained from 3029 (PP analysis) of the 4541 randomized subjects in the RECORD 1 study. For the MITT analysis 3153 subjects were valid.

In the RECORD 2 study, the primary efficacy endpoint was obtained from the MITT population which comprised  1733  subjects  of  the  2509 randomized  subjects.  1615  patients  were  valid  for  the  PP analysis.

Efficacy data were obtained from 1631 (PP analysis) of the 2531 randomized subjects in the RECORD 3 study. For the MITT analyses 1702 subjects were included.

The  numbers  of  withdrawals  as  well  as  the  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  balanced  between  the treatment groups with the exception of an apparent imbalance in the number of evaluable venograms between the treatment groups in RECORD 1 and RECORD 3. Approximately 89% and 88% of the randomised patients completed treatment in the hip and knee study, respectively, which appears to be in line with what could be expected in well performed studies. The observed rate of invalid venograms ranged  between  26.9%  (RECORD  1)  and  28.2%  (RECORD  3)  of  the  randomised  patients.  The number of patients who did not have any VTE assessment (no venogram performed) does not seem to be significantly high.

## Outcomes and estimation

The extended and short-term prevention regimens tested in trials RECORD 1 and RECORD 3 reflect current practice as recommended by treatment guidelines. These guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis  of  at  least  10  days  for  subjects  undergoing  THR  or  TKR  and  extended prophylaxis for up to 35 days after surgery in subjects undergoing THR. RECORD 2 study compared extended prevention with rivaroxaban vs short-term prevention with enoxaparin. Different durations of thromboprophylaxis  for  the  comparator  in  studies  RECORD  1  and  RECORD  2  reflect  different standards  of  care  in  different  countries  and  regions  related  to  the  use  of  low  molecular  weight heparins.

The results for the primary efficacy endpoint and its components are given in the following tabular overviews for the MITT and PP population.

On  the  background  of  MITT  incidence  rates  of  3.7%  and  18.9%  in  the  comparator  groups  in  the RECORD 1 and RECORD 3 trials, respectively, absolute reductions of 2.6 and 9.2%, respectively, appear  statistically  significant  and  therapeutically  impressive.  The  higher  incidence  in  the  knee replacement study (especially for distal thrombi) is in line with the earlier experience.

In  the  RECORD 1 study, in 3153 subjects valid for MITT analysis, the composite primary efficacy endpoint 'total VTE' (composite endpoint I) outcome occurred in 18 (1.1%) and 58 (3.7%) of subjects randomized  to  rivaroxaban  or  enoxaparin,  respectively  with  a  statistically  significant  difference (P&lt;0.001).  This  finding  clearly  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  rivaroxaban  over  enoxaparin  in preventing VTE. The relative risk reduction (unweighted relative risks) was 69.7% for the primary efficacy  endpoint  for  the  MITT  population.  Most  components  of  the  primary  composite  efficacy endpoint  were  numerically  reduced  in  the  presence  of  rivaroxaban  compared  with  enoxaparin, including  proximal  DVT,  distal  DVT,  VTE-related  death  and  non-VTE-related  death  in  the  MITT population. Only numerical differences were observed for death of any cause between the 2 treatments (rivaroxaban 4 (0.3%) subjects, enoxaparin 4 (0.3%) subjects) and nonfatal PEs, which were observed in  4 (0.3%) subjects receiving rivaroxaban compared to 1 ( &lt; 0.1%) subject in the enoxaparin group. Furthermore  unexplained  death  occurred  in  2  (0.1%)  and  0  (0%)  subjects  in  the  rivaroxaban  and enoxaparin groups, respectively.

Major  VTE,  the  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  occurred  in  4  (0.2%)  subjects  receiving rivaroxaban  10  mg  od  compared  to  33  (2.0%)  subjects  receiving  enoxaparin  40  mg  od  thus demonstrating superiority over enoxaparin (P &lt; 0.001; MITT analysis of major VTE).

Rivaroxaban was statistically superior to enoxaparin in reducing the incidence of composite primary endpoint (VTE-related  death,  nonfatal  PE,  and  DVT)  and  composite  main  secondary  endpoint (proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and all-cause death). According the analysis of net clinical benefit which was the composite of major VTE and treatment-emergent major bleeding the rivaroxaban regimen was statistically superior to the enoxaparin regimen.

The  CHMP raised  a  concern  with  respect  to  the  invalidity  rates  in  all  pivotal  trials  resulting  from missing/unevaluable  venograms  in  the  study  A  description  of  the  reasons  for  not  performing  the scheduled  venographies  was  provided  in  the  respective  study  reports.  Of  the  subjects  invalidated because of inadequate assessment of thromboembolism, between 45.0% and 52.4% did not have any venography. Main reason was a premature termination of participation in the trial (between 17.6% and 26.0%  of all subjects with inadequate assessment if thromboembolism),  followed by failed venipuncture  (between  9.4%  and  11.3%)  and  subject's  refusal  of  venography  (between  3.0%  and 11.2%).  Further re-examination of these cases revealed that the reasons for the venograms not being performed  or  being  assessed  as  non-evaluable  are  as  expected  for  this  type  of  trial.  There  is  no apparent imbalance between the treatment arms with regard to those reasons. The rather high level of discordance  between  the  central  adjudication,  using  strict  criteria,  and  the  local  investigators interpretation is in line with what has been observed in other similar studies and supports the strategy to use the blinded central adjudication for the primary efficacy evaluation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  RECORD  2  study,  the  composite  primary  efficacy  endpoint  occurred  in  17  (2.0%)  and  81 (9.3%)  of  subjects  randomized  to  rivaroxaban  or  enoxaparin,  respectively.  Thus  the  rivaroxaban regimen was found superior to the enoxaparin regimen.

All components of the primary composite efficacy endpoint were reduced in the rivaroxaban regimen compared  with  the  enoxaparin  regimen,  including  proximal  DVT  (5  (0.6%)  subjects vs 44  (5.1%) subjects), distal DVT (11 (1.3%) vs 49 (5.6%) subjects), nonfatal PE (1 (0.1%) vs 4 (0.5%) subjects), and death (2 (0.2%) vs (60.7%) subjects). For the main secondary efficacy endpoint, major VTE, the rivaroxaban  regimen  (6  subjects  (0.6%))  was  statistically  superior  to  the  enoxaparin  regimen  (49 subjects  (5.1%));  (P&lt;0.001;  MITT analysis of major VTE). For symptomatic VTE, the rivaroxaban regimen (3 subjects (0.4%)) was statistically superior to the enoxaparin regimen (15 subjects (1.7%)).

Thus, in RECORD 2 a superior efficacy of a five week regimen with rivaroxan as compared to a two week regimen with enoxaparin is demonstrated.

In  the  RECORD 3 study,  the  efficacy  data  were  obtained  from  1631  (PP)  of  the  2531 randomized subjects.  Based  on  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  4%,  results  for  the  composite  primary  efficacy endpoint  demonstrated  that  the  objective  of  non-inferiority  against  enoxaparin  was  met  and  that rivaroxaban was at least as effective as enoxaparin in preventing VTE. In 1702 MITT subjects, the composite  primary  efficacy  endpoint  outcome  occurred  in  79 (9.6%)  and  166 (18.9%)  of  subjects randomized to rivaroxaban or enoxaparin, respectively; a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.001) was observed. This finding demonstrated the superiority of rivaroxaban over enoxaparin in preventing VTE.  The  relative  risk  reduction  (unweighted  relative  risks)  was  49.3%  for  the  primary  efficacy endpoint in the MITT population. All components of the primary composite efficacy endpoint were reduced in the  presence  of  rivaroxaban  compared  with  enoxaparin,  including  proximal  DVT,  distal DVT, nonfatal PE and death (MITT population).

For symptomatic VTE, rivaroxaban demonstrated superior efficacy with a lower incidence rate when compared with  enoxaparin.  In  the  PP  and  MITT  analyses,  rivaroxaban  was  statistically  superior  to enoxaparin in the incidences of composite endpoint (DVT, nonfatal PE, and VTE-related death), as for the composite endpoint (proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and all-cause death). For the primary efficacy endpoint,  superiority  of  rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin  was  demonstrated  by  a  consistently  lower incidence of DVT, both for proximal and distal DVT. In addition, incidence rates for the components death and nonfatal PE were also lower in subjects receiving rivaroxaban compared to those receiving enoxaparin.  For  the  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  'major  VTE',  superiority  of  rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin  was  mainly  driven  by  a  lower  incidence  of  proximal  DVT.  The  overall  results  are consistent  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  'total  VTE'  and  the  main  secondary  efficacy  endpoint 'major  VTE'.  This  study  seems  to  have  demonstrated  superiority  of  rivaroxaban  to  enoxaparin concerning efficacy in patients undergoing knee surgery as an example for major orthopedic surgery of the lower limb.

The results of other secondary end-points were also in line with the primary efficacy results.

Furthermore  during  heterogeneity  testing  a  statistically  significant  difference  female  gender  was apparent  and  the  meaning  of  this  finding  in  the  context  of  the  study  results  is  unclear.  To  further explore  the  effect  of  gender  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  a  logistic  regression  model  was employed including the interaction of treatment with gender. The test for interaction of treatment with gender was not statistically significant in either the PP or MITT populations.

The clinical phase III program demonstrated the superiority of rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin concerning efficacy in the direct short term treatment comparison, the direct extended treatment comparison as well  as  the  comparison  of  extended  treatment  with  rivaroxaban vs short-term  treatment  with enoxaparin. There is a clear superiority of rivaroxaban 10mg od to standard comparator enoxaparin 40mg  od  in  the  prevention  of  venous  thromboembolism  in  patients  undergoing  major  orthopaedic surgery of the lower limb.

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses)

The  main  purpose  of  the  meta-analyses  is  the  investigation  of  the  treatment  effect  in  the  different subpopulations  of  clinical  relevance.  The  pooled  efficacy  data  for  the  three  RECORD  studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provided, including RECORD 2 which is regarded as a supportive study. Since the two treatment arms in  RECORD 2 differ both  with regard  to  treatment  time  and  prophylactic  agent  used  these  pooled efficacy analyses are believed to be of less interest. The p-value for heterogeneity indicates substantial differences between the estimated treatment effects in the three studies, which is not implausible given the differences in indication and design.

In  the  overall  population  of  the  3  pivotal  studies,  rivaroxaban  was  generally  more  effective  than enoxaparin in preventing total VTE  (MITT analysis) in nearly all subpopulations. These subpopulations with an observed odds ration less than the upper 95% CI limit of the overall population estimate (0.44) were: both genders, white and Asian race, all age groups, bodyweight &gt; 50 to 110 kg, BMI groups between 18.5 kg/m2 to &lt; 40 kg/m2, general anesthesia and regional anesthesia, duration of surgery,  absence  and  presence  of  risk  factors  for  VTE,  absence  and  presence  of  a  history  of  VTE, creatinine  clearance  between  30  to &lt; 50  mL/min  and &gt; 80  mL/min,  fragile  subjects,  and  a  limited number of subjects taking CYP3A4 or P-gp inducers.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No clinical studies were performed in children; rivaroxaban was only studied in patients older than 18 years.  Rivaroxaban  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  patients  below  18  years  of  age.  There  is  no clinically relevant difference in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics between men and women.

As stated above under clinical pharmacokinetics, rivaroxaban exposure increases with increased age, reduced renal function and reduced hepatic function.

Based on the data observed in the renal impairment PK study and in the phase III trials, the use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;15 ml/min and the product is only be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or patients with moderate renal impairment concomitantly receiving other medication increasing rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. This is reflected in the SPC.

The AUC of rivaroxaban was increased by 127% in moderate hepatic impairment (cirrhotic subjects classified  as  Child  Pugh  B).  A  significantly  altered  sensitivity  in  anti-coagulant  activity  towards rivaroxaban plasma exposure (increase in slope for PT/rivaroxaban plasma concentration relationship by more than 2 fold) was observed . A considerably larger increase in exposure could be expected in patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  As  stated  in  the  SPC,  rivaroxaban  is  contraindicated  in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and a clinically relevant bleeding risk. In addition, caution is advised in the treatment of patients with other hepatic disease of moderate grade.

## · Supportive studies

No  supportive  studies  were  provided,  although  the  RECORD  2  study  might  be  considered  as supportive given the differences in the use of the prophylactic agents and the treatment duration. For the purpose of the overall efficacy and safety overview of the product, the study is described along with the main RECORD 1 and RECORD 3 studies.

## Clinical safety

## Introduction

The  main  safety  endpoint  during  phase  II  and  III  studies  was  the  incidence  of  treatment  emergent major bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug. Major bleeding observed after  this  period  was  considered  separately.  Bleeding  events  were  analysed  and  assessed  by  an independent Adjudication Committee/Bleeding Events (AC/BE). The same AC/BE assessed all of the three studies of phase III with the same members and the same consistent method. The analysis of the primary  safety  endpoint  was  solely  based  on  the  classification  made  by  the  Committee.  Adverse events  that  started  more  than  2  days  after  the  last  intake  of  study  drug  were  not  considered  to  be 'treatment-emergent'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other safety variables included:

- -Major bleeding observed after this period was considered separately.
- -Incidence of any treatment-emergent bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug.
- -Incidence of non-major treatment-emergent bleeding including non-major clinically significant bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug.
- -Incidence of (any, non-major, major) post-operative bleeding (the post-operative period started 6 h after end of surgery or with the first post-operative intake of study medication, whatever came first and ended 2 days after last intake of study medication).
- -Incidence of surgical site bleedings associated with ≥ 2 g/dL fall in haemoglobin or leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or packed red blood cells.
- -Treatment-emergent adverse events.
- -Treatment-emergent serious adverse events.
- -Deaths.
- -Adverse events starting more than 2 days after stop of treatment.
- -Adjudicated cardiovascular events (on treatment/off treatment).
- -Incidence of (prolonged) hospitalization.
- -Transfusion requirements.
- -Discontinuations due to adverse events.
- -Amount of intra-operative blood loss.
- -Post-operative drainage volume.
- -Laboratory parameters.

An additional evaluation of bleeding events was conducted in accordance with the Scientific Advise given by the CHMP. In addition to the specified bleeding categories in phase III studies, the extended category  of  major  bleeding  events  removing  the  restriction  to  the  extra-surgical  site  for  a  fall  in haemoglobin of &gt; 2g/dL or for bleeding leading to infusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or packed cells was applied.

The safety of rivaroxaban in these studies was evaluated by documentation of adverse events coded according  to  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  conventions  and  laboratory testing. ECG monitoring was performed and analysed for phase I and for the phase II studies in the indication  VTE  prevention.  Additionally,  assessment  of  cardiovascular  events  was  provided  by  the Adjudication Committee/cardiovascular event for all studies.

## · Patient exposure

Safety data for rivaroxaban have been derived from studies completed and reported with a cut-off date of 31 August 2007.

No safety signals were identified from data analysis of phase I studies.

The  phase  II  study  programme  included  different  doses  up  to  60  mg  tdd  and  was  the  basis  of  the decision for further use of rivaroxaban 10 mg od in the phase III VTE prevention studies. Four VTE prevention studies and two VTE treatment studies were evaluated for the pooled safety analysis of phase II studies. This comprised data from 2787 subjects enrolled in VTE prevention studies, out of which  2232  subjects  received  rivaroxaban  and  555  subjects  received  enoxaparin.  A  total  of 1146 subjects  valid  for  safety  were  enrolled  in  VTE  treatment  studies;  883  subjects  received rivaroxaban and 263 comparator treatment. The number of subjects in phase II with the target dose of 10 mg rivaroxaban od was low, treatment durations were different and the safety profile in phase II was comparable to phase III. Bleeding rates observed with different rivaroxaban doses in the dosefinding studies are discussed in the section Dose-response studies.

In  the  three  phase  III  trials,  a  total  of  1220  subjects  were  treated  with  rivaroxaban  10  mg  od  for  a period of approximately 2 weeks, and 3437 subjects for a period of approximately 5 weeks. Safety data from phase III were derived from three pivotal studies (RECORD1, RECORD 2 and RECORD3), all of which were designed for patients receiving rivaroxaban 10 mg od. Thus, it is suitable to pool the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results from these methodologically consistent studies to conduct a safety analysis. All three phase III studies were assessed consistently. Bleeding events were analysed and evaluated by an independent Adjudication  Committee.  The  total  exposure  to  prophylactic  treatment  with  rivaroxaban  10  mg appears to be sufficient in order to reasonably characterise the safety profile of the proposed dosing regimen.

Based  on  the  demographic  data  analysis,  no  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  within  two indications during investigation in phase II were obvious. The gender distribution was 60% women vs 40% men for the rivaroxaban treated subjects in VTE prevention studies and 44% women vs 56% men for  the  rivaroxaban  treated  subjects  in  VTE treatment  studies.  The  race  distribution is  typical  for  a European population with more than 90% of white race in studies for both indications. About one third of the patients had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher in the VTE prevention studies and the  respective  number  in  the  VTE  treatment  studies  was  26%  for  the  rivaroxaban  treated  subjects. Mean age of the subjects was approximately 64 years with nearly half of the subjects younger than 65 years but only about 3 % of the subjects aged 40 years and younger. Although the mean body mass index of approximately 28 kg/m2 was within the normal range, about one third of the subjects had a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2.

Risk factors for thromboembolism were evenly distributed between treatment groups. In general, the profile of medical history findings appropriate to the population studied in relation to their age profile. When comparing the medicinal history of population with THR and with TKR, differences between both groups can be explained by the higher age of the subjects who had undergone TKR. The most noticeable  difference  between  the  hip  replacement  population  and  in  the  TKR  population  was observed in the surgical and medical procedures (51% vs 61%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (23% vs 34%)  and  vascular  disorders  (48% vs 62%).  These  differences  are  explained  by  the demographic variables, such as age, gender and BMI, which were different between the populations.

In summary, the adverse event safety assessment is based mainly on the safety population in phase III studies, which comprises of 4657 subjects randomised to rivaroxaban and 4692 subjects randomised to enoxaparin, since the number of subjects in phase II with the target dose of 10 mg rivaroxaban od was low  and  the  treatment  durations  were  different.  In  addition,  there  were  no  apparent  differences concerning the type of adverse events between all phases of the clinical programme.

Safety data with regard to the long term administration are missing, but since rivaroxaban is currently indicated for short time use (&lt;35 days), the safety evaluations are appropriate.

## · Adverse events

In the phase I studies 36.1% of all subjects who received rivaroxaban in any study reported at least one treatment emergent adverse event, compared to 27.1% in the placebo group. The majority of adverse events (30.4%) observed following rivaroxaban administration were of mild intensity, 5.6% were of moderate, and &lt;0.2% were of severe intensity. The most frequent adverse event observed in Phase I trials was headache, which is commonly observed in phase I trials regardless of the test drug. Overall, no specific safety signals could be identified from the data for adverse events in clinical pharmacology trials in phase I. However, as most of these comprised of single dose drug administration, this is an expected result.

The tendency to increased incidences of headache and gastrointestinal symptoms reported in the phase I studies was weaker in the phase II programme. No unexpected severe adverse events were recorded. Overall, the compiled safety data of adverse events from short term phase II VTE prevention studies and  from  phase  II  VTE  treatment  studies  with  a  median  treatment  duration  of  84  days  presented similar safety profiles between the two indications and between rivaroxaban and the comparator. The respective incidence rates were not different between the treatment groups.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse event from pooled data of the three phase III studies were gastrointestinal disorders, followed by general disorders and administration site conditions and injury, poisoning, and procedural complications. Although the three phase III studies include different indications (THR vs TKR) and different treatment durations (2 week active treatment with rivaroxaban and enoxaparin in RECORD 3, 5 week active treatment with rivaroxaban and enoxaparin in RECORD 1 and 2 week active treatment with enoxaparin followed by placebo vs 5 week active treatment with rivaroxaban  in  RECORD  2)  the  adverse  event  rates  are  consistent  across  the  three  studies. Concomitant  medications  taken  during  the  2  week  screening  period  prior  to  the  surgery  day  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

evenly distributed between treatment groups in both populations. Approximately 9% of the patients were  taking  antithrombotic  medication,  such  as  aspirin,  and  25%  used  anti-inflammatory  drugs. Furthermore, around 28 % of patients were taking agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, 15% of patients took beta-blockers, 15% of patients were treated with lipid-reducing agents and 12% with calcium  channel  blockers.  The  number  of  patients  on  concomitant  medication  is  believed  to  be appropriate and supportive of the conclusion that the populations studied were representative of the target population with regard to comorbidity.

Generally,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  Differences between the treatment groups did not exceed 1%. No group differences were seen between the most frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  in  both  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  the observed gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and constipation), general disorders (pyrexia), procedural  complications  (postoperative  anaemia,  procedural  pain).  Amongst  the  most  frequently reported  adverse  events  in  the  rivaroxaban  patient  group  were  oedema,  muscle  spasm,  pain  in extremities, skin blisters and pruritus. The treatment emergent adverse events and their frequencies are adequately reflected in the SPC.

## · Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

No death occurred in phase I  clinical trials.  Out  of  2232  randomized  subjects  in  the  phase  II  VTE prevention studies, seven cases of death were reported in the rivaroxaban treatment group. No deaths were reported in the subjects receiving enoxaparin. For five out of seven fatal cases the onset of the critical event leading to death occurred after the end of treatment. In the treatment group of 2.5 mg bid,  which was the lowest dose tested in phase II studies, there were three reports of death, two of them in subjects with pulmonary embolism and one in a subject with symptoms possibly related to pulmonary embolism. Events leading to death in the remaining dose groups were infections, cardiorespiratory  arrest  and  pulmonary  embolism.  None  of  the  reported  fatal  cases  were  believed  to  be related to bleeding events.

In  phase  III  trials,  eight  deaths  were  recorded  among  the  subjects  from  the  rivaroxaban  treatment groups and nineteen subjects from the enoxaparin/placebo treatment groups. From the eight subjects of the rivaroxaban treatment group two did not receive active study medication. From the reported events after start of active study medication until the end of the follow-up period, the most frequent cause of death  in  the  rivaroxaban  and  enoxaparin  group  was  pulmonary  embolism  or  suspected  pulmonary embolism (2 vs 6), followed by respiratory failure (2 vs 4) and myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest (0 vs 4).  In  summary,  the  death  numbers  were  numerically  lower  in  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group compared to the enoxaparin treatment group (pooled data irrespective of treatment duration). In the three controlled clinical studies there was no report of fatal bleeding or intracranial bleeding during the treatment with active study medication.

## Non fatal serious adverse events

In the phase I clinical pharmacological trials eight out of 1260 subjects who were evaluated in safety data analysis reported serious adverse events. None of these events was considered to be related to rivaroxaban and no safety signal was derived from these events.

In phase II studies treatment-emergent serious adverse events and drug-related serious adverse events were not different between the treatment groups of the subjects enrolled in VTE prevention studies. The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  serious  adverse  event  was  DVT  (2%  in  the rivaroxaban treatment group vs 6% in the enoxaparin treatment group).

During the 2 week treatment, the incidence of serious treatment-emergent adverse events reported by subjects valid for safety analysis in the 3 phase III studies during the entire treatment period or until day 12 ± 2  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  Differences  between  the  treatment  groups  did  not exceed 1% with exception of DVT. The investigator reported DVT rate was lower in rivaroxabantreated  subjects  in  both  analyses  (0.6%  in  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group vs 1.9%  in  the enoxaparin/placebo treatment group for all three studies irrespective of treatment duration). The most frequent  serious  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  in  both  treatment  groups  during  both  treatment periods were procedural complications, such as joint dislocation and dislocation of joint prosthesis and vascular disorders, in particular DVTs .

The  incidence  rates  of  serious  treatment-emergent,  drug-related  adverse  events  for  the  5-week treatment in the RECORD 1 study were 1.2% (26/2209) in the rivaroxaban treatment group vs 1.0% (23/2224) in the enoxaparin treatment group. These were 1.1% (13/1228) in the rivaroxaban treatment group vs 1.4% (17/1229) in the enoxaparin/placebo treatment group in study RECORD 2.

The  incidence  of  serious  treatment-emergent,  drug-related  adverse  events  reported  in  the  safety population of the 3 pivotal phase III studies during the entire treatment period or until day 12 ± 2 and until  day&gt;35  was  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most  frequently  reported  serious treatment-emergent,  drug-related  adverse  events  in  both  treatment  groups  during  both  treatment periods  were  gastrointestinal  disorders,  general  disorders,  increased  ALT,  injury,  poisoning,  and procedural complications, operative haemorrhage, and vascular disorders, and haematoma.

## Bleedings

All bleeding events were classified into two categories:

- Major bleeding event.
- Non-major bleeding event, including clinically relevant non-major bleeding and other nonmajor bleeding.

## Major bleeding events included:

- Fatal bleeding.
- Bleeding into critical organ (e.g. retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular or intraspinal bleeding/haemorrhagic puncture).
- Bleeding requiring re-operation.
- Clinically overt extra-surgical site bleeding associated with ≥ 2 g/dL fall in hemoglobin.
- Clinically overt extra-surgical site bleeding leading to infusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or packed cells.

Non-major bleeding events were bleeding events that did not fulfil the criteria of major bleeding. This included clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding events included multiple source bleeding, spontaneous haematoma &gt;25 cm 2 ,  excessive  wound  haematoma, spontaneous  nose  bleeding  &gt;5  min,  macroscopic  haematuria  (spontaneous  or  lasting  &gt;24  hours  if associated  with  an  intervention),  spontaneous  rectal  bleeding  (more  than  spot  on  a  toilet  paper), gingival bleeding &gt;5 min, coughing blood, haematemesis, prolonged bleeding after venipuncture &gt;5 min.

Other clinically relevant non-major bleeding events that were reported but that did not meet the above criteria were classified into the following categories: surgical site bleeding, intra-articular with trauma, events, slightly higher bleeding incidences were observed in the pooled rivaroxaban groups. However, a significant proportion of the patients in the control groups was treated with a placebo for approximately 3 weeks and a more relevant comparison can be made when all phase III patients having active treatment for 35 days are compared.

Thus, in adequate head to head comparisons there is a weak trend for a slightly higher rate of bleeding in the rivaroxaban treated groups. However, there are no differences in fatal bleedings or bleedings into critical organs. The distribution of bleeding locations and of bleeding severity seems to be similar between the treatment groups.

There have been no reports of accidental or intentional overdose with rivaroxaban, however, there is a potential  for  increased  bleeding  related  to  overdose.  No  specific  antidote  is  known  and  the  SPC recommends the several steps to help manage events of haemorrhage. This includes the use of procoagulants, such us the activated prothrombin complex concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate, recombinant factor VIIa. There is, however, no experience in the use of these substances in subjects treated  with  rivaroxaban;  only  non  clinical  data  are  available.  Formal  clinical  investigations  to demonstrate the effectiveness of the existing pro-coagulatory drugs in the settings of severe bleeding and/or  rivaroxaban  overdose  is  not  feasible  and  might  be  unethical.  Thus,  the  experience  from  the future occasional events of administration of pro-coagulants in relevant cases of drug overdose in the post-marketing use will be monitored and reported to the CHMP in Periodic Safety Update Reports.

## Cardiovascular events

During active treatment 11 subjects of the rivaroxaban 10 mg od treatment group vs 16 subjects of the enoxaparin  40  mg  od  treatment  group  had  cardiovascular  events  adjudicated  as  stroke,  myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. After discontinuation of the active treatment and during follow-up the  respective  numbers  were  11 vs 7.  In  general,  the  cardiovascular  events  adjudicated  as  stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death were evenly distributed between the treatment groups during the entire observation period.

No  QTc  prolonging  effect  was  observed  for  rivaroxaban  in  elderly  male  and  female  subjects  in  a dedicated QT study, which was a four way crossover study, that tested two doses of rivaroxaban (15 and 45 mg) as well as placebo and moxifloxacin (400 mg) as a positive control in 54 healthy male and female volunteers older than 50 years. No meaningful differences in ECG recordings or arrhythmias between the treatment groups were noted in the phase II programme.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The type and duration of surgery and of anaesthesia as well as time to mobilization were recorded in subjects  valid  for  safety  analysis.  There  was  no  noticeable  difference  between  the  rivaroxaban  and enoxaparin/placebo treatment groups in any of these parameters or in the vital parameters or in blood pressure or heart rate.

There  was  a  difference  in  non-infectious  wound  complications  188  (4.1%) vs 133  (2.9%)  in  the rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin  groups,  respectively.  A  difference  was  also  noted  for  wound  secretion. There  was,  however,  no  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  for  serious  non-infectious  wound complications. Following the data re-analysis, the statistical significance of these observations remains valid; however, there are no obvious differences with regard to severe complications.

## · Laboratory findings

Extensive clinical laboratory evaluations were performed in the 3 phase III studies and included:

- -Haematology:  haematocrit, haemoglobin, RBC, WBC, differential blood count, and platelets
- -Blood  chemistry:    glucose,  calcium,  sodium,  potassium,  creatinine,  urea,  uric  acid,  albumin, ALT, AST, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (total, direct,  and  indirect),  amylase, and lipase

Overall, the incidence rates of laboratory abnormalities in the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin treatment groups were similar.

The imbalance in the incidences of the creatinine and urea levels above upper limit of normal (ULN) was apparent. The levels of creatinine were increased on 8.54% of subjects in the rivaroxaban group vs 6.59% in the comparator group. Similarly, 8.55% of patients treated with rivaroxaban had increased values  of  urea  as  compared  with  6.41%  of  patients  treated  with  the  comparator.  Indeed,  further examination of the available data confirmed that mild or moderate elevations of serum creatinine are slightly more common amongst the rivaroxaban treated patients as compared to the enoxaparin treated patients.  There  seems  to  be  no  further  increase  after  2  weeks  of  treatment.  However,  the  observed increase  could  implicate  an  increased  risk  for  clinically  relevant  impairment  of  renal  function  in susceptible  patients  although  such  events  could  be  so  rare  that  they  are  not  easily  detected.  The extensive analyses of the pattern of creatinine laboratory derangements do not indicate any clinically relevant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  hip  studies.  In  addition,  there  is  no  clear signal that patients with elevations at baseline or early in the treatment period would deteriorate with further increase in the pooled analyses of the hip studies RECORD 1 and RECORD 2 with up to 5 weeks  treatment.  Patients  in  study  3  were  older  and  had  a  higher  incidence  of  elevated  creatinine values  at  baseline.  Further  analyses  on  the  pivotal  clinical  studies  regarding  these  aspects  will probably not bring any additional benefit. However, the safety concern cannot be neglected based on these analyses and it will be important to follow any clinically relevant renal adverse events through routine pharmacovigilance and in the planned post-marketing study, and to be reported in the future Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs).

Potential  abnormalities  of  liver  function  tests  were  intensively  monitored  and  occurred  with  a comparable or lower incidence in rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin treated subjects. In terms of elevations for all predefined ALT thresholds (ALT&gt; 1.5x ULN, ALT&gt; 2 x , ALT&gt; 3x ULN, ALT &gt; 5 x ULN, ALT &gt; 8 x ULN, ALT &gt; 10 x ULN and ALT &gt; 20 x ULN) numerically lower frequencies  were observed in rivaroxaban treated subjects as compared to enoxaparin treated subjects. Most of the ALT elevations are seen after surgery. ALT was used as a marker of hepatocellular injury as elevated levels are rather sensitive for toxic effects at the level of liver cell membrane. However, these events are not specific  for  e.g.  toxic  drug  effects.  Overall  from  the  data  no  clear  evidence  could  be  provided  that might indicate a significant difference with regard to hepatotoxicity for rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin. Nevertheless, in order to detect rare serious events surveillance of hepatic adverse events should be included in the future PSURs and in the planned post-marketing study.

The non clinical studies in rats and dogs might indicate some signal concerning a pancreatic toxicity (please see section Toxicology). Rivaroxaban seems to be highly distributed in the pancreas and thus, the potential pancreas enzyme abnormalities that could be observed during the clinical study program

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were of interest. Lipase and amylase elevations were seen only in a small number of patients included in the phase II and III programme. However, the rare cases of elevated enzyme levels, in some cases connected with abdominal complaints, did not provide the evidence for an association between upper abdominal pain and laboratory values indicating pancreatitis. Furthermore, in the patients included in the  phase  III  trials  non  drug  related  causes  for  pancreatitis  are  also  probable  and  could  not  be excluded.

There were no relevant differences between both treatment groups in terms of bilirubin abnormalities.

## · Safety in special populations

For  the  category  of  treatment-emergent  major  or  non-major  bleeding  events,  the  subgroup  analysis showed  a  trend  towards  higher  bleeding  event  rates  for  subjects  with  a  BMI&lt;18.5,  subjects  with decreased (&lt;50 kg) or increased (&gt;110 kg) body weight in the rivaroxaban group when compared with the enoxaparin group. Subjects older than 75 years and fragile subjects showed tendency towards a lower risk for bleeding events in rivaroxaban treated subjects compared to enoxaparin treated subjects. However, these trends are based on overall low event rates in both treatment groups.

Men  had  higher  bleeding  events  rates  of  treatment-emergent  major  or  non-major  bleeding  events compared  to  women,  and  had  higher  bleeding  rates  when  treated  with  rivaroxaban  compared  to enoxaparin.

There was no clinically relevant difference in the incidence and pattern of treatment-emergent adverse events between the two treatment groups within any of the four different race strata.

Overall, considering the presented subgroup analyses of bleeding events in the three phase III trials and the relevant data available for the comparator, there is no suggestion of the need to restrict the use of rivaroxaban according to gender, race, age or bodyweight.

## Patients with hepatic impairment

Patients  with  significant  liver  disease  (cirrhosis,  acute  clinical  or  chronic  active  hepatitis)  were excluded in from study participation in the RECORD studies as per exclusion criteria. However, data are available from patients with pre-operative elevated ALT and/or elevated bilirubin values.

The PK/PD changes in these subjects are markers for the severity of the underlying hepatic disease which  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  subsequent  increased  bleeding  risk  in  this  subject  group.  There  are appropriate  safety  warnings  adequately  included  in  the  SPC  and  further  analysis  of  clinical  data revealed only a slight numerical difference between the treatment groups for the elevations of hepatic enzymes in the patients with a history of hepatic disease. These differences are small and in most cases transient  of  a  non-progressive  nature.  Thus,  rivaroxaban  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  hepatic disease  which  is  associated  with  coagulopathy  and  a  clinically  relevant  bleeding  risk.  Furthermore, due to the fact that rivaroxaban exposure was increased 2.3 fold in cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic  impairment  (classified  as  Child  Pugh  B)  and  there  may  be  patients  with  moderate  hepatic impairment but without coagulopathy, these would  not be covered by the contraindication. Rivaroxaban may be used with caution in cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) if it is not associated with coagulopathy. The SPC reflects this information.

## Patients with renal impairment

Rivaroxaban  is  eliminated  by  both  metabolic  degradation  and  direct  renal  excretion  of  unchanged active compound. Thus, renal impairment is important for the safety of this product.

Results of the phase I studies indicate an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlating to the decrease in renal function, as assessed via creatinine clearance measurements. The studies conducted in VTE prevention  with  rivaroxaban  10  mg  od  restricted  inclusion  of  subjects  by  renal  function  due  to  the contraindications  for  enoxaparin.  The  phase  III  safety  population  of  4657  subjects  treated  with rivaroxaban included 25 subjects (0.5%) with a calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 ml/min and 298 (6%) of subjects with a calculated creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min. A higher number of  bleeding  events  was  seen  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  (&lt; 30 ml/min).  However,  the safety evaluation did not reveal any tendency for increased risk of bleeding in patients with CLcr 30-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

40 ml/min. Although the number of patients is fairly low, the PK data suggests only a modest increase in exposure in these patients. Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from the phase III studies and the available PK data indicate a modest increase in exposure in severe renal impairment. Patients with CLcr &lt;15 ml/min have not been studied. Higher exposure to the active substance might be expected in these patients. In summary, the SPC does not recommend the use of rivaroxaban in patients  with  creatinine  clearance &lt;15  ml/min. The  medicinal  product  is to  be  used  with  caution in patients with severe renal impairment  and  also  in patients with  moderate  renal  impairment concomitantly receiving other medication increasing rivaroxaban plasma concentrations.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  with  substrates  of  CYP  isozymes  due  to  rivaroxaban  comedication  are  rather  unlikely,  as  no  significant  influence  of  rivaroxaban  on  biotransformation reactions catalyzed by relevant cytochrome P450 isoforms was observed. The likelihood to observe clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  through  induction  of  CYP1A2,  3A4,  2B6  or  2C19  is considered to be very low.

To  confirm  the  absence  of  any  interaction  potential  by  rivaroxaban  co-medication  specific in  vivo drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  CYP3A4/  CYP2C9/P-gp  substrates  (midazolam, digoxin,  atorvastatin,  warfarin)  and  the  lack  of  interaction  potential  caused  by  rivaroxaban  as  comedication could be demonstrated in all cases.

The use of rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics  such  as  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole  and  posaconazole  or  the  HIV protease inhibitors, since these medicinal  products  have  a significant  impact  on  rivaroxaban disposition. This is adequately reflected in the product SPC.

During the concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), opioids, statins, nitrates, platelet aggregation inhibitors or acetylic salicylic acid, no increase in the bleeding risk beyond that seen with enoxaparin was observed in the phase III studies. However, care must be taken when coadministering rivaroxaban and other anti-coagulants due to the possible increase of bleeding.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The total  number of adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation was higher in the pooled active  comparator study arms. This was evident for all most frequently occurring events leading to discontinuation,  i.e.  vascular  disorders,  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders,  injuries, poisoning, and procedural complications, gastrointestinal disorders and cardiac disorders. The pattern of adverse events leading to discontinuation in the rivaroxaban groups does not implicate any specific safety concerns.

During the phase III studies discontinuation rates for any reason from all randomised subjects were similar with 10.9% in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 12.1% in the enoxaparin/placebo treatment group. The same situation was seen for the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, which were 3.1% in the rivaroxaban treatment group and 4.0% in the enoxaparin treatment group until day 12 ± 2 and  3.8%  in  the  rivaroxaban  treatment  group vs 4.5%  in  the  enoxaparin  treatment  group  with  the extended  5-week  treatment  period.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  in  the  rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin group with an incidence ≥ 0.2% were atrial fibrillation (0.1% vs 0.2%), nausea (0.2% vs 0.3%),  PE (0.2% vs 0.3%)  and  DVT  (0.1% vs 0.4%).  From  the  preferred  terms  with  an  incidence ≥ 0.2%  the  data  indicated  a  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  for  DVT.  Overall,  these  data show  that  the  discontinuation  rates  due  to  adverse  events  during  extended  treatment  (5-week treatment) are low and comparable between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin treatment and do not seem to contribute significantly to rivaroxaban discontinuation.

| Haemorrhage                | Routine pharmacovigilance activities Additional information from ongoing trials Additional information from the post-marketing observational study (XAMOS) in 15000 patients and drug utilisation database study/studies | Contraindication in SmPC section 4.3 'Contraindication' \"Clinically significant active bleeding. Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 5.2).\" Warning in SmPC section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' \"Haemorrhagic risk \"Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are to be carefully monitored for signs of bleeding complications after initiation of treatment. This may be done by regular physical examination of the patients, close observation of the surgical wound drainage and periodic measurements of haemoglobin. Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.\" Warning in SmPC section 4.5 'Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions' \"CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of rivaroxaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day [od]) or ritonavir (600 mg twice a day [bid]) led to a 2.6 fold / 2.5 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban AUC and a 1.7 fold / 1.6 fold increase in mean rivaroxaban Cmax, with significant increases in pharmacodynamic effects which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of Xarelto is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole or HIV protease inhibitors. These active substances are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (see section 4.4). Fluconazole is expected to have less effect on rivaroxaban exposure and can be co-administered with caution. Anticoagulants After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with rivaroxaban (10 mg single dose) an additive effect on anti- Factor Xa activity was observed without any additional effects on clotting tests (PT, aPTT). Enoxaparin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. Due to the increased bleeding risk care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with any other anticoagulants (see section |

NSAIDs/platelet aggregation inhibitors No clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of rivaroxaban and 500 mg naproxen. Nevertheless, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when rivaroxaban was co-administered with 500 mg acetylsalicylic acid. Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg maintenance dose) did not show a pharmacokinetic interaction but a relevant increase in bleeding time was observed in a subset of patients which was not correlated to platelet aggregation, P-selectin or GPIIb/IIIa receptor levels. Care is to be taken if patients are treated concomitantly with NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid) and platelet aggregation inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk (see section 4.4).\" Haemorrhage is listed in section 4.8 of the SPC   |

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The non clinical pharmacological programme provided a good characterisation of the pharmacological properties  of  rivaroxaban.  Pharmacodynamic  receptor  binding  and  enzyme  inhibition  investigations adequately demonstrate that rivaroxaban is a selective FXa inhibitor and that pharmacological effects due to interaction with unrelated receptors or enzymes are unlikely.

Inhibition  of  FXa  leads  to  secondary  changes  in  coagulation  parameters  such  as  aPTT  and  PT. Efficacy was demonstrated in various thrombotic models and in general there appears to be a dose margin between the antithrombotic effect and the risk for increased bleeding. Safety pharmacology studies do not suggest any acute adverse exaggerated pharmacological effects of rivaroxaban, except bleeding and this was confirmed in the clinical environment.

Rivaroxaban  has  a  structural  similarity  to  the  antibiotic  linezolid  and  therefore  might  exhibit  a potential  for  inhibition  of  the  bacterial  protein  synthesis.  An  additional,  related,  concern  is  the possibility  of  mitochondrial  toxicity,  since  linezolid  is  known  to  inhibit  mitochondrial  protein synthesis  leading  to  a  loss  of  mitochondrial  function.  No  antibacterial  activity  was  shown  for rivaroxaban  ,  however,  the  potential  risk  for  mitochondrial  toxicity  is  not  ruled  out.  This  does  not represent  a  considerable  risk  for  the  approved  short-term  indication.    In  order  to  provide  further clarifications, mitochondrial toxicity of rivaroxaban is planned to be addressed in further nonclinical investigation, which is particularly relevant in case of considering an extension to long-term treatment in the future.

The drug interaction investigations did not indicate any specific concerns. Some additive effects on bleeding  were  observed  in  concomitant  administration  of  rivaroxaban  with  antihaemostatic  drugs. There is a potential for the recombinant factor VII to serve as rivaroxaban antidotes, but this has not been confirmed in clinical settings.

The pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile of rivaroxaban are well characterised.

The  increased  incidence  of  pancreatic  lesions  in  animals  and  adverse  effects  on  liver,  including changes  of  hepatic  enzyme  and  bilirubin  levels  and  incidence  of  liver  necrosis,  observed  in  non clinical studies are thought to be found in the human trials, e.g. increased lipase, amylase and hepatic enzyme  levels.  Furthermore,  some  teratogenic  effects  were  seen  at  clinically  relevant  exposure affecting  mainly  skeleton,  heart  and  vessels.  In  addition,  true  placenta  and  teratogenic  effects  of rivaroxaban cannot be excluded. Reduced viability of the offsprings was observed at the doses that were toxic to dams. Pregnancy and breastfeeding during rivaroxaban administration are contraindicated. The relevant information on placental toxicity, embryofoetal toxicity and teratogenicity are included in the SPC.

The environmental risk of rivaroxaban was assessed and the CHMP concluded that there is no need for a phase II assessment in frame of the currently planned use of rivaroxaban.

## Clinical pharmacology

Rivaroxaban has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile with several elimination pathways (about 36% renal excretion, 32% CYP-mediated metabolism and 14% hydrolysis) and a fairly small risk for major increases  in  exposure.  Rivaroxaban  exposure  is  increased  to  a  significant  extent  in  patients  with moderate hepatic impairment and in patients receiving concomitant medication with dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.  Data  are  lacking  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  associated  with  impaired haemostasis  and  in  end  stage  renal  disease  patients  (creatinine  clearance  &lt;15  ml/min).  Appropriate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

warnings  and  recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  SPC  for  patients  at  risk  for  increased exposure.  The  applicant  has  ongoing  activities  to  further  investigate  the  possibility  to  develop  a laboratory test that could be used for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding.

## Efficacy

The dose finding, phase II studies in VTE prevention setting were performed with the doses ranging from 2.5 mg bid to 30 mg bid and a with the doses range from 5 mg od to 40 mg od. Data indicated a target  therapeutic  window of  5  mg  to  20  mg  total daily  dose in the prevention of VTE after  major orthopedic surgery. Total daily doses of 20 mg and beyond were associated with a higher incidence of bleeding events and there was only an evidence for small differences in efficacy between the 5 mg bid and the 10 mg od dosing regimens. Higher compliance to treatment a possible better safety profile of the  10 mg od  dosing  regimen  in  comparison  with  the  5  mg  bid  regimen  can  be  expected.  Further investigations confirmed that the optimal net clinical benefit (avoidance of major VTE and/or major bleeding)  was  observed  in  the  10  mg  od  dose.  The  use  of  the  once-daily  dose  of  10  mg  was  thus adequately  justified  and  was  selected  for  investigations  in  phase  III  studies  in  the  VTE  prevention indication.

The pivotal phase III studies had a conventional design for new agents within this therapeutic area. Two  independent  comparative  studies,  one  in  hip  surgery  and  one  in  knee  surgery  have  been performed. The study populations were representative of a target population undergoing elective major orthopaedic  surgery  of  the  lower  limbs.  The  rivaroxaban  regimens  were  superior  to  the  well established enoxaparin regimens with regard to the composite primary efficacy parameter (venographically detected total VTEs, symptomatic VTEs and death) and the results were supported by different sensitivity analyses. Superiority was also demonstrated for a more stringent endpoint of major VTEs consistent  with  the  CHMP  guidance  recommendations,  excluding  asymptomatic  distal VTEs). As expected, the rates of symptomatic VTE events were low and these results were consistent with the primary efficacy results.

A supportive study comparing a 5 week prophylactic rivaroxaban regimen with a conventional 2 week enoxaparin regimen in elective hip surgery demonstrated superiority of the rivaroxaban regimen.

Hip fracture patients were not included in the clinical study programme. The proposed indication was therefore found to be not acceptable by the CHMP. It is expected that rivaroxaban would be effective in  the  hip  fracture  surgery.  There  are  higher  VTE  rates  in  hip  fracture  surgery  as  compared  to  the elective hip surgery. Marked differences in the overall mortality rates with higher mortality among the fracture patients and a clear tendency to the higher incidence of fatal PEs are also relevant for this patient  population.  As  a  group,  fracture  patients  are  of  advanced  age  and  more  fragile,  and  have  a larger risk of concomitant diseases. Rivaroxaban represents a fairly new pharmacological concept and some  uncertainties  with  regard  to  the  safety  of  the  drug  when  used  in  the  routine  clinical  setting remain. Specific controlled efficacy and safety data from patients with hip fracture were not available. Given the different risk profile for these patients, the current indication of rivaroxaban was restricted by the CHMP to adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban is not recommended for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.

## Safety

The  safety  profile  of  rivaroxaban  in  the  proposed  dose  for  up  to  5  weeks  treatment  has  been  well characterised and no major safety concerns have been identified so far. A relatively large number of subjects were exposed to rivaroxaban. Safety population in phase III studies comprises 4657 subjects randomized to rivaroxaban and 4692 subjects randomized to enoxaparin. Since the product is currently proposed for an exposure not longer than 35 days, safety data with regard to long-term exposure is limited.  Only  limited  data  concerning  the  exposure  of  &gt;35±4  days  is  available  at  this  time  point, however, no different safety profile became obvious during assessment of this data in comparison to short term treatment (&lt;35±4 days).

Safety  aspects  such  as  bleeding  events,  cardiovascular  events  and  liver  enzyme  elevations  were analysed and assessed. The main safety endpoint during phase II and III studies was the incidence of treatment emergent major bleeding observed not later than 2 days after last intake of study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in phase III controlled clinical studies in  both treatment groups during both treatment periods were gastrointestinal disorders, in particular nausea, vomiting, and constipation; general disorders, in particular pyrexia; procedural complications such as postoperative anaemia and procedural pain. The most frequently reported serious treatmentemergent,  drug-related  adverse  events  in  both  treatment  groups  during  both  treatment  periods  were increased  ALT,  operative  haemorrhage,  vascular  disorders,  and  haematoma.  No  differences  of relevance concerning type of adverse events between all phases of the clinical trial program became obvious.

Similar  rates  and  profiles  of  discontinuation  of  treatment  because  of  adverse  events  between rivaroxaban  treatment  and  treatment  with  the  comparator  enoxaparin  were  observed.  Overall  death rate  was  within  the  range  expected from  literature  and  no  specific safety  signal  could  be identified form  the  assessment  of  deaths  in  this  application.  Haemorrhage  (surgical  and  extra-surgical  site haemorrhages) is considered an identified risk. The incidence rate of major bleeding was comparable between  the  two  treatment  groups,  but  the  bleeding  overall  events  were  numerically  higher  in  the rivaroxaban  group  in  comparison  to  enoxaparin.  The  potential  for  increased  bleeding  risk  for rivaroxaban still exists, especially in cases of incidental overdose or inappropriate off-label use. Such issues  are  addressed  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  There is  a  trend towards  higher  bleeding  event rates  for  subjects  outside  of  normal  body  weight  range  when  compared  with  enoxaparin  treatment. Elderly  (&gt;  75  years)  and  fragile  subjects  tended  to  have  a  lower  risk  for  bleeding  events  with rivaroxaban,  but  in  both  cases,  the  observations  are  based  on  overall  low  event  rates  and  no  dose adjustment was needed. At present no specific antidote is available for rivaroxaban.

Overall  from  the  presented  subgroups  analyses  of  bleeding  events  in  the  three  phase  III  trials,  no evidence  was  found,  to  restrict  the  use  of  rivaroxaban  10  mg  od  according  to  gender,  age  and bodyweight.

In patients with different stages of renal impairment an increase in rivaroxaban exposure correlating to the  decrease in renal  function  was  observed.  Furthermore,  a  higher  number  of bleeding  events  was seen in subjects with severe renal impairment. Therefore, as advised in the SPC, rivaroxaban is not to be used in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;15 ml/min and must be used with caution in patients with  severe  renal  impairment  as  well  as  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  concomitantly receiving other medication increasing rivaroxaban plasma concentrations.

No specific safety signal concerning cardiovascular safety was derived from the clinical data.

In order to avoid a potential increase in the pharmacodynamic effect, rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients  with  hepatic  disease  associated  with  coagulopathy  and  a  clinically  relevant  bleeding  risk. Caution is advised in patients with other hepatic disease of moderate grade. Safety recommendations with regard to patients with hepatic impairment are reflected in the SPC. The use of rivaroxaban in cirrhotic  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  resulted  in  an  increased  drug  exposure  in comparison with healthy volunteers.

Observations of transient increases of serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin as well as increases in serum lipase  and  amylase  in  patients  undergoing  major  orthopaedic  surgery  are  reflected  in  the  adverse reaction  section  of  the  SPC.  In  most  cases,  these  were  asymptomatic  elevations.  Single  cases  of symptomatic liver impairment and non-serious pancreatitis have been reported in the clinical studies. There is, however, no clear evidence that rivaroxaban was the causative agent in these cases.

Rivaroxaban is not recommended for treatment of patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with  azole-antimycotics  such  as  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole  and  posaconazole  or  the HIV  protease  inhibitors  due  to  their  interactions  with  cytochrome  P450  and  P-gp  resulting  in  a potential to increase bleeding risk. Furthermore, care must  be taken when  co-administering rivaroxaban and other anti-coagulants due to the possible increase of bleeding.

From  the  safety  database  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  included  in  the Summary of Product Characteristics[0] based on a pre-defined algorithm.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these concerns.

## · User consultation

User  testing  of  the  Package  Leaflet  was  performed  in  August  and  September  2007  in  English. Following  a  pilot  round  the  Package  Leaflet  was  tested  in  two  test  rounds,  with  a  total  of  20  test persons (healthy volunteers and orthopaedic surgery patients with even distribution of gender, age 5079).  The  questionnaire  covered  the  key  safety  issues  of  the  PL.  The  methodology  followed  the Readability guideline. The PL was revised following a pilot round as well as the test rounds 1 and 2. Considering the overall results of the two rounds the result is in line with the requirements.

In conclusion, the user testing is judged acceptable.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  clinical  development  programme  and  the  reduced  occurrence  of thromboembolic  events  in  subjects  treated  with  rivaroxaban,  the  number  of  patients  in  need  of therapeutic  anticoagulant  treatment  in  the  target  population  may  be  reduced  by  approximately  50% when compared to the approved enoxaparin regimen. Considering the risks and practical difficulties with such treatment, this reduction is considered to be beneficial. There is a potential for rivaroxaban to  further  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  venous  thromboembolism  related  complications.  It  is important to note that hip fracture patients were not included in the clinical study programme and this is  reflected  in  the  wording  of  the  amended,  restricted  indication  and  appropriately  addressed  in  the SPC.

Structural similarity of rivaroxaban  with  linezolid have  raised a concern  regarding  potential mitochondrial  toxicity  of  rivaroxaban.  Although  non-clinical  studies  cannot  completely  rule  out  a potential for risk for mitochondrial damage of rivaroxaban, in vitro -studies addressing mitochondrial protein  synthesis  showed  that  the  potential  for  mitochondrial  toxicity  might  be  low  and  thus  not expected to be of concern for the currently approved short-term treatment with rivaroxaban. However, any mitochondrial toxicity is of greater concern if the product is to be used long-term. Therefore, due to limitations of the in vitro study, this issue will be explored further in nonclinical setting specifically addressing mitochondrial toxicity.

Rivaroxaban exposure is increased to a significant extent in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and in patients receiving concomitant medication with dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Data are not available from patients with hepatic impairment associated with impaired haemostasis and in end stage renal disease patients (creatinine clearance &lt;15 ml/min). There are, however, proposed activities to further investigate the possibility to develop a laboratory test that could be used in routine clinical setting for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding. The results from these activities will be provided to the CHMP in frame of a follow-up measure. If possible, appropriate recommendations in the SPC including methodology for monitoring patients at increased risk for bleeding might be needed.

No major safety concerns have been identified. Prophylaxis with rivaroxaban might be associated with a slightly higher bleeding tendency than the approved enoxaparin regimen but no major differences are apparent at this point in time. The number of serious bleedings did not differ substantially between the treatment groups in the clinical studies. No clear signals for hepatic or renal adverse events induced by rivaroxaban have been identified. However, such adverse events will be kept under close surveillance in the post-marketing observational study and in the future Periodic Safety Update Reports.

The benefit/risk balance was considered to be positive by the CHMP. An oral treatment without the need  for  dose  titration  or  monitoring  would  represent  an  important  alternative  to  the  conventional subcutaneous  prophylactic  therapy.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  rivaroxaban  therapy  in  proposed doses  is  more  effective  than  the  approved  enoxaparin  regimen  possibly  at  the  price  of  a  slightly increased bleeding tendency.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Xarelto in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
