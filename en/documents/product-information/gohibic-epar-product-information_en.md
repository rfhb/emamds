## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Gohibic 200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each vial contains 200 mg of vilobelimab in 20 mL.

Each mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 10 mg of vilobelimab. After dilution, each mL of solution contains 3.2 mg of vilobelimab.

Vilobelimab is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal IgG4 antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.

## Excipient(s) with known effect

Each vial contains 74.2 mg of sodium.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). Clear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Gohibic is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with SARS-CoV2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are receiving systemic corticosteroids as part of Standard of Care and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

## Posology

The recommended dose is 800 mg administered by intravenous infusion after dilution, for a maximum of 6 (six) doses over the treatment period as described below.

Treatment should be started within 48 hours of intubation (Day 1) followed by administration on Days 2, 4, 8, 15 and 22 as long as the patient is hospitalised, even if discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Gohibic in children under 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## For intravenous use after dilution.

Once diluted, the solution must be administered as an infusion over 30 to 60 minutes. Gohibic should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other medicinal products. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of Gohibic with other medicinal products.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions

There is a possibility for hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions, to occur as the product is a monoclonal antibody. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnoea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and shivering.

If symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, administration should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment and/or supportive care should be initiated.

Appropriate medical treatment and/or supportive care should be administered if an infusion-related reaction occurs.

## Infections other than COVID-19

Cases of infections have been reported while using vilobelimab (see section 4.8).

A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with vilobelimab should undergo diagnostic investigations. Appropriate treatment should be initiated and the patient should be closely monitored.

The risk of vilobelimab-associated infections may be higher in elderly patients (&gt;65 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains 296.8 mg sodium per dose of 4 vials, equivalent to 15% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. Vilobelimab is not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of vilobelimab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity

(see section 5.3).

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vilobelimab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether vilobelimab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, vilobelimab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

Non-clinical data do not suggest any effect on male or female fertility under treatment with vilobelimab (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Vilobelimab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions are pneumonia (21.7%), herpes simplex (6.3%), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (5.7%), and sepsis (5.1%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety of vilobelimab has been evaluated in a placebo-controlled, randomised study in which 175 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were treated. However, the very small number of patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the clinical trial (7 in the vilobelimab group and 9 in the placebo group) represents a limitation for the characterisation of the safety of vilobelimab in this subset of patients. Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1.  Adverse reactions

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific antidote for overdose with vilobelimab. If overdose with vilobelimab occurs, the treatment should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, complement inhibitors, ATC code: L04AJ10

## Mechanism of action

Vilobelimab is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal IgG4 antibody that is a specific inhibitor of the soluble human complement component C5a.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The reduction of C5a plasma concentrations in response to vilobelimab treatment has been evaluated in the PANAMO phase III study. In general, baseline C5a levels were elevated in these patients compared to mean values found in healthy individuals and treatment with vilobelimab reduced the mean baseline C5a levels.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of vilobelimab has been studied in the PANAMO phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicentre trial, evaluating vilobelimab for the treatment of COVID19 in adult (≥ 18 years) patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)). A total of 369 patients were randomised in the study: 178 patients in the VILO group and 191 patients in the Placebo group. Efficacy analyses were based on 368 patients, 177 in the vilobelimab group and 191 in the placebo group. The mean age of participation was 56 years (range: 22 to 81 years) and 68.5% were male. Common co-existing medical conditions included hypertension (46.2%), obesity (40.8%) and diabetes (29.6%) in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overall study population. Corticosteroids and antithrombotic agents were used concomitantly in 96.7% and 98.4% of patients respectively. All patients were mechanically ventilated and three patients in each arm were on ECMO. Additional demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in the PANAMO phase III trial are provided in Table 2.

## Paediatric population

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with Gohibic in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Other information

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.

The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The PK of vilobelimab has not been extensively studied in COVID-19 patients. In the PANAMO phase III trial (n = 81 patients), mean vilobelimab plasma trough concentrations on Day 8 ranged from 21,800 to 303,000 ng/mL (147 to 2,040 nM) with a geometric mean of 138,000 ng/mL (929 nM).

## Distribution

Mean (s.d.) volume of distribution after a single 4 mg/kg dose to healthy volunteers was 0.0833 (0.0136) L/kg.

## Biotransformation

No data are available on the metabolism of vilobelimab in humans. Vilobelimab is a monoclonal antibody and expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via non-specific catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

In healthy volunteers, target mediated disposition was apparent as mean vilobelimab clearance decreased with dose from 0.06 mL/min/kg after administration of 0.02 mg/kg to 0.02 and 0.01 mL/min/kg after administration of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. Mean terminal half-life (t1/2) was found to be 101.3 hours and 94.9 hours after single vilobelimab doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of vilobelimab in paediatric COVID-19 patients has not been studied.

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of vilobelimab in patients with renal impairment has not been formally studied. In general, due to its high molecular weight vilobelimab is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of vilobelimab in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. Vilobelimab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, therefore changes in hepatic function are not expected to have any effect on elimination.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

There were no adverse effects associated with vilobelimab in conventional repeated dose and pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. Pharmacokinetic data in humans are insufficient to estimate the safety margins provided by these studies.

No specific studies were conducted to evaluate potential effects of vilobelimab on fertility. There were no adverse effects on male or female reproductive parameters or organs in monkeys treated for 13-weeks or 26-weeks, respectively.

Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis studies with vilobelimab have not been conducted.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Gohibic 200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion vilobelimab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Gohibic is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given Gohibic
3. How Gohibic will be given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Gohibic
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Gohibic is and what it is used for

Gohibic contains the active substance vilobelimab. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies.

Gohibic is used to treat adults with acute severe breathing problems caused by SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) who are on a ventilator (a machine to help a patient breathe) with or without ECMO (life support that can help a person whose lungs and heart aren't working correctly). Gohibic is used in patients who are already treated with corticosteroid medicines.

Monoclonal antibodies like vilobelimab are types of proteins that can attach to certain targets in the body. Vilobelimab attaches to a protein called C5a to blocks its action. C5a is a part of the so-called complement system, a part of the immune system (the body's natural defences). High levels of C5a may cause damage to lung tissue, as is seen in patients with severe COVID-19. By blocking the C5a protein, Gohibic helps prevent such damage, which allows the lungs to get oxygen into the blood.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Gohibic

## You must not receive Gohibic

- if you are allergic to vilobelimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Your doctor or nurse will monitor you during treatment with Gohibic to check if you have:

- allergic reactions or infusion-related reactions

Your doctor may need to stop treatment with Gohibic if you have symptoms, such as:

- -low or high blood pressure
- -rapid or slow heartbeat
- -difficulty breathing
- -lack of oxygen in body tissues

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -fever
- -chills
- -serious allergic reactions which cause swelling of the face or throat
- -rash
- -nausea
- -vomiting

## Children and adolescents

Gohibic is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as it has not been studied in this group.

## Other medicines and Gohibic

Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice.

Gohibic is not recommended in pregnant women, as it has not been tested in this group.

It is not known if vilobelimab passes into human breast milk and a risk to the baby cannot be excluded. Your doctor will decide whether you should stop breast-feeding while you are using Gohibic.

## Driving and using machines

Gohibic is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive and use machines.

## Gohibic contains sodium

This medicine contains 296.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose of 4 vials. This is equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

## 3. How Gohibic will be given

Gohibic will be given as an infusion (drip) into a vein by a doctor or nurse, for 30 to 60 minutes.

The recommended dose of this medicine is 800 mg (4 vials), diluted into the infusion solution. Treatment should start (day 1) within 48 hours after you are put on a ventilator . If you are still in the hospital, more doses are then given on days 2, 4, 8, 15 and 22.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
