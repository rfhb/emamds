## 1. Introduction

Based on reports received during the period of review and the strong causal relationship to CELVAPAN as well as continued adverse reaction reports for the events of anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity and  paraesthesia,  it  was  previously  recommended  in  the  Addendum  to  the  Clinical  Overview  and Addendum to the Clinical Summary of Safety, both dated 02 December 2009, to include these terms into the SmPC.

•

In  addition  to  continued  reports  for  anaphylaxis,  a  second  S-PSUR  (covering  17  November  2009 through 14 December 2009, report dated 23 December 2009) identified new safety concerns including convulsions, pain in extremity and influenza-like symptoms. It is therefore recommended to include these terms in the SmPC, Section 4.8. 2. Clinical safety aspects · Influenza-like illness The MAH proposes to amend the SPC and add the term 'influenza-like illness' (ILI) to section 4.8. ILI is also labelled for other pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines. The proposal is endorsed by CHMP. · Pain in extremity The most frequently reported unlisted adverse reaction in the 2 nd  sPSUR was pain in extremity (n=22). Therefore, the company proposed to label the term. However it was unclear whether the pain in extremity is an injection site reaction or whether other limbs could be involved. The MAH clarified that up to 11 January 2010 (data lock point of the 3rd S-PSUR) the MAH received 79 (47 serious, 32 non-serious) reports involving pain in extremity; thereof, 27 cases were reported for Celvapan  and  52  for  an  unspecified  H1N1  vaccine.  Sixty-eight  cases  were  reported  in  adults,  5  in children and in 6 cases the age is unknown. The MedDRA LLTs were: · Pain in arm; Painful arm: n=46 · Aches and pains in legs; Pain of lower extremities: n=9 · Aching pain in hands, forearms and elbows; Painful hand: n=3 · Pain in extremity, Aching in limb: n=21 The vast majority of reports involve 'pain in arm.' In only 17 cases was painful arm specified as the injection  site  arm;  in  all  other  reports  the  injection  site  and/or  the  concerned  arm  were  unknown. However, based on the latency (one day to two days) between vaccination and onset of pain reported for these cases, an injection site reaction radiating into the injected arm seems to be most likely. The MAH proposed to further specify the term in the SPC as follows: 'MUSCULOSKELATAL  AND  CONNECTIVE  TISSUE  DISORDERS:  Pain  in  extremity  (in  the  majority  of cases reported as pain in the injection site arm).' The CHMP endorsed this proposal. Convulsion In the 2 nd  sPSUR 4 reports that might be indicative for a possible convulsion have been described. Two reports  meet  the  Brighton  level  1  of  diagnostic  certainty.  The  remaining  2  reports  were  already diagnosed as convulsions by the physicians with no detailed description. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The first case concerns a patient with unknown age and gender who most likely experienced immediately following Celvapan vaccination a convulsive syncope.
- The second case refers to a 41 year old woman who developed chills and fever and vertigo when walking following vaccination. She collapsed and experienced tonic convulsions. A herpes zoster was diagnosed, which might explain the symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The  third  case  refers  to  a  21  year  old  female  patient  with  a  medical  history  of  epilepsy (seizure-free for two  years)  who  experienced  dizziness,  pallor  and  convulsion  on  the vaccination day. Concomitant medication included lamotrigine.
- The fourth case refers to a 33 year old male patient with a medical history of epilepsy and mental disability who experienced a convulsion 24 hours after Celvapan vaccination.

In summary one case reflects most likely a convulsive syncope and one case most likely has an alternative cause (herpes zoster). Of some concern are the two cases of convulsions in patients with seizure disorders in a short temporal association with vaccination.

The company proposed to add the term 'convulsion' to the SPC. This term apparently includes febrile and  non-febrile  seizures.  In  contrast  to  febrile  seizures  which  are  associated  in  particular  with childhood vaccination, there is at present no evidence that vaccination can cause non-febrile seizures or can trigger the re-occurrence of seizure activity in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders. The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  present  a  detailed  cumulative  review  of  all  case  reports  of seizures in patients with a known history of seizure disorders following Celvapan administration. The  MAH  clarified  that  a  narrow  SMQ  query  for  convulsions  (data  lock  point  of  the  3rd  S-PSUR) revealed 9 reports (6 for Celvapan and 3 for an unspecified H1N1 vaccine). Febrile convulsion: 2 reports in 1-year-old children (1 for Celvapan and 1 for the unspecified H1N1 vaccine). The events occurred with a reasonable temporal association to the vaccination and due to lack of any alternative aetiologies. Additional cases of febrile convulsions are described in the overview of data from clinical trials below. Non-febrile convulsion in patients with medical history of epilepsy: 3 reports (2 with Celvapan, 1 with unspecified H1N1 vaccine) concerning patients (aged 21 years to 56 years)  with  a  medical  history  of  epilepsy  and  concomitant  antiepileptic  treatment.  In  one  of  these cases, the patient had been seizure-free for 2 years prior to vaccination, suggesting good control of underlying epilepsy. In the fourth case involving Celvapan, the 3-year-old patient had a family history of epilepsy only. In those four cases, the latency between the vaccination and the occurrence of the event ranged between hours and 2 days. For one case an epileptic aura without convulsion that occurred on the vaccination date was reported. No further information with respect to severity and type of epilepsy, frequency of convulsions or compliance to antiepileptic treatment was provided. Non-febrile convulsion in patients with no relevant medical history: 3 cases (2 with Celvapan, 1 with the unspecified H1N1 vaccine). In 2 cases the event occurred on the vaccination day and no alternative aetiologies were provided. In one case the convulsions occurred one day after vaccination and concomitant dermatological herpes zoster infection was diagnosed. However, CT of head and lumbar puncture did not show evidence for encephalitis due to endogenous reactivation of herpes zoster. Upon  request  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  expected  background  incidence  of  fatal  and  non-fatal seizures in epileptic patients, based on available databases and medical literature, the MAH provided no background data and argued that due to the diversity of the clinical manifestations of epilepsy and lack  of  consensus  on  background  incidence  of  seizures  in  epileptic  patients,  no  valid  background incidence can be provided. The MAH was further requested to provide an analysis of the 'observed vs expected' incidence of nonfatal  seizures  in  epileptic  patients.  In  the  absence  of  accurate  exposure  data,  this  analysis  should incorporate appropriately justified assumptions/estimates on exposure Medicinal product no longer authorised

Baxter clarified that although observed to expected comparisons may provide insight regarding causal versus coincidental events, such comparisons are limited by a number of factors, including incomplete reporting/ascertainment,  uncertain  exposure  data  with  potential  to  falsely  dilute  signals  (where distribution data is used as a surrogate), lack of standard hazard windows, and lack of consensus on appropriate background rates for populations of interest. Of primary concern is the potential for false negative  results  in  the  comparison  of  a  reporting  rate  to  a  background  incidence  rate  to  confirm  a signal arising from qualitative data review.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on these limitations, the MAH, regarding the decision to add convulsions (febrile and nonfebrile) to  the  CCDS,  has  been  relying  on  evidence  from  the  medical  review  of  individual  case  reports (qualitative assessment) rather than on the proposed observed vs expected analysis.

The MAH presented an overview of any relevant data from clinical trials of Celvapan (including any H5N1 studies) and stated that no reports concerning convulsions are available.

The clinical database size includes:

· H5N1 clinical trials: 3576 subjects (3116 between 18 and 59 years old, and 460 aged 60 years and above) · Ongoing H1N1 clinical trials: adults &gt; 18 years of age (406 subjects, all of whom have already received  the  second  vaccination)  and  children  and  adolescents  aged  between  6  months  and  17 years  (101  subjects  aged  9-17  years,  100  subjects  aged  3-8  years,  100  subjects  aged  6-12 months and 39 subjects aged 6-11 months; all except 3 subjects from the youngest age group have received the second vaccination) · Ongoing observational study: As  of  February  1,  2010,  there  have  been  3000  subjects  enrolled.  Follow-up  information  from approximately  1100  subjects  is  presently  available.  3  reports  concerning  convulsions  have  been received: Two reporting febrile convulsions, which occurred in children, and one reporting an epileptic seizure in an adult subject. The febrile convulsions were reported in a 9-year-old child without a history of previous convulsions and in an approximately 3-year-old child with a history of prematurity and repeated febrile convulsions since February 2009. The interval between vaccination and onset of the adverse experience was 2 and 9 days, respectively. In both cases causality was assessed as possibly related by the investigator. The epileptic seizure occurred in an approximately 50-year-old male with history of a haemorrhagic insult 2 years ago, who has suffered since then from dizziness and memory loss. After this epileptic seizure the subject was admitted to hospital, where a second epileptic seizure, followed by postictal amnesia,  occurred.  In  addition,  according  to  the  subject,  he  has  a  history  of  an  abnormal  EEG; however, no epileptic  seizures  were  reported  in  his  medical  history.  The  epileptic  seizures  occurred approximately one month after the Celvapan vaccination and causality was assessed as unlikely related by the investigator. The MAH clarified that no incidences of 'convulsions' were recorded in any of the H5N1 non-clinical toxicology studies. Discussion: The  term  'Convulsion'  is  already  labelled  in  the  section  experience  with  interpandemic  trivalent vaccines. The evidence for this is unknown. The MAH proposes to label febrile and non-febrile convulsions on the basis of a few single case reports: 4 case reports with febrile convulsions (thereof 1 with unknown brand) and 8 case reports with nonfebrile-convulsions (thereof 2 cases with unknown brand and one case with an un-plausible temporal relationship).  3/8  cases  concerned  patients  with  a  history  of  epilepsy.  For  several  cases  relevant medical information is lacking. A single case assessment of the causal association between vaccination and the event is not possible. There  is  biological  evidence  that  childhood  vaccination  may  be  associated  with  febrile  convulsion. However, there is no biological evidence so far that non-febrile convulsions are linked to vaccination. In  the  SPC  guideline  in  section  4.8  it  is  stated  that  all  adverse  reactions  from  clinical  trials,  postmarketing studies or spontaneous reports attributed to the medicinal product with at least reasonable suspicion should be labelled. The MAH has not presented data in this respect. Labelling of non-febrile convulsion doesn't appear to be justified from a scientific point of view. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore CHMP concluded to include the term 'febrile convulsions' into the SmPC.
