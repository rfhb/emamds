## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Nuedexta is a fixed combination of two known active substances, dextromethorphan and quinidine 23  mg/9  mg  &amp;  15  mg/9  mg  (corresponding  to  dextromethorphan  hydrobromide  and  quinidine sulfate 30 mg/10 mg &amp; 20 mg/10 mg). Both individual components are used separately for other indications at higher doses: dextromethorphan as an antitussive (120 mg/day) and quinidine for treating arrhythmias (typically 200 mg to 1200mg). The CNS-active substance is dextromethorphan;  the  product  concept  is  to  include  quinidine  to  inhibit  the  2D6-mediated metabolic conversion of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan, therefore increasing the plasma levels of dextromethorphan to increase its therapeutic potential. This is equivalent at the extreme (i.e. at high doses of quinidine) to converting extensive metabolisers of 2D6 to poor metabolisers.  The great  majority  of  the  European  population  (88%)  are  known  to  be  2D6  extensive  metabolisers (EM).    Poor  metabolisers  are  the  second  most  frequently  occurring  genotype  (8%)  in  Europe, followed by intermediate and ultra fast metabolisers. 2.2. Quality aspects The  finished  product  is  presented  as  immediate  release,  solid  oral-dosage  form  in  hard  gelatin capsules containing dextromethorphan and quinidine as active ingredients. Nuedexta is available in two strengths:  23  mg  dextromethorphan  /  9  mg  quinidine  (corresponding  to  30  mg  dextromethorphan hydrobromide / 10 mg quinidine sulfate)  15  mg  dextromethorphan  /  9  mg  quinidine  (corresponding  to  20  mg  dextromethorphan hydrobromide / 10 mg quinidine sulfate). The regulatory expression of the strength of Nuedexta is always as per the active moiety of its active  ingredients.  However,  throughout  this  report  reference  is  made  interchangeably  to  the quantity of the active ingredients as per their active moiety (23 mg / 9 mg and 15 mg / 9 mg) or salt forms (30 mg / 10 mg and 20 mg / 10 mg). The full qualitative composition is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Dextromethorphan 23 mg /quinidine 9 mg capsules are brick red gelatin capsules, size 1, with the strength identification imprint 'DMQ / 30-10' printed in white ink on the capsule and three white bands around the circumference.

Dextromethorphan hydrobromide exhibits optical activity but does not show polymorphism. Manufacture Dextromethorphan  is  supplied  by  one  manufacturer  to  which  a  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for dextromethorphan has been granted. The current Certificate of Suitability has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. The relevant information has been assessed by EDQM. Specification The active substance will be tested and assessed by the finished product manufacturer applying the methods and specifications laid down in the Ph. Eur. monograph and CEP of dextromethorphan. Satisfactory batch analysis data were provided for multiple batches demonstrating that the active ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  non-compendial  methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Stability The active substance is packaged in LDPE bags, individually sealed with a polypropylene strap. The LDPE bags are placed inside a HDPE drum, closed with a lid and a galvanised ring seal. Multiple production scale batches of active substance packed in a container closure system similar to the intended commercial packaging were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up to 60 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 months Satisfactory results on stress conditions (e.g. photostability, acid, hydrolysis and oxidation) were also provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  following parameters  were  tested: description, specific optical rotation, water related substances and assay.

The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the container closure system in order to protect from light.

## Quinidine sulfate

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Quinidine  sulfate  is  a  white  to  almost  white  crystalline  powder  or  silky,  colourless  needles.  It  is slightly soluble in water, soluble in boiling water and in ethanol (96 %), and practically insoluble in acetone.

The chemical name is bis(S)-[(2R,4S,5R)-5-ethenyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-yl](6methoxyquinolin-4-yl)methanol sulfate dihydrate. The molecular formula is C40H50N4O8S, 2 H2O and the structural formula is as follows:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  non-compendial  methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Quinidine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. The enantiomer of quinidine  does  not  exist.  A  well-known  diastereomer  of  Quinidine  is  Quinine.  In  the  Quinine structure two of the four chiral centres are inverted. Quinine is controlled by the PhEur monograph. Polymorphism has not been observed for quinidine sulfate dihydrate manufactured according to the submitted manufacturing process. An ASMF has been submitted to support the quality of the active substance. Manufacture Quinidine sulfate dihydrate is supplied by one manufacturer. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Specification The active substance will be tested by the methods and specifications laid down in the Ph. Eur. monograph.  In  addition,  the  finished  product  manufacturer  performs  a  test  for  particle  size distribution as part of the specification of the active substance. Satisfactory batch analysis data were provided for batches demonstrating that the active ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

Fibre  drums  or  cardboard  boxes  and  double  polyethylene  inliners  are  used  as  container  closure system.

Up to three production scale batches of active substance  packed in a container closure system similar to the intended commercial packaging were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up to 60 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 months.

The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 5 years in the proposed container closure system in order to protect from light.

2.2.2. Finished medicinal product Pharmaceutical development To allow for variable  maintenance  dosages, two strengths of capsules are proposed for commercialisation: 23 mg dextromethorphan / 9 mg quinidine and 15 mg dextromethorphan / 9 mg  quinidine.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  compositions  of  both  strengths  did  not  change during the clinical program or for the commercial formulation. Compatibility studies between the two active substances show no significant degradation; this was subsequently confirmed by long-term stability testing. All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with compendial standards. Active-excipient compatibility was adequately confirmed in long-term and accelerated stability studies. There are no novel excipients used  in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. All  batches  were  stated  to  have  met  specification  requirements  and  there  were  no  effects attributable  to  changes  in  scale,  equipment,  site  or  process  operations.  Blend  and  content uniformity were satisfactory. Commercial product will be packaged in HDPE plastic bottles with a cotton insert and polypropylene screw cap or in PVC-based aluminium blisters.  The container closure systems were chosen for their ability  to  protect  the  capsules  during  storage  and  because  they  are  considered  safe  for  oral, immediate-release capsules.  The suitability of the container closure systems has been investigated through drug product stability studies. Adventitious agents Statements from producers confirming that the excipients are BSE/TSE free are submitted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture of the product

The process for capsule manufacture is a simple pharmaceutical process comprised of sequential pre-blending, screening, blending, lubrication and encapsulation operations.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described  and  the  critical  steps  have  been identified. In process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

Manufacturing process validation was performed on commercial scale batches of each strength

The batch analysis data on multiple commercial batches of each strength shows that the capsules can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Product specification

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identification, assay,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  dissolution,  degradation  products  and  microbial  quality.  All analytical procedures and test methods have been adequately described and the validation data presented is acceptable.

Batch  data  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the  process  is capable and under control.

## Stability of the product

Stability data for multiple batches stored in the two container closure systems equivalent to those proposed for marketing were provided under long term conditions for up to 60 months (25 ºC/60 % RH) and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerate  conditions  (40  ºC/75  %  RH)  in  line  with  ICH guidelines. Photostability studies were conducted and indicate that drug product is not sensitive to light when it is stored in the proposed packaging configurations. The stability studies support the shelf-life of 3 years under the storage conditions declared in the SmPC. 2.2.3. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 2.2.4. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 2.2.5. Recommendation(s) for future quality development Not applicable. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Nuedexta is a fixed combination medicinal product comprised of 2 well known and characterized components, DM and Q, used at doses below those employed for other indications.  A reduced nonclinical  testing  program  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed combinations of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005) based on literature and on new data generated by the applicant was submitted.  Much of the non-clinical program conducted by the applicant preceded both the above EU Guidelines, and the corresponding FDA Guidance for industry:  nonclinical  safety  evaluation  of  drug  or  biologic  combinations  (CDER  March  2006).  In general, the nonclinical safety studies with Nuedexta were designed to be consistent with (then) current industry standards, FDA and ICH regulatory guidances.  No juvenile animal toxicity studies with  AVP-923  have  been  submitted.    The  EMA  Paediatric  Committee  adopted  an  opinion  of  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product-specific waiver for all subsets of the paediatric population for the use AVP-923 in PBA (see Paediatric section of this report).

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The  non-clinical  primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamics  of  dextromethorphan  hydrobromide (DM) and quinidine sulfate  (Q)  have  been  previously  evaluated  and  are  well-documented  in  the literature.  There  is  also  extensive  clinical  experience  with  DM  and  Q.  Therefore  a  limited pharmacology  package  was  submitted  to  support  the  fixed  dose  combination,  which  was acceptable. The etiology of PBA is not completely understood; however, the neurologic insults that are associated with PBA are thought to increase the activity of the excitatory glutamate pathways that regulate affect.  The pathophysiology of PBA is then believed to involve injury to the circuitry that regulates affect and motor expression leading to lack of voluntary control (Moore, 1997) or the loss of communication between the cerebral cortex and cerebellum needed for normal regulation of emotional  expression  (Parvizi,  2009).  It  is,  therefore,  possible  that  the  ability  of  DM  to  reduce glutamatergic  signalling  and  its  reported  neuroprotective  properties  could  explain  its  efficacy  in PBA. However, since a nonclinical pharmacological model for PBA is not available, a direct proof for the  claimed  primary  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  DM  in  PBA  could  not  be  provided  on  the nonclinical level. With regard to the high affinity of DM for SERT and HT1B/D receptors (see below), effects on the serotoninergic system may be involved as well. Quinidine has been shown to elevate and prolong systemic DM levels via inhibition of its metabolism by CYP2D6 to dextrorphan (DX) and hence it is expected that this action reduces the required therapeutic dose of DM, prolonging its duration of action. In  an  in  vitro  binding  assay  (study  DMQ-129)  DM  competed  for  binding  at  sigma1,  SERT, α 2adrenergic, and 5-HT1B/D with a high affinity for sigma1. Neither DM nor the metabolite DX had affinity  for  the  sigma2  receptor.  It  is  postulated  that  in  PBA  the  selectivity  for  sigma-1  may  be beneficial as this is located in areas of the brain involved in regulation of pathways that coordinate emotional output, namely the brainstem and cerebellum. In addition, DM was also found to have a high  binding  affinity  (Ki  =  40  nM)  at  the  serotonin  transporter  (SERT);  the  primary  target  for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs. Dextrorphan also competed for SERT with a Ki value of 484 nM and PCP binding. Furthermore, it is reported that DX competed for β -adrenergic receptor binding, histamine binding, muscarinic binding and 5-HT1B/D binding. The applicant has highlighted the fact that Q is intended to inhibit the metabolism of DM to DX which is then rapidly glucoronidated and hence unable to cross the blood:brain barrier. Consequently, any potential for pharmacological action by DX at receptors located in the brain is expected to be negligible. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

Recently, Q was identified to have 5-HT2B agonistic activity. There is evidence that 5-HT2B agonism can be related to induction of valvular disease (Huang X-P et al.: Mol Pharmacol 2009, 76:710722). However, the results of a study performed by the sponsor at the request of FDA, as well as the  study  by  Huang et  al. provide  experimental  evidence  that  Q,  at  the  plasma  concentrations reached clinically during Nuedexta therapy, is unlikely to result in an activation of 5-HT 2B receptors. These data combined with the long history of clinical use of Q, at doses and plasma concentrations much (2-logs) greater than with Nuedexta dosing, support the conclusion that the dose of Q from Nuedexta  would  not  cause  valvulopathy  and  that  further  specific  non-clinical  investigations concerning this issue are not warranted.

## Safety pharmacology programme

In the GLP compliant hERG assay (study DMQ-131), Nuedexta inhibited hERG tail current recorded from  stably  transfected  HEK293  cells  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner.  The  estimated  IC 50

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

value for inhibition of HERG tail current was 347.5 ng/ml (equivalent to a combination of 222.0 nM [173.8ng/ml] Q and 469.3 nM [173.8 ng/ml] DM). The mean Cmax of Q and DM in the clinic was estimated to be approximately 66.3 and 113 ng/ml, respectively, following repeated administration to  healthy  volunteers for 8 days at the maximum proposed dose (clinical pharmacokinetic study 07-AVR-125). Based on these values a human safety factor of 2.6 and 1.5 can be applied for Q and DM respectively.  This finding is supported by an earlier non-GLP study (study DMQ-130). The IC50 values  obtained  for  DM  alone:  6592  ng/ml  (human  safety  factor  =  ~58),  Q  alone:  367  ng/ml (human safety factor = ~5), and DM/Q combination: 466 ng/ml (human safety factor = ~7 for Q, and ~ 2 for DM) indicated that inhibition was primarily Q-related and there was no evidence of a synergistic interaction.

In an investigation into the in vitro effects of Q on QRS, QT, TP-E and proarrhythmias in the rabbit left  ventricular  wedge  model  (Study  DMQ-146),  at  a  concentration  of  0.015 μ M  Q  sulfate  (the equivalent  of  0.03 μ M  free  quinidine  [Q  sulfate  generated  two  Q  molecules  in  the  perfusion solution]),  Q  had  no  significant  effect  on  the  QT  and  TP-E  intervals.  At  0.1 μ M,  Q  significantly prolonged the TP-E intervals and prolonged the QT interval but not at levels that were statistically significant. Based on the Cmax values for Q obtained in clinical study 07-AVR-125, a human safety factor of ~5.6 can be applied at the NOEL of 0.015 μ M. In  conclusion,  DM/Q  was  found  to  have  an  inhibitory  effect  on  the  hERG  current  in  transfected HEK293 cells, and Q significantly prolonged the QT and Tp-e intervals in a concentration-dependent manner. It is well known that Q inhibits sodium and cardiac potassium currents, decreasing the Vmax for sodium influx and excitability, conduction velocity, and contractility, and increases the duration of cardiac cell action potentials. Therefore no further non-clinical studies have been requested, as no unknown cardiovascular  risks  have  been  identified  thus  far.    No  additional  safety  pharmacology studies were conducted for the combination product, which is acceptable given that the individual active ingredients are well-known. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No  newly  conducted  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  submitted  for  the  current application,  which is acceptable given the known pharmacological actions of Q and DM. However detailed evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interactions is discussed below which is more relevant to the efficacy of the combination product. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dextromethorphan is the pharmacologically CNS-active component of Nuedexta; however, in most people DM is rapidly metabolised to DX by CYP2D6. The glucuronidated form of DX is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Quinidine inhibition of CYP2D6 enhances DM uptake by CNS tissues. Since both Q and DM are known active ingredients with well-established ADME profiles in animals and  humans,  the  applicant  has  only  conducted  studies  to  investigate  the  effects  of  Q  on  DM absorption and metabolism and in vitro enzyme inhibition and induction studies to further evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential of the combination product. Taking into account that both DM and Q are approved and there is considerable clinical experience with their use, from a non-clinical point of view this is acceptable.

## Combination studies

Rapid oral absorption (Tmax 15 min - 1 hr) of Q and DM was demonstrated in all species studied (mice, rats and dogs). When co-administered, Q increased systemic DM exposure and decreased exposure to DX in both the males and females in all species evaluated.

In mice, single oral administrations of DM at the dose of 200 mg/kg were lethal to females, and to male mice when given in combination with Q doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. AUC values of DM were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximal at Q doses of  40  mg/kg  in  combination  with  20  mg/kg  DM  (283  and  343  ng.h/ml  for females and males, respectively), and at 30 mg/kg Q in combination with 60 mg/kg DM (1384 and 1992 ng.h/ml for females and males, respectively). Co-administration of Q with DM reduced the Tmax for females from 1 hour to 15-30 minutes. These results suggest saturation of the inhibitory effects of Q on CYP2D activity at doses of approximately 30-40 mg/kg.

In rats (Study DMQ-101), DM exposure (AUC0-t), when administered at 20 mg/kg, was increased 1.3X,  2.9X  and  4.1X  by  Q  at  2,  20,  and  100  mg/kg,  respectively,  compared  to  when  DM  was administered  alone.  At  50  mg/kg  DM,  exposure  increased  1.5X,  2.5X,  and  2.2X  by  Q  coadministration at 2, 20, and 50 mg/kg, respectively. DM exposure, at the dose of 100 mg/kg, was increased 1.6X by Q at 100 mg/kg. This effect was greater in the males than in the females. In contrast to the findings in mice, the DM and DX AUC0-t and Cmax values were greater in females than in males, with Q co-administration. The exposure to DX was unaffected or slightly decreased when Q was co-administered. The NOAEL for DM alone was 100 mg/kg. There were no effects of Q alone.  In  a  further  study  (DMQ-107)  systemic  exposure  to  both  DM  and  Q  was  greater,  and exposure to DX was lower under fasted than under fed conditions in rats.

Although in vitro studies did not evidence any inhibitory effect of DM on the main CYP450 enzymes this was not verified in vivo. Further discussion has been provided to explore the potential of DM to cause  potential  drug-drug  interactions  when  used  to  treat  PBA.    From  the  amount  of  free  DM present following the MRHD (0.11 µM), it is unlikely that CYP inhibition or induction would occur.

Clinical signs in dog study DMQ-100 (DM at 10 mg/kg) included CNS depression, ataxia, vomiting, hyper-excitability, muscular rigidity, tonic-clonic convulsions and 4 dogs were found dead 3 hours post-dose  and  a  further  6  out  the  remaining  8  dogs  sacrificed  at  4  hours  post-dose  due  to  the severity  of  the  clinical  signs.  Consequently,  there  were  insufficient  numbers  of  samples  for  PK analysis, although plasma sampling showed that Cmax values for DM and DX ranged from 47.23 to 2478.65 ng/ml and 77.54 to 1104.9 ng/ml, respectively. Repeat dosing in dogs indicated that coadministration  of  Q  did  not  increase  the  Cmax  or  AUC  values  of  DM;  suggesting  that  DM  is metabolised via an alternative route in this species. The applicant has presented a paper published in 2003 (Shou et. al.) that supports this hypothesis further, where N-demethylation via CYP3A12 is proposed as the major metabolic pathway in dogs. DM  did  not  inhibit  (&lt;  20%  inhibition)  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19, CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  CYP3A4  (midazolam)  or  CYP3A4  (testosterone)  in  human  liver  microsomes  at concentrations  up  to  5 μ M.  Conversely,  DM  did  not  induce  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6  or  CYP3A4  at concentrations up to 4.8 μ M. It was, therefore, concluded that DM is neither an inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 activity in these test systems. Q  did  not  inhibit  (&lt;  30%  inhibition)  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 (midazolam) or CYP3A4 (testosterone) in human microsomes at concentrations up to 5 μ M. As expected, Q inhibited CYP2D6 with an IC50 of less than 0.05 μ M. Similarly to DM, Q did not  increase  CYP  mRNA  content  in  the  CYP  P450  induction  study  (DMQ-145).  Hence  it  was concluded that Q is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 activity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Toxicokinetic  investigations  to  support  the  safety  and  efficacy  profiling  of  the  fixed  combination medicinal product of DM and Q were carried out as part of the toxicology programme and were assessed in the Toxicology section.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Acute toxicology data was adequate and no further studies were required. In rodents, mortality and severe  signs  of  CNS  depression  were  evident  at  200  mg/kg  DM  (1,200  mg/m2),  the  HED  is  32

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/kg. At the reported NOAEL (100 mg/kg) a clinical safety margin of ~13x can be applied based on body surface area. Mortality and clinical signs of CNS depression were observed at lower DM doses than when DM was administered concomitantly with Q. This is an expected finding based on the role of Q as a 'pharmacokinetic enhancer'. In non-rodents the MTD in dogs (as determined by severe  CNS  signs  of  depression  and  mortality)  was  10  mg/kg  DM  (200  mg/m2;  5  mg/kg  HED) which  is  ~4x  the  maximum  clinical  dose  when  corrected  for  body  surface  area.  However,  in  a further study, 10 mg/kg was well tolerated and CNS-related signs occurred at 27.4 mg/kg DM (548 mg/m2; 15 mg/kg HED).

## Repeat dose toxicity

Rodents: Daily oral dosing of DM/Q to rats for up to 26 consecutive weeks at dose levels of 5/100, 20/100  and  50/100  mg/kg/day  resulted  in  changes  to  the  liver  (increased  liver  weight,  liver centrilobular  hepatocellular  hypertrophy),  kidneys  (increased  relative  kidney  weight,  increased urinary volume, tubular dilations), and lungs at all dose levels. The thyroid glands (females) and prostate  were  also  affected  by  treatment.  Although,  reported  findings  were  reversible,  a  NOEL could not be established. The applicant states that 5/100 is the NOAEL, however the CHMP does not  agree  as  significant  changes  in  kidney  and  liver  weights  were  reported  in  this  dose-group together with histopathological changes. Based on the proposed maximum clinical dose of 30/10 mg b.i.d and corresponding human AUC values of 1766 and 942 ng.h/ml, the clinical margin of safety (MOS) for the lowest dose group was x0.1 for DM (both males and females) and x31 and x28 for Q (males and females, respectively). The  applicant  considers  that  the  hepatotoxicity  is  an  adaptive  response  to  meet  the  added metabolic burden of daily administration of two compounds that require metabolism by the liver. It is  noteworthy  that  PBA  patients  may  be  administered  multiple  medications  and  therefore  the risk:benefit of this additional burden should be considered clinically. Non-rodents: In a 5-week study (DMQ-138), dogs did not tolerate 30/20 mg/kg due to severe CNS toxicity  (abnormal gait, paresis, loss of balance and convulsion). Dose limiting toxicity in the 39 week  study  (DMQ-139)  included  decreased  activity,  tremors,  increased  muscle  tone  and  head shaking. In addition, there was a slight increase in the incidence and severity of focal squamous metaplasia  of  the  trachea/larynx  in  animals  compared  to  controls  which  may  be  attributable  to local  irritation.  Increases  in  heart  rate  were  recorded  in  high-dose  animals  when  Q  dose  was doubled  to  12  mg/kg/day.  Corresponding  decreases  in  QT  intervals  were  also  recorded.  It  is noteworthy that these elevations were still within historical control ranges and no longer observed at  week  39.  In  contrast  to  findings  in  the  rat,  pathology  in  the  liver  and  kidney  was  largely unremarkable following chronic treatment in the dog. The NOAEL (6/3 mg/kg/day) corresponded to AUC values were 380 and 372, 140 and 127, and 11100 and 8500 ng.h/ml (males and females, respectively) for DM, DX and Q on day 267, respectively. The clinical MOS for Q is ~ 9x and ~0.2 for  DM.  Toxicokinetic  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  inhibitory  effects  of  Q  on  DM  metabolism occurred from doses as low as 1.5 mg/kg/day and toxicity correlated with decreased concentration of DX in the presence of higher doses of Q.

In conclusion, the repeat-dose toxicology data suggest that the potential target organs of toxicity for Nuedexta are CNS, kidneys and liver in rats but in dogs it was CNS-depression and Q-related effects  on  the  cardiovascular  system  that  defined  dose-limiting  toxicity.  Toxicokinetic  analyses demonstrated that exposure of rats to DM increased with increasing doses of Q and, generally, in a greater than or approximately equal to dose-proportional fashion. Systemic exposure was higher in females.  In  rats,  DX  exposure  also  increased  with  increasing  doses  of  DM/Q  but  these  levels decreased  in  dogs.  The  PK  parameters  for  Q  remained  unaffected  by  increasing  DM  doses  and there were no gender-related changes. The data in rats appear to confirm that administration of Q in combination increased systemic exposure to DM. Contrastingly, in the dog PK study (DMQ-137)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Q did not appear to increase the Cmax or AUC values of DM but repeated DM dosing did increase these PK values. These results suggest that in dogs DM is metabolised via an alternative route.

## Genotoxicity

An  adequate  battery  of  tests  was  conducted.  The  genotoxic  potential  of  DM  and  Q  (tested individually)  was  assessed  in  multiple  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies,  and  both  compounds  were negative. However, in an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test, DM was associated with an  increase  in  chromosome  number  (polyploidy)  in  the  presence  of  S9  activation,  and  Q  was associated  with  an  increase  in  polyploidy  both  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  S9  activation. Structural aberrations were also assessed for each compound independently, and it was concluded that  DM  was  nonclastogenic.  Quinidine  was  considered  to  have  weak  or  equivocal  clastogenic activity  in  the  presence  of  S9  activation,  since  positive  results  were  only  observed  at  a  single concentration  in  two  independent  tests  and  were  not  dose-dependent.  Further  reassurance  was obtained from the in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test where it was demonstrated that a combination of DM and Q (1:1, w/w), was negative at concentrations of up to those limited by cytotoxicity. These results indicate that DM/Q has minimal genotoxic potential.

Reproductive toxicity findings were observed in rats and rabbits at DM exposures at or below the human exposure of DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg with higher relative exposures of DX and Q.  The analysis of the data indicates that the developmental toxicity observed may be due to a synergistic effect of DM and Q likely related to increased exposure to DM.  The use of either agent alone in pregnancy, mostly transiently, was not reported to be associated with increased fetal malformations; the labels for  their  uses  in  other  indications  generally  suggest  use  only  if  'the  benefit  outweighs  the  risk', rather than including a contraindication. Section 5.3 of the SmPC reflects this.

Carcinogenicity Based on unremarkable findings in a 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats (where there  were no biologically  significant  neoplastic  findings  for  DM  and/or  Q),  a  two-year  carcinogenicity  study  in mice (where there was no evidence of carcinogenicity) and predominantly negative results in the genotoxicity  assays,  DM/Q  is  considered  unlikely  to  be  carcinogenic.  In  addition,  recorded incidences  of  Q-related  increases  in  benign  pituitary  adenomas  occurred  at  plasma  levels  of  Q calculated to be ~40x expected clinical exposure levels. Reproduction Toxicity The range of studies conducted was in line with current guidance and provides a suitable package of reproductive toxicity studies. Fertility and early embryonic development In  the  rat  fertility  study  there  were  no  dose-related  deaths  or  effects  on  bodyweights  and  food consumption. The only clinical sign was increased salivation. There were also no treatment-related effects  on  any  of  the  reproductive  tissues  or  fertility  (sperm  count/motility/morphology,  corpora lutea count, effects on implantation). Therefore, the NOAEL was the high-dose: 50/100 mg/kg/day DM/Q.  As  maternal  MTD  was  not  established  it  is  uncertain  if  higher  doses  could  have  been administered  to  further  evaluate  potential  reproductive  toxicity.  Nonetheless,  exposure  to  DM/Q and DX was largely comparable to levels seen in the rat 26 week toxicology study. Embryo-foetal development Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pre and postnatal development

In  the  rat  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  ( DMQ-125 ),  overall  pregnancy  rates  were comparable  across  groups.  Total  loss  of  pregnancy  occurred  in  one  high-dose  animal  and  two animals (mid and high-dose) underwent elective early sacrifice due to total loss of litter soon after birth. There were neither overt clinical signs nor signs of maternal toxicity but a slight prolongation of  gestational  period  was  observed  in  all  groups,  however  still  within  the  normal  range  for  this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strain.  Treatment-related  increases  in  pup  mortality  (unrelated  to  maternal  toxicity  and  with  a 'shallow'  dose-response)  were  also  recorded.  A  slight  reduction  in  F1  body  weight;  delay  in acquisition of the air-righting response (mid- and high-dose), and slight increases in exploratory motor  activity  in  F1  pups  (that  quickly  resolved)  were  also  reported.  No  effects  on  sexual maturation  or  reproductive  function  were  noted  and  there  were  no  treatment-related  effects  on kidney or liver weights in F0 dams or their F1 offspring. Subsequently, the investigators could not establish a NOAEL in terms of pregnancy and pre- and post-natal development; and it was noted that treatment-related effects did not coincide with maternal signs of toxicity.

Two groups of rats were administered with DM or Q alone ( DMQ-125 ) at doses comparable to that used in the definitive EFD study (DMQ-124; 50/100 DM/Q). Toxicokinetic analysis demonstrated, as  expected,  that  DM  exposure  was  up  to  50%  less  (  GD  17:  4760 v 9410  ng/h/ml,  in  studies DMQ-125 and DMQ-124, respectively) than when dosed in combination with Q (as recorded in the EFD  study  -  DMQ-124)  and  DX  exposure  was  10-fold  higher  (GD  17:  18600  v  1870  ng/h/ml). Exposure to Q was comparable in both studies. In contrast to the findings in the EFD study, there were no overt signs of maternal toxicity (food consumption or body weight) or rate of incidence of externally visible abnormalities among the fetuses. It was, therefore, concluded that the signs of developmental delay reported in the pivotal rat EFD study (DMQ-124) were attributable to some synergism between DM/Q, likely attributable to the increased DM exposure levels. It is noteworthy that  the  increased  DX  levels  recorded  in  this  study  did  not  relate  to  increased  incidence  of  EFD toxicity or maternal toxicity and hence this metabolite is unlikely to have had contributory effects on developmental delays previously reported. Toxicokinetic data There were anomalies in the toxicokinetic readings summarised in rat prenatal development study, DMQ-124, where a higher apparent exposure to DM was observed (9410 ng.h/mL) when co-dosed with Q, double that seen for DM alone (DMQ-125).  The Applicant concludes that Q and DM codosed results in a synergistic effect whereby DM exposure is enhanced in the presence of Q.  Given the  available  literature  and  the  clear  developmental  effects  observed  in  studies  with  DM/Q,  the Applicant's  conclusion  that  Nuedexta  has  potential  to  cause  fetal  harm  was  supported.    The wording for section 4.6 is in line with the Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products on human  reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling  (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005)  i.e. Nuedexta (AVP-923) is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Local Tolerance Not applicable. Other toxicity studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

In an acute rat neurotoxicity study ( DMQ-106 ) to evaluate the potential for DM/Q in combination to  induce  Olney  lesions  or  related  neurodegenerative  changes  in  the  brain,  histopathological examination of the brain revealed no evidence of any vacuoles, lesions, or other treatment-related abnormalities at doses up to 50/50 mg/kg (300/300 mg/m2; 8/8 mg/kg HED).

## Juvenile studies

The applicant presented in their responses the results of non-clinical study DMQ-149. The objective of this study was to determine the toxicokinetic profile of DMQ when administered to neonatal and juvenile rats. This study was conducted to support future dose levels for an oral (Gavage) singledose neurotoxicity study of DMQ in neonatal rats (DMQ-150). The applicant states that 'No  new information  emerged  from  this  pharmacokinetic  dose  selection  study  to  warrant  additional  risk minimisation measures. The RMP has been updated to reflect the completion of this study. When the results of the companion neurotoxicity study (DMQ-150) are available, the need for additional

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

risk minimisation measures will be re-assessed'. This is accepted and it is agreed that the results of the definitive study can be submitted post-approval and the RMP updated accordingly.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant did not submit a Phase II environmental risk assessment but provided the reasons for its absence:

- a) The DM and Q addition to environmental exposure by Nuedexta is considered to be minimal in relation to pre-existing uses. Single digit percentage exposure changes are not significant in lognormal dose-response relationships.
- b) Nuedexta is a combination product that cannot replace DM and Q for other indications.
- c) Ecotoxicological processes follow normal mass action log-normal dose-responses.

CHMP agreed that there  will  be  a  negligible  increase  in  the  active  substances  released  into  the environment over and above existing quantities.  The Applicant argument fulfils the criterion for justification of the absence of a full ERA. As neither of the active substances is new and the overall production of both is unlikely to increase greatly if this product were to be licensed, the CHMP concluded that the Applicant has fulfilled the requirements for assessing the potential for a risk to the environment and that no further work is necessary.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The Applicant has conducted an adequate toxicity programme for Nuedexta. Only the oral route of administration was investigated in all species, which is acceptable.

The single-dose studies are adequate and no further studies are required. In rodents mortality and clinical signs of CNS depression were observed at lower DM doses than when DM was administered concomitantly with Q. This is an expected finding based on the role of Q as a 'pharmacokinetic enhancer'.

Repeat dose toxicology studies  in  rodents  revealed  signs  of  hepatotoxicity,  possibly  an  adaptive response  to  meet  the  added  metabolic  burden  of  daily  administration  of  two  compounds  that require metabolism by the liver. As PBA patients may be administered multiple medications due to their  comorbidities,  the  risk:benefit  considering  this  liver  burden  should  be  taken  into  account clinically: it is part of the RMP and mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Nuedexta is a fixed combination medicinal product comprised of 2 well known and characterized components, dextromethorphan and quinidine, used at doses below those employed individually for other indications.

The repeat-dose toxicology data suggest that the potential target organs of toxicity for Nuedexta are CNS, kidneys and liver in rats but in dogs it was CNS-depression and Q-related effects on the cardiovascular system that defined dose-limiting toxicity. An  adequate  battery  of  Genotoxicity  tests  was  conducted.  The  results  indicate  that  DM/Q  has minimal genotoxic potential. Based on the findings of a 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats, where there were no biologically significant  neoplastic  findings  for  DM  and/or  Q,  a  two-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice,  where there was no evidence of carcinogenicity, and predominantly negative results in the genotoxicity assays, DM/Q is considered unlikely to be carcinogenic. The  range  of  Reproductive  toxicology  studies  conducted  was  in  line  with  current  guidance  and provides  a  suitable  package.  In  study  DMQ-141,  DM/Q  was  embryolethal  in  rabbits  at  75/100 mg/kg. These findings are reflected in the SPC (sections 4.6 and 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nuedexta during pregnancy. A full ERA assessment was not performed and was deemed not necessary. 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The  Applicant  has  conducted  an  adequate  investigation  of  the  toxicity  profile  for  Nuedexta, supplementing the literature data on the two known substances with studies on the combination. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

The active principle in the combination is Dextromethorphan. The exact mechanism by which the product acts in PBA is unknown, but dextromethorphan is thought to have a modulatory effect on neurotransmission involving glutamate, monoamines (including serotonin), as well as ion channel function.

The purpose of Quinidine in the combination is to inhibit CYP 2D6, which is the main metabolic pathway for elimination of Dextromethorphan. It is reported in literature that effect of Quinidine can  be  as  significant  as  41-fold  increase  in  availability  of  Dextromethorphan  when  given

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

simultaneously,  and  near  complete  CYP  2D6  inhibition  has  been  achieved  with  30mg  or  more Quinidine b.d.

The  great  majority  of  the  European  population  (88%)  are  known  to  be  CYP  2D6  extensive metabolisers (EM).  Poor metabolisers are the second most frequently occurring genotype (8%) in Europe,  followed  by  intermediate  and  ultra  fast  metabolisers.    The  product  concept,  to  include quinidine to inhibit the 2D6-mediated metabolic conversion of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan, is equivalent at the extreme (i.e. at high doses of quinidine) to converting extensive metabolisers of 2D6 to poor metabolisers, and to increase the plasma levels of DM to a concentration sufficient to exert effects on the symptoms of PBA.

While  the  interplay  between  these  variables  is  not  fully  elucidated,  the  correct  use  of  the  two proposed  strengths  according  to  the  titration  schedule  described  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC provides a rational and clinically based way to reach the effective dose when the metabolizer status is  unknown and based on actual clinical response to treatment. The study population, consistent with  European  demographics,  was  largely  made  up  of  extensive  metabolisers.    For  poor metabolisers, quinidine shows little impact on dextromethorphan levels, as would be expected.  For intermediate metabolisers, it might be expected that Nuedexta will result in plasma dextromethorphan concentrations lower than those of poor metabolisers. For ultrafast metabolisers, a 10 mg dose of quinidine is expected to result in a lower degree of inhibition of 2D6 activity  than in extensive metabolisers. As lower plasma DM levels can be associated with lower clinical  response,  the  clinician  may  need  to  up  titrate  to  the  higher  Nuedexta  dose  in  cases  of insufficient efficacy.   The benefit risk would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis in these

Pharmacokinetics The great majority of the European population (88%) are known to be 2D6 extensive metabolisers (EM).    Poor  metabolisers  are  the  second  most  frequently  occurring  genotype  (8%)  in  Europe, followed by intermediate and ultra fast metabolisers.  The product concept, to include quinidine to inhibit the 2D6-mediated metabolic conversion of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan, is equivalent at the extreme (i.e. at high doses of quinidine) to converting extensive metabolisers of 2D6 to poor metabolisers. The  pivotal  study  was  performed  with  the  combinations  Dextromethorphan  /  Quinidine  30mg  / 10mg and 20mg / 10mg. While the applicant provided the justification for the choice of dose of Quinidine, the choice of dose of Dextromethorphan has been less well justified. The plasma levels of  Dextromethorphan  following  administration  of  the  product  are  controlled  by  the  dose  of Dextromethorphan, the CYP2D6 phenotype of the patient, and the dose of Quinidine. Additionally, induction of CYP3A4 (which metabolises quinidine) may result in reduced Q plasma concentrations, leading to decreased inhibition of CYP2D6, and potential subtherapeutic DM plasma concentration (see SmPC section 4.5).

patients.   The suggested regimen of uptitration was considered by CHMP as the rational clinical approach that can maximise the benefits for patients whose metabolizer status is not known. The cautious pace of uptitration is also acceptable in view of the non-life-threatening nature of PBA.

## Absorption

The absolute and relative bioavailability of DM without Q has been comprehensively described in the literature: DM is absorbed fast but undergoes first-pass metabolisation leading to an absolute bioavailability of 10%. Half life of DM is short with data reported ~3 h.

The  bioavailability  of  DM  in  combination  is  increased  by  Q  due  to  the  inhibition  of  the  main metabolisation pathway via CYP2D6. Therefore the effect of Q on the bioavailability of DM has been investigated in several PK studies.

| no      |
|---------|
| product |

The plasma levels of Q for the product are well below the therapeutic concentrations required when Q is used as antiarrythmic (1% to 3%).

The overall conclusion from the early Phase 1 dose-finding clinical PK studies was that low doses of Q  effectively  inhibit  the  activity  of  CYP2D6  and  increase  the  systemic  exposure  to  orally administered DM. Comparison  of  PK  results  across  the  studies  showed  that  inhibition  of  CYP2D6  decreased  dosedependently  at  lower  Q  doses,  while  the  plasma  concentration  of  DM  (mean  AUC0-∞ or  mean Cmax) increased with Q doses up to 25 (28.8) mg and then plateaued at higher doses. Maximal inhibition of CYP2D6 in EMs was observed at Q doses ≥ 30 mg, with a 41-fold increase in systemic exposure of DM at Q 30 mg BID, however, a substantial increase in systemic bioavailability of DM (25-fold) was still observed at the lower Q dose of 10 mg BID. Effect of Q Dose on Bioavailability of DM (30 mg) (Study 99-AVR-100) The applicant has also investigated the Q 10 mg dose in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 07-AVR-123 to confirm  that  plasma  DM  concentrations  were  sufficiently  elevated  to  retain  a  pharmacodynamic effect. Bioavailability of Q Q is well a known substance and its pharmacokinetic properties are well described in literature. Q is well absorbed with an absolute bioavailability reported from 70-100%. Maximum plasma levels are reached within 2 hours and half life is reported to be approx. 5-7 hours. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

Dextromethorphan is widely distributed with a volume of distribution reported with 431 l (Pop-PK analysis)

The volume of distribution of quinidine is reported in literature with 2 to 3 L/kg for healthy young adults.

## Elimination

-  Excretion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DM in EMs without Q is mainly metabolised by hepatic enzymes and the metabolites are eliminated mainly  through  urinary  excretion  (up  to  100%).  The  half  life  of  the  parent  compound  is approximately 2 to 4 hours in EM.

In  addition  to  increasing  systemic  exposure  of  DM  by  inhibiting  CYP2D6-mediated  first  pass metabolism, the clearance of DM from plasma was also reduced following co-administration of Q. Plasma half-life values for DM in healthy volunteers (EMs) receiving various doses of DM/Q ranged from 11.9 to 23.2 hours.

Quinidine clearance typically proceeds at 3 to 5 ml/min/kg. Elimination is mainly renal after hepatic metabolisation via CYP3A4.

##  Metabolism

There is a clear first pass metabolism for DM, which is mainly metabolised to DX via CYP2D6 if no Q is present.

The aim of the early clinical pharmacology studies for Nuedexta was to identify the optimal dose of quinidine to maximise patient exposure to dextromethorphan.  It was found that a dose of 30 mg quinidine  increased  the  exposure  of  dextromethorphan  in  extensive  metabolisers  (88%  of  the European  population)  by  a  factor  of  40.    This  dose  of  quinidine  was  chosen  and  a  full pharmacokinetic  characterisation,  including  drug-drug  interaction  studies,  food  effect,  etc  was undertaken with the then proposed to-be-marketed formulation of 30 mg dextromethorphan and 30 mg quinidine.  This was submitted to the FDA. Following discussions about the cardiac safety of a 30 mg quinidine dose, the Applicant subsequently redeveloped the product, reducing the dose of quinidine to 10 mg.  This dose was estimated to increase the exposure of dextromethorphan in extensive  metabolisers  by  a  factor  of  25  (i.e.  resulting  in  1.6-fold  lower  dextromethorphan concentrations than the original product).  The final clinical pharmacology data package consists mainly of (1) studies to quantify the impact of different combinations of quinidine  and dextromethorphan  on  dextromethorphan  exposure  and  (2)  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  in support of the original product (containing 30 mg quinidine).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The impact of quinidine on the exposure to dextromethorphan and dextrorphan was investigated in a number of studies in healthy volunteers. These studies found that:

o Coadministration  of  doses  as  low  as  2.5  mg  quinidine  with  dextromethorphan  result  in increasing exposure to dextromethorphan as a result of inhibiting the 2D6 mediated metabolism of dextromethorphan, reducing both its first pass elimination (and increasing its bioavailability) and also reducing its systemic clearance and increasing the half life of dextromethorphan.

o The degree of inhibition of 2D6 increases with quinidine dose with an approximate 40-fold increase in dextromethorphan exposure observed after 25 mg when compared to dextromethorphan exposure in subjects receiving no quinidine, with relatively small increases in dextromethorphan exposure for large increases in quinidine above this dose.

o A dose of 10 mg quinidine was found to increase dextromethorphan exposure by a factor of 25 when compared to dextromethorphan exposure in subjects receiving no quinidine. o Quinidine  has  a  shorter  t 1/2 than  dextromethorphan  (in  poor  metabolisers)  and  there  is evidence that the degree of 2D6 inhibition fluctuates over a dosing interval at steady state since: a)  there  is  evidence  of  a  rebound  in  dextrorphan  concentrations  following  the  last  dose  of dextromethorphan/quinidine  in  Study  99-AVR-101  and  Study  07-AVR-125  and  b)  dextrorphan concentrations are higher on day 8 after 30 mg quinidine than when higher quinidine doses are given (Study 00-AVR-103). The Applicant developed a population PK model that describes the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan  and  its  metabolite,  dextrorphan,  in  plasma,  with  inhibition  of  the  metabolic conversion  of  dextromethorphan  to  dextrorphan  by  quinidine.    Data  from  two  of  the  healthy volunteer studies (chosen as a sufficiently sensitive quinidine assay was used in these studies) and a phase 3 study that included intensive sampling in a PK subgroup of patients were included in the analysis [total of 133 subjects, 109 healthy volunteers (75 male, 34 female) and 24 PBA patients (15  ALS,  9  MS;  10  male,  14  female)].  The  final  model  consisted  of  2  first-order  constants  of absorption with lag times, distribution of dextromethorphan with two  compartments  and distribution of dextrorphan with one compartment.  The metabolic conversion of dextromethorphan to  dextrorphan  was  described  by  a  sigmoidal  inhibition  model  related  to  quinidine  concentration The  model  is  complex,  accounting  not  only  for  the  individual time  courses  of quinidine, dextromethorphan and its metabolite, dextrorphan, but also for the complex relationship among the  three  moieties.    It  is  notable  that  the  model  is  able  to  predict  the  rebound  of  dextrorphan concentrations  as  quinidine  concentrations  decline,  as  would  be  expected  when  the  degree  of inhibition of 2D6 declines towards the end of a dosing interval.  The Applicant concludes that none of  the  tested  covariates  including  gender,  race,  weight  and  age,  have  an  important  impact  on quinidine, dextromethorphan or dextrorphan pharmacokinetics.  Given the large shrinkage on some parameters (e.g. 56% for quinidine CL/F) and the graphical method used to identify covariates the conclusion is unclear.  The results of model qualification, in particular the VPCs, suggest that the variability in  the  pharmacokinetics of DM and DX have not been well specified in the model and hence the model is deemed to have limited utility for extrapolation to different dosage regimens Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

No evaluation of the impact of renal impairment on DM30/Q10 or DM20/Q10 has been included in this dossier.  A study of DM30/Q30 showed no impact of mild or moderate renal impairment on levels of quinidine or dextromethorphan.  However, dextrorphan levels were doubled in moderate renal  impairment.    A  similar  impact  on  DM30/Q10  would  be  expected.    There  is  no  concern regarding  the  impact  of  renal  impairment  on  Nuedexta  pharmacokinetics  and  exposure  to dextromethorphan, dextrorphan or quinidine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No evaluation of the impact of hepatic impairment on DM30/Q10 or DM20/Q10 has been included in this dossier.  A study of DM30/Q30 in mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed decreased protein binding of dextromethorphan and quinidine. A decrease in protein binding resulted in slight increases in steady-state AUC0τ (u) and Cmax(u) values and a slight decrease in urinary excretion of dextromethorphan.  Exposure to quinidine was not increased in patients with low to moderate hepatic  impairment,  whereas  exposure  to  dextromethorphan  was  increased  by  less  than  20%. However  there  was  an  increase  in  common  adverse  events  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic impairment.  It  is  concluded  that  no  dosage  adjustment  is  needed  for  mild-moderate  hepatic impairment but patients with moderate impairment should be closely evaluated for adverse events.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No evaluation of the impact of food on DM30/Q10 or DM20/Q10 has been included in this dossier. A study of DM30/Q30 showed an impact of food on the time course of quinidine (but not Cmax or AUC).  Additional simulations utilising the sigmoidal inhibitory population PK model developed for quinidine, dextromethorphan and dextrorphan and data from the fasted and fed treatments with DM30/Q30 suggest the food effect on DM30/Q10 is likely to be minimal. Regarding metabolic drug drug interactions, no studies were conducted with the to-be-marketed formulation DM30/Q10 or DM20/Q10.  Two such studies were conducted with DM30/Q30, one with desipramine, which is highly metabolised by 2D6 and one with paroxetine, which is an inhibitor of 2D6 and is a substrate of 2D6 (in addition to other CYPs).  Regarding the results of the interaction study  with  desipramine,  because  of  the  3-fold  higher  dose  of  quinidine  in  this  formulation (DM30/Q30)  compared  to  the to-be-marketed formulation, the extent of interaction with desipramine for DM30/Q10, which results as a consequence of the inhibition of 2D6 designed into the product, is likely to be less than observed in this study.  Thus, dosing recommendations based on this study are likely to be conservative and are endorsed.  The interactions with paroxetine are more complex and it is not clear from the discussion provided that the interaction would be lower than that shown with DM30/Q30. However, with the SmPC wording it is considered that any risks around this interaction are acceptably managed. The Applicant has not evaluated the effect of co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors on Nuedexta. As this is an important route for quinidine elimination (and is also involved to a minor extent in DM metabolism)  and  as  quinidine  is  associated  with  a  concentration-dependent  increase  in  the  QT interval, it is viewed as a potential safety concern for the product.  The Applicant's discussion of literature data was not sufficiently reassuring and it is viewed as important to have documented the quantitative impact of strong CYP3A inhibitors on DM, DX and Q for the product.  The applicant proposes to conduct a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of Nuedexta (DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg) with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole as a post-authorisation commitment. This is acceptable Medicinal product no longer authorised

DM is a weak/moderate inhibitor of OCT1.  It is recognised that OCT1 is one of the less common and less well characterised transporters.  However, as the applicant shows, there is a growing list of recognised substrates and clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are recognised.  Therefore it is requested that an in vivo study be performed looking at the effect of DM on a sensitive OCT1 substrate. This will be performed post-approval, with an interim wording in the SmPC to state that the DM is a mild/moderate OCT1 inhibitor in vitro .

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

The  exact  mechanism  by  which  the  product  is  claimed  to  act  in  PBA  is  unknown.  The  active principle in the combination is Dextromethorphan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dextromethorphan is a sigma-1 receptor agonist and an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. In addition it shows affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and for the 5-HT1B/D receptor. Through its binding to the NMDA, sigma-1, SERT and 5-HT1B/D receptors, dextromethorphan is thought  to  have  a  modulatory  effect  on  neurotransmission  involving  glutamate,  monoamines (including serotonin), as well as ion channel function.

The purpose of Quinidine in the combination is to inhibit CYP 2D6, which is the main metabolic pathway for elimination of Dextromethorphan. It is reported in literature that effect of Quinidine can  be  as  significant  as  41-fold  increase  in  availability  of  Dextromethorphan  when  given simultaneously.  This  effect  is  dose  dependent  and  near  complete  CYP  2D6  inhibition  has  been achieved with 30mg or more Quinidine b.d.

In  addition  to  the  desired  CYP2D6  inhibition,  Quinidine  also  inhibits  fast  inward  sodium  current (causing use dependent block), it blocks slowly inactivating tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na current, the slow  inward  calcium  current,  the  rapid  and  slow  components  of  the  delayed  potassium  rectifier current,  the  inward  potassium  rectifier  current,  the  ATP-sensitive  potassium  channel.  It  also inhibits Na/K-ATP-ase. The overall effect of Quinidine is to prolong cardiac action potential, which can  be  observed  as  prolongation  of  QT  interval  on  ECG.  Apart  from  inhibiting  CYP  2D6,  it  also inhibits p-glycoprotein, which can cause numerous interactions with other drugs. Primary and Secondary pharmacology The applicant has conducted two clinical studies aimed at instigation of pharmacodynamic effects of the product - Study 08-AVR-126 and Study 05-AVR-119. The study 08-AVR-126 was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the combination AVP-923 (Dextromethorphan  30mg  and  Quinidine  10mg)  on  the  QT  interval.  It  was  a  Double-Blind Randomized Crossover Trial to define the ECG effects of AVP-923 (Dextromethorphan/Quinidine) using a clinical  dose  of  30  mg  Dextromethorphan and 10 mg Quinidine twice daily compared to Placebo  and  Moxifloxacin  (a  Positive  Control)  in  healthy  men  and  women.  Primary  Endpoint Variable was time-matched change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR). The QTcI mean change from baseline placebo-corrected for time-averaged analysis for the clinical dose of AVP-923-30/10 was 8.9 ms. For QTcF the value was 8.1 ms. The time-matched analysis for the QTcI endpoint revealed that the upper CI of AVP 923 30/10 exceeded 10 ms at 10 of the 11 timepoints  with  a  range  of  9.1  ms  to  14.3  ms.  The  point  estimate  for  QTcI  of  AVP-923-30/10 ranged from 5.0 ms to 10.3 ms. The maximum time-matched mean change of 10.3 ms occurred at 3 hours postdose with the upper CI of 14.3 ms. The study demonstrated that the product exerts an effect of QT prolongation. The effect, however, appears to be moderate and unlikely to raise safety concerns  except  in  patients  with  coexisting  cardiac  conditions  or  taking  other  medications  that prolong the QT interval.

The study 05-AVR-119 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 3 double-blind treatment  arms  (2  dose  levels  of  AVP-923  and  placebo)  and  an  open-label  treatment  arm (moxifloxacin)  conducted  in  36  healthy  male  and  female  subjects.  The  study  objective  was  to determine  the  potential  of  AVP-923  to  cause  cardiac  repolarisation  abnormalities.  Twelve-lead continuous digital electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were used as well as plasma levels of DM, DX, and Q.

AVP-923, in repeated oral doses at standard doses was associated in the study with maximal mean placebo-subtracted changes in QTcF less than the reference positive control (moxifloxacin), 10.12 msec vs. 14.35 msec. Supratherapeutic doses were associated with QTcF prolongation that was higher than the reference positive control (18.81 msec). The maximal QTcF and maximal change in QTcF observed was 454 msec and 55 msec, respectively. The study demonstrated prolongation of QTc  which  can  be  regarded  as  dose  dependent  (higher  with  the  supra-therapeutic  doses).  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prolongation observed with the doses labelled standard (de facto supra-therapeutic too) is minor and not likely to raise safety concerns in patients without underlying cardiac conditions.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The product contains known active ingredients. Their individual pharmacologies are reasonably well known.  Modulation of CYP2D6 activity is part of the desired pharmacodynamic effect of one of the components of this product, and the applicant has conducted a number of studies to characterise how this is influenced.

No  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  conducted  to  clarify  the  mechanism  of  action,  but  the applicant  provided  a  reasonably  comprehensive  literature  review  of  the  pharmacodynamics  of dextromethorphan relevant to the claimed indication.

## 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies)

2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology The data generated by the applicant, supplemented by the provided literature on the individual substances, is sufficient to elucidate the clinical pharmacology profile of the product. A drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of Nuedexta 30/10 with ketoconazole 200mg BID to quantify the PK effects of CYP3A4 inhibition on DX, DM and Q is included in the RMP under Potential risksDrug/drug interactions. 2.5. Clinical efficacy The applicant has listed the following studies in support of the claim of efficacy in Pseudobulbar Affect. Breakdown of the diagnoses, strengths and doses used in the efficacy studies Of the four studies, only 07-AVR-123 was carried out with a study medication representative of the proposed product and dosage, and is described in more detail as main study. The other studies were  considered  by  CHMP  as  supportive  as  they  were  using  different  dosages,  and  provide additional information on the dose response relationship. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A  comprehensive review of available data  from  the  pivotal  study  07-AVR-123  was  conducted  to explore the dose-response relationship. Although a comparison between the two dose groups was not pre-specified in the analysis plan, post-hoc analyses of efficacy comparing DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg with DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg employed (amongst others) statistical methods used in the pre-specified analysis comparing the active dose groups against placebo.

The objective of this PK/PD analysis was to investigate a relationship between exposure parameters of  the  PK  dataset  (AUC  and  Cmax  from  predicted  concentration  curves  of  DM,  DX  and  Q)  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy  responses  as  measured  by  the  number  of  crying/laughing  episodes  and  CNS-LS  and  to identify the impact of demographic and treatment exposure covariates on the efficacy response.

The  overall Pearson's correlation coefficients  between  efficacy  endpoints  and  exposure  PK parameters were negative indicating a trend of increasing efficacy (decreased weekly episode count rates and  CNS-LS  scores)  with  increasing  PK  exposure. The  correlation coefficients  were statistically significantly different from zero, except for between episode count and DX and Q PK parameters.

Pearson's correlation coefficients between PK parameters and efficacy responses:

|                  |    | EpisodeCount   | CNS-LSScore   |
|------------------|----|----------------|---------------|
| Dextromethorphan | C  | -0.1039*       | -0.2586*      |

As study 07-AVR-123 was considered by CHMP as the only pivotal study, it was evaluated in light of the requirements laid out in the CHMP Points to Consider document on 1. Meta-Analyses; 2. One Pivotal Study (CPMPEWP/2330/99).

As  both  pre-specified  and  post-hoc  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoints  revealed  statistically significant results favouring the higher strength and exploratory pk/pd analyses were (only weakly) indicative  of an association between higher plasma exposure and lower episode rates and CNS-LS scores, respectively, it is not excluded that the higher strength might possibly provide incremental efficacy  compared  to  the  lower  strength.  For  some  other  efficacy  parameters,  results  of  both strengths  reveal  generally  similar  results,  however  in  the  large  number  of  analyses  performed, statistically  significant  differences  in  efficacy  results  favoured  the  higher  (DM30/Q10)  dose strength. For  the  DM  30  mg/Q  10  mg group, the applicant also submitted the finding of a slightly higher percentage  of  subjects  achieving  onset  of  action  within  2  weeks,  earlier  time  to  a  statistically significant  difference  in  the  number  of  episode  free  days  and  a  slightly  higher  clinical  response. However,  the  percentages  of  patients  with  onset  of  action  within  2  weeks  was  rather  similar (74.8%  for  the  higher  and  73.7%  for  the  lower  dose  group,  respectively),  and  earlier  time  to relevant  differences  in  efficacy  for  the  higher  dose  strength  might  also  be  due  to  faster achievement of sufficient plasma levels of DM in the higher dose group. Overall, the presented analyses provide some evidence for a separation of the dose groups for the two  main  efficacy  endpoints,  with  several  sensitivity  efficacy  analyses  statistically  favouring  the higher DM dose (see further, efficacy discussion). 2.5.2.

## Study 07-AVR-123

A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, Multicenter Study to assess the safety,  efficacy  and  pharmacokinetics  of  two  doses  of  AVP-923  (Dextromethorphan/Quinidine 30mg/10mg  and  20mg/10mg)  in  the treatment of Pseudobulbar Affect in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis.

## Methods

## Study Participants

The key inclusion criteria required the following:

-  A clinical history of PBA
-  Coexistent major systemic diseases that would interfere with interpretation of the results of the study (e.g., malignancy, poorly controlled diabetes, ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease)

 A Center for Neurologic Studies-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) score ≥ 13 at Baseline  An electrocardiogram (ECG) with no evidence of the following: -Second or third degree heart block. -Prolongation of QTc interval (  450 msec males or  470 msec females) -Ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopic beats (&gt;5 VEs per minute).  Stable  hematologic,  hepatic,  and  renal  function,  with  no  clinically  significant symptoms, as determined by standard laboratory tests (complete blood count, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) up to 1-fold higher than the upper limit of the normal range.  Resting respiratory rate between 12 and 20 breaths per minute.  Resting diurnal oxygen saturation ≥ 95%.  Patients  taking selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs)  for  the treatment of depression for at least 3 months before entering the study were allowed  to  participate  in  the  study.    The  SSRI  antidepressant  dose  was  to remain  unchanged  during  the  course  of  the  study.    Only  10%  of  subjects enrolled  in  the  study  were  to  be  concurrently  taking  an  SSRI.    If  this percentage was surpassed, the further inclusion of subjects taking SSRIs was to be limited.  Did not exhibit current symptoms of a depressive disorder.  Score ≤ 19 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Except for the underlying neurological disorder, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar in Studies 07-AVR-123, 99-AVR-102 and 02-AVR-106. The inclusion criteria in  the  3  studies  also  required  that  male  or  female  patients  be  18 years  or older; maximum age: 80 years (studies 07-AVR-123, 99-AVR-102) and 68 years (study 02-AVR106), respectively. Females  must  either  have  been  practicing  an  established  method  of  birth  control  for  at  least 1 month before study entry or be surgically sterile or postmenopausal.  Women of child-bearing potential were required to have a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 of the study before the distribution of study drug. Main exclusion criteria (similar in studies 07-AVR-123 , 99-AVR-102 and 02-AVR-106):  History of ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes, Severe and/or unstable pulmonary disease Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Myasthenia gravis, Current history of major depression, or current or prior history of major psychiatric  disturbance,  including  bipolar  disorder,  schizophrenia,  somatoform  disorders, and borderline personality disorder
-  Hypotension (systolic blood pressure  &lt;100 mm Hg), history of postural syncope, or any history of unexplained syncope (to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Disallowed  concomitant  medications  comprised  substances  that  may  increase/decrease  quinidine levels,  that  may  have  increased  plasma  levels  if  co-administered  with  quinidine  or  that  may decrease  dextromethorphan  and  quinidine  plasma  levels.  These  included  TCA,  SNRI,  Quinidine, Dextromethorphan  and  MAOIs  (the  latter  because  of  the  risk  of  serotonin  syndrome  when  coadministered with dextromethorphan). Oral steroids at stable doses were allowed.

## Treatments

Double-blind phase:

-  AVP-923-30 capsules (30 mg DM/10 mg Q), orally every 12 hours
-  AVP-923-20 capsules (20 mg DM/10 mg Q), orally every 12 hours
-  In addition, burden on the caregiver was assessed. The Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) was administered to the caregiver (when applicable) at baseline and at study end.

<!-- image -->

 Placebo capsules Open-label phase:  AVP-923-30 capsules (30 mg DM/10 mg Q), orally every 12 hours Objectives The objectives of the double blind (DB) phase of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and  efficacy  of  2  different  doses  of  AVP-923  compared  with  placebo,  for  the  treatment  of pseudobulbar  affect  over  a  12-week  period  in  a  population  of  patients  with  amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). An  additional objective was  to determine  the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the 2 doses of AVP -923 in a subset of the study population. The objective of the open label extension (OLE) phase of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety of AVP-923-30 (capsules containing 30 mg Dextromethorphan and 10 mg Quinidine) during a 12-week period in subjects who completed the DB phase. Outcomes/endpoints For the DB phase, the primary endpoint used to determine efficacy was  the number of episodes of laughing and/or crying. The analysis was based on the changes from baseline in episode rates as recorded daily in the subject diary. Secondary endpoints were:  Mean change in CNS-LS score for the assessment of PBA status.  Mean change in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)  Mean change in the SF-36 Health Survey Medical Outcomes (SF-36)  Mean change in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)  Mean change in Pain Rating Scale (PRS) score in MS subjects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Efficacy assessments during the OLE phase were limited to CNS-LS score.

Safety  was  assessed  by  reported  AEs,  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  electrocardiograms  (ECGs), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and physical examinations. Genotyping was used to classify subjects as either  poor  or  extensive  metabolisers  of  DM.  After  the  study  was  completed  and  data  were unblinded,  the  frequency  and  type  of  SAEs  or  AEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  were  assessed  in subjects classified  as  poor  metabolisers  among  subjects  taking AVP-923 compared with subjects taking placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Along with the efficacy analysis, at days 29 and 57 all subjects had a blood sample collected for PK analysis. This was done up to 3 hours following the morning dose. 24 subjects on the study have instead of the single PK sample had their full PK profiles described. This was done at Day 29 visit, by sampling the blood at 15 minutes prior and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the morning dose. PK sampling and analysis were performed only during the double blind period of the study. From these samples plasma levels of Dextromethorphan, Dextrorphan and Quinidine were assayed for determination of Cmax, Tmax and AUC0-12.

In  addition  to  the  main  efficacy  assessment  and  the  PK  assessment,  the  Cytochrome  P450  2D6 genotyping was carried out at baseline for each subject.

## Sample size

The primary outcome was the additional reduction (treatment effect) in episode rates experienced in  the  overall  study  population  with  AVP-923-30  relative  to  placebo.  For  the  primary  efficacy analysis, a longitudinal random effects negative binomial model, assuming constant dispersion, was used  to  appropriately  incorporate  and  adjust  for  (a)  differences  between  subjects  in  underlying susceptibility to PBA laughing and crying episodes, (b) differences between average pre-treatment and post-treatment episode rates, and (c) the correlation between episode counts within a single subject. Independent variables in the model included treatment (AVP-923-30 vs. placebo and AVP923-20 vs. placebo), period (before or after treatment), underlying disease diagnosis (ALS vs. MS) and site (with small sites pooled). A variation of the primary random effects longitudinal analysis described above was completed using site category (U.S. vs. Latin America) instead of individual or pooled sites. These primary analyses compared trends in episode rate for each AVP-923 dose and the  placebo  group;  additional  exploratory  analyses  compared  efficacy  trends  within  subsets (ALS/MS; U.S./Latin America) of the entire study population.

Planned for DB phase: 306 subjects (180 subjects with ALS and 126 subjects with MS) Planned for OLE phase: (no planned number of subjects) Analysed for DB phase: 326 subjects randomised (197 with ALS and 129 with MS), 326 treated, and 283 completed Analysed  for  OLE  phase:  253  subjects  (146  subjects  with  ALS  and  107  subjects  with  MS);  235 completed Randomisation Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to the 3 different treatment groups (DM30/Q10, DM20/Q10 and placebo group). Blinding (masking) The blinding procedures were standard and adequate. Statistical methods The primary efficacy analysis was based on the changes from baseline in laughing/crying episode rates recorded in the subject diary and estimated using a longitudinal negative binomial regression model on the daily episode counts. Daily laughing/crying episode counts were recorded in subject daily diaries. A baseline daily episode count was calculated based on a subject's pre-treatment entries recorded at  the  baseline  visit.  The  number  of  pre-treatment  days  (between  4  and  7)  with  non-missing episode counts were determined, as well as the total number of reported episodes over those days. In most cases, episode counts were the total number of laughing and/or crying episodes reported and  analysed  as  a  rate  expressed  as  episodes  per  day.  Daily  episode  rates  at  each  visit  were determined as averages using all available non-missing counts for the previous 7 days. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two sensitivity analyses were completed for the primary endpoint. The first was a Non-longitudinal negative binomial (constant dispersion) model analysis of the sums of the episode counts, with an offset based on the number of non-missing diary days. This matched the analyses that were done for previous studies. This model incorporated the baseline episode rate as a covariate. This analysis was  also  completed  for  laughing  episodes  and  for  crying  episodes  considered  separately.  The second sensitivity analysis used a generalised estimating equation (GEE) model for daily episode rate  assuming  a  negative  binomial  distribution  function  and  a  compound  symmetry  correlation variance structure.

An additional analysis of the primary outcome compared the mean change in daily episode rates (laughing and crying combined and separately) from baseline to Day 84 for the AVP-923-30 group vs. placebo and for the AVP-923-20 group vs. placebo using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Similar analyses compared the mean change in daily episode rates from baseline to each visit, overall and by region (U.S./Latin America) and by diagnosis within each region.

## Recruitment

The DB phase of the study was conducted at 52 sites, 36 in the United States and  16 in Latin America (11 in Argentina and 5 in Brazil). In addition a total of 22 sites enrolled at least 1 subject; 18 sites were in the U.S., and 4 were in Israel. Overall, 326 subjects were randomized, 110 were assigned to AVP-923-30, 107 to AVP-923-20, and 109 to placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  DB  phase,  more subjects overall had a diagnosis of ALS (60.4%) than MS (39.6%). This distribution of subjects with ALS and MS was similar across treatment groups: in the AVP-923-30 group,  59.1%  of  subjects  had  ALS  (vs.  40.9%  with  MS),  in  the  AVP-923-20  group,  63.6%  of subjects had ALS (vs. 36.4% with MS), and in the placebo group, 58.7% of subjects had ALS (vs. 41.3% with MS).

The  majority  of  subjects  were  Caucasian,  with  percentages  of  Caucasian  subjects  ranging  from 72.7% in the AVP-923-30 group to 76.1% in the placebo group. Hispanics accounted for the next highest percentage of subjects, ranging from 19.1% in the AVP-923-30 group to 19.6% in the AVP923-20  group.  Subjects  from  other  ethnic  groups  did  not  exceed  more  than  5.5%  in  any  one treatment group.

Demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects in the OLE phase of the study were similar to those of subjects in the DB phase.

The applicant was requested to clarify how this reflected an EU population: while the EU population has  a  larger  proportion  of  individuals  of  Asian  descent  then  the  US,  and  the  US  has  larger proportion of individuals descended from the Native (North and South) American populations, there is no evidence that these differences in this case would result in significant difference in the safety and efficacy. The potentially most important issue would be the phenotypical differences in activity of CYP2D6, and these differences are minimal. The applicant submitted a number of publications supporting this. The impact of racial origin is discussed in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In the open label phase the study was conducted in 45 sites, 31 in the United States and 14 in Latin America. A total of 253 subjects were enrolled in the OLE phase. As in the DB phase, more subjects had a diagnosis of ALS (146 subjects, 57.7%) than MS (107 subjects, 42.3%). A total of 235 subjects (92.9%) completed the OLE phase of the study, and 18 (7.1%) withdrew. Conduct of the study Across  both  phases  of  the  study,  1019  protocol  deviations  were  reported.  The  study  report classifies them as:  'Other,' including missing assessments or assessments performed out of the specified time window (939 deviations).  Subjects who entered the study even though they did not meet all the inclusion criteria (45 deviations).  Subjects who received an excluded concomitant treatment (19 deviations).  Subjects who received the wrong study treatment or an incorrect dose (9 deviations).  Subjects who were not withdrawn from the study even though they developed withdrawal criteria during the study (7 deviations).

One site in Brazil (site 301) was found to be not GCP and study procedure compliant. This site was further audited by the applicant and full quality control check was carried out. These checks have identified a number  of issues including inconsistent and missing data. However,  not all inconsistencies were resolved prior to database lock. The site has been subsequently investigated by  the  National  Health  Surveillance  Agency  of  Brazil  (Agência  Nacional  de  Vigilância  Sanitária; ANVISA).  The  findings  were  not  available  at  the  time  of  writing  of  this  report.  To  address  the impact of the data generated by this site, an alternative efficacy sensitivity analysis was performed by the CRO. The conclusions were that as the subject enrollment at Site 301 was evenly distributed among treatment groups, efficacy analyses were not significantly affected. This was acceptable to CHMP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A number of deviations to the statistical analysis plan were implemented subsequently to database lock.  The  level  and  nature  of  protocol  deviations  is  considered  acceptable.  The  integrity  of  the study results was not jeopardised.

## Baseline data

There were no relevant demographic differences between the treatment groups.

Somewhat more female patients were included in study 07-AVR-123 (54% female and 46% male patients, respectively).

The majority of patients was Caucasian (74.5%).

The majority of subjects did not use tobacco, drink alcohol, or abuse substances. The proportion of subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder ranged from 19.3% in the placebo group to 22.7% in the DM30mg/Q10mg treatment group.

During the OLE phase, the most frequently used classes of concomitant medications were vitamins (used by 44% of subjects), 'other nervous system drugs' (40% of subjects), psycholeptics (34% of  subjects),  and  muscle  relaxants  (33%  of  subjects).  Approximately  29%  of  subjects  used immunostimulants, consisting of interferons (13%) and other cytokines/immunomodulators (16%). About 25% of subjects used psychoanaleptics, mostly centrally acting sympathomimetics (7.5%) and SSRIs (7.1%). Twenty-four percent of subjects used analgesics, primarily anilides (15%).

Concomitant Medications During the DB phase, the most frequently used classes of concomitant medications were vitamins (used by 46-50% of subjects), 'other nervous system drugs' (36-48% of subjects), psycholeptics (33-42% of subjects), and muscle relaxants (30-39% of subjects). Psychoanaleptics were used by 28%  to  33%  of  subjects,  and  the  subclassifications  of  this  class  of  drugs  taken  by  the  most subjects were SSRIs (9-13%) and centrally acting sympathomimetics (7-10%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The use of SSRIs and TCAs was analysed more in depth by CHMP, as, so far, treatment efforts of PBA have mainly employed SSRIs (particularly fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine and citalopram),  TCAs  (particularly  amitriptyline  and  nortriptyline),  the  antiParkinsonian  therapies levodopa and amantadine and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; protirelin) [Miller (2006), Pioro

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(2011), Garnock-Jones (2011)], although none of these substances is authorised for treatment of PBA in Europe or the US.

In study 07-AVR -123, the use of SSRI was per protocol limited to 10% of patients and was equally distributed  across  treatment  groups  (and  numerically  slightly  in  favour  of  the  placebo  group). During the OLE phase of the study, use of SSRI was even lower (7.1%) than in the double-blind study phase (9-13%).

There were no relevant differences between the different treatment groups with respect to 'other antidepressants' (5.5% and 7.5% in active treatment groups, 7.3% in placebo group); the same was seen with respect to 'thyroid hormones (7.5% and 11.8% in active treatment groups, 10.1% in  placebo  group)  and  with  concomitant  use  of  adamantane  derivatives,  dopa/-derivatives  and dopamine agonists (2.85% and 4.5% in active treatment groups, 6.4% in placebo group).

These  findings  were  corroborated  by  the  first  sensitivity  analysis  (using  the  non-longitudinal negative binomial model). Results of a second sensitivity analysis using the GEE model were also in favour of the active treatment groups but reached statistical significance only for the higher dose strength.    Further  evaluations  of  PBA  episode  rate  in  the  overall  study  population  were  also consistent with the finding of the primary analysis.

With  respect  to  other  concomitant  medication  (which  are  not  considered  to  potentially  influence PBA), no substantial differences were seen between treatment groups. Numbers analysed For  the  DB  phase  of  the  study,  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were conducted using the ITT (326 patients) and EE (293 patients) populations. 41 patients (27 subjects in the active treatment groups) consented to participate in PK plasma profiles at Day 29. PRS was only analysed in subjects with MS (129 patients). For the OLE phase of the study, the ITT population, consisting of all enrolled (253) subjects, was analyzed for efficacy of AVP-923-30. As this was considered by CHMP the only the pivotal study, the numbers are rather low. However, statistical significance has been achieved in the analysis. Outcomes and estimation Primary Endpoint: With  respect  to  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  i.e.  change  in  PBA  episode  rates,  both  active treatment groups (DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg and DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg) showed a greater and statistically significant  (p  &lt;  0.0001)  improvement  compared  to  placebo  using  the  ITT  as  well  as  the  EE population  in  the  pre-specified  primary  analysis  using  the  longitudinal  binomial  model.    The incremental  reduction  of  PBA  episodes  relative  to  placebo  was  47%  (DM30/Q10)  and  49% (DM20/Q10). Medicinal product no longer authorised

While the study was not powered to show efficacy based upon underlying disorder the following was found for each population studied:

For ALS patients results were generally in accordance with the results of the whole population.

For MS patients separately (who comprised ~40% of the total study sample), the primary analysis showed a significant treatment effect only for the higher dose strength, while for the DM20/Q10 dose strength the episode rate appeared numerically slightly inferior to placebo. However, results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from the random effects model for number of episodes showed significantly lower episodes for both dose groups of DM/Q for MS patients (each with p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, in both pre-specified sensitivity analyses, results for MS patients were numerically in favour of active treatment for both dose strengths and just missed statistical significance in the GEE analysis.

Study 07-AVR-123 was not designed to examine laughing episodes separately from crying episodes (laughing and crying episodes comprise the primary manifestation of PBA), therefore a full set of statistical analyses, including the primary analysis method, was not originally applied separately to laughing  and  crying.  Following  questions  from  CHMP,  the  Applicant  undertook  the  statistical analysis of 07-AVR-123 utilizing the primary longitudinal analysis specified for all episodes in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan.    For  both  crying  and  laughing  the  results  analysed  separately  were  in accordance with the overall results.

Secondary endpoints Decreases  in  CNS-LS  total  scores  were  greater  in  both  active  treatment  groups  compared  to placebo during all study visits, the differences being statistically significant for the higher (DM 30/Q 10) dose strength at all visits and for the lower (DM 20/Q10) dose strength at days 57 and 84, but not at the earlier visits at Day 15 and 29. The mean improvement in CNS-LS from baseline to day 84 was approx. 2.5-point higher in the active treatment compared to the placebo group. While  the  results  of  the  CNS-LS  score  were  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy parameter and the mean change in BDI-II total scores was significantly in favour of the higher dose strength, the other secondary efficacy parameters were either only significant in individual summary scores or sub-scores, respectively. However, the relative short treatment duration (12 weeks) and the underlying diseases may also have contributed to these results. No global scale assessing Quality of Life has been evaluated in this study, but health status was measured using the SF-36 as a secondary efficacy variable. Statistically significant differences in mean changes in individual components of the SF-36 scores were shown between the DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg group and the  placebo  group  for  social  functioning  (p  =  0.0033),  mental  health  (p  =  0.0028),  and  mental component (p = 0.0428). No other differences in mean changes in individual components of SF-36 scores were statistically significant. Caregiver  strain  index  (CSI)  was  only  performed  when  applicable  and  thus  in  a  minority  of patients.  Only raw data were submitted, and an analysis was requested during the procedure. A slight, non-significant numeric trend for both DM/Q dose groups to less caregiver strain during the course of the study, with an opposite trend in the placebo group, was found. Pharmacokinetic Results Plasma concentrations for Dextromethorphan (DM), Dextrorphan(DX) and Quinidine (Q), respectively by visit (sparse sampling) showed concentrations of DM ranging from highest in the slow metabolizers to lowest in the ultra-rapid metabolizers, and the opposite findings for DX, as expected.

For PK profiles over time data were only available for 27 subjects who received their assigned active treatment on day 29. It was not possible to robustly evaluate the PK parameters of DM, DX, and Q by genotyping groups since the PK population consisted either solely (DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg) or mostly (DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg) of extensive metabolizers.

The CHMP concluded that because of the existence of poor and rapid metabolisers the availability of two doses can nevertheless be beneficial for the clinician in practical terms. As per the results from sparse  PK  sampling  (Day  57)  following  plasma  concentrations  respond  to  the  steady  state twice a day dosing:

| Rapid Metabolisers | 78 ng/mL (n=83) | 39 ng/mL (n=3)  |

The cautious pace of uptitration is also acceptable in view of the non-life-threatening nature of PBA.

In women a higher plasma exposure with DM and Q was seen compared to male subjects.

The applicant was requested to evaluate the efficacy data of study 07-AVR-123 in male subjects separately. The separate analyses of male patients showed that the results were consistent with the overall study results (ITT population) as well as the PK modeling results in which gender was a nonsignificant covariate in all models, underscoring the lack of a gender effect for efficacy. Efficacy in men appeared to be larger at the higher dose (DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg) which is consistent with the higher plasma concentrations at that dose. The dose regimen recommended in the SmPC allows for dose escalation from DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg to DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg in case of insufficient efficacy. Open label extension phase of study 07-AVR-123 Efficacy during the open-label phase was measured by CNS-LS. For the OLE phase of the study, analysis of CNS-LS total score revealed statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) decreases from (OLE phase) baseline at all study visits (Days 15, 42, and 84) when analysing all subjects, regardless of which treatment group they had been in during the DB phase. CNS-LS scores during the OLE phase plotted over time by previous treatment groups are presented in the following figure: Medicinal product no longer authorised 16 14 10

Decrease from baseline in CNS-LS scores were seen for ALS as well as for MS patients.

The CHMP concluded that although efficacy during the OLE phase of study 07-AVR-123 has only been measured by CNS-LS and taking the into consideration the naturally limited value of open

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

label studies with respect to efficacy, the presented data are nevertheless indicative of maintenance of effect at least of the 30 mg dose strength for a total of 6 months.

## Ancillary analyses

## Study 07-AVR-123 (double blind phase):

## Time to onset of action

Onset of action was defined as the time at which a subject achieved a 30% decrease from baseline in the laughing and crying episode count.

As early as Week 1 (Day 7), 74.8%, 73.7%, and 57.3% of subjects experienced a 30% decrease from baseline in laughing and crying episodes, in the DM30/Q10, DM20/Q10, and placebo groups, respectively. The differences between the DM30/Q10 and placebo group and the DM20/Q10 group and placebo group were statistically significant (p = 0.0108 and p = 0.0167, respectively).

'Number  of  episode  free  days',  'remission'  and  'clinical  response'  are  considered  parameters indicative of clinical meaningfulness and the respective results are in favour of active treatment.

Number of episode free days: At every time point, the mean number of days free from episodes of laughing or crying was greater in  the  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  differences  between  the DM30/Q10 group and placebo group and between the DM20/Q10 group and placebo group were statistically  significant  at  all  time  points  (range  of  p  values:  0.0123  to  0.0002),  except  for  the difference between the DM20/Q10 group and placebo group at Visit 2 (Day 15). Percentage of subjects showing remission (no episodes during the last 14 days of study participation) and Clinical Response (40% decrease in episode rate) : Results  at  the  end-of-study  visit  (including  subjects  who  completed  Day  84  and  subjects  who discontinued early from the study) were comparable. Medicinal product no longer authorised [1] [2]

The finding, that the number of episode free days became statistically significant already at Visit 2 (after  14  days)  in  the  DM30/Q10  group  compared to  placebo, whereas  a statistical significant difference  for  the  DM  20/Q  10  dose  group  compared  to  placebo  was  reached  at  Visit  3  (after  4 weeks). This was interpreted by the applicant as indicative of a higher efficacy of the higher dose strength. However, this result may also be due to faster achievement of sufficient plasma levels of DM in the high dose group, whereas in the SmPC a slow titration (after 1 week of DM20/Q10 o.d. and 3 weeks of DM20/Q10 bid) is proposed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finding that clinical response at Day 84 (and end-of study-visit, respectively) was statistically in favour of active treatment only for the higher dose strength, provides an indication of a possibly higher efficacy of the higher dose strength. However, this finding has to be balanced in the context of  other  comparisons  for  the  efficacy  of  the  two  dose  strengths  that  have  not  demonstrated  a categorical dose response relationship. In summary, taking supporting arguments into consideration which indicate higher efficacy of the higher Nuedexta dose, it appears reasonable to conclude that the DM/Q 30/10 mg dose of Nuedexta might lead to higher efficacy compared to the DM/Q 20/10 mg dose at least in some patients. Results for remission were very similar for both DM/Q dose strength and significantly in favour of each DM/Q group compared to placebo.

## Episode Rates by diagnosis and by SSRI usage

The random effects analysis of episode rates by SSRI usage did not show a significant difference between patients with or without SSRI usage. The random effects analysis of episode rates by primary diagnosis (ALS, MS) led the CHMP to question  the  assumption  that  the  effect  of  DM/Q  on  PBA  can  be  extrapolated  to  all  possible underlying etiologies. This was discussed at the Oral explanation. The pathophysiology of PBA is incompletely understood and the proposed mechanism of action of DM/Q on PBA is speculative. PBA  occurs  in  association  with  a  wide  range  of  underlying  conditions  that  vary  considerably  in terms of pathophysiology, anatomy of neurological damage, age of onset and disease progression. In contrast, there does seem to be a reasonable level of consistency in PBA symptoms in patients regardless of the underlying pathology. CHMP agreed that Nuedexta is a product for symptomatic treatment  only  and  there  is  no  suggestion  it  has  an  effect  on  the  underlying  pathology.  The assessment of the applicant response showed that efficacy was shown in both ALS and MS, which are  also  two  different  models  of  pathologically  unrelated  disorders,  and  this  supports  the extrapolation to other causes of PBA. While it was agreed to put no restriction of the indication to MS and ALS,  the  prescribers  are  informed  of  the  limitations  of  the  information  gathered  in  the development plan (SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1). In addition, the definition of PBA, based on the pivotal efficacy study inclusion criteria, is provided in section 4.4 of the SPC. CNS-LS by Diagnosis and SSRI usage Results from the analysis using the ITT population by primary disease indicate that subjects with ALS diagnosis showed a statistically significant  decrease  in  CNS-LS  total  scores  due  to  AVP-923 when  compared  to  placebo  at  all  time  points  and  subjects  with  MS  showed,  at  almost  all  time points, greater decreases in scores in the AVP-923 treatment groups compared with the placebo group, although the differences did not always meet statistical significance.

As  only  26  patients  with concomitant  SSRI were  included  in  the  pivotal  study,  no  robust assessment  of  efficacy  of  Nuedexta  in  patients  with  concomitant  SSRI  was  possible.  Data  are however indicative of efficacy of Nuedexta in patients with concomitant SSRI intake (no significant differences in efficacy with regard to episode rate and CNS-LS during double-blind treatment phase in patients with vs. without SSRI; magnitude of effect at different time points regarding change in CNS-LS among patients with SSRI within similar range compared to patients without SSRI). The Applicant also provided sufficient justification that 35 mg paroxetine (the maximum dose advised in the SmPC) would not reach steady state concentrations of the highest recommended paroxetine dose  of  60  mg  when  co-administered  with  DM  30mg/Q  10  mg  or  DM  20  mg/Q10  mg  and  is therefore safe.

Therefore, the concomitant use of Nuedexta and SSRI is considered adequately justified, and the SmPC  contains  adequate  information  on  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  SSRI  and Nuedexta, giving recommendations on reduction of SSRI dose as well as adequate warning on the possibility of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when Nuedexta is used concomitantly with SSRI.

As the metabolites of Q and DM are eliminated mainly through urinary excretion, the safety and PK of DM 30 mg/ Q 30 mg were studied in patients with renal impairment (Study 04-AVR-116) . Study 04-AVR-116 (renal impairment study) has been conducted with a different formulation (30/30 mg) than the to-be-marketed formulation. This was considered acceptable as high Q doses implicate higher DM plasma level.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) As there is only one efficacy study where the medication used was representative of the proposed product, the pooled efficacy analysis is not applicable.

The  statistical  analysis  showed  no  statistically  relevant  changes  in  plasma  PK  parameters  in patients with moderate to mild renal function impairment for DM. Although the 90% CI were rather wide, the point estimates were within classic acceptance criteria. The point estimates for the metabolite DX is significantly raised, as in the moderate impairment group the AUC and Cmax are doubled. No  change  in  dosing  is  required  for  patients  with  moderate  to  mild  renal  impairment as  the increased DX levels are not accompanied to higher incidence of AEs.  Nuedexta should not be used in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment,  as  the  safety  of  DM/Q  has  not  been  studied  in  these patients. A warning for severely renally impaired patients is included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.  Impaired hepatic function The results of Study 04-AVR-115 showed that changes in plasma PK parameters in patients with moderate to mild hepatic function impairment were minor and clinically insignificant: The  ratios  of  point  estimates  AUC 0-t and  Cmax  of  DM  and  DX  were  within  80-125%.  The  point estimates    and  the  90%  CI  AUC  and  C max (unbound  to  protein)  were  not  within  these  limits. However the increase was about 30% which is considered not clinically relevant. No change in AVP-923 dosing is therefore required for patients with moderate to mild or moderate hepatic impairment, however, the frequency of AEs in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was  slightly increased in comparison  with  healthy  subjects  or  patients with mild hepatic impairment. Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  should  be  closely monitored during treatment. This is reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2). Concerning patients with severe hepatic impairment, section 4.2 also states: Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C)  or  severe  renal  impairment (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the potential risks associated with the use of this medicine should be assessed against the medical need (see section 5.2).

##  Gender

CYP2D6 is known to have a gender dependent activity. PK results  for  men  and  women  showed lower mean Cmax and AUC0-12 values of plasma DM and Q for the male subjects in study 07-AVR123. However the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no apparent gender differences in the  pharmacokinetics.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  inhibition  of  CYP2D6  which  overrides  the anticipated gender effect.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Race

Due to the differences in the distribution of CYP2D6 genotype within different races,  an ethnicity effect could be expected.

Therefore race was included as covariate in the Pop PK analysis studies 04-AVR-117 and 09-AVR127. However the population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no apparent racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of DM. Again, this can be explained by the overriding inhibition of CYP2D6 over a race effect.

##  Weight

The  results  of  Pop  PK  analysis  revealed  that  there  was  no  significant  correlation  between  the covariates of height, weight, body mass index.

 Elderly Patients  up  82  years  of  age  were  assessed  in  the  clinical  efficacy  studies.  It  was  found  in  a population pharmacokinetic analysis that the pharmacokinetics are similar in subjects &lt;65 years and those ≥ 65 years of age. Age played a significant role on the volume of distribution of DX but not of DM. The  apparent  increase  in  the  central  volume  of  distribution  of  DX  (Vc/Fm)  associated  with increasing age is likely a reflection of a decrease in the terminal elimination rate constant because total clearance (CLT) is unaffected by age in the population of patients and healthy subjects.  Children No data is available in the paediatric population. This is acceptable for this indication. Supportive study(ies) In addition to the pivotal efficacy study, the applicant is listing three more studies, in support of the claim of efficacy. However, none of the supportive studies can be used as direct evidence of efficacy  of  the  product  submitted  for  marketing  as  the  strengths  used  in  these  studies  are  not representative of the proposed product. Supportive Study 99-AVR-102 This  was  a  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  of  ALS subjects with pseudobulbar affect. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to receive AVP-923 (30 mg DM and 30 mg Q), or 30 mg DM, or 30 mg Q. The objectives of this study were to compare and evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination of 30 mg Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide  and 30 mg Quinidine Sulfate (AVP-923) taken  twice  daily  relative  to  30  mg  DM  and  to  30  mg  Q  taken  individually  in  a  population  of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) subjects with pseudobulbar affect. Medicinal product no longer authorised

While  the  findings  for  CNS-LS  which  was  the  primary  outcome  measure,  were  found  to  be significantly  better  for  AVP-923,  the  study  report  states  that  results  for  counts  of  laughing  and crying  were  influenced  by  'substantial  overdispersion'  of  data.  Only  after  adjusting  for  this,  the results showed statistically significant improvement.

The primary outcome measure in this study - CNS-LS has demonstrated improvement. The CHMP accepts the statistical approach to the analysis of data obtained by counting laughing and crying episodes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study was of a shorter investigation period than the other two sponsored efficacy studies. The main problem for interpretation of results here, as in 02-AVR-106, is the selection of the strength. The dose of Quinidine (30mg b.d.) used in this study (as per the findings in the study 99-AVR100) indicate that this daily dose of Quinidine provides over 1.6 times higher total exposure to Dextromethorphan than with Quinidine 10mg twice daily (the strength intended for marketing).

Despite the difficulty  in  extrapolating  the  results  to  the  target  populations,  the  main  conclusion that  can  be  drawn  from  this  study  is  the  superiority  of  the  combination  compared  to  the components. In that respect the results from this study can be accepted as supportive of the claim for efficacy.

## Supportive Study 02-AVR-106

This  was  a  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  the  treatment  of pseudobulbar affect in MS subjects with AVP-923 administered orally, up to 2 times a day (every 12 hours). The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerance,  and  efficacy  of  AVP-923 (capsules  containing  dextromethorphan  hydrobromide  30  mg  and  quinidine  sulfate  30  mg), compared  with  placebo,  for  the  treatment  of  pseudobulbar  affect  over  a  12-week  period  in  a population of subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). Subjects treated with AVP-923 experienced approximately half as many episodes of inappropriate laughing,  crying,  and  laughing  and  crying  as  subjects  receiving  placebo;  the  number  of  these episodes was significantly lower in the AVP-923 group than the placebo group (all p ≤ 0.0077). The  results  for  both  CNS-LS  and  L/C  episode  counts  show  statistically  significant  improvement over  the  placebo.  CNS-LS  can  be  regarded  as  validated  instrument,  while  counting  of  the  PBA episodes is not. The study report deals with this issue. The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  clinical  interpretation  of  the  findings  in  this  study.  There  is  a  clear correlation  between  improvement  in  CNS-LS  and  L/C  episodes  counts.  Secondary  efficacy measures were also at least statistically significant. The report, however, does not elaborate on the effect of the change in the primary efficacy measure to quality of life. The results of this study are supportive of the claim of efficacy in of AVP-923 in PBA. The selection of the strength is the main factor complicating the interpretation of results. As already pointed out the used dose of Quinidine (30mg b.d.) as per the PK findings and in particular findings in the study 99-AVR-100 indicate that this daily dose provides over 1.6 times higher total exposure of Dextromethorphan than with Quinidine 10gm b.d., which is the strength intended for marketing. Supportive Study CNS-93 Medicinal product no longer authorised

This was a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, single centre study in patients experiencing emotional  lability  associated  with  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis,  multiple  sclerosis,  or  stroke. Patients were randomised into two groups in a 1:1 ratio of active drug to placebo. The 9-week study had two 4-week double-blind Treatment Periods separated by a 1-week Washout Period.

The primary objective was to determine if a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine was effective  in  suppressing  or  eliminating  emotional  lability  (pseudobulbar  affect)  in  patients  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis or stroke.

This study can be regarded as the proof of concept study for the current programme. The number of  patients  was  small  (12)  mainly  with  underlying  Amyotrophic  Lateral  Sclerosis,  the  primary efficacy measure was an experimental instrument (65 item questionnaire). It was not sponsored by the applicant, but conducted by the investigator who subsequently obtained a US patent for efficacy  of  Dextromethorphan  /  Quinidine  combination  in  treatment  of  emotional  lability.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strength used in this study (Dextromethorphan / Quinidine 30mg / 75mg) was not representative of the strength intended for marketing now.

While  the  study  report  concludes  that  the  findings  are  evidence  of  statistically  significant effectiveness  of  the  DM/Q  combination  in  treatment  of  pseudobulbar  affect  in  patients  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, considering the methods and medication strengths and doses, this study is of limited relevance in support of the current claim of efficacy.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

All  efficacy  studies  were  carried  out  outside  the  EU.  The  applicant  has  provided  the  requested information and reassurances regarding the applicability to the EU populations. The general methodology in the efficacy studies, including statistical approaches, was standard and acceptable. Only one of the three sponsored efficacy studies (07-AVR-123) was regarded as fully relevant to assessment of efficacy for the product intended for marketing. The other two sponsored efficacy studies  (99-AVR-102  and  02-AVR-106)  evaluated  a  higher  strength  product,  with  respect  to  Q content (DM/Q 30/30), than Nuedexta as proposed for marketing, and are regarded as supportive. As 07-AVR-123 was considered by CHMP as the only pivotal study, it was evaluated in light of the requirements  laid  out  in  the  CHMP  Points  to  Consider  document  on  1.  Meta-Analyses;  2.  One Pivotal Study (CPMPEWP/2330/99). It is considered that it fulfils the requirement for demonstration of efficacy in the submitted indication. Outcome measures The primary outcome measure in the pivotal study - the count of the episodes of laughing and crying  is  not  a  validated  instrument.  The  correlation  between  'Count  of  Episodes'  and  CNS-LS (analysed  in  the  response  submission)  is  encouraging  but  the  process  of  collecting  'Count  of Episodes' was not regarded as robust due to the poor demarcation of one episode from another. Count of symptom free days and 'remission rate' were regarded as more reliable indicators that can be extracted from the collected trial data. The results were statistically significant, but this data has relatively poor correlation (-0.48 and -0.43 respectively) to the validated CNS-LS. The pivotal study included the validated CNS-LS as one of the secondary outcome measure. The CHMP  considered  the  CNS-LS  more  useful  than  'Count  of  Episodes'.  All  efficacy  analyses  and discussions have been strengthened with the analyses based on CNS-LS.

The  pivotal  study  was  performed  with  the  combinations  Dextromethorphan/Quinidine  30/10  mg and 20/10 mg. While the applicant justified the choice of dose of Quinidine (see the PK section of this  assessment report), the choice of doses of Dextromethorphan was less well supported. The applicant reduced the dose of quinidine from 30mg to 10mg in the product to reduce the potential of cardiac risk. However this resulted in a reduced effective dose of the therapeutically active part of the product, dextromethorphan (AUC about 60% of that for the 30/30 combination).

The CHMP concluded that because of the existence of poor and rapid metabolisers the availability of two doses can nevertheless be beneficial for the clinician in practical terms. The cautious pace of uptitration is also acceptable in view of the non-life-threatening nature of PBA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proposed Indication

The  proposed  indication  is  the  treatment  of  pseudobulbar  affect  (PBA)  in  adult  patients  with underlying neurological disease or injury.  There is currently no treatment approved specifically for this condition in the EU. 'Pseudobulbar Affect' is one of the commonly used names for a symptom that  occurs  in  a  wide  range  of  neurological  and  psychiatric  conditions  and  in  some  intoxications (like CPM seen in alcoholics). The term 'labile affect' is perhaps a more commonly used term for this  condition  but  the  term  'Pseudobulbar  Affect'  is  also  recognised  and  not  likely  to  cause confusion. This term also appears in the North American product literature for Nuedexta. The CHMP found the use of the term 'Pseudobulbar Affect' acceptable.

The pathophysiology of PBA is incompletely understood and the proposed mechanism of action of DM/Q on PBA is speculative. PBA occurs in association with a wide range of underlying conditions that vary considerably in terms of pathophysiology, anatomy of neurological damage, age of onset and disease progression. However, there does seem to be a reasonable level of consistency in PBA symptoms in patients regardless of the underlying pathology. Nuedexta is a product intended for symptomatic  treatment  only  and  there  is  no  suggestion  it  has  an  effect  on  the  underlying pathology.

Nuedexta is suitable only for the treatment of PBA, not for other causes of emotional lability. PBA is  a  consequence  of  neurological  diseases  affecting  the  brain,  or  brain  injury,  and  is  defined  by episodes of involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or crying that are incongruous or disproportionate to the patient's emotional state or mood. Before treatment with Nuedexta is initiated patients must be fully evaluated to confirm the diagnosis of PBA. Central to the diagnosis are the presence of an underlying neurological condition known to cause PBA, and confirmation that the episodes of emotional expression do not reflect the patient's emotional state or mood.

The applicant initially proposed a broad indication of 'treatment of PBA'. However in the pivotal study (as well as in the two supporting efficacy studies which used a higher effective dose than that proposed for marketing) only patients with ALS or MS as underlying disease were included. Thus no controlled efficacy or safety data of Nuedexta in PBA in patients with any other underlying disease  were  available.  The  applicant  argued  that  the  investigated  conditions  are  sufficiently different in their aetiology and that it was not feasible to test efficacy and safety in all conditions where  PBA  occurs.  The  applicant's  justification  for  extrapolating  to  PBA  in  patients  with  any underlying neurological condition has been accepted by CHMP. While there is no restriction of the indication  to  MS  and  ALS,  the  prescribers  are  informed  in  the  SmPC  of  the  limitations  of  the information gathered in the development plan. Concerning the possibility of off-label use, the SmPC clarifies that Nuedexta is suitable only for the treatment of PBA, not for the treatment of other causes of emotional lability. This is because the mechanism of action of Nuedexta in PBA gives no reason to think that it would be of benefit for patients who show no dissociation between their feeling and their emotional expression. The CHMP considered that PBA represents a distinct cause of emotional lability, which is different from cases where  the  emotional  lability  is  a  direct  reflection  of  the  emotion  the  patient  is  actually  feeling rather than a disruption of cortical control, as in PBA. The following wording is in section 4.4: Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition, the CHMP considered that there is still potential for significant off-label use, particularly in behavioural disturbances (other than PBA) in patients with dementias and emotional lability/labile affect due to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a drug utilisation study was requested in the RMP. This consists of an observational study and targeted survey to collect information on disease state and drug utilization of Nuedexta when used in routine clinical practice. The purpose of the study is to determine if Nuedexta, under usual medical practice is being prescribed for PBA, for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

non-PBA  behavioral  symptoms  associated  with  dementia  and  other  psychiatric  disorders,  or  for other  unrelated  indications.  It  will  also  be  important  in  testing  whether  the  SPC,  information disseminated  through  physician  education  and  other  risk  management  initiatives  are  providing prescribers with adequate guidance for prescribing Nuedexta as treatment for PBA.

Prescription pattern data will be obtained through a combination of national database queries and direct  prescriber  surveys.  Special  focus  will  be  placed  on  understanding  use  in  patients  with dementia and in patients with psychiatric disorders.

The physician's educational material also highlights the importance of a correct PBA diagnosis.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The evidence presented in the application dossier from data in patients with underlying ALS and MS and  subsequent  responses  is  regarded  as  sufficient  to  establish  a  positive  risk-benefit in symptomatic  treatment  of  PBA.  Nuedexta  is  suitable  only  for  the  treatment  of  PBA  and  not  for other causes of emotional lability. The CHMP concluded that, as the studied conditions have different aetiology and the treatment is symptomatic  and  does  not  seem  to  influence  the  underlying  pathology,  the  indication  does  not need to be restricted to ALS and MS only. However, the prescribers are informed in the SmPC of the limitations of the information on the efficacy of the combination. 2.6. Clinical safety Dextromethorphan (DM) and quinidine (Q) have both been well established as individual agents in clinical  practice  over  many  years  and  the  safety  profiles  of  each  drug  are  well  established.  The main differences concerning the proposed product are that (1) the effective doses are somewhat different from those used in the established indications for these drugs, (2) the patient population is different and (3) the combination of the two actives raises new potential issues. The most common undesirable effects reported for dextromethorphan as an antitussive agent are dizziness and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea. The maximum dose recommended for Nuedexta  is  30mg/10mg  (dextromethorphan  hydrobromide/quinidine  sulfate)  twice  a  day.  The nominal  dose  of  dextromethorphan  is  therefore  less  than  the  maximum  recommended  OTC antitussive oral dose of 120 mg/day but the actual dose of dextromethorphan will be much greater because  of  the  CYP2D6  inhibition  by  the  quinidine  component  of  the  product.  Gastrointestinal disturbances are more an issue of tolerability rather than of safety per se. Based on the known properties of the drug, the main areas of potential concern for the safety of Nuedexta attributes to the dextromethorphan component relate to undesirable CNS effects. Like other NMDA antagonists such  as  ketamine  and  phencyclidine  (PCP)  dextromethorphan  is  a  dissociative  hallucinogen  at higher  doses.  As  such  it  also  has  considerable  abuse  potential  and  possible  issues  relating  to withdrawal and rebound will also need to be considered, although these have not been evidenced in  the  submitted  data.  There  is  also  indication  that  dextromethorphan  may  modulate  serotonin reuptake  through  5-HT  receptor  interactions  and  the  potential  for  undesirable  effects  on  mood (depressive  or  manic  symptoms)  will  require  specific  scrutiny.  A  serotonin  syndrome  has  been reported  in  the  literature  in  a  patient  who  took  dextromethorphan  concomitantly  with  an  SSRI. Dextromethorphan  is  also  a  sigma  receptor  agonist,  modulating  the  release  of  excitatory neurotransmitters. The possible undesirable CNS effects of this are not clearly established. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The existing therapeutic use as an antitussive might be of concern in patients with ALS who are at risk  of  developing  respiratory  failure,  although  this  was  not  evidenced  in  the  development programme.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common undesirable effects reported for quinidine as an antiarrhythmic and antimalarial are gastrointestinal disturbances  including diarrhea, nausea,  vomiting,  and  dyspepsia.    At antiarrhythmic  doses  (600-1600  mg/day),  quinidine  is  associated  with  significant  cardiovascular AEs including torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. For this reason quinidine is not used much today and has been taken off several markets.  The QT interval is believed to represent a well validated and sensitive biomarker of  the  potentially  proarrhythmic effect of drugs such as quinidine and the data on QTc from the development program will be an important aspect of the safety evaluation.  The data presented supports the applicant claims that the low dose of quinidine in Neudexta (10 mg per capsule; 20 mg/day) is such that the major undesirable effects described for antiarrhythmic doses, in particular the proarrhythmic events, are unlikely to occur. Other well-known undesirable effects of quinidine including  thrombocytopenia, granulomatous hepatitis and myasthenia gravis are immunologically mediated and are less likely to be dose dependent.

The mean duration of exposure was 2.7 times longer for subjects who received the higher dose of Q (30 mg) in combination with any dose of DM (319.5 days)  than for the 10 mg dose of Q in combination with DM 20 or 30 mg (120.0 days). This marked difference in duration of exposure is due  to  the  different  duration  and  design  of  the  trials.  Because  of  this,  the  incidence  of  AEs  in subjects exposed to the lower dose of Q cannot be compared directly with that in subjects exposed to the higher dose. Conclusions on a dose-response relationship in terms of safety outcomes need to be based on like for like data i.e. clinical trials designed to study dose - response. No such trial was conducted on the different doses of Q.

The potential issues relating to the combination of the two actives include both pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic  interactions.    The  effect  of  quinidine  on  exposure  to  dextromethorphan seems to be comparable to what is seen in poor CYP 2D6 metabolisers, so a major safety problem with the combination seems unlikely. There are some potential pharmacodynamic interactions that might be relevant, for example possible additive or multiplicative effect on GI undesirable effects, but none seem likely to be a major safety concern based on existing knowledge of the two active substances. Interactions with concomitantly administered drugs are similarly a potentially important issue. Patient exposure Safety data from patients are presented in the five pooled data sets of which the following two are of primary interest:  Pool 1 All patients enrolled in the 5 efficacy studies of DM/Q (3 PBA studies and 2 DPN pain studies), plus healthy volunteers enrolled in 4 of the clinical PK studies (Studies 99-AVR-100, 99-AVR-101, 00-AVR-103, and 07-AVR-125) and a long-term open-label safety study in PBA (02AVR-107). Total  of  1,396 subjects exposed to DM/Q (946 PBA patients, 292 DPN pain patients, and 158 healthy volunteers).  Pool 3 - Controlled PBA safety population : PBA patients in sponsor controlled studies (Three studies: 99-AVR-102, 02-AVR-106 and 07-AVR-123). Total of 363 PBA patients exposed to DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg  (107  patients),  DM 30 mg/Q 10 mg  (110 patients),  or  DM 30 mg/Q 30 mg (146 patients).    It  also  included  control  patients  exposed  to  placebo  (183 patients),  DM-alone (33 patients) or Q-alone (37 patients). In total, 393 study participants (28.2%) have been exposed to varying combinations of DM and Q for  at  least  180  days,  and  303  study  participants  (21.7%)  have  been  exposed  for  at  least  360 days. 161 patients were treated for more than 2 years and 82 were treated for more than 3 years.

It was concluded that the extent and duration of exposure were sufficient.

## Adverse events

A  total  of  1216/1396  subjects  (87.1%)  exposed  to  any  dose  of  DM/Q  in  the  integrated  studies (Pool  1)  experienced  at  least  one  TEAE,  and  761/1396  (54.5%)  of  these  subjects  had  AEs  that were considered treatment-related. The incidence of AEs reported in subjects receiving placebo was 81.0% (256/316), with 34.5% deemed treatment-related. AEs for subjects in integrated studies are summarized in the table below. SAEs and deaths are considered later in this report.

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  in  the  integrated  controlled  studies  (pool  3)  for  all  DM/Q  dose combinations  (incidence  &gt;10%  and  more  common  than  for  placebo)  were  dizziness,  nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue and fall. These are consistent with the known pharmacology of DM in particular, and  its  known  CNS  and  gastrointestinal  side  effects.  Headache  was  common  in  all  groups  but numerically more common in the placebo group so is probably not related to treatment. Other  AEs  that  seemed  to  be  more  common  than  for  placebo  included  dry  mouth,  asthenia, somnolence, UTI and muscle weakness / stiffness also seemed to be more common in the active treatment groups although the numbers are too small to be confident that the differences are real. The  incidences  of  other  common  TEAEs  were  similar  for  placebo  and  the  AVR  923  treatment groups. Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Most of the severe TEAEs in PBA patients were related to the underlying neurological disease. In  conclusion  the  observed  pattern  of  common  AEs  is  consistent  with  expectations  in  the knowledge of the patient populations and the known pharmacology of the active substances. There are no particular concerns and the SPC section covers these common AEs appropriately. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Adverse Events of Special Safety Interest Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  safety  summary  has  addressed  AEs  that  may  represent  significant  findings  based  on  the known pharmacology of the active substances. Analyses of these AEs of special interest are in the Controlled PBA safety population (Pool 3) because a direct comparison with rates in the placebo group is necessary. Results are presented separately for the ALS and MS populations to allow a better assessment of possible causal relationship to trial medication, since many AEs are expected to be attributable to the underlying condition.

Gastrointestinal  disturbances  including  nausea,  vomiting  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  dyspepsia  are known  undesirable  effect  of  dextromethorphan  and/or  quinidine.  These  are  more  relevant  to tolerability than safety and are considered in the general AE review above.

The main areas of potential concern relate to cardiovascular and CNS effects. Because ALS is the underlying illness in many patients the potential effects on aspects relating to respiratory function (including airway secretions) are also of particular significance. Potential effects on muscle function are important for both MS and ALS patients. The key findings were as follows:

-  There was a modest excess over placebo for somnolence so it does not seem to be a major problem in most patients. Somnolence is listed appropriately as a 'common' AE in the SPC.
-  The  number  of  reported  events  of  confusion  and  disorientation  was  very  low  so  do  not seem likely to be a major problem in most patients although the number of 7 events for active treatment vs. 1 for placebo is fairly persuasive that this is likely to be a true treatment effect.
-  Depression and Suicidality is a critical factor for any CNS  drug  with effects on neurotransmitters including serotonin. It is reassuring that there was no signal from these data of an adverse effect on the incidence of these AEs.

The narrative summaries of the five SAEs (including one death) considered by the investigators to be 'possibly' or 'probably' related to study medication do not reveal any major cause for concern. All are likely to be unrelated to study treatment except one case of spasticity which seems quite likely to be related to the study medication. Muscle spasm is listed as an uncommon undesirable effect in the SPC.

 Muscle  and  Fall-Related  Events:  The  issues  are  very  different  for  the  ALS  and  MS populations.  For  ALS  there  was  no  signal  of  an  increase  in  AEs  relating  to  skeletal  muscle functioning, in particular falls. For MS There was a modest and probably not significant increase in the number of fall related events. There was no indication that Nuedexta might worsen spasticity in ALS or MS. There is no signal of a major issue here.  Dry  mouth  is  consistently  more  common  for  active  than  for  placebo  in  the  various  AE listings and is probably treatment related (known anticholinergic effect of quinidine). Some reports of  dysphagia  might  be  related  to  this.  There  was  no  indication  that  Nuedexta  might  precipitate respiratory depression or failure in ALS patients.  There was no indication that any cardiovascular AEs were treatment related (i.e. excess over  placebo),  including  arrhythmias.  However,  due  to  the  quinidine  known  safety  profile,  the registry in the RMP was designed to be adequately powered to monitor cardiovascular risk. Serious adverse events and deaths At least one SAE (including deaths) was reported for 235 of 1396 subjects (16.8%) exposed to any dose of DM/Q in the integrated studies (Pool 1). The most frequent event was respiratory failure (61 [4.4%]), followed by dysphagia (30 [2.1%]), exacerbation of MS (19 [1.4%]), and pneumonia (13 [0.9%]). Other SAEs reported in at least 5 patients (out of 1396) were chest pain NOS (10 [0.7%]),  urinary  tract  infection  (17  [0.5%]),  dyspnoea  (7  [0.5%]),  fall  (6  [0.4%]),  CVA  (6 [0.4%]), and muscle spasticity (5 [0.4%]), All of the above are events that are to be expected in the population of patients with ALS and MS and the reported rates of these are in line with expectations. The full listing of SAEs (table 23.1.1) is  not reproduced here. Scrutiny of this listing did not identify any unexpected patterns that might be of concern in terms of treatment causality.

## Drug Abuse Potential

Nuedexta has not been systematically  studied  in  animals  or  humans  for  its  potential  for  abuse, tolerance,  or  physical  dependence.  However  NMDA  antagonists  generally  have  abuse  potential (most notably phencyclidine and ketamine) and dextromethorphan abuse has been widely reported as common in the literature, especially in young adult males. Literature references indicate that dextromethorphan  produces  dissociative  effects  similar  to  those  of  PCP  and  ketamine  at  doses above about 300mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a pilot human abuse liability crossover study (Zawertailo 1998) psychomotor effects and drug liking  were  correlated  with  CYP2D6  activity  in  2  extensive  metabolizers  (EMs)  and  4  poor metabolizers (PMs) given dextromethorphan 3mg/kg. Peak plasma dextromethorphan levels were 5 fold higher and peak plasma dextrorphan levels 30 fold lower in PMs compared to EMs. PMs had greater  psychomotor  impairment  on  an  objective  measure  and  reported  greater  sedation  and dysphoria but EMs reported greater abuse potential. The authors concluded that PMs may be less likely to abuse dextromethorphan.

The same author conducted a follow up crossover study (Zawertailo 2010) in 8 healthy EMs who received dextromethorphan 3mg/kg to 6mg/kg both with and without pre-treatment with quinidine 100mg.  Peak  and  AUC  plasma  dextromethorphan  levels  were  5  fold  higher  and  peak  and  AUC plasma dextrorphan levels 6 fold lower in EMs pre-treated with quinidine compared to EMs alone. As  for  the  PMs  in  the  previous  study  pre-treatment  with  quinidine  was  associated  with  greater overall  drug  liking  and  positive  subjective  effects.  Compared  to  the  no  quinidine  condition, quinidine  pre-treatment  decreased  the  area  under  the  dose-response  curve  on  subjective measures of positively reinforcing effects (e.g., euphoria, p&lt;0.04; drug liking, p&lt;0.05), and was significantly  greater  for  measures  of  dysphoria  (e.g.,  unpleasantness,  p&lt;0.02).  These  changes corresponded to increased dextromethorphan and decreased dextrorphan plasma concentrations. The authors concluded that quinidine pre-treatment inhibited dextromethorphan metabolism and changed its subjective effects, demonstrating that the psychoactive properties of dextromethorphan are a function of drug metabolism, with implications for both the abuse liability and therapeutic utility of DM.

The applicant argues that since quinidine inhibits dextrorphan formation from dextromethorphan via  CYP2D6  metabolism,  the  abuse  potential  of  Nuedexta  may  be  reduced  in  comparison  with dextromethorphan  alone.  This  seems  to  be  reasonably  well  substantiated  by  the  above  studies. However the doses of dextromethorphan used in the human studies (3mg/kg to 6mg/kg, which equates to 200mg to 400mg in a typical adult) are much higher than the dose for Nuedexta (20 30 mg). The applicability of these data to the situation for Nuedexta is therefore questionable. However the fact remains that dextromethorphan is itself an NMDA antagonist (indeed this is said to  be  its  mechanism  of  action  for  treating  PBA)  which  puts  in  a  high  risk  category  for  abuse potential. The only human studies were conducted in a small number of subjects and used a dose of  dextromethorphan  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  that  proposed  for  Nuedexta  so  the applicability of these data to the situation for Nuedexta is questionable. The argument about the different  relative  ratio  of  dextromethorphan  to  dextrorphan  when  quinidine  is  added  seems plausible  but  involves  certain  assumptions.    In  this  context  it  is  considered  a  weakness  of  the dossier  that  no  abuse  liability  study  has  been  performed  with  Nuedexta.    While  the  applicant confirmed that no abuse signals were evident from post marketing use to date in the US,  abuse potential remains an identified risk and will be an important aspect of the Risk Management Plan. Laboratory findings The mean clinical laboratory values and mean changes from baseline showed no significant trends. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No evidence was found to suggest that Nuedexta might cause drug-related liver injury. Overall the pattern of LFT elevation is in line with that expected in such a patient population and there is no evidence of hepatotoxicity of Nuedexta.

## ECG findings

2 thorough QT studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to determine specifically the potential of  DM/Q  to  cause  cardiac  repolarization  abnormalities.  These  studies  are  reported  in  the pharmacodynamics section of this assessment report. They confirmed the potential for low doses of Q (10mg to 30mg) to cause modest dose dependent QT prolongation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ECG  parameters  included  in  the  integrated  safety  data  sets  were  heart  rate,  PR  interval,  QRS complex,  QT  interval,  QTc  interval,  QTcB  (QT  interval  after  Bazett's  correction)  and  QTcF  (QT interval after Fridericia's correction).

The data indicate that quinidine 30mg produced a modest but clear increase in QTc interval after 12  weeks  of  treatment.  No  clear  effect  was  apparent  at  the  4  week  time  point  using  Bazett's correction but the median  values for Fridericia's correction are suggestive of  some  QTc prolongation for quinidine 30mg at this time point also.

There  was  no  significant  measurable  effect  of  quinidine  10mg  median  changes  from  baseline  in QTcB or QTcF and no clear difference from placebo (confirmed in the analyses for study 07-AVR123 only).

These results indicate that treatment with DM/Q combination for 3 months can lead to increases in QTc interval but at the proposed doses for Nuedexta no such effect was apparent. In conclusion here does not appear to be a major issue with Nuedexta at the recommended dose and  the  risk  of  arrhythmias  including  torsade  de  pointes  seems  small.  The  SPC  warnings  are appropriate. Risk management measures will be required. Safety in special populations Elderly SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and TEAEs have been analyzed for PBA patients &lt;65 years, or ≥ 65 years. Events that were reported with a greater incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 years than in patients  aged  less  than  65  years  included  diarrhea  (4.0%  vs.  1.1%),  nausea  (6.7%  vs.  1.6%), asthenia  (2.7%  vs.  1.0%),  fatigue  (3.4%  vs.  1.4%),  dizziness  (4.7%  vs.  1.6%),  somnolence (2.7% vs. 1.1%), and respiratory failure (including acute respiratory failure: 9.4% vs. 3.6%). The incidence of SAEs was higher for subjects aged ≥ 65 years (33.6%) than for those aged less than 65 years (20.8%).The incidence of discontinuations due to AEs was also greater for subjects aged ≥ 65 years (43.0%) than for those aged less than 65 years (20.8%). Since  the  total  incidences  of  AEs  were  not  markedly  different  in  the  2  age  groups,  the  greater number of discontinuations attributable to such AEs in subjects aged ≥ 65 years is consistent with a more  fragile  patient  population  such  as  ALS  and  progression  of  other  underlying  neurologic diseases. However, due to the low numbers of elderly patients in the database any conclusion with respect to safety has to be considered with caution and this patient population should be carefully monitored (as also indicated in the  SmPC). Renal impairment PK  Study  04-AVR-116  (discussed  under  Efficacy)  had  the  secondary  objective  to  compare  the safety profile at steady-state of DM/Q. DM 30 mg/Q 30 mg was well tolerated in all groups. Hepatic impairment Medicinal product no longer authorised

PK Study 04-AVR-115 (discussed  under efficacy)  showed a trend of increased incidence of AEs in patients  with  moderate  hepatic  disease.  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  were  not included, and use in these patients is not recommended.

## Metabolizer Status

The majority of PBA patients in the studies were characterized by genotyping as extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers. The number of PMs was too low for detailed comparisons, but consistent with the distribution of PMs in the general population (40/946 [4.2%] in ISS Pool 2), but the AE profile in PMs showed no obvious marked differences compared with that in EMs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Most patients received one or more  concomitant medications. The most common  single concomitant medication for DM/Q-exposed subjects in the Integrated Studies was riluzole (289 ALS subjects [23.3%]), followed by aspirin (278 subjects [22.5%]), tocopherol (257 subjects [20.8%]), baclofen (249 subjects [20.1%]), ascorbic acid (236 subjects [19.1%]), paracetamol (231 subjects [18.7%]), and ibuprofen (206 subjects [16.6%]). Clonazepam and gabapentin were both taken by about 12% of MS patients with PBA.

In the integrated safety Pool 1 827 subjects (66.8%) who received any dose of DM/Q received one or more concomitant medications of special interest, the most common of which were:

-  CYP2D6 substrates (500 subjects [40.4%]) tolterodine (64 subjects),
-  CYP2D6 inhibitors (373 subjects [30.1%])diphenhydramine (88)

A patient alert card is foreseen, to address the potential for a drug-drug interaction occurring once a patient is already being treated with Nuedexta, when another (potentially interacting) treatment is  added.  The  main  message  of  the  card  makes  patients  aware  of  this  risk  and  requests  they always show the card to their prescriber AND pharmacist when new treatments are being started in  addition  to  Nuedexta,  so  that  the  HCP  can  check  whether  use  of  the  additional  drugs  is appropriate or whether changes to the dosing is required.

 medications known to prolong the QT interval (530 subjects [42.8%]) - tizanidine (111), diphenhydramine (88), levofloxacin (82), ciprofloxacin (74)  opiates/opioids (292 subjects [23.6%])  other medications known to affect ECG parameters (157 (12.7%])  CYP3A4 inhibitors (146 subjects [11.8%]) ciprofloxacin (74) Dexamethasone was the only known inducer of CYP2D6 used in the integrated studies (Pool 1), and was used by 13 subjects (1.4%) of patients treated with DM any dose/Q 30 mg, and by 1 subject (0.3%) treated with DM any dose/Q 10 mg. Dexamethasone  is  also  an  inducer  of  CYP3A4.  Other  inducers  of  CYP3A4  used  in  by  patients receiving any dose of DM/Q in the integrated studies (Pool 1) included carbamazepine (24 [1.9%]), and phenytoin (17 [1.4%]). MAO inhibitors were disallowed as concomitant medications in all of the  sponsor's  clinical  studies,  because  of  the  possibility  that  they  may  have  produced  serotonin syndrome when administered in combination with DM. Nevertheless, a total of 3 subjects received MAO  inhibitors  during  the  sponsored  clinical  trials  (protocol  violations);  all  were  PBA  patients enrolled in Study 02-AVR-107, 2 receiving selegeline, and one receiving phenelzine. No association between the above concomitant medications and reported AEs and SAEs was found. The most reliable information on potential PK interactions will come from the specific preclinical and human PK studies. Concomitant medications of potential concerns were excluded from the clinical trials. Nevertheless it is noted that there is no indication from the clinical trial safety database of clinically important AEs relating to PK interactions. 42.8% of patients took concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval. In response to a question the applicant provided additional analyses that provided reassurance that there was no evidence of  an  additive  or  multiplicative  effect  on  QT  of  Nuedexta  and  concomitant  medications known to prolong the QT interval.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

The percentage of patients discontinuing from the study was higher for both treatment groups than for the placebo group and most withdrawals from the active treatment groups were due to AEs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  AE  most  frequently  associated  with  discontinuation  was  respiratory  failure  which  is  clearly related to the underlying condition (ALS) and presumably reflects withdrawal from the trial due to imminent death.

The  AE  that  was  the  main  reason  for  a  higher  withdrawal  rate  on  AVP-923  was  dizziness.  The others listed above are well established undesirable effects of AVP-923 except for headache which is a common cause for withdrawal also in the placebo group.

Withdrawals did not show any notable relationship to age, sex or race.

## Post marketing data

Extensive US post-marketing surveillance data have revealed no additional safety concerns.

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety The  active  components  in  Nuedexta,  dextromethorphan  (DM)  and  quinidine  (Q),  have  a  wellestablished safety profile at different effective doses and for different indications. Dextromethorphan has been used for many years as an antitussive in a wide range of over the counter (OTC) products. The recommended maximum daily dose in OTC products is (e.g. in the UK) 120 mg, which is higher than the top recommended dose of Nuedexta (30mg twice daily). However for most patients the effective dose is about an order of magnitude greater for Nuedexta because the CYP 2D6 inhibition by  the  quinidine  component  results  in  much  higher  drug  exposure.  In  genetic  poor  metabolisers (about 8% of the European population) CYP 2D6 activity is even lower than in normal metabolisers treated with quinidine 10mg twice daily. There is therefore a great deal of clinical experience with dextromethorphan at doses at least as high as the dose proposed for Nuedexta. No major safety issues have come to light over the years in genetic poor metaboliser patients who have taken OTC dextromethorphan. Controlled data are lacking because CYP 2D6 metaboliser status is not normally known but existence of a significant problem seems very unlikely. The different patient population studied (MS, ALS, and other neurological conditions in study 107) do not seem likely to affect this conclusion, although the CNS undesirable effects might exacerbate an already elevated risk of falls and  confusion  /  disorientation.  Detailed  scrutiny  of  undesirable  effects  on  aspects  of  these underlying illnesses revealed some potential issues, however, there were no undesirable effects that could not satisfactorily be managed by withdrawing treatment or reducing the dose. In conclusion there are no substantial safety concerns regarding the dextromethorphan component. The  QT  prolonging  and  pro-arrhythmic  properties  of  quinidine  are  well  known  at  doses  used  for treating arrhythmias (typically 200mg to 400mg). The 10mg dose proposed for Nuedexta and the 30mg dose used in two of the clinical trials are clearly very much lower and are claimed not to have the same QT issues. The data show evidence of dose related QT prolongation at these lower doses. The 30mg dose showed a degree of QT prolongation that could potentially be significant but the QT prolongation  produced  by  the  10mg  dose  that  will  be  marketed  seems  unlikely  to  be  clinically important. Nevertheless appropriate cautions regarding cardiac disease and concomitant medications are necessary, and reflected in the SmPC. No other significant safety issues relating to the  quinidine  component  were  identified.  Dry  mouth,  due  to  the  known  anticholinergic  effect  of quinidine, seems to have been an issue in some patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

There  are  no  safety  concerns  that  might  preclude  the  approval  of  Nuedexta  with  the  proposed posology and indication.

The potential risks are monitored in the RMP and proposed registry/drug utilisation study.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

PBA  is  a  condition  which  consists  of  episodes  of  inappropriate  expression  of  affect  (laughing  or crying) that are either qualitatively or quantitatively incongruent with the individual emotional or social context in which they occur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The only currently validated instrument for measuring the severity of the condition is CNS-LS.

In the pivotal study (07-AVR-123) the change in CNS-LS from the baseline to Visit 5 was -8.17 for DM30/Q10 and -8.24 for  DM20/Q10.  Changes  for  both  strengths  of  the  proposed  product  were statistically significant compared to the change from baseline to Visit 5 for placebo (-5.72).

The other instrument used in the pivotal study for the assessment of severity of PBA was count of episodes of laughing and crying. The recorded changes between the baseline and Visit 5 were -4.11 for AVP-923-30 and -3.88 for AVP-923-20. The incremental reduction of PBA episodes relative to placebo was 47% (DM30/Q10) and 49% (DM20/Q10).

The pathophysiology of PBA is incompletely understood and the proposed mechanism of action of DM/Q on PBA is speculative. PBA occurs in association with a wide range of underlying conditions that vary considerably in terms of pathophysiology, anatomy of neurological damage, age of onset and disease progression. However, there does seem to be a reasonable level of consistency in PBA symptoms in patients regardless of the underlying pathology. Nuedexta is a product intended for symptomatic  treatment  only  and  there  is  no  suggestion  it  has  an  effect  on  the  underlying pathology. The applicant argued that the investigated conditions are sufficiently different in their aetiology and that it was not feasible to test efficacy and safety in all conditions where PBA occurs. The applicant's justification  for  extrapolating  to  PBA  in  patients  with  any  underlying  neurological condition has been accepted by CHMP, as the results are consistent and demonstrate an acceptable level  of  statistical  significance  and  clinical  relevance  in  these  two  conditions.    The  SmPC  gives information to the prescribers on the limitations of the information gathered in other underlying conditions in the development plan. In  addition  to  the  pivotal  efficacy  study,  two  other  Phase  III  studies  were  also  conducted.  The Quinidine dose used in these two studies was of higher strength than that proposed for marketing, and the results were considered by CHMP as supportive to the claim of efficacy of the combination of Dextromethorphan and Quinidine in treatment of PBA. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. The  supporting  efficacy  studies  were  conducted  using  the  product  strengths  that  are  not representative of the final product. In that sense, the dossier relies on the results of one single efficacy study involving 326 patients with ALS and MS. Efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  directly  only  in  patients  who  had  MS  or  ALS  as  the  underlying cause of their PBA symptoms. No other underlying pathologies have been studied in the pivotal trial.  While  there  are  no  controlled  data  demonstrating that the same level of benefits would be present  in  all  conditions  where  neurological  PBA  occurs,  Nuedexta  is  a  product  for  symptomatic treatment only and there is no suggestion it has an effect on the underlying pathology. Therefore an indication irrespective of aetiology has been agreed, qualifying the limitations in SmPC sections 4.1 and  4.4. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The 'count of episodes of laughing and crying' used as primary efficacy measure in the pivotal efficacy study is not a validated instrument. It has been found to be an estimate rather than actual count, it relies entirely on patient's recall, it fails to take the account of severity of symptoms and of  poor  demarcation  of  episodes,  which  is  typical  of  PBA.  As  such,  this  measure  is  regarded  as inferior  to  CNS-LS  and  it  is  of  uncertain  clinical  relevance,  even  if  the  results  were  positive  and statistically significant.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  active  components  of  the  product,  dextromethorphan  (DM)  and  quinidine  (Q),  have  been present on the EU markets for a number of years and their safety profiles and interactions are well known, albeit at different effective doses and for different indications.

The QT prolonging and pro-arrhythmic properties of quinidine are well known at doses used for treating  arrhythmias  (typically  200mg  to  400mg  four  times  per  day).  The  QT  studies  showed evidence of modest dose related QT prolongation at both lower doses of Q, 30mg and 10mg. Q 60mg  b.d  however  showed  a  degree  of  QTcF  prolongation  that  could  potentially  be  significant (mean 19ms, upper CI 25ms). However, caution is required in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, including concomitant medicines. Since quinidine is metabolised by CYP 3A4 there is in principle potential for an increased QT risk with other drugs that inhibit CYP 3A4, especially if they also cause QT prolongation.

A 60mg dose of quinidine showed a degree of QT prolongation that could potentially be significant but  the  QT  prolongation  produced  by  a  10mg  dose  seems  unlikely  to  be  problematic,  provided appropriate caution is exercised to avoid use in patients with existing QT prolongation and/or taking precautions when used with other QT prolonging medication. This is also monitored in the proposed registry.  Serial  ECGs  in  the  main  clinical  studies  indicated  a  modest  effect  on  QT  of  Q  30mg  but there  was  no  adverse  signal  for  Q  10mg.    Some  discrepancies  in  the  data  raised  questions  over whether reporting practices were consistent and reliable and whether the ECG readers who reported the cases of QT prolongation were blinded to study medication. 42.8% of patients took concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval but there was no evidence of a substantial additive or multiplicative  effect  when  Nuedexta  was  added.  It  cannot  be  completely  certain  that  in  clinical practice significant issues will not arise in a small number of cases despite the SPC advice and other risk  management  measures.  Appropriate  cautions  regarding  cardiac  disease  and  concomitant medications are necessary.

Q is a potent CYP 2D6 inhibitor at the 10mg dose in Nuedexta. There is obvious potential for drug drug interactions  (DDIs)  with  other  drugs  metabolised  by  CYP  2D6  and  caution  will  be  required with  such  combinations,  with  dose  adjustment  (or  switching  to  an  alternative  treatment)  as necessary. Suitable advice to prescribers regarding CYP 2D6 related DDIs is provided in the SPC, and a patient's card is foreseen by the RMP. No other significant safety issues relating to the quinidine component are identified. Dry mouth due to the known anticholinergic effect of quinidine seems to have been an issue in some patients. The  main  known  undesirable  effects  of  DM  generally  relate  more  to  tolerability  than  to  safety although in the target patient population with serious underlying CNS pathology undesirable effects such as dizziness, fatigue and somnolence could potentially increase the risk of falls and other such accidents. There was no evidence of a substantial problem in practice. There was only a weak trend to a higher rate of falls on active treatment compared to placebo (13.5% vs. 12%, not statistically significant)  and  an  inconclusive  suggestion  of  a  dose  response  relationship  between  20mg  and 30mg of DM. Significant CNS undesirable effects typical of NMDA antagonists are known to occur at higher doses than the proposed therapeutic dose and this could be an issue with misuse of the product. Extensive US post-marketing surveillance data have revealed no additional safety concerns. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

There  is  some  uncertainty  regarding  the  potential  impact  of  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  on quinidine concentrations and associated cardiac safety. This issue was not completely resolved by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the references to published literature. The QT studies showing that the effect on QTcF appeared to be  no  greater  for  Q  30mg  than  for  Q  10mg  (but  is  clinically  important  for  Q  60mg)  gives  some reassurance  that  there  is  a  reasonable  safety  margin.    The  applicant  has  agreed  to  conduct  a specific  drug-drug  interaction  study  for  Nuedexta  with  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  (ketoconazole dosed twice daily) and relate these data to the results of the QT-study. This study is included in the RMP under Potential  risks-Drug/drug  interactions.  When  these  data  are  available  the  advice  with regard to pre and post dosing evaluation of QTc will be re-evaluated.

Q is not the only medicinal product that is a potent CYP 2D6 inhibitor at the therapeutic dose and other such drugs, most notably certain SSRIs, have been widely used with an acceptable level of clinical safety provided suitable precautions are taken to avoid troublesome interactions. Nevertheless  there  is  the  potential  for  important  interactions  with  other  drugs  that  may  be  coadministered  (e.g.  antidepressants,  opioids,  donepezil)  and  the  extent  to  which  SPC  advice  and other  risk  management  measures  (patient  card  and  HCP  educational  material)  will  prevent significant interactions in clinical practice is an area of some uncertainty. However, the worst case scenario regarding the CYP 2D6 inhibitory effect of Q cannot be worse than the usual situation for the 8% of the Caucasian population who are genetic CYP 2D6 poor metabolisers.

A favourable effect in this patient population would be of considerable importance as the condition is distressing to many patients and there is currently no approved treatment.

Dextromethorphan  has  been  used  for  many  years  as  an  antitussive  in  a  wide  range  of  over  the counter  (OTC)  products  at  a  higher  nominal  maximum  daily  dose  as  proposed  for  Nuedexta (120mg). Although for most patients the effective dose of DM is an order of magnitude greater for Nuedexta (because of the CYP 2D6 inhibition by Q) this is not the case for genetic poor metabolisers (about  8%  of  the  European  population)  in  whom  CYP  2D6  activity  is  even  lower  than  in  normal metabolisers treated with quinidine 10mg twice daily as proposed for Nuedexta. There is therefore a great deal of clinical experience with dextromethorphan at effective doses at least as high as the dose proposed for Nuedexta. No major safety issues have come to light over the years in genetic poor metaboliser patients who have taken OTC dextromethorphan and a significant problem seems very unlikely. With the possible exception of falls there were no undesirable effects that could not satisfactorily be managed by withdrawing treatment or reducing the dose. In conclusion there are no substantial safety concerns or uncertainties regarding  the  dextromethorphan  component  of Nuedexta at the dose proposed. There is little data on adverse events in different underlying diseases, such as stroke, which could have  a  very  different  set  of  risk  factors  and  co-morbidities  from  MS  and  ALS  patients  (although safety was not an issue in the consideration of whether to grant or not a wider indication to MS and ALS).  The  applicant's  responses  provided  reasonable  reassurance  that  there  are  unlikely  to  be clinically important safety issues in patient populations other than those with ALS of MS that might affect  the  overall  risk-benefit  conclusions.  The  available  post-marketing  data  from  the  USA  are reasonably reassuring. Benefit-risk balance Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The main safety issues identified are potential QT prolongation, drug - drug interactions, and CNS side  effects  that  could  potentially  increase  the  risk  of  falls  in  these  patient  populations  with underlying serious neurological pathology and symptoms. The most important unfavourable effect would  be  sudden  death  due  to  QT  prolongation  and  torsades  de  pointes.  However,  it  is  very unlikely that this would occur in clinical practice provided basic precautions are taken in line with the  contraindications  in  the  SPC.  The  potential  consequences  from  drug  -  drug  interactions  and falls  related  to  CNS  side  effects  are  not  inconsiderable  but  again,  provided  appropriate  care  is taken as advised in the SPC, the risk of major safety issues is considered to be very small.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The RMP measures include a registry, a DUS protocol, prescriber checklist and the patient cards to inform on the potential for interactions.

The SmPC sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 were phrased to ensure a clear definition of the indication, and clarify that Nuedexta is suitable only for the treatment of PBA, not for other causes of emotional lability. PBA is a consequence of neurological brain disease or injury and is defined by episodes of involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or crying that are incongruous or disproportionate  to  the  patient's  emotional  state  or  mood.  Before  treatment  with  Nuedexta  is initiated patients must be fully evaluated to confirm the diagnosis of PBA. Central to the diagnosis are  the  presence  of  an  underlying  neurological  condition  known  to  cause  PBA,  and  confirmation that the episodes of emotional expression do not reflect the patient's emotional state or mood.

## Balance

## Outcome

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance Nuedexta  is  a  novel  combination  product  to  treat  PBA,  which  is  a  distressing  but  non-lifethreatening condition, which at present cannot be successfully treated. PBA  is  present  in  a  number  of  neurological  conditions.  Nuedexta  provides  symptomatic  PBA treatment only. The efficacy has been investigated in two pathologically unrelated disorders: ALS and  MS.  The  results  on  the  primary  and  key  secondary  outcome  measures  are  consistent  and demonstrate  an  acceptable  level  of  statistical  significance  and  clinical  relevance  in  these  two conditions. Nuedexta is not suitable to treat other causes of emotional lability. The results for improvement in quality of life and functional measures are less convincing in the pivotal efficacy study compared to the other supporting studies with DM 30mg / Q 30mg. For the lowest Nuedexta dose (DM/Q 20/10) there was no difference from placebo. These quality of life results  suggest  a  dose  response  relationship  (to  Dextromethorphan),  which  due  to  the  use  of different instruments cannot be directly quantified. The active components of the product have been present on the EU markets for a number of years and their safety profiles and interactions are relatively well known. The main safety issues relate to the potential for QT prolongation and drug - drug interactions. Collectively these issues are not of a level  of  concern  to  preclude  the  grant  of  a  marketing  authorisation  but  they  will  require  active management in the risk management programme. As there are no major safety concerns with the product containing the 10mg dose of quinidine, and the  clinical  relevance  of  the  treatment  effect  is  demonstrated,  the  risk  benefit  of  the  product  is considered positive. 4. Recommendations Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Nuedexta in the symptomatic treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in adults (see section 4.4). Efficacy has only been studied in patients with underlying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Multiple Sclerosis (see section 5.1).

is  favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
