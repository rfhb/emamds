## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

The Marketing Authorisation application for Zyclara, 3.75% cream, is a hybrid application made according to Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The proposed product differs from the reference product, Aldara 5% cream, in therapeutic indication and strength. These differences, together with the fact that the pharmaceutical form is a topical cream, make it necessary to carry out new clinical studies as bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability studies.

Imiquimod is an immune response modifier. Saturable binding studies suggest that a membrane receptor for imiquimod exists on responding immune cells. Imiquimod has no direct antiviral activity. In animal models imiquimod is effective against viral infections and acts as an antitumour agent principally by induction of alpha interferon and other cytokines. The induction of alpha interferon and other cytokines following imiquimod cream application to genital wart tissue has also been demonstrated in clinical studies. Increases in systemic levels of alpha interferon and other cytokines following topical application of imiquimod were demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic study.

These statements have received further support in the last years [Schön &amp; Schön 2007, Schön &amp; Schön 2008]. It may now be considered as established that the so-called toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 are the main targets of imiquimod. Imiquimod as the lead compound of the imidazoquinolines yields a TLR7/8-mediated activation of the central transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (nf κ B), which leads to induction of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators. Cutaneous dendritic cells are the primary responsive cell type and initiate a strong T-helper-cell (Th1) weighted antitumoural cellular immune response. Recent research has shown that dendritic cells themselves acquire direct antitumoural activity upon stimulation by imiquimod. In addition, there are a number of secondary effects on the molecular and cellular level that can be explained through the activation of TLR7/8. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

proinflammatory activity of imiquimod, but not resiquimod, appears to be augmented by suppression of a regulatory mechanism, which normally limits inflammatory responses. This is achieved independently of TLR7/8 through interference with adenosine receptor signalling pathways. Finally, at higher concentrations imiquimod exerts Bcl-2- and caspase-dependent proapoptotic activity against tumour cells.

The proposed indication for Zyclara 3.75% (imiquimod) cream is different from the reference product and includes topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhyperpertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults. During assessment, and due to absence of active controlled studies, this indication was limited to second line treatment being the approved indication: Topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhyperpertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults, when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate.

The recommended dose per application is up to 2 sachets, containing 9.375 mg imiquimod in 250 mg cream (3.75%) each, once daily before bedtime to the skin of the affected area for two treatment cycles of 2 weeks each separated by a 2-week no-treatment cycle or as directed by the physician. The cream should remain on the skin for approximately 8 hours. The product is not to be used in children/ adolescents below 18 years of age as no data are available. The prescriber should demonstrate the proper application technique to the patient to maximize the benefit of Zyclara cream therapy.

The active substance, imiquimod, has well established safety and efficacy and has been on the market since 1998 as 5% cream.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Zyclara is a white to faintly yellow topical cream base, formulated as oil-in-water vanishing cream base. Is packaged in a form, fill and seal multi-layer laminate single dose sachet. Each sachet contains 250 mg of imiquimod 3.75% topical cream.  The pack sizes include 14, 28 and 56 sachets.

## 2.2.2. Active substance

The active substance is imiquimod, chemical name 1-(2-Methylpropyl)-1H-imidazo [4,5-c] quinolin-4amine; 4-Amino-1-isobutyl-1H-imidazo [4,5-c] quinolone. The corresponding molecular formula is C14H16N4. The molecule does not contain any chiral centres and no polymorphic forms.

Imiquimod is not described in any pharmacopoeial monograph.

It is an odourless, white to off-white crystalline solid, practically insoluble in water and common organic solvents as free base, but becomes soluble as a salt form. Its solubility decreases with increasing pH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Imiquimod has the following structural formula:

<!-- image -->

## Manufacture

Imiquimod is synthesised according to the same process currently approved for use in Aldara 5% Cream. It is synthesized in six main steps, including a purification step, using well defined starting materials.

Stability data have been provided for 6 batches of the drug substance and the result support the proposed retest period of 2 years when stored below 30 °C in double polyethylene bags in cardboard kegs.

Adequate in-process controls are applied at each stage of the synthesis. In general, the specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

Batch analysis data are provided on 3 batches produced with the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly.

## Specification

The drug substance specification as tested by the active substance manufacturer is identical to that currently approved for imiquimod used in the reference product.

As there is no monograph of imiquimod in the Ph.Eur., the applicant developed its own specification and test methods for the quality control. Control tests include appearance, identification, loss on drying, heavy metals, residue on ignition, chloride residue, iron content, platinum content, assay on dried basis, purity and residual solvents.

At the time of the CHMP Opinion the analytical methods used were not fully validated. For this reason the CHMP issued a recommendation to the applicant to complete the validation of these analytical methods. However this raises no concern about the safety of the active substance as the results of batch analysis comply with the specification.

The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, stability studies and CHMP/ICH guidelines. The analytical methods used are sufficiently described and fully validated in line with the CHMP/ICH requirements.

The acceptance criteria for impurities, including limits for organic impurities, inorganic impurities and residual solvents, are defined. The limits were evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. No genotoxic impurities were detected in the batches of the active substance. No solvents are carried over from early steps of the synthesis.

Results of analysis of three batches of the active substance were provided. Compliance with the specification was demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

Stability data of one batch of the active substance up to 60 months and of several batches up to 24 months of storage at 25°C/60% relative humidity (RH) and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH were provided. The stability parameters measured include UV assay, HPLC assay, LOD and HPLC purity.

The stability data support the proposed retest period of 2 years when stored in double polyethylene bags in a cardboard keg as secondary packaging.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical development

The aim was to develop an imiquimod cream formulation at lower concentrations using the same excipients as the currently marketed Aldara 5% cream, with emphasis on physical and chemical stability, imiquimod solubility, similar emollient properties and dose proportionate imiquimod delivery. This lower strength optimized formulation would be used daily, for a much shorter therapy regimen and with less potential side effects.

Zyclara 3.75% cream contains the same active ingredient and excipients which are of the same quality as that of Aldara Cream 5%. The quantity of the excipients in both formulations is identical with the exception of the following changes to the proposed formulation when compared to Aldara:

-  A reduction in the level of the active substance
-  A reduction in the level of isostearic acid
-  A corresponding gain in purified water

This change in the formulation is considered acceptable for the development of a lower strength formulation.

At the time of the CHMP Opinion the analytical method used for controlling one of the excipients was not fully validated. For this reason the CHMP issued a recommendation to the applicant to complete the validation of this analytical method. However this raises no concern about the safety of the finished product as the results of batch analysis comply with the specification.

## Adventitious agents

Not applicable

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process for Zyclara is essentially the same as that of the reference product Aldara. It uses standard pharmaceutical techniques for topical creams i.e. dissolution, mixing and heating of imiquimod in the oily phase and dissolution of the preservative in the aqueous phase followed by mixing both phases.

The manufacturing process has been satisfactorily validated with respect to bulk cream manufacture, filling and sachet assembly for three validation batches.

The batch analysis data show that this medicinal product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Product specification

The product specifications include methods for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, IV), assay (HPLC), drug related impurities (HPLC), pH, viscosity, minimum fill weight and microbial purity (Ph Eur).

The finished product specifications have been justified and all methods of analysis have been described and adequately validated.

## Stability of the product

Stability data were provided on 3 batches of the finished products packed in sachets as intended for marketing. The batches were manufactured at the proposed site to the proposed formulation and manufacturing process. The stability studies included  36 months at long term conditions (25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 5°C) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5°C). The parameters tested the same as those for release of the finished product.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

The  active  substance  imiquimod  is  well  known  and  has  been  in  the  market  since  1998.  The manufacturing  process  has  essentially  been  the  same  since  then  and  both  active  substance  and finished product manufacturing processes are well controlled.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

The CHMP has issued two recommendations to the company. One regarding the finalisation of validation of the analytical methods of the drug substance specification. The second one refers to the finalisation of the validation of an analytical method for controlling one of the excipients of the finished product. These two issues raise no concerns as batch analysis data for the drug substance and the finished product comply with specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Since the applicant (MEDA AB) of Zyclara is the same as the Marketing Authorisation Holder of the reference medicinal product centrally authorised, Aldara, the same non-clinical data was made available. .

The non-clinical aspects of Zyclara SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product, Aldara. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. The following sections summarise the available non-clinical information from the dossier of the reference medicinal product.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The pharmacodynamic action of imiquimod has been studied in vitro and in vivo .

In cultured murine cells imiquimod induced cytokine secretion in a wide variety of cell types including spleen, bone marrow, liver, peritoneal exudate and alveolar macrophages. The pattern of cytokines differed between the cell types. Studies with mouse macrophages produced results consistent with a cell surface receptor for imiquimod. Further in vitro studies showed that imiquimod is a potent inducer of cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Its two metabolites were also potent inducers. Induction occurred 1-2 hours after exposure and generally peaked after 8 hours.

In a study of the mode of action, cytokine gene expression in a human epidermal carcinoma cell line (COLO-16) and human keratinocytes following exposure to imiquimod was determined. There was both stimulation (1  g/ml) and down-regulation (10  g/ml) of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA synthesis. Further experiments with keratinocytes showed that, of the 5 cytokines assayed, IL-8 was present in the supernatant whereas there was little or no effect in cultures of melanocytes or fibroblasts. In this instance, imiquimod was substantially less potent than Poly I:C (50  g/ml).

The ability of imiquimod to stimulate cytokine production was confirmed in in vivo studies conducted mainly in mice (both normal and immunodeficient), but also in rats, guinea pigs and Cynomolgous monkeys. The results confirm the ability of imiquimod to stimulate cytokine production.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Antiviral activity has been examined in cell cultures and in in vivo animal infection models. In vitro imiquimod inhibited rhinovirus 1A, respiratory syncytial virus and varicella zoster virus as assessed by 50% plaque reduction in virus infected cells. In guinea pigs a single oral dose (5 mg/kg) was effective against primary genital herpes (HSV-2) infection. Under certain conditions intravaginal imiquimod reduced latent neural HSV-2 in ganglia and also recurrences, with early or prolonged treatment being of respective importance.

In other animal infection models, imiquimod was effective against Rift Valley fever and Banzi viruses (in mice) and yellow fever virus (in Cynomolgous monkeys). With regard specifically to HPV, imiquimod administered at 5 mg/kg i.p. to mice implanted with tumours expressing the HPV 16 E7 gene reduced the weight of tumours by up to 84%.

Imiquimod was shown to be an effective anti-tumour agent in mice implanted with a number of different tumour cell types.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety pharmacology programme

Imiquimod has been assessed in safety pharmacology tests both in vitro and in vivo . Although there were a number of findings in the intravenous dog study (cardiac stimulation, central nervous system stimulation and some autonomic nervous system inhibition), none of the effects found raised any safety concerns.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic profile of imiquimod was studied in rats, rabbits, and monkeys, the main species used in the preclinical program. Following oral administration imiquimod was rapidly absorbed. Following repeated dermal administration of 1 or 5 mg/kg imiquimod during a 4 week rat toxicity study, the systemic exposure to imiquimod or its metabolites was minimal. No imiquimod or metabolite was detected in the plasma of the low dose group, low doses of the metabolite S-26704 were found at 5 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the clinical dose).

Distribution studies were conducted in rats (pigmented and non-pigmented) and monkeys with radiolabelled compound administered orally. Distribution was wide and rapid in both species with higher levels in the organs of elimination (liver, kidney and gall bladder) compared to the plasma after 72 hours. In pigmented rats high concentrations were found in the skin and eye and were still high 72 hours after dosing, indicating non-specific melanin binding. In pregnant rabbits 14 C-imiquimod was administered intravenously. Radiolabel was present in the uteri, placentae, amniotic fluid and foetuses. The exact distribution within the foetus as determined by whole body autoradiography has not been established.

There are relatively few animal data on metabolites. In rat urine, however, radiochromotography of untreated urine revealed 3 peaks increasing to 6-7 following hydrolysis with  -glucuronidase. The structure of the two major metabolites formed by hydroxylation, S-26704 and S-27700, was determined from human urine. They are also found in rat and monkey. Excretion is via the urinary and biliary routes.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single dose toxicity of imiquimod was studied in mice, rats and monkeys. These studies indicated a high degree of safety. Adverse effects were limited to the central nervous system resulting in a number of clinical signs, usually convulsions, prior to death.

In two dermal toxicity studies in rabbits with doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg under occlusion there were no deaths and no signs of toxicity other than mild transient erythema at the application site.

## Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated dose toxicity of imiquimod after oral administration was studied in rats and monkeys up to 6 months. In both studies, the only adverse effects apart from slight effects on body weight and food consumption were considered to be the result of exaggerated pharmacological activity, i.e. hyperplasia of B- and T-cell lymphoid tissue, increased number of plasma cells, enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, mononuclear/macrophage cell accumulation or proliferation. These included over-stimulation and in some animals subsequent down-regulation of lymphoid tissue. These effects were reversed during a recovery period during which animals were not dosed. There were no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

other target organs and a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 3 mg/kg was established in both species.

In light of the potential for increases in systemic exposure, the CHMP requested the Applicant to discuss the available animal PK data with respect to the measured pharmacokinetic parameters in the pivotal clinical trial. In response, the Applicant has provided the following data and safety margin calculations at the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL).

## Genotoxicity

In a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests, imiquimod lacked genotoxic potential.

## Carcinogenicity

The carcinogenic potential of imiquimod following dermal application was assessed in mice over 18 months. Benign squamous cell tumours (including papillomas and keratocarcinomas) were detected in the skin at the application site in 4 control and 3 high dose animals. In addition, lymphosarcomas at the application site were found in one control and in high dose animals. There were no differences between control and high dose animals in the incidence of other tumours or non-neoplastic lesions.

## Reproduction toxicity

In a general reproductive performance and fertility study and teratogenicity study in rats, dams showed moderate signs of toxicity including decreased body weight gain and food consumption, tremors and/or convulsions. In pups there was decreased body weight and/or retarded ossification. There were no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of the F0 generation nor any effects on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the post-natal development and reproductive performance of the F1 generation. In a general reproductive performance and fertility study in rabbits, the only signs of toxicity were tremors and convulsions in the dams. There were no effects on the pups.

## Local tolerance

Dermal toxicity studies, where imiquimod was applied three times per week, were conducted in rats (up to 4 months), and mice (up to 4 months). In rats significantly decreased body weight and increased spleen weight were observed at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, and local skin irritation (severe erythema, slight to moderate oedema, desquamation and scabbing) more severe than that seen in humans was observed. Histopathological examination revealed epidermal inflammation with epidermal ulceration and hyperkeratosis. There was no good dose/response relationship and a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was not established. In treated mice spleen weight was increased, however, was not attributed to systemic exposure to imiquimod and its metabolites which is negligible following dermal administration. In mice there was a better dose/response and a NOEL of 0.4 mg/kg (approximately twice the clinical exposure).

## Other toxicity studies

Ocular and skin irritation studies in the rabbit were conducted with imiquimod and imiquimod cream. The results indicate that imiquimod itself is not irritant and that the cream is in general only mildly irritant.

Vaginal irritancy of 1% and 5% imiquimod creams has been assessed in rats and rabbits. In rabbits there was no vaginal irritation. In rats there was no histopathological evidence of vaginal irritation however there were monocytic infiltrates below the vaginal epithelium, increased spleen weight and lymphoid hyperplasia consistent with the pharmacological activity of the compound.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Currently, the reference product is the only imiquimod-containing product on the market in Europe and the Applicant is the sole MAH for imiquimod products.  Aldara is supplied in packs of 250 mg cream, one of which may be applied for each treatment.

-  For genital warts, Aldara is applied 3 times a week for up to 16 weeks.
-  For small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is applied 5 times a week for 6 weeks.
-  For actinic keratoses, it is applied three times a week, for one or two four-week courses, with four weeks between courses.

Zyclara (imiquimod) Cream 3.75% is supplied in single-use sachets. Patients should be prescribed no more than 56 sachets for the total 2-cycle treatment course. Up to 2 sachets (500 mg cream) may be applied to the treatment area at each application (corresponding to 18.75 mg imiquimod).

As there are no other MAHs for imiquimod-containing products, the Applicant argues that the recent sales figures for Aldara represent the total use of the active substance in Europe.  The applicant argues further that because no new indications are being sought, there should be no increase in the medical use of the active ingredient and thus no change to the market penetration is expected.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Non-clinical data from the reference product dossier revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, mutagenicity and teratogenicity.

The concentration of active ingredient in the proposed product is lower than that in the reference product and there is no reason to assume that the former will present more of a toxic risk than the latter.  It is also accepted that there are no concerns in respect of the excipients.  The impurities comply with the Note for Guidance on Impurities in New Drug Products (CPMP/ICH/2738/99) and none require toxicological qualification.  No discussion has been provided on the potential for substances leaching from the packaging into the product.  However, the multi-layer laminate used for imiquimod 3.75% cream is identical to the laminate approved for Aldara ® 5% cream.  For the inner layer of the sachet foil, a statement of compliance with European Directive 90/128/EEC is included hence there are no toxicological concerns.

In light of the potential for increases systemic exposure, the CHMP requested the Applicant to discuss the available animal PK data that explore the safety of the measured mean Cmax (0.323±0.159 ng/ml and total exposure (AUC 0-24 = 5.964 g hr/ml) for imiquimod in treated patients at the end (day 21) of the PK trial (GW01-0706). In response, the Applicant has provided data from repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys and has calculated safety margins at the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL).  The calculated safety margins (between 12 and 102, refer to Table 1) were considered satisfactory by the CHMP.

Further to the CHMP request, the Applicant has provided three separate calculations of the PECsufacewater for imiquimod, all of which are below the action limit and hence indicate that there will be no risk to the environment, and that further work is not necessary.  The CHMP considers that the original ERA submitted based on actual sales figures is likely to provide the most realistic estimate of the PECsufacewater .  This figure was corroborated by the use of independently published figures on the amount of imiquimod sold.  A third calculation, using yet another mean of deriving the PECsufacewater , also led to the same conclusion.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP accepts the Applicant's view that no new non-clinical studies are required. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The indication claimed by the applicant is:

Imiquimod cream is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in adults.

Due to the absence of active-controlled trials, the indication as adopted by the CHMP is:

Zyclara is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhyperpertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults, when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic program was designed to support the use of 3.75% imiquimod cream in patients with  actinic  keratoses  when  the  cream  is  applied  on  a  daily  basis.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  the imiquimod  cream,  as  a  5%  formulation,  have  been  studied  previously  in  patients  with  both  actinic keratoses and external genital warts, but never when applied at a daily frequency. Study GW01-0706 was designed to characterise the serum level profile and pharmacokinetics of daily topical applications of 3.75% imiquimod cream under maximal use conditions. Serum concentrations of imiquimod and 2 alkyl  hydroxylated  metabolites,  S-26704  and  S-27700  were  measured  for  evaluation  of  studied  AK patients with a disease severity towards the upper end of the proposed indication using the maximal dosing regimen (two sachets once daily for three weeks), and applied to the body surface areas that are consistent with the patients studied in the Phase 3 clinical studies (entire face or balding scalp).

Study GW01-0706 was an open label, single centre, non-randomised pharmacokinetic (PK) study in adult patients with actinic keratoses (AKs), and it is the only pharmacokinetic study included in this application  that  utilised  the  to-be-marketed  3.75%  imiquimod  cream  formulation.  The  study  was designed to quantify the pharmacokinetic profile of imiquimod and its metabolites following 3 weeks (21  days)  of  daily  applications  of  3.75%  imiquimod  cream  in  adult  patients  with  actinic  keratoses (AKs). The study was conducted under maximal use conditions (dose, duration, disease severity, and application  areas)  in  a  population  that  had  at  least  10  AK  lesions  in  the  application  area.  The application area was the entire face (exclusive of nares, vermilion, periocular areas and ears) and/or the entire balding scalp; areas estimated as approximately 200 cm 2 , each. If the area of the entire balding scalp was less than 200 cm 2 , the forehead area was included in order for the entire treatment area to be approximately 200 cm 2 . The daily dose was 2 sachets of 3.75% imiquimod cream applied to the relevant treatment area once daily for three continuous weeks (21 Days).

Patients  stayed  at  the  study  centre  overnight  at  treatment  initiation  (Day  1,  1st  dose),  and  end  of treatment (Day 21, last dose) visits for collection of a 24-hour serum PK profile. During the domiciled periods  of  initiation  (Day  1),  and  end  of  treatment  (Day  20-21)  visits,  serum  PK  samples  were collected  predose  and  at  planned  time  points  through  24  hours  post  dose.  At  the  end  of  treatment (Day 21), additional PK samples were taken at approximately 48 and 72 hours post application. Single serum samples for PK analyses of trough concentrations were obtained at Day 7 and Day 14 (in the morning prior to dosing).

Adverse events, study medication accountability, and dosing compliance were reviewed at each visit. Routine clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, haematology and urinalysis) were performed at Screening, Day 1 (predose), and the end of study visits.

At total of 19 patients (14 males and 5 females) with at least 10 actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face and/or  balding  scalp  participated  in  the  trial,  and  18  patients  completed  treatment.  One  patient discontinued prematurely due to an adverse event, and one patient missed a dose on Day 20 and was therefore excluded from the evaluation of Day 21 data.

Serum  concentrations  of  imiquimod  (R-837)  were  relatively  low  in  patients  treated  with  daily applications  of  imiquimod  3.75%  cream  for  up  to  21  days.  While  serum  concentrations  of  two imiquimod metabolites (S-26704 and S-27700 combined) were measured throughout the study, very few samples had concentrations above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). Therefore, these data were  too  sparse  to  assess.  The  single-dose  and  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  imiquimod  are summarised in the following table.

Peak exposure (Cmax) and total exposure (AUC0-24) for imiquimod (R-837) were higher on Day 21 than Day 1 when analysing all patients in the pharmacokinetic population. The mean accumulation ratios, RCmax  and  RAUC,  for  all  patients  in  the  pharmacokinetic  population  were  2.810  and  3.873, respectively. The serum concentration profile on Day 21 was relatively flat across the dosage interval, and mean Cmax (0.323±0.159 ng/ml) was less than twice the level of mean Cmin (0.199±0.109 ng/ml). The mean effective half-life for accumulation was 55.3 hours and the mean observed elimination halflife was 29.3 hours on Day 21. Analysis of trough concentrations over time indicated that steady-state conditions were achieved between Day 7 and Day 14, which was consistent with the time to steady state predicted from the observed elimination half-life (approximately 6 days) and the effective half-life for accumulation (approximately 12 days).

In a comparison of female and male patients who applied imiquimod 3.75% cream to the face, serum pharmacokinetics for imiquimod (R-837) were very similar for both groups on Day 21. In a comparison of scalp and face applications in male patients, imiquimod (R-837) Cmax and AUC0-24 were lower on Day 21 in patients who applied study medication to balding scalp rather than to the face. Analyses of the subgroups were limited by wide variability in the data, small overall numbers, and a large disparity in group sizes (female/male comparison of 4 versus 10 patients, and scalp/face comparison of 3 versus 10 patients).

In  conclusion,  the  amount  of  imiquimod  (R-837)  absorbed  into  systemic  circulation  after  topical application of imiquimod 3.75% cream to the face and/or scalp once daily for up to 21 days was low; peak and total  serum imiquimod concentrations increased 3- to 4-fold between Day 1 and Day 21. Steady state was achieved by Day 14. Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 21 appeared to be similar in female and male patients and lower in male patients who applied imiquimod 3.75% cream to balding scalp rather  the  face.  Imiquimod  metabolites  (S-26704  and  S-27700  combined)  were  measured,  but  the data were too sparse to assess.

##  Bioavailability

Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained following single-dose and repeat-dose administration of 3.75% imiquimod cream in Study GW01-0706. The mean (SD) accumulation ratios calculated from Cmax and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AUC0-24  were  2.810  (1.514)  and  3.873  (2.153),  respectively.  The  mean  effective  half-life  for accumulation was 55.3 hours and the mean observed elimination half-life was 29.3 hours on Day 21. Analysis  of  trough  concentrations  over  time  indicated  that  steady-state  conditions  were  achieved between  Day  7  and  Day  14,  which  is  consistent  with  the  time  to  steady  state  predicted  from  the observed  elimination  half-life  (approximately  6  days)  and  the  effective  half-life  for  accumulation (approximately 12 days).

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained following single-dose and repeat-dose administration of 3.75% imiquimod cream in Study GW01-0706. Compared to Aldara 5% cream 2 sachets applied x3/week to scalp, ~20% higher exposure is expected with Zyclara. The relative exposure is approximately 3 times higher when Zyclara is compared to Aldara 1 sachet applied x3/week. According to the European SmPC of Aldara, the most clinically serious adverse event reported following multiple oral doses of 200 mg (content  of  approximately  21  sachets  of  Zyclara)  was  hypotension  which  resolved  following  oral  or intravenous fluid administration. Therefore, despite relatively higher exposure compared to Aldara, the overall systemic exposure with Zyclara does not seem excessive. These findings, in conjunction with safety findings from submitted clinical trials, including the one year observational study GW01-0803, indicate that the higher systemic exposure with Zyclara does not lead to major safety concerns.

No  data  on  special  populations  or  interactions  with  other  medicines  have  been  provided.  The  low systemic  exposure  and  the  post-marketing  data  obtained  from  this  and  the  higher  strength  of  the same active substance (Aldara 5% cream) are reasonably reassuring.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  pharmacodynamic  section  of  the  SmPC  is  based  on  data  obtained  from  studies  on  Aldara  5% cream. Given that the same active substance is used in this product, this was considered acceptable.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Data obtained from Study GW01-0706 is considered adequate to further characterise the PK of this product. Bridging to Aldara 5% cream data for the PD section of the SmPC (section 5.1) with regard to the mechanism of action is acceptable.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Main studies

The data to support this application come from 4 clinical studies with 2 investigational formulations (Imiquimod 2.5% and 3.75% creams), 2 pairs of identically designed studies, with each pair having a different treatment regimen: Studies GW01-0702 and GW01-0704 had 2-week treatment schedules as per the proposed SmPC, whereas GW01-0703 and GW01-0705 had 3-week treatment schedules and are considered as supportive studies accordingly.

GW01-0702 and GW01-0704: A phase 3, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre, efficacy and safety study of four weeks of treatment with imiquimod creams for actinic keratoses

## Methods

## Study Participants

Patients had 5 to 20 typical visible or palpable AKs in an area that exceeded 25 cm 2 on either the face or the balding scalp (but not both). Three hundred and nineteen (319) patients with AK were treated.

Actinic keratosis lesions in the defined treatment area (face/balding scalp) were counted by qualified investigators at baseline and at each study visit to determine treatment efficacy. They were diagnosed by clinical inspection as per usual clinical practice. The same evaluator was to count and record the number of AK lesions present in the treatment area throughout the whole study.

## Treatments

The scheduling of treatment schedules for the trials are shown below.

Note:A no-treatment period of 2weeks occurred between the 2 treatment cycles.

Study medication was applied in a thin layer once daily to the treatment area (the entire face or the balding  scalp,  but  not  both),  avoiding  the  periocular  area,  lips,  and  nares.  This  allowed  patients  to treat a larger area of sun-damaged skin, including any subclinical lesions that may have been present in the treatment area. As the treatment area was determined to be either the full face or balding scalp,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  did  not  need  to  remember  the  outline  of  a  fixed  (25  cm 2 )  patch  of  skin  designated  for treatment.

A maximum of 2 sachets of study medication, total 500 mg cream including 18.75 mg imiquimod, was applied daily for 2 week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment cycle.

In addition, all patients who showed complete clearance at the end of one of the 2 pivotal studies were invited to be monitored for one year.

## Objectives

The  studies  were  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  the  individual  imiquimod  cream  formulations 3.75% and 2.5% to vehicle.

## Outcomes/endpoints

For all studies the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients for whom the AKs were completely cleared. For Studies 0702 and 0704 this was at 14 weeks. Secondary endpoints were partial clearance rates (75% reduction in AKs) and the percent change in total number of lesions from baseline.

## Randomisation

Eligible patients were centrally randomised to placebo, imiquimod 2.5%, or imiquimod 3.75% (1:1:1).

## Statistical methods

For the purposes of the comparison of imiquimod to placebo the hypothesis testing was planned and performed using a hierarchical procedure (modified Bonferroni-Holm procedure).

Missing data were handled using Last observation Carried Forward (LOCF). Additional analysis of the primary  efficacy  variable  was  performed  in  which  all  missing  observations  were  considered  'not cleared' (i.e.  counted as  failures).  The  Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test, adjusting for site, was used to analyse the data. To control for the 2 doses, Hochberg's modification of the Bonferroni procedure was used. After this, the 2 doses were tested against each other at the 5% level.

For the combined trials the complete clearance rate of the full face or balding scalp under Zyclara 3.75% cream was 35.6 % (57/160 patients, CI 28.2%, 43.6 %) under vehicle 6.3% (10/159 patients, CI 3.1%, 11.3%) at the 8-week post-treatment visit.

## Supportive studies

GW01-0703 and GW01-0705: A phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of six weeks of treatment with imiquimod creams for actinic keratoses

These 2 studies have the same design as the pivotal studies, the only difference being the treatment regimen of 3-week cycle instead of 2-week cycle.

End of study (EOS, 8 weeks post end of treatment, Week 17 based on study design) was the time point used for evaluation of the primary (complete clearance) and two secondary (partial clearance, percent AK lesion reduction) efficacy endpoints.

Study  GW01-0803 was  a  follow-up  observational  study  to  evaluate  sustained  clearance  rates  of actinic  keratoses  up  to  one  year  after  completion  of  studies  GW01-0702,  GW01-0703,  GW01-0704, and  GW01-0705.  At  the  12  month  follow-up  timepoint,  the  sustained  clearance  rate  was  40.5%  in patients previously treated with the 3.75% 2-week treatment cycle regimen. Overall, slightly higher rates  of  sustained  complete  clearance  were  observed  in  patients  previously  treated  with  imiquimod 3.75% versus 2.5% and with 3-week versus 2-week treatment cycle regimens.

Study GW01-0901 was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which the  efficacy  and  safety  of  imiquimod  3.75%  cream  following  cryosurgery  to  treat  clinically  typical visible  or  palpable  AK  lesions  on  the  face  was  compared  with  that  of  placebo  cream.  The cryosurgery/imiquimod 3.75% group achieved significantly greater efficacy than the cryosurgery/placebo  group  in  terms  of    percent  reduction  of  all  AK  lesions,  cryosurgery-treated  AK lesions, and non-cryosurgery-treated AK lesions from baseline to Week 26/end of study (EOS) in the ITT  population.  The  primary  endpoint,  percent  reduction  from  baseline  to  Week  26/EOS  of  all  AK lesions, showed a median percent reduction of 86.5% with imiquimod 3.75% treatment compared with a 50.0% reduction with placebo treatment.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Design and conduct of the clinical studies submitted were considered appropriate for this hybrid application. The choice of primary and secondary endpoints and the inclusion/exclusion criteria were also considered acceptable.

The  statistical  methods  used  to  analyse  the  data  are  acceptable.  The  use  of  LOCF  may  not  be appropriate and the use of missing = failure may be more appropriate. The Applicant has presented both  analyses  which  was  considered  sufficient.  The  procedure  to  control  the  Type  I  error  was acceptable.

The Applicant has adequately described the patient population. There were very little missing data and thus the sensitivity analyses should provide similar results to the main analyses. There did not appear to be a difference between the doses, or the reasons for withdrawal, either within or between studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant has provided clear statistical evidence of efficacy over placebo for both doses. The prespecified primary analysis using LOCF (not shown) showed similar results. Although none of the studies showed a formal separation of the doses, the studies were never powered to do this and 3 of the 4 studies show a clear numerical separating.

It is also noted that in general there does not seem to be a substantial benefit using 3-week treatment as opposed to 2-week treatment. Whilst this should be treated with caution as cross-trial comparisons are non-randomised comparisons, the evidence generated to date does suggest there is little benefit from the longer treatment regimen and thus the one proposed by the applicant is acceptable.

All  secondary endpoints (not shown) showed very similar results, with highly significant effects over placebo and no statistical difference between doses, albeit with a numerical difference.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and the younger patients.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Superior efficacy of Zyclara 3.75% cream in comparison to placebo in the treatment of AK has been demonstrated.  Given  that  Zyclara  is  not  intended  for  interchangeable  use  with  Aldara,  formal therapeutic equivalence data are not deemed necessary. However, lack of active comparator data to a first line treatment, limits the use of Zyclara to second line therapy as is the case with the reference product, Aldara.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The safety database on Imiquimod 3.75% cream includes 969 patients. Approximately 85% showed a transitory increase in AK lesions count during one course of treatment. The lesions decreased during the treatment interval and the treatment free follow-up periods. The patient population enrolled in the study were predominantly male, Caucasian, elderly, with multiple AKs over a wide area of sun-exposed facial or scalp skin and thus reflecting the target population of AK patients.

The  study  program  excluded  pregnant  and  lactating  women,  patients  with  renal,  hepatic  or  cardiac impairments, patients with polymorphism, and children (there were no participants under the age of 33). In addition, patients who were treated with immune-modulators or immunosuppressive therapy were excluded (only inhaled/ intranasal steroids were permitted).

## Adverse events

The drug exposure for Imiquimod 3.75% cream using the recommended regimen of daily treatment for 2x2 weeks was higher (18.75 mg/ day) than the exposure for the currently licensed Imiquimod 5% cream (12.5 mg/ treatment day). No new safety signals were identified during the pivotal clinical trial program.  Most  patients  experienced  local  skin  reactions,  which  subsided  with  completion  of  each treatment cycle. Some patients discontinued as a result of adverse events.

11% of patients receiving imiquimod 3.75% cream in the proposed 2-week regimen during the pivotal studies required periods of treatment interruption due to adverse events.

A range of adverse reactions concerning the reproductive system and breast disorders are included in the  EU  SmPC  for  Aldara.  Imiquimod  3.75%  cream  is  not  indicated  for  perianal  and  genital  warts. However, due to a potential of off-label use, adverse reactions of the reproductive system and breast disorders should be included in the SmPC for imiquimod 3.75% cream.

As expected, higher rates of AEs were observed with active treatment compared to vehicle with a dose and duration dependent pattern (higher rate of AEs in 3.75% vs 2.5% cream and in 3 week vs 2 week duration  of  treatment).  The  AEs  reported  were  generally  consistent  with  those  previously  identified with Aldara 5%.

## Laboratory findings

Clinical laboratory analysis results were similar in both the 2-week and 3-week treatment cycle studies. Examination of the shift tables for laboratory data revealed no trends. For most of the haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis variables, the majority of patients were normal at screening and at the end of the study. Occasional shifts from within the normal range to above or below the limits of the normal range  were  observed  in  all  3  treatment  groups  for  most  laboratory  tests  in  both  the  pivotal  and supportive studies.

## Safety in special populations

Adverse events were examined in the pivotal and supportive studies by demographic subpopulations. The incidence of AEs tended to be somewhat higher in patients with Fitzpatrick skin type I or II than in those with type III-VI, and in patients who treated the face than in those who treated the balding scalp in the active treatment groups, but there were no other apparent trends within the subgroups. Of note, approximately half of the study populations was 65 years or older.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No  interaction  studies  have  been  performed.  This  includes  studies  with  immunosuppressive  drugs. Interactions  with  systemic  drugs  would  be  limited  by  the  minimal  percutaneous  absorption  of imiquimod  cream.  Due  to  its  immunostimulating  properties,  imiquimod  cream  should  be  used  with caution in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive medicinal products.

The concomitant use of Zyclara and any other imiquimod creams in the same treatment area should be avoided since they contain the same active ingredient (imiquimod) and may increase the risk for and severity of local skin reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pivotal studies, 6 patients reported 9 AEs that led to discontinuation from the study: 2 patients in the 3.75% imiquimod group, 1 patient in the 2.5% imiquimod group, and 3 patients in the placebo group. Five of these events were considered to be related or probably related to study treatment by the investigator. None of the AEs leading to withdrawal from the 2-week treatment cycle studies were categorized as SAEs.

## Post marketing experience

Cumulative post-marketing experience since 1997 was available for Imiquimod 5%. The MEDA safety database for imiquimod in all indications contained a total of 3282 individual medically confirmed case reports. Of these, 407 cases were serious and unlisted.

As of 27 April 2010, a PSUR covering information from both, Aldara 5% and Zyclara (Imiquimod 3.75% cream) was issued. According to this PSUR, no new relevant safety findings have been identified from postmarketing adverse events reports coincident with the appearance of imiquimod 3.75% cream on the market in the US and Canada. These safety data are in accordance with the safety information presented in the proposed SmPC.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Clinical safety of the reference product (Aldara 5% cream) in the treatment of actinic keratosis is wellestablished.

With respect to tolerability and safety of the 2-week versus 3-week treatment regimens, similar doseresponse relationship was seen with respect to local skin reactions and certain systemic reactions that are considered to be attributable to local cytokine release triggered by imiquimod. In contrast to the efficacy  estimates, the incidence of adverse reactions appeared to be higher in the 3-week regimen than in the 2-week regimen. For instance, the number of rest periods taken, mainly triggered by local skin and applications site reactions, increased strongly from the 2-week (10.6% of patients) to the 3week regimen (27.2% of patients).

Therefore,  the  Applicant  primarily  proposed  for  the  3.75%  strength  to  be  applied  daily  (up  to  two sachets) for 2 treatment cycles of 2 weeks each, separated by a 2-week treatment pause.

Zyclara at the proposed posology leads to a higher systemic exposure compared to Aldara when used for the treatment of AK. This higher exposure did not lead to any new safety signals during the pivotal clinical  trials  with  Zyclara.  It  is  also  noted  that  the  clinical  development  program  of  Zyclara  did  not include a formal head to head comparison with Aldara. However, the applicant following CHMP request, provided this comparison.

With respect to local skin reactions, the following comparison of Zyclara versus Aldara data is provided in Table 20. It shows that the incidence of severe local skin reactions is not consistently different when using Zyclara 3.75% in the 2-week regimen compared to using Aldara 5% in the 1-2 COT regimen. Such outcome is to be expected given the known qualitatively comparable efficacy. Note that many of these skin reactions were already present at baseline as signs of severity of the target disease AK, although often only of mild and never of severe severity. Therefore, the threshold 'severe' is most sensitive for such a comparison.

During therapy and until healed, affected skin is likely to appear noticeably different from normal skin. Local skin reactions are common but these reactions generally decrease in intensity during therapy or resolve  after  cessation  of  imiquimod  cream  therapy.  Rarely,  intense  local  inflammatory  reactions including skin weeping or erosion can occur after only a few applications of imiquimod cream.

There is an association between the complete clearance rate and the intensity of local skin reactions (e.g.  erythema).  These  local  skin  reactions  may  be  related  to  the  stimulation  of  local  immune response. Furthermore, imiquimod has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the skin. If required by the patient's discomfort or the intensity of the local skin reaction, a rest period of several days  may  be  taken.  Treatment  with  imiquimod  cream  can  be  resumed  after  the  skin  reaction  has moderated. The intensity of the local skin reactions tend to be lower in the second cycle than in the first treatment cycle with Zyclara.

The other important expected part of side effects are systemic reactions attributable to a spillover of local cytokine release into systemic circulation, summarised in the following tables.

* In the Aldara project only \"fever\" was coded, while in the imiquimod 3.75% project only \"\"pyrexia\" was coded.

** Such terms were coded as\"influenza-like illness\" in study GW01-0901.

Flu-like systemic signs and symptoms may accompany, or even precede, intense local skin reactions and may include fatigue, nausea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and chills. An interruption of dosing or dose adjustment should be considered. Imiquimod should be used with caution in patients with reduced haematologic reserve.

The safety and efficacy of Zyclara in immunocompromised patients (e.g. organ transplant patients) and/or patients with autoimmune conditions have not been established. Therefore, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.5). Consideration should be given to balancing the benefit of imiquimod treatment for these patients with the risk associated either with the possibility of organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease or a possible worsening of their autoimmune condition.

No data are available on re-treating actinic keratoses that have cleared after two cycles of treatment and subsequently recur.

For imiquimod no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.

Zyclara should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

The long-term safety aspect was assessed in study GW01-0803. During this follow-up study, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were the most frequently reported AEs in the study. Squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma was reported in 4 patients in the 3.75% imiquimod, 3-week treatment cycle regimen and basal cell carcinoma was reported in 1 patient in the 2.5% imiquimod, 2week treatment cycle regimen. 3 out of 4 of these patients had a reported history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma. On all 4 occasions, the investigators' assessment of causality was 'not related' (in 1 case 'probably not related') to study medication.

These results were not alarming and could hardly be linked to slightly higher systemic exposure seen with  Zyclara.  However,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  include  the  two  studies  X-03016-3271  and X-03016-3284,  implemented  as  part  of  the  Aldara  (imiquimod  5%)  RMP,  in  the  RMP  of  Zyclara  to gather long-term data on recurrences of actinic keratosis and progression to superficial squamous cell carcinoma.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Safety of Zyclara in the treatment of AK at the proposed posology and for the duration of pivotal clinical trials has been demonstrated. A comparison between AE and SAE data of Zyclara vs Aldara indicate local skin reactions for both treatments are comparable and reactions are mostly reflective of the therapeutic action of imiquimod. Comparative data for 2-week regimen - in line with the proposed duration of treatment - shows that the rates of systemic AEs are generally low for both treatments, and numerically slightly in favour of Zyclara (with the exception of lymphadenopathy which was seen in 1.9% of patients who received the 3.75% cream compared to 0.8% of those who received Aldara). It can be concluded that the safety profile of Zyclara is comparable to that of Aldara.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

The applicant must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

## PSUR submission

On the basis of the safety data submitted, the CHMP considered that the PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product (Aldara, imiquimod 5%), which currently is on a 3-yearly cycle.

The next data lock point for the reference medicinal product is 26 January 2014.

## User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Compared to Aldara (5% imiquimod), Zyclara has lower concentration of the active substance (3.75% imiquimod), allowing the treatment of areas larger than 25 cm 2 and a higher number of lesions. The daily dosing regimen with Zyclara, compared to dosing on a certain number of days in the week for Aldara, is more intuitive and more easily followed by patients potentially improving compliance with treatment.

Data from pivotal trials have established superior short term efficacy compared to placebo. The average response rate across the 4 pivotal studies was approximately 35% for Zyclara, compared to 5% for placebo. All results were highly statistically significant.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Although efficacy and safety of Zyclara versus placebo at the given strength and proposed posology was demonstrated through 2 pivotal trials, comparative efficacy of Aldara and Zyclara is less clear, as the 2 have never been compared in head to head trials. The efficacy and safety of Zyclara vs a well established first line treatment has never been assessed and such comparison is limited to the use of historical data which has known limitations. However, as long as Zyclara remains a second line therapy, as is the case with the reference product, Aldara, this approach (comparison vs placebo only) can be acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The clinical safety of Zyclara is comparable to that of the reference product (Aldara 5% cream) in the treatment of actinic keratosis, which is well-established and includes local skin reactions as well as flulike systemic signs and symptoms  (fatigue, nausea, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and chills) attributable to local cytokine release from the immune-stimulatory action of imiquimod.

The long-term safety aspect was assessed during study GW01-0803 which was a one year observational follow-up to Studies GW01-0702, GW01-0703, GW01-0704, and GW01-0705. During this follow-up study, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were the most frequently reported AEs in the study. Squamous cell or basal cell carcinomas were reported in 4 patients in the 3.75% imiquimod, 3-week treatment cycle regimen and basal cell carcinoma was reported in 1 patient in the 2.5% imiquimod, 2-week treatment cycle regimen. Three out of 4 of these patients had a reported history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma. On 3 occasions, the investigators' assessment of causality was 'not related' to study medication and on 1 occasion 'probably not related'. These results are not alarming and, given that they occurred within weeks to months after the treatment was stopped, it is unlikely the development of squamous cell carcinoma is causally related to slightly higher systemic exposure seen with Zyclara.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Compared to Aldara 5% cream 2 sachets applied 3 times per week, around 20% higher systemic exposure is expected with Zyclara. The relative systemic exposure is approximately 3 times higher when Zyclara is compared to Aldara 1 sachet applied 3 times per week. According to the European SmPC of Aldara, the most clinically serious adverse event reported following accidental ingestion of 200 mg (content of approximately 21 sachets of Zyclara) was hypotension which resolved following oral or intravenous fluid administration. Therefore, despite relatively higher exposure compared to Aldara, the overall systemic exposure with Zyclara does not seem excessive.

These findings, in conjunction with safety findings from submitted clinical trials, including the one year observational study GW01-0803, indicate that the higher systemic exposure with Zyclara does not lead to major safety concerns. However, lack of data on long-term exposure (beyond the duration of the submitted clinical trials) limits the ability to detect differences in the rates of uncommon AEs compared to Aldara. In view of uncertainties with regard to the rates of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, long-term data on recurrence of actinic keratosis and progression to squamous cell carcinoma, the applicant has agreed to include the two studies X-03016-3271 and X-03016-3284, implemented as part of the Aldara (imiquimod 5%) RMP, in the RMP for Zyclara to gather long-term data on recurrences of actinic keratosis and progression to superficial squamous cell carcinoma.

## Benefit-risk balance

Overall, the data presented show that Zyclara 3.75% (imiquimod) is an effective treatment for actinic keratosis.  The  use  of  Zyclara  over  the  duration  of  the  presented  clinical  trials  did  not  raise  safety issues.  Compared  to  Aldara,  the  posology  of  Zyclara  is  easier  to  follow,  potentially  improving compliance. It also allows for treating a larger surface area and, therefore, higher number of lesions. The Benefit/Risk of Zyclara is considered to be favourable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Zyclara in the topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults, when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Pharmacovigilance System

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

## Risk management system

The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
-  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
-  At the request of the EMA

## PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle for the product will follow PSURs submission schedule for the reference medicinal product.
