## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Venetoclax (tradename Venclyxto) is a selective, orally bioavailable, small molecule B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor.

In the EU, Venclyxto is approved in the following indications:

- Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1).
- Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL:
- in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, or
- in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.
- Venclyxto in combination with a hypomethylating agent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

With this procedure the MAH submitted the final report for study M13-833, a Phase 1 study of the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of venetoclax in paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory malignancies.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study M13-833

## Description

Study M13-833 was an open-label, global, Phase 1, dose determination (consisting of both a dose determination and dose escalation/de-escalation component) and cohort expansion study in pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory malignancies.

## Study design

In Part 1, Dose Determination subjects with any relapsed or refractory tumor without available curative treatment options were eligible to enroll. In Part 1, Dose Escalation/De-escalation solid tumor subjects without bone marrow involvement were eligible to enroll. During Part 2 (Cohort Expansion), subjects were enrolled into one of five tumor cohorts. Four of the cohorts enrolled subjects with the following malignancies: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Neuroblastoma (NBL). A fifth exploratory cohort (referred to as Other Tumors) enrolled subjects with any other tumor that expressed B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) or subjects with transcription factor 3-hepatic leukemia factor (TCF3-HLF) ALL confirmed during frontline induction therapy. Subjects who had primary brain tumors and disease that was metastatic to the brain were excluded because of preclinical murine data indicating that venetoclax is unlikely to penetrate a mature blood-brain barrier. Subjects with solid tumors enrolled in the fifth cohort were analyzed separately.

## Methods

## Study participants

In summary the study planned to enroll 165 patients (whereas 143 were actually enrolled, 140 were analyzed).

Part 1 will enroll a minimum of 10 patients with any relapsed or refractory tumor type without available curative treatment options. Approximately 45 patients may be enrolled to ensure sufficient enrolment across age and weight ranges and tumor types if additional PK data is required.

Part 2 will enroll 44 - 125 patients into five tumor cohorts. ALL, AML, NHL and neuroblastoma comprise four of these cohorts.

Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

- Subjects were &lt;25 years of age. o Enrollment of subjects ≥ 18 years of age was halted at any time during the study to ensure adequate enrollment of pediatric subjects (&lt;18 years).
- Subjects had relapsed or refractory cancer.
- o Subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma that was refractory after completion of at least 4 cycles of induction therapy (no response or stable disease as best response) were eligible to enroll in Part 2 (cohort expansion).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

o Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of TCF3-HLF ALL were eligible to enroll in the 5th cohort in Part 2 (cohort expansion) beginning on or after Day 15 of induction or the end of induction and were assessed independently of other subjects with ALL.

- Subjects had adequate hepatic function.
- Subjects had normal creatinine for age or have a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .
- Subjects ≤ 16 years of age had performance status of Lansky ≥ 50% and subjects &gt;16 years of age had performance status of Karnofsky ≥ 50%.
- In Part 1, subjects with solid tumors (with the exception of neuroblastoma) had adequate bone marrow function as defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/µL and platelets &gt;75,000/μL (with transfusion independence defined as not receiving platelet transfusion within 7 days prior to enrollment).
- For Part 2 of the study - for enrollment into the fifth cohort (other tumors), subjects had evidence of BCL-2 expression determined locally in either archived tumor tissue or tumor tissue available at relapse. Exception: subjects with TCF3-HLF ALL enrolled in the fifth cohort were not required to have evidence of BCL-2 expression.

## Treatments

This was an open-label Phase 1 study without any active- or placebo control group(s). An overview of the different test product formulations is shown in Table 1 (section 2.2).

Venetoclax was administered orally QD, continuously, in subjects with hematologic malignancies. Subjects with Solid Tumors enrolled in Part 1 (Dose Determination) were also administered venetoclax orally QD, continuously. Subjects with Solid Tumors enrolled in the Escalation/De-escalation portion of Part 1 were administered venetoclax orally QD, continuously or intermittently depending on the assigned cohort.

Venetoclax dose was ramped up to the target dose over 2 or 3 days depending on the tumor type. Subjects with Solid Tumors were ramped up over 2 days (400 mg Day 1 - 800 mg Day 2) and Subjects with liquid tumors (ALL, AML, NHL) were ramped up over 3 days (200 mg Day 1 - 400 mg Day 2 - 800 mg Day 3).

Patients who are &lt;2 years of age were to be dosed based on age because venetoclax is metabolized through the CYP3A system, which is not fully mature until the age of 2. Patients who are 2 years of age and older were to be dosed based on weight.

Individual doses will be adjusted by age or weight to match an adult exposure equivalent target daily dose of 800 mg. During Part 1 (Dose Determination), all patients will be administered the tablet for oral suspension (see Table 2: Venetoclax Dosing). If 800 mg is not tolerated, a lower dose (400 mg adult equivalent) will be evaluated at a lower dose level. Dose levels greater than 800 mg may be evaluated. At start of treatment, venetoclax will ramp-up to the target dose over 3 days (equivalent to 200 mg Day 1 - 400 mg Day 2 - 800 mg Day 3; see Table 2: Venetoclax Dosing Day 3). The maximum tolerated dose for venetoclax monotherapy has not been reached in adult studies evaluating daily venetoclax monotherapy at doses up to 1200 mg. Doses will be adjusted if needed based on PK data from Part 1 (Dose Determination).

Dose can only be administered using the tablet for oral suspension formulation

The recommended dose for cohort expansion was chosen based on evaluation of the 800 mg dose during Part 1 and if required, evaluation of a dose lower or higher than 800 mg. The stepwise dosing to 800 mg may be eliminated during Part 2, following analysis of data generated during Part 1.

Patients could receive study drug up to 9 months.

## Venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy

Combination with chemotherapy was allowed on Day 3/Day 4 or later as decided by the investigator.

Chemotherapy was added to venetoclax beginning on Day 4 for subjects with liquid tumors and beginning on Day 3 for subjects with neuroblastoma or solid tumors. Venetoclax was given at 800 mg adult-equivalent dose when chemotherapy combination was initiated, unless noted below:

- 400 mg adult-equivalent in combination with azacitidine or decitabine
- 400 mg adult-equivalent in combination with imatinib or nilotinib (imatinib and nilotinib are moderate CYP3A inhibitors)
- 400 mg adult-equivalent for patients with TCF3-HLF ALL.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy

The following efficacy evaluations/endpoints were collected during the study: objective response rate, complete response rate, partial response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and MRD status. Responses were assessed using established response criteria for each tumor type (amended as relevant for pediatric use).

## Safety

The following safety evaluations were performed during the study: adverse event monitoring and laboratory test assessments.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentrations of venetoclax were determined using a validated liquid/liquid extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric detection. The lower limit of quantitation for venetoclax was established at 2.00 ng/mL.

PK samples were to be collected during Part 1 and Part 2 until appropriate data for each indication had been collected. An overview of the sampling scheme is shown in Table 7.

Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax including the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax (peak time, time to maximum observed concentration [Tmax]), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and apparent clearance (CL/F) were determined using non-compartmental methods as applicable. Dose-normalized Cmax and AUC values were calculated by dividing each of these PK parameters by the adult-equivalent dose.

## Sample size

For Part 1 (dose determination), complete data from 10 subjects yielded a two-sided 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean PK parameter estimate with 95.4% probability. The calculation assumed a total standard deviation of 0.3403 for the natural logarithm of AUCinf. This value was selected based upon the sum of within-subject and between-subject variances for venetoclax AUCinf from pediatric formulation bioavailability Study M16-069.

The sample size in Part 2 was determined using a Gehan 2-Stage design with beta = 10%, and a target for response rate of 20%. Additional patients may be added if required, particularly in cohorts with disease heterogeneity, to pursue potential signals in different subtypes. The NHL cohort and Cohort 5 may not completely enroll; the NHL cohort may enroll a minimum of 1 patient.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was an open-label Phase 1 study without any active- or placebo control group(s).

## Statistical Methods

Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on all subjects who received at least 1 dose of venetoclax, unless otherwise specified.

## Efficacy

Analyses were performed for the following five analysis groups: AML, ALL, NHL, Neuroblastoma, Solid Tumors. The Solid Tumor analysis group includes subjects from the exploratory cohort with solid tumors. The Other Tumors analysis group includes all other subjects from the exploratory cohort.

Analysis of ORR (CR + CRi + CRp + PR for ALL and AML, CR + PR for NHL and Solid Tumors, and CR+PR+MR for Neuroblastoma), complete response rate, partial response rate, MRD status, OS, and PFS were performed, and the corresponding 95% CIs were constructed based on binomial distribution for dichotomous endpoints or, respectively, on Kaplan-Meier methodology for time-to-event endpoints. Safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety of venetoclax was assessed by evaluation of study drug exposure, AEs, SAEs, deaths, and changes in laboratory measures.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentrations of venetoclax and PK parameter values were tabulated for each patient and each dose level. Summary statistics were provided for each dose level and parameter.

## Protocol changes

The original protocol, 24 February 2017, (0 subjects) had 5 amendments and 4 administrative changes and 1 country-specific protocol. The amendments and number of subjects enrolled under each amendment were as follows:

- Amendment 1 (13 October 2017, 15 subjects)
- Amendment 2 (23 February 2018, 7 subjects)
- Amendment 3 (19 October 2018, 23 subjects)
- Amendment 4 (25 June 2019, 55 subjects)
- Amendment 5 (09 March 2021, 40 subjects)
- Country Specific (UK 0-01) (05 October 2017, 0 subjects)

The MAH states that the protocol changes described in the amendments and administrative changes did not affect the interpretation of study results.

## Statistical changes

There were no changes to the planned analyses after finalization of the SAP.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 140 subjects at 27 sites in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States were enrolled in Study M13-833.

Enrollment was open until each of the cohorts in Part 2 had been filled, with the exception of the NHL analysis group and the Other Tumors analysis group. Enrollment of subjects ≥ 18 years of age was halted at times during the study to ensure adequate enrollment of pediatric subjects (&lt;18 years).

In Part 1 (Dose Determination), 22 subjects (10 with AML, 5 with ALL, 0 with NHL, 3 with neuroblastoma, 4 with solid tumors, and 0 with other tumors) were enrolled to ensure sufficient enrollment across all weight ranges and tumor types within each of the following age groups: &lt;2, 211, and 12-17 years.

Additionally, 18 subjects with neuroblastoma (N=7) and solid tumors (N=11) were enrolled in Part 1 Dose Escalation/De-escalation. Specifically, Cohort S1, S-1, S-2 each enrolled 6 subjects (2, 5, and 4, respectively, with solid tumors, and 4, 1, and 2, respectively, with neuroblastoma). Cohort S2 did not enroll any subjects based on the Bayesian optimal interval design and incidence of DLTs observed in Cohort S1.

In Part 2, a total of 100 subjects were enrolled into 5 tumor cohorts; ALL (N=26), AML (N=27), NHL (N=2), Neuroblastoma (N=26), and a fifth exploratory analysis group with other tumor types who had evidence of BCL-2 expression and had exhausted curative treatment options. In this exploratory

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cohort, N=8 subjects were included in the solid tumors analysis group and N=11 subjects in the other tumors analysis group.

Progressive disease was the leading primary reason for venetoclax discontinuation in most disease analysis groups.

Two subjects (8.7%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of venetoclax. All AEs leading to discontinuation of Venetoclax were reported in 1 subject (4.3%) each. These events included febrile neutropenia, vomiting, and muscular weakness.

## Other tumours

In subjects with Other Tumors (N=11), the most common TEAEs were anemia, white blood cell count decreased, and lymphocyte count decreased (90.9% each), vomiting and nausea (81.8% each). The most common Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were anemia, lymphocyte count decreased, and white blood cell count decreased (90.9% each) and neutrophil count decreased (72.7%).

A total of 7 subjects (63.6%) died. These deaths were not due to AEs.

Five subjects (45.5%) experienced an SAE. These included febrile neutropenia (27.3%), and bacteremia and vascular device infection (18.2% each). All other AEs were reported in 1 subject each.

Two subjects (18.2%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of venetoclax. All AEs leading to discontinuation of Venetoclax were reported in 1 subject (9.1%) each. These events included platelet count decreased and white blood cell count decreased.

## Deaths

In all 140 subjects, a total of 98 deaths were reported in this study as of 19 April 2023, the LSLV date for this final report. The primary cause of death among almost all subjects was reported as \"Disease Progression\" per the investigator's assessment. Among all analysis groups, TEAEs leading to death were reported in 12 subjects overall and include multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

malignant neoplasm progression, respiratory failure, hypoxia, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia fungal, cardiac failure, pericardial effusion, Escherichia sepsis, and hypotension. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death considered possibly related to chemotherapy agents were reported in 1 subject; these events were pneumonia fungal and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Among subjects with neuroblastoma, 1 subject who had a Grade 5 fungal pneumonia that caused multiorgan failure died; this death was considered possibly related to venetoclax. Among subjects with ALL, 1 subject had a Grade 5 pneumonia assessed as possibly related to venetoclax; however, after being originally reported as a death from an AE, the cause of death was re-assessed by the investigator as related to disease progression.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH has submitted the final results for study M13-833 in accordance with the Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006.

Study M13-833 was an open-label, global, Phase 1, dose determination (consisting of both a dose determination and dose escalation/de-escalation component) and cohort expansion study in paediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory malignancies.

Treatment with venetoclax was ramped-up to the target dose over 2 (for solid tumours) or 3 days (for AML, ALL and NHL); on Day 3 (for solid tumours) or Day 4 (for AML, ALL and NHL) chemotherapy was added with different chemotherapy regimens depending on the tumour diagnosis.

A total of 140 patients were enrolled and analysed in the following tumour cohorts: AML, ALL, NHL, neuroblastoma, solid tumours (primary tumours expressing BCL-2) and other tumours (other haematological malignancies). Of these malignancies, only AML is an approved indication in adults.

Patient disposition and age across the cohorts was as follows: AML (N=37), median age of 6 years (range 0-17 years); ALL (N=31), median age of 9 years (range 0-25 years); NHL (N=2), 3 years and 21 years, respectively; neuroblastoma (N=36), with a median age of 8 years (range 1-17 years); solid tumours (N=23), median age of 16 years (range 3-24 years); other tumours (N=11), median age of 10 years (range 5-19 years).

## Pharmacokinetics

A reasonable PK sampling schedule has been used to characterise the paediatric PK profile in Study M13-833. The PK parameters included Cmax, tmax and AUC which is considered reasonable parameters to derive using non-compartmental analysis given the PK sampling design. The PK sampling was most intense at Week 2 Day 8 which is considered representative of steady-state and this time-point is considered relevant. Multiple PK samples were also collected during in Part 1 on Days 1-3 of treatment which was also reported (Figure 2). Additional samples were also to be collected using a sparse PK sampling design at later visits during treatment (Table 7).

For Week 2 Day 8, the PK results were stratified based on body weight and age (Table 9, Figure 3). Overall, the exposure seems to be comparable across the different age- and weight groups. However, a limitation is that the PK exposures in Study M13-833 were not compared with the corresponding adult exposure following 800 and 400 mg, i.e. it was not possible to assess whether the applied paediatric doses (Table 2) give rise to exposures which are equivalent to adult exposures.

As an update of the SmPC based on the results from Study M13-833 will be relevant (see below), information on the PK exposure in paediatric patients compared to adults should be included in SmPC section 5.2.

## Efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ORR and CR rates in the AML cohort were 24.3% and 16.2%, respectively, and in the ALL cohort 41.9% (all CR). The estimated median DOR was 78 days (95% CI: 15, 240) for AML and 311 days (95% CI: 84, 432) for ALL. ORR and CR rates in the neuroblastoma cohort were 30.6% and 22.2%, respectively, with an estimated median DOR of 283 days (95% CI: 120, NE).

Although assessment of efficacy is hampered by the lack of a control arm and the small number of patients included in each cohort, the results in terms of response rate indicate anti-tumour activity in patients with AML, ALL or neuroblastoma treated with venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy.

For the other tumours cohort, no analysis of efficacy was undertaken by the MAH due to the many different tumour types enrolled; this is acknowledged. Given the low number of patients included in the NHL and solid tumours cohort, as well as the diversity of tumour types included in the latter cohort, and the lack of a control arm, no conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy for those tumour cohorts.

## Safety

The median duration of exposure to venetoclax ranged from 35 days in the AML cohort to 93 days in the other tumours cohort. Three patients in the AML cohort and 1 patient in the ALL cohort received venetoclax monotherapy; duration of exposure for these 4 patients ranged from 9 to 21 days.

Across all tumour cohorts, the most common TEAEs concerned febrile neutropenia, anaemia and gastrointestinal AEs (vomiting or nausea). Common grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were febrile neutropenia and hypokalaemia. Across all tumour cohorts, the incidence of SAEs ranged from 45.5% in the other tumours cohort to 94.4% in the neuroblastoma cohort. Across all tumour cohorts, 12 TEAEs leading to death were reported. Of these, TEAEs leading to death (fungal pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction) assessed by the investigator as possibly related to venetoclax were reported in 1 patient in the neuroblastoma cohort.

The reported TEAEs for the 4 patients receiving venetoclax monotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile for venetoclax. However, given the small number of patients and the short treatment duration, no firm conclusions can be drawn. The overall safety profile reported for venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy seems to be consistent with the established safety profile for venetoclax; no new safety signals could be identified. However, the assessment of safety is hampered by the lack of a control arm, the various chemotherapy regimens and the diversity of the underlying tumour types.

## Product information

The SmPC for Venclyxto states the following regarding paediatric use:

## Section 4.2

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of venetoclax in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Section 5.1

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Venclyxto in all subsets of the paediatric population in CLL (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Venclyxto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in AML (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

The MAH has not proposed an update of the product information as part of this procedure. However, according to the paediatric regulation ((EC) No 1901/2006), results from paediatric studies, even when there is lack of activity, should be included in the SmPC to provide guidance to prescribers. Furthermore, the current text on deferral of studies with Venclyxto in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of AML should be amended to reflect finalisation of study M13833. Section 4.2 should be amended accordingly.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy and safety in paediatric patients with AML, ALL, NHL, neuroblastoma, solid tumours or other tumours treated with venetoclax in combination with chemotherapy.

Presentation of PK data is considered acceptable in the context of this p46 procedure.

The SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of study M13-833 (section 5.1); the current texts on deferral of paediatric studies (section 5.1) and lack of data (section 4.2) should be updated to reflect finalisation of the study, as detailed below. In addition, a brief description of the PK exposure in paediatric patients of study M13-833, in relation to adult PK exposures should be included in SmPC section 5.2.

## Fulfilled:

In view of the available data regarding efficacy in paediatric patients the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

- Section 5.1 of the SmPC should be updated with a brief description of the results of study M13833 (number of patients, the diagnoses included and efficacy data in terms of response rates).
- The current deferral information in section 5.1 should be updated to reflect finalisation of the study.
- In section 4.2 the information under the heading paediatric population should be updated by replacing the text 'No data are available' with the statement as per the SmPC guideline (Currently available data are described in section &lt;4.8&gt;&lt;5.1&gt;&lt;5.2&gt; but no recommendation on a posology can be made).
- Section 5.2 of the SmPC should be updated with a brief description of PK exposure in paediatric patients of study M13-833, in relation to adult PK exposures.
