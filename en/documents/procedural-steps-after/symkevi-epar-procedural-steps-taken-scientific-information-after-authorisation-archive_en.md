|                     | Update of the Product information to provide the final clinical study report (CSR) Part A of Study VX17- 661-116 (A Phase 3, Open-label, Rollover Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Long-term Treatment With Tezacaftor in Combination With Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Aged 6 Years and Older, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation). Consequently the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 and the package leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP is also updated. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance   |            |            |                        | heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation. A total of 130 subjects were enrolled. The treatment effects observed were generally consistent with those previously observed in CF subjects 6 through 11 years of age with F/F and F/RF genotypes. In particular, the improvements observed in the parent studies (Studies 113B and 115) in LCI2.5, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score and BMI z- score were maintained or improved slightly over 96 weeks of treatment, and BMI improved during the treatment period of up to 120 weeks. Overall, the safety profile was in line with the known safety profile of Symkevi and Kalydeco. These results are added in section 5.1 of Symkevi SmPC, and the study is mentioned in section 4.8 of Symkevi SmPC and section 5.1 of Kalydeco SmPC.For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics   |

No dose adjustment of OATP1B1 substrates is required when co-administered with Symkevi. Furthermore, the effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure is consistent with the effect of co- administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. Therefore, no dose-adjustment of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is considered necessary. No data are available for CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype |
