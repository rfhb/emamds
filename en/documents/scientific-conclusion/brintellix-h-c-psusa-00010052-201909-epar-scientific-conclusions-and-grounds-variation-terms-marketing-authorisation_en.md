## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vortioxetine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In  view  of  available  data  on false positive immunoassay results for urine methadone from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and false  positive  results  with  certain  urine  enzyme  immunoassays  for  methadone  is  possible.  The  PRAC concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  vortioxetine  should  be  amended accordingly.

In view of available data on insomnia from spontaneous reports including in 99 cases a close temporal relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge  and/or  re-challenge,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship between vortioxetine  and  insomnia  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on agitation and aggression from spontaneous reports including in 351 events within the SMQ hostility / aggression a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or rechallenge  and  in  view  of  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship between vortioxetine and aggression and agitation is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on glaucoma from clinical trials, spontaneous reports including in 5 cases a close  temporal  relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge  and/or  re-challenge  and  in  view  of  a  plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between vortioxetine and glaucoma is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing vortioxetine should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vortioxetine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vortioxetine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
