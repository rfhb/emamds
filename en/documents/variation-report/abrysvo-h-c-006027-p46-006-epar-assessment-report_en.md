Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 29 August 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study C3671016 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The CSR is dated 9 July 2024. A short critical expert overview was also provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development programme

The MAH conducted C3671016 in accordance with the approved PIP for Abrysvo (P/0058/2023). The PIP required that Abrysvo should be investigated for the prevention of RSV disease in 2 to &lt;5-year-old children and in 5 to &lt;18-year-old children with high-risk chronic medical conditions. Due to the nature of RSVpreF, being a non-live vaccine, it was not required that it should be evaluated in children aged &lt;2 years who are most likely to be RSV-naïve.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The approved formulation contains RSVpreF 120 µg per 0.5 mL dose. There is no adjuvant.

C3671016 was a Phase 1 study of the safety and immunogenicity of RSVpreF in children from 2 to &lt;18 years of age. In C3671016, all vaccinated participants received 1 dose of RSVpreF, either the adult dose (120 μ g) or half the adult dose (60 μ g). See further below on the dose groups.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for C3671016 dated 09 July 2024. The study was initiated (FPFV) 22 June 2023 and the LPLV was on 29 February 2024. The CSR contains a statement on GCP compliance.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study C3671016

## Description

This was a Phase 1, open label age descending dose-finding study to evaluate the and safety and immunogenicity of RSVpreF vaccine in children aged from 2-&lt;18 years. The study was conducted at 16 sites in the US, one of which closed early for financial reasons.

## Methods

- Study participants

Children were eligible as follows:

1. Age 2 to &lt;18 years of age at enrolment (Visit 1).
2. Healthy or considered by the investigator to be at high risk of RSV disease based on the presence of at least one of the following chronic medical conditions:

- [ ]  Cystic fibrosis

- [ ]  Medically treated asthma

-  Other chronic respiratory diseases and malformations of the lung

- [ ]  Down syndrome

- [ ]  Neuromuscular disease

- [ ]  Cerebral palsy

- [ ]  Hemodynamically significant or symptomatic congenital heart disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Children aged 2 to &lt;5 years of age were to be confirmed seropositive for RSV (see below). Children older than 5 years were assumed to be seropositive and were not tested before vaccination.

## Exclusions included the following:

1. Known or suspected immunodeficiency
2. Autoimmune disease (stable type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism permitted)
3. Other medical or psychiatric condition that may make the participant inappropriate for the study.
4. History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction to any component of the study intervention(s).
5. Bleeding diathesis
6. Seizure disorders or neurological complications following vaccination
7. Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational RSV vaccine
8. Receipt of monoclonal antibodies against RSV within 6 months
9. Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within 28 days
10. Chronic systemic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications or radiotherapy within 60 days

Vaccination was delayed in case of i) a febrile illness (body temperature ≥38°C) ; ii) other acute illness within 48 hours; iii)receipt of short-term (&lt;14 days) corticosteroids within 28 days; or iv) receipt of inactivated vaccine within 14 days or live vaccine within 28 days. Non-study vaccines were not given concomitantly or within 14-days of study intervention.

## · Treatments

| Age Stratum 1 (Year's)   | Number of Participants   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2 to                     | -20/-20                  |
| 5 to <18                 | -40/~40b                 |
| Total                    | -60-120                  |

Up to 2 dose levels of RSVpreF (120 μg and 60 μg) will be tested in participants.

Approximately 40 participants 5 to c18 years old will be enrolled,with-20 healthy participants and --20 participants with high-risk chronic medieal conditions receiving each dose level.

A single dose of RSVpreF 120 μ g (0.5 mL) was to be given to ~40 participants in the 5 to &lt;18-year age stratum first, equally divided between healthy children and those with high-risk chronic medical conditions.

Upon IRC approval, a dose of 60 μ g (0.25 mL) was to be given to 20 participants in the 2 to &lt;5-year age stratum. If the IRC was of the opinion that 60 μ g was safe, another 20 participants in the 2 to &lt;5year age stratum were to receive a 120 μ g dose. The IRC could also request that a single dose of RSVpreF 60 μ g be given to approximately 40 participants in the 5 to &lt;18-year age stratum.

IM injections were into the non-dominant deltoid muscle.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The participant or their parent(s)/legal guardian completed a reactogenicity e-diary after each vaccination. Information was collected for 7 days on local reactions, systemic events and temperature. At Visit 2 (a telephone contact on day 7) the content and completion of the diaries was discussed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blood samples (approximately 5 mL per sample if &lt;10 years and 10 mL if 10-17 years) were collected at both Visit 1 (day of vaccination) and Visit 3 (1 month post-vaccination) to determine neutralizing antibody using assays conducted at the sponsor's laboratories as documented in the initial MAA. RSV A -and RSV B -neutralizing antibody titres were reported as neutralizing titres (NTs).

## Assessor comment

For children aged 2-&lt;5 years, serostatus testing was conducted at Visit 1 or, if a delay in results was expected, at a screening visit that was followed by Visit 1. This testing was conducted by sites using a test kit developed and provided by Pfizer. In the discussion section of the Clinical Overview it is mentioned that this was a lateral flow assay. The assessor is unable to find information in the dossier on this kit and how the results might correlate with NTs.

As described and discussed further below, baseline RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were lower in the 2 to &lt;5-year group compared to the 5 to &lt;18-year group. In the lower age group there were 6/44 children (13.6%) with baseline NTs for both RSV A and RSV B at the RSV neutralization assay LOD despite being enrolled as seropositive based on the lateral flow test kit. See further below.

Additionally, participants provided blood samples for PBMCs (approximately 1 mL per year of age up to 10 mL maximum) at Visits 1 and 3 to evaluate cell-mediated immunity (CMI) elicited by the vaccine by measuring RSV F antigen -specific CD4+ T cells secreting IFN gamma and F antigen -specific CD4+ T cells secreting IL-4. A description of the methods used to determine CMI is provided.

## · Sample size

This was an open label study in which groups defined by age were enrolled to receive adult or half adult doses according to the IRC recommendations. As shown above, it was anticipated that between 60 and 120 children would be enrolled to support descriptive analyses.

## · Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was a non-randomised and fully open-label study as described above.

## · Statistical methods

There was no formal hypothesis testing. Immunogenicity results were reported in a descriptive manner. For purposes of descriptive analyses, the populations were defined as shown in the table.

The immunogenicity analyses were conducted for the evaluable immunogenicity population and for the MITT immunogenicity population.

- Outcomes and estimation

## Neutralizing antibody titres

## Before vaccination

GMTs were higher in the older age group (5-&lt;18 years) vs. the younger age group (2-&lt;5 years). Additionally, in the older subgroup, baseline GMTs were higher in the high-risk vs. healthy children.

## After vaccination (Visit 3 and month 1)

- The response to RSVpreF 120 μ g in the 5 to &lt;18-years group was higher than that in the 2 to &lt;5years group, especially for RSV-B.
- The response to RSVpreF 60 μ g in the 5 to &lt;18-years group was higher than that in the 2 to &lt;5-years group.
- In the 5 to &lt;18years group, the RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were 31199 and 29670, respectively, after 120 μg doses and 24630 and 32146, respectively, after 60 μ g doses. The RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMFRs were both 20.3 in the 120 μ g dose group compared to 19.0 and 23.5, respectively, in the
- 60 μ g dose group.
- In the 2- to &lt;5years group, the RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were 26146 and 16504, respectively, after 120 μg doses and 11004 and 10659, respectively, after 60 μ g doses. The RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMFRs were 42.8 and 39.8 in the 120 μ g dose group compared to 17.7 and 20.6, respectively, in the 60 μ g dose group.

Similar results were obtained for the mITT immunogenicity population

The s eroresponse rate was defined as achieving a ≥4 -fold rise from baseline if the baseline value was above the LLOQ. If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥4 times the LLOQ was considered a seroresponse.

At 1 month after vaccination in the 5- to &lt;18-years group, the proportions with seroresponse against both RSV A and RSV B were ≥93.2% and 93.9% in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g groups, respectively.

At 1 month after vaccination in the 2- to &lt;5-year age group, the proportions with seroresponse against both RSV A and RSV B were ≥91.7% and 85.0% in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, respectively.

with the exception of calculating the fold-rise when a before vaccination assay value was below the LOD but a corresponding after vaccination assay value was at the LOD or above,where the LOD was set for before vaccination.

Vaccination and 1 mouth after Vaccination were coumted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## At Visit 3 (I month after vaccination)

- The median IFN-gamma fold rise in the 5- to &lt;18-year age group was higher than that in the 2to &lt;5-year age group.
- At 1 month after vaccination in the 5- to &lt;18-year age group, the median fold rises in IFN-gamma were 4.8 (Q1, Q3: 2.0, 7.7) and 3.2 (Q1, Q3: 1.8, 8.4) in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, · respectively.
- At 1 month after vaccination in the 2- to &lt;5-year age group, the median fold rises in IFN-gamma were 2.1 (Q1, Q3: 1.2, 3.3) and 2.2 (Q1, Q3: 1.0, 3.4) in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups,
- respectively.
- No notable increases in IL-4 were observed in both age groups at either dose levels at 1 month after vaccination. IL-4 secretion was low, before and after vaccination.
- Similar results were obtained for the mITT immunogenicity population

## MAH's conclusions on immunogenicity (summarised from the Clinical Overview)

Based on NTs in the 5- to &lt;18-year-olds, the 120 μ g dose was selected, i.e. the same dose as in adults was considered appropriate for use from 5 years of age.

For the 2 to &lt;5-year-olds, the 120 μ g dose elicited significantly higher GMTs and GMFRs than the 60 μ g dose but immune responses in this age group were variable, suggesting that even 120 μ g may not be the appropriate dose.

In this regard, the MAH notes that baseline RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were lower in the 2 to &lt;5year group compared to the 5 to &lt;18-year group, including 6/44 children (13.6%) with baseline NTs for both RSV A and RSV B at the RSV neutralization assay LOD (despite being enrolled as seropositive based on the lateral flow test kit). Also, the seroresponse data showed that 3 in the 120 μ g group and 6 in the 60 μ g group showed no response after vaccination for either RSV A or RSV B. Therefore, although the 120 μ g dose elicited significantly higher GMTs and GMFRs in the 2 to &lt;5-year-olds compared to the 60 μ g dose in this age stratum, it is stated that further dose finding is warranted for this age group before proceeding to Phase 3.

## C3671016 - Results Safety

Patient exposure

As shown in Table 4 above, there were 127 children vaccinated, of which 44 were aged 2-&lt;5 years. In this age group, 24 received the adult dose and 20 the half adult dose.

In the older age group 5-&lt;18 years, 42 healthy children received RSVpreF (25 received the adult dose and 17 the half adult dose) while 41 children considered high risk received RSVpreF (21 received the adult dose and 18 the half adult dose).

Note: Local reactions were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 through Day 7 affer vaccination. Any local reactions reported as related or not related adverse events during the e-diary' collection period were included.

Note: Number above each bar denotes percentage of participants reporting the reaction with any severity.

In the 5 to &lt;18-year age group, 56.3% and 48.6% in the 120 μg and 60 μg dose groups, respectively, reported any local reactions within 7 days after vaccination. Most were mild or moderate with a single report of severe injection site pain after 120 μg which resolved in 4 days. The median onset of local reactions was 2-3 days after vaccination and lasted for 1-3 days.

In the 2 to &lt;5-year age group, 16.7% and 20.0% in the 120 μg and 60 μg groups, respectively, reported local reactions within 7 days after vaccination and none was severe. The median onset of local reactions was 1-3 days after vaccination and lasted for 1-3 days.

In the 5 to &lt;18-year age group, 52.1% and 60.0% in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, respectively, reported any systemic events within 7 days after vaccination. Most of the systemic events were mild or moderate with severe fever in two in the 60 μ g group. The median onset was at 1-6 days after vaccination and lasted for 1-2.5 days.

In the 2 to &lt;5-year age group, 33.3% and 45.0% of participants in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, respectively, reported any systemic events within 7 days after vaccination and none was severe. The median onset of systemic events was at 1-3 days after vaccination and lasted for 1-7 days.

## Other AEs reported up to 1 month post-vaccination

In the 5 to &lt;18 years group, 8.3% and 14.3% in the 120 μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, respectively, reported AEs. Two in the 60 μ g group were considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related (once case of axillary pain on the day of vaccination and one case of abdominal pain on day 2). One in the 120 μ g group reported a severe AE within 1 month (food allergy) and another in the 60 μ g group reported a severe AE after the 1-month follow-up visit (asthma) but neither was considered vaccinerelated (see SAEs below). The most common AEs were reported in the infections and infestations SOC (6.3% and 8.6% per group).

In the 2 to &lt;5 years group, 12.5% and 15.0% in the 120μ g and 60 μ g dose groups, respectively, reported AEs but none was considered by the investigator to be vaccine-related. The most common AEs were reported in under the infections and infestations SOC (8.3% and 15.0% per group).

- a. N = number of participants in the specified vaccine group. These values are the denominators for the percentage calculations.

b. = Nuumber of participants reporting at least 1 occurence of the specified adverse event. For *any event\", n = number of participants reporting at least 1 occurence of any adverse event.

C. Exact 2-sided confidence interval (CI), based on the Clopper and Pearson method.

d. An immediate AE is defined as any AE that occured within the first 30 minutes after administration of the investigational product.

## Other safety data

There were no deaths, NDMCs, AESIs or withdrawals due to AEs. There were two SAEs reported. One was the case of food (nut) allergy (see severe AEs above) in a 12 year-old who had a history of food allergy (tree nuts) and asthma. Onset was the day of vaccination with resolution on day 2 and the SAE was considered unrelated to vaccination. The other SAE was the case of asthma in a 6 year-old with a history of asthma and atopic dermatitis. Onset was on day 39 and this SAE was considered unrelated to vaccination.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Immunogenicity

At 1 month after vaccination of 5-&lt;18 year-olds, the RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were 31199 and 29670, respectively, in the 120 μg group and 24630 and 32146, respectively, in the 60 μg group, in the 5- to &lt;18-year age group. These values overlap with those described in healthy young adults in prior studies. The corresponding GMTs in the 2-&lt;5 year-olds were lower, at 26146 and 16504 in the 120 μg group and 11004 and 10659 in the 60 μg group.

The GMFRs reflected similar responses to both doses in older children but a greater response to the higher dose in the younger children. Similarly, the seroresponse rates were ~ 93-94% for both doses in older children but ~92% and 85% in the younger children.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median fold rises in IFN-gamma were 4.8 and 3.2 for the 120 μg and 60 μg dose groups, respectively, in the 5 to &lt;18-years age group whereas corresponding values were 2.1 and 2.2 in the 2 to &lt;5-years age group.

From these humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity data, noting that there were no additional safety concerns with the higher dose, the MAH has concluded that the 120 μg dose (i.e. the adult dose) may be given to children aged from 5-&lt;18 years. It is agreed that it would be reasonable to take forward this dose into further studies in this age range.

In the younger age range of 2-&lt;5 years, the humoral immunogenicity data suggested an advantage for the higher dose although the CMI data did not point to a difference. However, the MAH also noted that immune responses in this age group were more variable, suggesting that even 120 μ g may not be the appropriate dose for children who have had no or few RSV exposures before vaccination. This is supported by the observation that baseline RSV A and RSV B 50% NT GMTs were lower in the younger age group, in which 6/44 (13.6%) had baseline NTs for both RSV A and RSV B at the assay LOD. Also, 3 in the 120 μ g group and 6 in the 60 μ g group did not have a seroresponse for either RSV A or RSV B. Therefore, although the 120 μ g dose elicited significantly higher GMTs and GMFRs in the 2 to &lt;5-yearolds compared to the 60 μ g dose in this age stratum, The MAH concludes and the assessor agrees that further dose finding is warranted for this age group before proceeding to Phase 3.

In addition to dose selection considerations, the CMI data suggest that RSVpreF elicits a greater IFNγ (Th1) than IL-4 (Th2) response in both age groups and at both dose levels. This finding supports a conclusion that Abrysvo does not elicit a Th2-skewed response.

## Safety

There are no new issues raised by the safety data reported with either dose in either age sub-group.

## Conclusions

C2671016 was a first dose-finding study in paediatric subjects aged from 2 years, by which age the majority of children in the US (where the study was conducted) are usually RSV non-naïve. Although the children aged 2-&lt;5 years had to have a positive lateral flow test for RSV for study entry, not all were later found to have NA titres above the assay LOD for RSV-A or RSV-B.

Before proceeding to evaluate vaccine efficacy in children, it is agreed that further dose-finding is warranted in the younger age group. Meanwhile, it appears that with comparable immune responses to the higher and lower doses in children aged from 5 years, and supported by the CMI data, the adult dose is likely suitable for further testing in older children.

At this time, since no posology can be recommended in the SmPC and with no new safety information of importance, it is agreed with the MAH that no change to the SmPC is applicable at this time.
