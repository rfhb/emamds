## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for Ribavirin containing medicinal products, the scientific conclusions are as follows:

This PSUSA covers a yearly period with a Data lock point up to 24 July 2013.

The MAH submitted an evaluation of a signal on tongue hyperpigmentation, as requested in the previous PSUR of Rebetol. The number of cases of tongue  pigmentation reported to date with ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa 2b, even though some of them are insufficiently documented, is significant. In literature case reports, a positive dechallenge (with slowly resolution of symptoms) was generally reported after stopping antiviral therapy which is in favour of drug causality. This evaluation led to the conclusion that bitherapy with ribavirin and peginterferon can induce tongue pigmentation. PRAC therefore recommends the inclusion of this adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC of the oral formulations of ribavirin containing products. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly. Furthermore, it was noted that the following adverse drug reactions should be included across the product information of all the ribavirin containing products: tinnitus, hypotension, vasculitis and cerebrovascular ischaemia. As such PRAC recommended that these adverse drug reactions be added to the product information of those products that do not contain them. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisations On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Ribavirin containing medicinal products the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing the active substance Ribavirin is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
