## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Pfizer Ltd. submitted on 28 July 2011 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for XALKORI, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 December 2010.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

Xalkori is indicated for the treatment of previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, nonclinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision EMA/304142/2010 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Applicant's request for consideration

## Conditional Marketing Authorisation

The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14(7) of the above mentioned Regulation based on the following claims:

-  The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive.

Based on the data presented to date, crizotinib has promising evidence of clinical effectiveness as shown by ORR of 61.2% (95% CI: 51.7%, 70.1%). The preliminary estimate of mPFS was 10.0 months (95% CI: 8.2 months, 14.7 months; N=119), with a 1-year survival probability of 80.5%. The compelling crizotinib antitumor activity observed in Study A8081001 is supported by preliminary data from Study A8081005, an ongoing, multicenter, multinational, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study in patients with previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, with an ORR of 51.1%. The most common AEs were vision disorder and gastrointestinal events, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation, plus oedema and fatigue, all of which were generally mild to moderate in severity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of severe and serious AEs and laboratory abnormalities reported on crizotinib treatment was relatively low and generally manageable in this patient population. The clinical results obtained to date support the clinical benefit of single-agent crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC and overall, crizotinib has successfully addressed a high unmet medical need for a relatively rare NSCLC subtype. This favourable benefit/risk assessment was supported by an impressive rate of objective tumor responses that were rapid, durable, and clinically meaningful together with an AE and laboratory profile demonstrating that crizotinib was generally safe and well-tolerated.

-  It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. Randomized Phase 3 studies are ongoing in second-line NSCLC (Study A8081007) and in first-line nonsquamous NSCLC (Study A8081014). As of June 2011, Study A8081007, which will confirm the clinical benefit of crizotinib in previously treated patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC ,was 70% enrolled at the time of filing, and has since completed.
-  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled.

Although there are treatments available for NSCLC, there is very limited information on the efficacy of anticancer therapies in ALK-positive NSCLC. Data to date from 5 retrospective analyses of small cohorts have suggested that 1) ALK status is not predictive of improved standard chemotherapy outcomes, 2) ALK status is predictive of poor response to EGFR TKI therapy, and 3) ALK positivity is not a favourable prognostic factor in NSCLC (Shaw et al, 2009; Yang C-H et al, 2010; Koh et al, 2011; Kim et al, 2011; Shaw et al, 2011). Controlled or case-matched analyses have suggested that ALK positivity may represent a negative prognostic factor in NSCLC (Yang et al, 2011; Kim et al, 2011).

-  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

To date, there are no therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Molecularly targeted therapies such as crizotinib may offer patients an alternative therapeutic option with a positive benefit/risk profile. Crizotinib will not be administered to all patients with NSCLC. Patients are required to have ALK-positive NSCLC prior to receiving treatment with crizotinib, as confirmed by the use of a validated ALK assay, which will be available on the European market with the approval of crizotinib. This should avoid potential concern for misuse of the drug.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Disease

Lung cancer is the most common and lethal cancer worldwide. In 2008, the number of new lung cancer cases was estimated at 1.61 million, or 12.7% of all new cancers, and the number of deaths at 1.38 million, or 18.2% of the total cancer deaths. In Europe, estimates for the year 2008 were 391,000 cases and 342,000 deaths.

The majority of lung cancers (85%) are NSCLC. Most patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate for NSCLC in the US for the period 1999-2006 was 18%.

## Treatment

- Standard first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC of any histological subtype normally consists of platinum-based chemotherapy, which has been shown to have modest impact on efficacy outcomes, as ORRs in the range of 15% to 32% have been reported with a median PFS of 3-6 months and a median OS of 8-12 months (1-year OS of 34% to 44%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- After disease progression on first-line treatment, standard second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC consists of single-agent chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel), which has been associated with an ORR of approximately 9%, a median PFS of approximately 3 months, and a median OS of approximately 8 months (1-year OS of 30%).

- More recently, pemetrexed use has been restricted to patients with non-squamous histology as in the first-line treatment setting, with a reported ORR of 11.5%, median PFS of 3.1 months, and a median OS of 9.3 months (1-year OS of 41% assuming exponential distribution).

- When given to unselected patients with advanced NSCLC who have received 1 or 2 prior lines of chemotherapy, the EGFR TKI erlotinib has reported ORR of 8.9%, median PFS of 2.2 months, and median OS of 6.7 months (1-year OS of 31%).

- Recently, advances in the understanding and treatment of NSCLC have been made based on the identification of molecular alterations specific to tumor cells. Results of randomized Phase III studies analyzed retrospectively in selected advanced NSCLC patients harbouring activating EGFR mutations have recently shown that first-line treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib increases ORR and prolongs PFS compared to standard chemotherapy doublets (ORR 62%-83% vs. 31%-47%; median PFS range: 9-13 months vs. 5-6 months).

Advanced NSCLC remains a highly symptomatic and incurable disease, more effective and safer agents including those that target key oncogenic drivers of lung cancer, are still needed.

## About the product

The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:

XALKORI is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The drug product Xalkori contains the active substance crizotinib. The composition is described in section 6.1. of the SmPC. The two dosage strengths 200 mg and 250 mg are dose/weight proportional and the size/colour/printing of the capsules adequately differentiate between one another. Xalkori capsules will be packaged in HDPE bottles with child-resistant caps or PVC/Alu foil blisters.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The active substance, crizotinib is qualified as a new active substance, it is a white to pale yellow powder, non-hygroscopic. Crizotinib has one asymmetric center of R configuration. It is considered as a class IV compound as per the BCS classification (low permeability, low solubility substance). Only

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

one crystalline form has been found, this is the thermodynamically stable form A, no other crystalline form has been found.

The corresponding molecular formula is C21H22Cl2FN5O and the relative molecular mass 450.34.

<!-- image -->

The chemical name of the active substance is  ( R )-3-[1-(2,6-Dichloro-3-fluorophenyl)ethoxy]-5-[1(piperidin-4-yl)-1 H -pyrazol-4-yl]pyridin-2-amine

## Manufacture

The synthetic process of the active substance Crizotinib is using well characterised and commercially available starting materials. The batch size is based on input of starting materials.

The description of the manufacturing process is sufficiently detailed. The applicant has used risk assessments and design of experiments to identify the critical process parameters and adequate in process controls have been put in place. Proven acceptable ranges have been established and normal operating ranges for critical parameters have been provided.

The justification of the starting materials and their specification is based on their manufacturing process, the impurities that can be generated and their fate in the crizotinib synthesis. .

The analytical procedures are described and validated.

## Specification

The specification of the active substance contains tests with suitable limits for appearance (visual), identification (FTIR) spectrum, assay (HPLC), specified, unspecified and total Impurities (HPLC), residue on Ignition (Ph. Eur), Heavy Metals (Ph. Eur), Residual Solvent (GC), Particle Size (laser light diffraction) and palladium (ICP-MS or ICP-OES). The palladium limit in the drug substance specification assures patient safety and is well within the safety limit of EMA/CHMP/SWP/4666/2000 Option 2a. However based on the available batch data, the CHMP recommends to review and possibly restrict the palladium limit, when more experience is gained on the commercial process.

Based on the antimicrobial properties of the drug substance and crizotinib formulated capsules, microbial enumeration testing will not be performed for routine batch release.  These batches have been used for toxicology studies, for manufacture of drug product for clinical studies and for stability studies. In all cases that batch analysis results met the predefined specifications for the active substance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

Stability studies were performed using samples from four batches manufactured according to the commercial route and packaged in the commercial packaging. Stability results have been provided for up to 12 months at 25°C/60%RH and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. They show a good stability for the active substance.

The parameters tested were the same as those included in the release specification. Stress studies were performed at high temperatures and no significant degradation was observed after 14 days stored at 100°C. Minor degradation was observed when crizotinib was exposed to strongly acidic, strongly basic, intense light and oxidative conditions.

## 2.2.3. The stability results indicate that the drug substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed retest period. Finished medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical development

The aim of the development was to obtain an immediate release hard gelatin capsule to deliver 200 mg and 250 mg crizotinib as a single unit dose.

The initial dosage form used during early Phase 1 clinical studies was a powder in capsule (PIC), consisting of crizotinib in a hard gelatin capsule shell. Then a tablet dosage form was developed containing 50 mg and 100 mg crizotinib (drug substance loading of 12.5%), to meet increased clinical demand for Phase 3 clinical studies. In vitro dissolution profiles for both the clinical tablet and PIC dosage forms demonstrated rapid release within 30 minutes in 0.1N HCl. In vivo performance was subsequently shown to be bioequivalent between the clinical tablet and PIC. However for manufacturability reasons, the crizotinib capsule form was developed and it was designed to be qualitatively similar to the clinical tablet formulation. The pharmaceutical development was based on the Quality by Design concept. No design space has been claimed by the applicant in the manufacturing process of the finished product.

Multivariate experimental design studies were executed to evaluate and determine criticality of process parameters and their effect on manufacturing and performance of the final formulated capsule

The excipients used in the formulation comply with compendial requirements. Appropriate in-house specifications are provided for the capsule shells.

The primary packaging proposed is stated in the SmPC and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the product.

## Adventitious agents

Valid TSE CEP certificates have been provided for the gelatin of capsules.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process is considered as standard, and adequate information has been provided. The main critical steps have been studied in detail andthe critical process parameters (CPPs) have been described adequately. . The target normal operating ranges and proven for these CPPs are considered acceptable. A satisfactory validation protocol was filed.

All batches manufactured using the process ranges described have produced drug product of acceptable quality and performance showing that this product can be manufactured reproducibly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## Product specification

The drug product specifications have been developed in line with ICH guidelines Q3B (R2) and Q6A. They are based on the data ranges from three 150 mg, one 200 mg, and three 250 mg batches manufactured by the commercial manufacturing process. Batch analysis data confirm the consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control.

The specification include appropriate tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (UV),uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur. 2.9.40).

## Stability of the product

Crizotinib capsules were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are the same as those used for release. Water content is monitored on stability using Ph. Eur. 2.5.12, method A. The microbial quality test is monitored on stability using Ph. Eur. 2.6.12. Results are provided for up to 12 months at 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/75%RH and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH in both packaging systems.

Samples stored in PVC/aluminium foil blisters showed some caking of the capsule contents at the 6 month time point at 30°C/75%RH and from the 2 month time point onwards at 40°C/75%RH. Brittleness of the capsule shells was also seen at the 6 month time point at 40°C/75%RH. These observations were not associated with changes in degradation product levels, assay or dissolution results. Also, they were not been observed through 9 months at the 25°C/60%RH or 30°C/75%RH storage conditions.

For samples stored in PVC/aluminium foil blisters, the water content increased by about 0.5% at 25°C/60%RH and by about 1.5% at 30°C/75%RH and 40°C/75%RH through 6 months. The water content did not increase at the 9 month time point. This increased water content has not led to any changes in degradation product levels, assay or dissolution results.

A photostability study in ICH conditions was also run. Besides water uptake and changes in appearance of capsules that did not affect assay, degradation products or dissolution, no trends have been evidenced. The capsules are also stable to light. Also in use stability of capsules packed in the HDPE bottle has been demonstrated.  Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life with no special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are considered acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

The quality of Xalkori is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The CHMP recommended that these issues are addressed in the future development of the product (see section 2.2.6)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product (see section 2.2.6 below).

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

- The CHMP recommends the applicant to review and tighten, if possible, the palladium limit when more data from testing of the active substance manufactured at commercial scale is available.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The goal of the nonclinical studies was to support the registration of crizotinib for the proposed indication.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The applicant submitted 9 in vitro and 14 in vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies.

Crizotinib demonstrated in  vitro inhibition  of  tyrosine  kinase  in  biochemical  enzymatic assays and in cell-based assays against EML4-ALK, NPM-ALK, c-Met/HGFR and RON enzyme in several human cell lines. Crizotinib major metabolites were also tested and crizotinib lactam metabolites showed relevant inhibitory  activity  in  the  nanomolar  range,  thus  close  to  crizotinib  potency.  When  tested  to  its selectivity  for  different  kinases,  crizotinib  was  relatively  specific  to  c-Met/HGFR  and  ALK  fusion proteins.

Crizotinib  inhibited  cell  proliferation,  migration,  invasion  and  motility  in  tumour  or  endothelial  cells expressing EML4-ALK, NPM-ALK or c-Met/HGFR. These data suggest that crizotinib has an effect on both tumour cell growth and survival and on angiogenesis.

In vivo , Crizotinib demonstrated a dose-dependent cytoreductive antitumour activity in several tumour models expressing EML4-ALK, NPM-ALK or c-Met/HGFR. PK/PD modelling indicated that the extent and duration of the inhibition of target kinase phosphorylation is directly related to the level of anti-tumour efficacy.  Near  complete  inhibition  of  ALK  or  c-Met/HGFR  activity  for  the  duration  of  treatment  is necessary to get the maximal anti-tumour efficacy (tumour regression). There is a correlation between inhibition of ALK or c-Met/HGFR phosphorylation and modulation of key signalling pathways involved in cancer  cell  survival,  growth,  proliferation  and  apoptosis.  Crizotinib  also  exhibited  an  antiangiogenic effect when administered for a long time. This effect was not seen in every tumour type.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Crizotinib  demonstrated  the  ability  to  bind  with  a  series  of  off-target  receptor  or  channel  such  as adrenergic,  muscarinic,  nicotinic  or  serotonin  receptors,  calcium  or  sodium  channels,  dopamine  or serotonin transporters, for some of them at concentrations close to therapeutic concentrations. It was a functional agonist of 5-HT4e and 5-HT7 serotonin receptors and an antagonist of the rat adrenergic α 1A receptor. It was an inhibitor of dopamine and 5-HT uptake.

It  also  inhibited  the  activity  of  PDE4  and  p55fyn  kinase.  This  large  binding  ability  can  induce undesirable  effects.  No  such  data  is  available  for  the  major  metabolite,  crizotinib  lactam  that  was demonstrated to be active on the target kinases.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Crizotinib  demonstrated adverse cardiac effects in safety pharmacology studies. In  vitro ,  it  inhibited hERG, sodium and calcium currents. The antagonist effect on calcium channel was confirmed in the isolated rat aorta model and in a Purkinje fiber assay. In vivo , crizotinib induced a decrease in heart rate and an increase in PR-interval, QRS and QT-interval.

The in vivo study has been conducted in anesthetised animals. This is not the appropriate method to detect  predictive  haemodynamic  and  ECG  effects  to  humans  because  anaesthesia  prevents  from  a correct interpretation of cardiac effects.

QTc prolongation has been observed in humans following crizotinib administration and a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Regarding  neurofunctional  effects,  decreased  locomotor  activity  has  been  observed.  It  is  correlated with a transitory decrease in respiratory rates.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

## Crizotinib and cytochromes

In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes demonstrated that crizotinib was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4, which also mediated the formation of crizotinib lactam and the O -desalkyl metabolites. In vitro data indicated that the most pronounced inhibitory potential of crizotinib was observed with respect to CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism. Crizotinib showed a time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A enzymes in human liver microsomes.

Clinically  relevant  interactions  with  substrates  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  or CYP2D6 are unlikely to occur considering the low potential of crizotinib to inhibit these enzymes and at crizotinib plasma concentrations achieved following therapeutic doses.

Crizotinib  caused  marked  induction  of  CYP3A4  based  on  mRNA  levels  in  human  cryopreserved hepatocytes. However, a corresponding induction of CYP3A4 enzyme activity was not observed. This finding is likely due to the crizotinib-mediated time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Crizotinib did not induce  CYP1A2.  Therefore,  crizotinib  would  not  be  expected  to  reduce  plasma  concentrations  of coadministered CYP1A2 substrates in vivo .

Results from an induction study show an increase ARNm level at concentrations of crizotinib up to 7 µM, but this effect is limited by the time-dependent inhibition of crizotinib on CYP3A4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, although the CYP3A4 induction is compensated by the time-dependent inhibition of crizotinib, the inducing potency of crizotinib on other enzymes or transporters PXR-dependent is likely even if the magnitude of induction is lesser than those observed with CYP3A4.

## Crizotinib and protein transporters

In vitro experiments showed a saturable involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) in a transfected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. Crizotinib was not found to be a substrate for the breast cancer  resistance  protein  gene  (BCRP,  ABCG2)  efflux  transporter. In  vitro studies  showed  that crizotinib inhibited P-gp.

Furthermore, as regards the inducing effect of crizotinib on transporters, the Applicant provided a clear discussion  on  the  inducing  effect  of  crizotinib  on  PXR-regulated  drug  transporters  with  particular relevance of P-gp mediated interactions.

Even if multidrug resistance-associated proteins [MRP]2, MRP3, organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP]1B1 could be considered potential target of inducing effect of crizotinib, the clinical relevance of interaction involving such mechanism is unlikely.

In  vitro ,  the  uptake  of  crizotinib  into  human  hepatocytes  is  not  OATP-dependent  and  occurred  via passive diffusion.

Although  crizotinib  was  determined  to  be  a  weak  inhibitor  of  (OATP)  1B1  and  1B3 in  vitro ,  clinical interactions with substrates of these hepatic uptake transporters are unlikely at crizotinib therapeutic concentrations.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

In vitro studies demonstrated that crizotinib is a substrate for P-gp but not for BCRP and that it enters hepatocytes by passive diffusion.

Pharmacokinetics  studies  after  a  single  administration  were  conducted  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys. Plasma  clearance  was  moderate  in  every  tested  species  (9  to  47  mL/min/kg).    The  volume  of distribution was large (2.9 to 24 L/kg in rats, 11 to 13 L/kg in dogs and 13 L/kg in monkeys, indicating an extensive distribution into body tissues. The bioavailability was variable, ranging from 38 to 66% for the same dose in dogs and from 26 to 63% in rats depending on the dose.

The half-life after oral administration ranged from 5.8 to 13 hours in rats, 12 to 13 hours in dogs and 14 hours in monkeys. Repeat dose studies demonstrated that accumulation of crizotinib after repeat administration in rats (after a period longer than 1 month), dogs and monkeys.

There was no sex-related difference in dogs and monkeys while higher exposure in male rats than in females was observed.

## Distribution

In vivo , crizotinib was widely distributed with a Cmax occurring between 4 to 8 hours. Concentration in tissues was generally higher than blood concentration. Crizotinib does not seem to distribute across the blood-brain barrier. It demonstrated a high affinity for pigmented tissues (eyes, skin) where the elimination  was  slow  due  to  a  reversible  binding  to  melanin.  Crizotinib-derived  radioactivity  was retained in several other tissues (including pituitary gland and testis) and that elimination was not yet complete by 168 hours postdose.

In  vitro ,  Crizotinib  was  highly  bound  to  protein.  Mean  unbound  fractions  of  crizotinib  were  0.036, 0.057,  0.070,  0.043,  0.072,  and  0.093  for  the  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog,  monkey,  and  human,

Xalkori

CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively. The extent of protein binding was similar for crizotinib lactam and its diastereoisomers. In mice, rats, dogs, and humans, crizotinib did not preferentially distribute into red blood cells.

## Metabolism

In  vivo ,  metabolism  was  studied  in  rats,  dogs  and  human.  Unchanged  crizotinib  was  the  main component in plasma and faeces in rats, dogs and humans.

The major metabolic pathway was oxidation of the piperidine ring to form critonib lactam M10 (in rats, and humans and to a lesser extent, dogs) and crizotinib nitrone M21 (in rats and dogs).

In rats, direct sulphate conjugation to form M19 was a major pathway in females but not in males, this could explain a lower exposure to crizotinib in females.

Even if M10 was not as abundant is rat plasma as in human plasma, a comparison of exposure to M10 indicated that rats are equally or more exposed than humans.

Some human metabolites were not detected in animal in vivo studies. The Applicant has clarified that M10 was the only active metabolite in human.

CYP3A enzymes are the main enzymes involved in crizotinib metabolism. The major metabolite M10 is formed in a 2-step reaction. An oxidation catalysed by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, 2C19 and 2D6 leading to an imine intermediate is followed by an AO- or CYP-catalysed oxidation resulting in M10. Dealkylation of crizotinib (leading to M4) or of M10 (leading to M2) is also catalysed by CYP3A4.

The involvement of CYP450 in crizotinib metabolism has been confirmed in humans.

## Excretion

The major route of excretion was the faeces in rats and dogs (after 168h: ~99% in non-canulated rats and 62% and 85% in male and female dogs, respectively). In canulated rats, bile excretion amounted to 38% and 62% after 48h in males and females, respectively. Urinary excretion was minor (generally below 3%).

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

Crizotinib  underwent  a  non  clinical  testing  compliant  with  the  guideline  ICH  S9  on  non  clinical  for anticancer pharmaceuticals.

## Single dose toxicity

No single dose studies were conducted.

Crizotinib was tested in mice and monkeys for 1 month and in rats and dogs for up to 3 months.

The main target organs were:

- the hematopoietic system : increased white blood count (WBC), monocytes and neutrophils in rats and in dogs, bone marrow hypocellularity or necrosis in rats and monkey and presence of immature neutrophils  in  monkeys  indicating  effects  on  WBC  proliferation,  decreased  red  blood  count  (RBC) parameters including reticulocytes suggesting a suppression of erythroid production in bone marrow.

-  the  cardiovascular  system:  mixed  ion  channel  blocker,  decreased  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure, increased LVEDP, QRS and PR intervals, and decreased myocardial contractility

- the liver: increased liver weight in mice, decreased liver weight in rats, increased ALAT and ASAT in mice,  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys,  increased  APL  and  GGT  in  rats  and  dogs  rarely  correlated  with microscopic  findings.  The  only  histological  finding  was  a  minimal  hepatocyte  necrosis  in  rats  given 2000 mg/kg for 2 days.

- the gastrointestinal system : diarrhea in rats, dogs and monkeys, emesis, congestion and dilatation of intestines in dogs.- the reproductive organs: ovaries single cell necrosis in the rat 7-day study and spermatocyte degeneration and decreased epipidymis weight in the 1-month rat study.

Phospholipodosis observed in rats and monkeys (vacuolated lymphocytes and macrophages in several organs in rats and monkeys and vacualoation in cortical tubules in rats) can be seen with amphiphilic molecules such as crizotinib.

In an electroretinography study, oral administration of crizotinib at 100 mg/kg/day to Long-Evans rats for 15 or 29 days resulted in significant reductions in the rate of retinal dark adaptation.

Crizotinib  was  tested  in  a  conventional  genotoxicity  battery.  It  was  negative  in  the  Ames  test, suggesting  that  it  was  not  mutagenic.  It  was  positive  in  the  chromosome  aberration  test  where  it induced polyploidy. In an in vitro micronucleus test, crizotinib induced micronuclei with the presence of kinetochore staining suggesting an aneugenic potential. In the in vivo micronucleus test, crizotinib was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

positive at 250 mg/kg and higher but had no effect at 100 mg/kg (representing 3.5-fold human AUC or 2-fold human Cmax).

## Carcinogenicity

No  studies  were  performed.  This  is  acceptable  according  to  the  guideline  ICH  S9  on  Non  Clinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals.

## Reproduction toxicity

No fertility  studies  were  performed.  According  to  ICH  S9,  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development studies are not warranted for marketing authorisation. For crizotinib, effects on reproductive organs were seen in repeat-dose toxicity indicating a potential impairment of male and female fertility.

In rats, decreased foetal body weight was observed at 200 mg/kg in the presence of maternotoxicity and  increased  postimplantation  loss  at  50  mg/kg  in  the  absence  of  maternotoxicity.  In  rabbits, crizotinib had no effect on dams but a decrease in body weight was recorded in foetus at 60 mg/kg. Crizotinib did not demonstrate teratogenic effects in both species.

No  pre-  and  postnatal  studies  were  performed.  According  to  ICH  S9,  the  absence  of  study  is acceptable.

The  safety  margins  were  around  1  based  on  phospholipidosis  and  effects  on  bone  marrow  in  rats, effects on haematological parameters, clinical chemistry and bone marrow in dogs and decreased fetal body weight in the absence of maternotoxicity in rabbits.

## Other toxicity studies

## Impurities

Four impurities are specified above the level of qualification in the drug substance.

The adverse effects in the impurity qualification study were consistent with those observed in the other repeat-dose toxicity studies.

## Phototoxicity

Crizotinib showed affinity with eyes and skin and absorbs light in the 290-700 nm range. According to the in vitro 3T3 NRU assay, crizotinib is a probable phototoxicant (see SmPC section 5.3). This is also addressed in the RMP as a potential risk.

## Electroretinography (ERG)

In an electroretinography study, oral administration of crizotinib at 100 mg/kg/day to Long-Evans rats for 15 or 29 days resulted in significant reductions in the rate of retinal dark adaptation.

Crizotinib  log  D  does  not  exceed  4.5.  Therefore,  no  PBT  screening  is  required.  Crizotinib  is  not expected to bio-accumulate in the environment

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed:

To  perform  all  studies  necessary  to  complete  the  Phase  II  of  the  ERA  in  compliance  with  the  EMA guidelines  and  agreed  to  submit  an  updated  environmental  risk  assessment  with  the  studies recommended during the Q1 2013.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No solid data are available at present showing that the anticancer activity of crizotinib in preclinical models of NSCLC is substantially dependent on the inhibition of ALK and its variants. Thus, no sound conclusion on the main molecular mechanism underlying crizotinib anticancer activity in NSCLC may be drawn from pre-clinical studies.

Crizotinib was also active against a wide range of enzymes and transporters at concentrations close to therapeutic concentrations, possibly leading to undesirable effects.

Regarding safety pharmacology, non-clinical evaluation for the potential delay of ventricular repolarisation was conducted according to guideline ICH S7B, however the effect on IKr was not tested following GLP as recommended by the guideline but this study was proven to have been performed with the same rigor of quality addressed by GLP.

Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys in order to investigate absorption, plasma kinetics, distribution, metabolism and excretion of crizotinib. Most of these studies were conducted using the oral route, some of them using the IV route.

Pharmacokinetic  studies  after  a  single  administration  were  conducted  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys. Plasma  clearance  was  moderate  in  every  tested  species.  The  volume  of  distribution  was  large indicating  an  extensive  distribution  into  body  tissues.  The  bioavailability  was  variable.  The  half-life after oral administration ranged from 5.8 to 13 hours in rats, 12 to 13 hours in dogs and 14 hours in monkeys.

Due to the large volume of distribution and the evidence that apparent half-life of crizotinib in organs or tissues significantly exceeds the apparent half-life of the elimination phase in plasma, repeated dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tissue  distribution  studies  should  have  been  performed  according  to  the  ICH  topic  S3B  but  the Applicant provided convincing justification for not performing such studies.

According  to  the  Applicant,  the  long-lived  radioactivity  in  tissues  and  human  plasma  and  the incomplete extraction recovery of total radioactivity from human plasma suggest the potential for some degree of binding of crizotinib-derived radioactivity to plasma proteins and/or tissue macromolecules. The  Applicant  did  not  discuss  the  incomplete  extraction  recovery  of  total  radioactivity  from  human plasma considering it potentially due to the low levels of radioactivity in plasma in the ADME study and to technical limitations. The justification was considered acceptable, with monitoring of the potential clinical effects, which can be derived from the product accumulation after repeated administration.

Repeat  dose  studies  demonstrated  accumulation  of  crizotinib  after  repeated  administration  in  rats (after a period longer than 1 month), dogs and monkeys.

## Regarding, drug-drug interactions

Although  the  CYP3A4  induction  is  compensated  by  the  time-dependent  inhibition  of  crizotinib,  the inducing potency of crizotinib on other enzymes or transporters PXR-dependent is likely even though the magnitude of induction is lesser than those observed with CYP3A4.

## Crizotinib and UGTs (UDP-glucuronyl transferase)

The  effect  of  crizotinib  on  glucuronidation  enzymes  was  not  assessed.  Even  though  the  phase  II enzymes such as UGT are not mainly involved in crizotinib metabolism, its inhibitory effect of the latter as well as its inducing effect should be investigated. During the procedure, the Applicant proposed an interesting simulation giving a range of at risk concentrations however without the calculation of the Ki value  of  crizotinib  for  UGTs,  it  is  difficult  to  know  whether  crizotinib  is  or  not  an  UGT  inhibitor  at therapeutic concentrations. Of note, a drug can be an UGT inhibitor whilst it is not metabolised by this enzyme.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  crizotinib  and  substrates  of  UGTs,  such  as paracetamol, morphine, or irinotecan, are combined, see section 4.5 of the SmPC.

The effect of crizotinib as a substrate and inhibitor of BSEP and renal secretory transporters like OCT2 and  OATs,  initially  missing,  has  been  discussed  by  the  Applicant  during  the  procedure.  On  renal transporters,  the  Applicant  did  not  estimate  the  Ki  or  IC50  value  of  crizotinib  and  chose  to  make deduction  based  on  clinical  data.  It  is  agreed  that  clinically  relevant  interactions  involving  renal transporters were rare but the applicant is recommended to further investigate this potential effect.

On BSEP, the high metabolism of crizotinib by CYP3A4, makes the biliary secretion a minor elimination pathway, therefore an in  vitro study  assessing  the  effect  of  crizotinib  as  a  substrate  of  BSEP  is  not warranted. Regarding the potential for crizotinib to be a BSEP inhibitor, it was recommended to the applicant to conduct an in vitro study assessing the inhibitory potency of crizotinib on BSEP.

Crizotinib  underwent  a  non  clinical  testing  compliant  with  the  guideline  ICH  S9  on  non  clinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals.

The  main  target  organs  were  related  to  the  gastrointestinal  (emesis,  fecal  changes,  congestion), hematopoietic  (bone  marrow  hypocellularity),  cardiovascular  (mixed  ion  channel  blocker,  decreased heart  rate  and  blood  pressure,  increased  LVEDP,  QRS  and  PR  intervals,  and  decreased  myocardial contractility), or reproductive (testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration, single-cell necrosis of ovarian  follicles)  systems.  The  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Levels  (NOAEL)  for  these  findings  were either subtherapeutic or up to 5-fold human clinical exposure based on AUC. Other findings included an effect on the liver (elevation of liver transaminases)  and  retinal function, and  potential for phospholipidosis in multiple organs without correlative toxicities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Crizotinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Crizotinib was aneugenic in an in vitro micronucleus assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. Small increases of structural chromosomal aberrations at cytotoxic  concentrations  were  seen  in  human  lymphocytes.  The  NOAEL  for  aneugenicity  was approximately 4-fold human clinical exposure based on AUC.

Carcinogenicity studies with crizotinib have not been performed.

No specific studies with crizotinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility; however, crizotinib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in humans based on findings in repeat-dose toxicity  studies  in  the  rat.  Findings  observed  in  the  male reproductive tract included testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration in rats given ≥ 50 mg/kg/day  for  28  days  (approximately  2-fold  human  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC).  Findings observed in the female reproductive tract included single-cell necrosis of ovarian follicles of a rat given 500 mg/kg/day for 3 days.

Crizotinib  was  not  shown  to  be  teratogenic  in  pregnant  rats  or  rabbits.  Postimplantation  loss  was increased at doses ≥ 50  mg/kg/day (approximately 0.8 times the AUC at the recommended human dose) in rats, and reduced foetal body weights were considered adverse effects in the rat and rabbit at 200 and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 2-fold human clinical exposure based on AUC).

Decreased bone formation in growing long bones was observed in immature rats at 150 mg/kg/day following  once  daily  dosing  for  28  days  (approximately  7  times  human  clinical  exposure  based  on AUC). Other toxicities of potential concern to paediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals.

The  results  of  an in  vitro phototoxicity  study  demonstrated  that  crizotinib  may  have  phototoxic potential.

Four impurities are specified above 0.15%, the level of qualification in the drug substance. The adverse effects in the impurity qualification study were consistent with those observed in the other repeat-dose toxicity studies. No specific genotoxicity studies were conducted to qualify these impurities. However, the Applicant provided QSAR analysis demonstrating that these impurities do not carry supplementary alerts compared to crizotinib.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

After  a  single-dose  of  250  mg  given  orally,  crizotinib  is  slowly  absorbed  at  a  median  t max of  4  to  6 hours, with mean Cmax and AUCinf reaching 100-130 ng/mL and 2100 - 2900 ng*hr/mL, respectively

The absolute bioavailability of a single oral 250 mg crizotinib dose administered in the fasted state as the IR tablets relative to a 50 mg IV crizotinib dose administered over 2 hours was assessed in healthy adult  volunteers  in  Study  1010.  It  shows  that  crizotinib  is  slowly  absorbed  in  fasting  subjects  with median tmax of 5.0 h. This seems compatible with in vitro findings allowing to consider crizotininib as a class 4 compound (low solubility, low permeability) under the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. The absolute bioavailability  is  moderate,  43  %  on  average  (90%  CI:  39.68%-47.56%).  Taking  into account this value of 43%, linear kinetics can be proposed between 50 mg IV and 250 mg oral, singledose,  based  on  extent  of  systemic  exposure.  The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  is  very  large, suggesting  high  tissue  penetration.  Based  on  the  results  observed  with  the  lactam  metabolite, metabolite ratios indicate extensive pre-systemic biotransformation of crizotinib.

Bioequivalence  between  the  different  formulations  used  was  demonstrated  according  to  standard procedures for bioequivalence assessment. Results were very consistent between studies and following a single oral administration of 250 mg crizotinib to healthy volunteers at fasting state, Cmax occurred 5 to 6 h post dosing, reaching around 120 ng/mL while the extent of systemic exposure was about 2800 hxng/mL.  .  Full bioequivalence can be acknowledged between the formulated capsule to be marketed and previous oral formulations such as simple powder in capsule or immediate release tablet.  This allows the bridging of data obtained in the whole clinical program.

Regarding  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  lactam  metabolite  PF-06260182,  no  difference  exists between the three oral formulations. On average, Cmax is 4-fold less and AUC is 6 to 7-fold less than the corresponding values measured for unchanged crizotinib.

Crizotinib PK parameters demonstrated moderate variability (CV: 36-45% for Cmax and AUC) in both healthy subjects and patients with advanced solid tumours:  :  in the 1010 study, CV values in AUCinf

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  Cmax  range  from  28%  to  34%  for  oral  administration  compared  to  18%  to  19%  following  IV infusion. In the pivotal study, the CV is 36-38% for AUC τ and 38-44% for Cmax, respectively.

On average, when crizotinib is given with high-fat meal, there is approximately 14% decrease in Cmax and in AUC, with a moderate delay in Tmax. Since the point estimate is the same in healthy subjects and  in  cancer  patients,  it  can  be  concluded  that  crizotinib  can  be  administered  irrespective  of  food intake, even if the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval in Study A8081001, is 69.23% for Cmax and 65.11% for AUC, respectively.  This finding provided the basis for the removal of food restrictions with regards to crizotinib dosing.

## Distribution

Crizotinib is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt;90% in humans: 91% for crizotinib and 94-95 % for the main metabolite).. A relatively equal distribution into the blood cell and plasma compartments is shown.  Crizotinib  is  very  largely  distributed  in  the  body  with  apparent  volume  of  distribution  V/F around 5000 L (Vss being measured at 1772 L following a single 50 mg IV dose) indicating extensive distribution into tissues from the plasma.

The available data on systemic exposure to crizotinib and active metabolites suggested that steadystate was achieved within 15 days of continuous administration of crizotinib 250 mg twice daily. The steady state plasma concentrations exceeded the target efficacious concentrations (23 nM free drug or 111 ng/mL total drug) of ALK inhibition predicated from preclinical tumour models.

## Elimination

Crizotinib  undergoes  extensive  hepatic  metabolism,  likely  pre-systematically  by  CYP3A,  leading  to numerous metabolites amongst which the lactam compound PF-06260182 could be active. Crizotinib is primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A4/5.  A  216%  increase  and  an  81.8%  decrease  in  crizotinib  plasma exposure  was  noted  in  clinical  drug-drug  interaction  studies  conducted  with  ketoconazole  (strong CYP3A inhibitor) and rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer), respectively.

The primary metabolic pathways in humans were oxidation of the piperidine ring to crizotinib lactam and O-dealkylation, with subsequent Phase 2 conjugation of O-dealkylated metabolites.

The lactam metabolite of crizotinib (PF-06260182, M10) is the most abundant metabolite in circulation. Trough concentrations of the metabolite PF-06260182 are 50% lower in Study 1005 compared with Study 1001. The applicant plans to conduct a clinical PK/PD study with the main lactam metabolite (PF06260182) which exhibits inhibitory activity in vitro against ALK and c-Met/HGFR.

Some  other  metabolites  have  been  detected  in  man  (less  than  10%)  in  addition  to  the  lactam metabolite, and elimination is mostly renal.

Following single doses of crizotinib, the apparent plasma terminal half life of crizotinib was 42 hours in patients.

Following the administration of a single 14C-radiolabeled crizotinib 250 mg dose, 63% and 22% of the drug-related radioactivity was  recovered  in the faeces and  urine, respectively.  Non-metabolic elimination such as biliary excretion cannot be excluded. Unchanged crizotinib represented approximately 53% and 2.3% of the administered dose in feces and urine, respectively.

Renal excretion of unchanged crizotinib is a minor route of elimination; however, the kidney appears to play  an  important  role  in  the  elimination  of  metabolites.  It  is  agreed  that  no  dose  adjustment  is required in patients with mild and moderate renal insufficiencies. No data are available in patients with severe and end-stage renal impairment. The applicant will perform such investigation following a step-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

wise approach as reflected in the RMP (see section 2.7). First a single dose is planned in patients with severe  renal  impairment.  The  need  for  further  investigations  (steady-state  study  or  SIM-CYP simulation) will be decided based on the findings of the single dose study.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Crizotinib demonstrated somewhat non-linear pharmacokinetics in humans.

- Single-dose PK of crizotinib has been evaluated in healthy subjects (Studies 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1015,  and  1016)  and  in  patients  with  advanced  tumours  (Study  1001).    After  a  single  250  mg crizotinib  dose  in  patients,  peak  crizotinib  plasma  concentrations  (C max )  were  achieved  at  a  median Tmax of 4.0 hours. Following attainment of Cmax, plasma crizotinib concentrations declined in a multiexponential manner with a long mean terminal half life of 42 hours.

Single-dose crizotinib systemic exposures in cancer patients were similar to those observed in healthy subjects, indicating that there are no inherent differences in PK between healthy subjects and cancer patients. Systemic exposure of crizotinib increases with dose in a less-than-proportional manner after single dose (over the range 50-300 mg QD).

-  Greater than dose proportional increases in crizotinib AUC and Cmax were observed over the 50 to 100 mg QD dose range and over the 200-300 mg BID in patients.  Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of crizotinib can therefore not be precisely predicted by single-dose. However, no significant changes in steady-state  trough  concentrations  following  250  mg  BID  have  been  observed  during  repeated treatment  cycles.  In  order  to  better  elucidate  the  systemic  exposure  to  crizotinib  and  active metabolites,  the  applicant  was  recommended  to  investigate  further  this  aspect  and  will  submit  the outcome as soon as it becomes available.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Renal excretion of unchanged crizotinib is a minor route of elimination; however, the kidney appears to play  an  important  role  in  the  elimination  of  metabolites.  It  is  agreed  that  no  dose  adjustment  is required  in  patients  with  mild  (CLcr  60  to  90 mL/min)  and  moderate  (CLcr  30  to  60 mL/min)  renal insufficiencies.  The  steady-state  trough  concentrations  in  these  two  groups  were  similar  to  those  in patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than 90 mL/min) in studies 1001 and 1005. There is no specific study in renal impairment and serum creatinine &gt; 2 x ULN was an exclusion criteria for the main  studies  (1001  and  1005).  No  data  are  available  in  patients  with  severe  and  end-stage  renal impairment. The applicant has committed to perform an investigation following a step-wise approach in planned study A8081020 'A Phase I, Single-Dose, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Crizotinib in Subjects with Impaired Renal Function' (as reflected in section 2.7) and the available data have been adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The need for further investigations (steady-state study or SIM-CYP simulation) will be decided based on the findings of the single dose study.

## Liver impairment

There is also no specific study in hepatic impairment. Clinical trials 1001 and 1005 excluded patients with ALT or AST &gt;2.5 x ULN, or if due to underlying malignancy, &gt; 5.0 x ULN or with total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN. Hepatic impairment is likely to alter the kinetics of crizotinib as it is primarily hepatically eliminated and the lack of data has been adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  Population PK analysis did not select transaminases as significant covariates influencing crizotinib. The influence of liver insufficiency on the disposition of crizotinib remains to be established and no recommendations of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

use could be made yet in this sub-group of patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The Applicant  has  committed  to  perform  adequate  investigations  (planned  study  A8081012  and  post authorisation  safety  study  to  evaluate  multiple  dose  (due  to  the  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  of crizotinib) and determine the PK profile of crizotinib and metabolites in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment (see section 2.7). A contra-indication has been added in section 4.3 of the SmPC in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Elderly patients

Age was not identified as a significant co-variate for crizotinib in the population PK analysis and the characteristics of patients with ALK-positive status (younger patients) seem to differ from unselected NSCLC patients. Only a small proportion (12-14 %) of the patients included in the main studies (10011005)  were  over  65  years.  No  formal  dosing  recommendation  can  be  made  until  additional  data become available. The PKs of crizotinib have not been formally investigated in elderly patients and the Applicant has committed to investigate further this issue in the final popPK analysis report of the main studies (see section 2.7 RMP).

## Race

After repeated administration of 250 mg BID, steady-state crizotinib Cmax and AUC  in Asian patients were higher than in Non-Asian: respectively, 1.57 (90% CI: 1.16-2.13) fold and 1.50 (90% CI: 1.102.04) fold those seen in non-Asian patients (also see section 2.4 with regard to differences in ORR). Bodyweight, size and BSA, appear to be factors partly contributing to the PK difference seen between Asian  and  non-Asian  patients.  Other  potential  mechanisms  for  this  PK  difference  are  unknown. Crizotinib  ORR  was  much  greater  in  Asian  patients  than  in  non-Asian  patients  with  ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. As 45% of the population in study A8081007 was Asian, an additional comparative analysis of crizotinib vs. Pemetrexed/docetaxel according to race is expected as part of the A8081007 study report (as indicated in the specific obligations to conduct post-authorisation measures).

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated that crizotinib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A (see section 4.5). In vitro studies indicated that clinical drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur  as  a  result  of  crizotinib-mediated  inhibition  of  the  metabolism  of  medicinal  products  that  are substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6.

An in vitro study in human hepatocytes indicated that clinical drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur  as  a  result  of  crizotinib-mediated  induction  of  the  metabolism  of  medicinal  products  that  are substrates for CYP1A2 or CYP3A.

An in  vitro study  in  human  hepatocytes  indicated  that  crizotinib  may  induce  pregnane  X  receptor (PXR)-regulated enzymes (e.g., CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, with the exception of CYP3A4). Therefore,  caution  should  be  exercised  in  administering  crizotinib  in  combination  with  medicinal products  that  are  predominantly  metabolized  by  these  enzymes.  Of  note,  the  effectiveness  of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be altered. (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

Based on an in vitro study, crizotinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp. Therefore, administration of crizotinib  with  medicinal  products  that  are  substrates  of  P-gp  (e.g.,  digoxin,  dabigatran,  colchicine, pravastatin) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Close clinical surveillance is recommended when crizotinib is administered with these medicinal products (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro , crizotinib did not inhibit the human hepatic uptake transport proteins OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, clinical drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur as a result of crizotinib-mediated inhibition of the hepatic uptake of medicinal products that are substrates for these transporters  as  the  concentration  of  crizotinib  that  inhibits  50%  of  OATP-mediated  transport  greatly exceeds  the  mean  unbound  crizotinib  plasma  concentration  at  C max (38  ng/mL,  0.085µM)  and  the estimated  maximum  crizotinib  concentration  in  liver  following  therapeutic  doses  of  250  mg  BID  in patients with cancer (A8081001).

## In vivo studies

Agents whose plasma concentrations may be altered by crizotinib

Following  28  days  of  crizotinib  dosing  at  250 mg  taken  twice  daily  in  cancer  patients,  the  oral midazolam  AUC  was  3.7-fold  those  seen  when  midazolam  was  administered  alone,  suggesting  that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.

Despite  a  moderate  effect  at  therapeutic  dosage,  with  the  dose  of  300  mg  QD  of  crizotinib,  and regardless  of  the  low  number  of  subjects,  the  upper  bound  of  the  90%  CI,  is  equal  to  8,68  thus suggesting  that  crizotinib  might  be  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor.    This  is  particularly  relevant  for  the population  at  risk  of  higher  exposure  such  as  Asian  and  low  weight  population.  Indeed,  of  the  14 patients receiving crizotinib given at 250 mg BID, 6 did not complete the study and on the 8 remaining patients, 3 displayed an AUCi/ AUC ratio for midazolam &gt; 5, making crizotinib a possible potent CYP3A inhibitor.

Therefore,  coadministration  of  crizotinib  with  CYP3A  substrates  with  narrow  therapeutic  indices, including  but  not  limited  to  alfentanil,  cisapride,  cyclosporine,  ergot  derivatives,  fentanyl,  pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). If the combination is needed, then close clinical monitoring should be exercised.

## Agents that may increase crizotinib plasma concentrations

In vitro , CYP3A4 was the main enzyme involved in crizotinib metabolism, notably in the formation of the lactam (or M10).

Coadministration of crizotinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase crizotinib plasma concentrations.  Coadministration  of  a  single  150  mg  oral  dose  of  crizotinib  in  the  presence  of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in increases in crizotinib systemic exposure,  with  crizotinib  AUCinf  and  Cmax  values  that  were  approximately  3.2-fold  and  1.4-fold, respectively, those seen when crizotinib was administered alone. The reported adverse events suggest a likely activity from the metabolite M10. Eyes disorders, for example, were frequently reported and may be related to the combination rather than to crizotinib alone. In other clinical studies, these AEs were observed after repeated-dose of crizotinib administered at  250  mg  BID  and  not after  a  single dose.  Hence,  the  explanation  behind  this  effect  might  be  the  consequence  of  the  active  fraction crizotinib + M10 circulating levels, reaching sufficient concentrations to penetrate the ocular system.

Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (certain protease inhibitors like atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and, certain azole antifungals like itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole, certain macrolides like clarithromycin, telithromycin, and troleandomycin) should be avoided. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib and should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). Furthermore, the effect of CYP3A inhibitors on steady-state crizotinib exposure has not been established.

Agents that may decrease crizotinib plasma concentrations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Coadministration  of  a  single  250 mg  crizotinib  dose  with  rifampicin  (600 mg  QD),  a  strong  CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in 82% and 69% decreases in crizotinib AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when crizotinib was given alone.

PF-06260182  plasma  exposure  following  coadministration  of  crizotinib  and  rifampicin  decreased  by approximately 94.3% for AUCinf and 89.0% for Cmax compared to when crizotinib was administered alone. When co administered with rifampicin the apparent oral clearance of crizotinib was 5.5-fold that seen when crizotinib was given alone.  The apparent terminal t1/2 of crizotinib was longer than that seen when crizotinib was given alone (48 vs. 33 hours), even though CL/F of crizotinib increased due to rifampin-mediated induction of CYP3A

Coadministration  of  crizotinib  with  strong  CYP3A  inducers  may  therefore  decrease  crizotinib  plasma concentrations. The concurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, and St. John's wort, should be avoided (see section 4.4). Furthermore, the effect of CYP3A inducers on steady-state crizotinib exposure has not been established.

The solubility  of  crizotinib  is  pH  dependant  (level  4  of  BPS)  with  solubility  decreasing  at  higher  pH. Despite the results from the PK-pop analysis, a clinically relevant impact of these drugs on crizotinib absorption cannot be excluded. Therefore, the applicant is recommended to perform a DDI study with PPI  and  H2  antagonists  in  order  to  assess  the  magnitude  of  this  interaction  and  to  anticipate  a recommendation for dose adjustment.

The CL/F after multiple dosing was lower than that observed after single dosing of crizotinib. Since crizotinib is primarily metabolized via CYP3A and is a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, CYP3A auto inhibition may likely be the mechanism for the decrease in CL/F after multiple dosing.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

No clinical studies on the mechanism of action were submitted. For in vitro and in vivo results, see non-clinical pharmacodynamics.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

PF-06260182  (with  two  constituent  diastereomers  PF-06270079  and  PF-06270080),  is  the  only identified metabolite accounting for &gt; 10% of circulating radioactivity and is approximately 3- to 8-fold less  potent  against  ALK  and  2.5-  to  4-fold  less  potent  against  c-Met/HGFR in  vitro .  The  other metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M8) that are present in man but not in animal are not active.

Clinical  relevance/activity  of  crizotinib  lactam (M10,  PF-06260182) and its constituent diastereomers (PF-06270079  and  PF-06270080),  is  still  not  clear.  The  Applicant  was  recommended  to  collect additional PK/PD data regarding crizotinib lactam metabolite.

In order to definitively assess the CLcr effect on crizotinib PK/PD, the applicant was recommended to complete  an  updated  population  PK  analysis  using  pooled  data  from  clinical  trials  including  but  not limited to Studies A8081001 and A8081005.

Genetic differences (CYP 3A4/5) may affect the metabolism of crizotinib in humans. It is unlikely that genetic differences on CYP2C19 and CYP2D would significantly influence the metabolism of crizotinib in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is not known whether crizotinib is only effective in patients with ALK positive status. The enrolment of  ALK-negative  NSCLC  patient  as  a  new  cohort  in  Study  A8081001  has  been  requested  as  PostMarketing Commitment related to US-NDA approval and the applicant agreed to provide results from this cohort as soon as available.

## Resistance

Clinical  collaborations  involving  crizotinib  resistance  have  identified  ALK  secondary  mutations  after demonstrating evidence of (radiographic) disease progression in a total of 11 of 36 cases (31%) of NSCLC (including L1196M, G1269A, C1156Y, L1152R, and F1174L mechanistically characterized in in vitro cell-based assays and demonstrated to confer resistance to crizotinib). Additional studies of ALKpositive  tumors  suggested  involvement  of  alternative  pathways  as  potential  mechanisms  of  ALK mutation-independent resistance. The Applicant will continue to address this issue and provide another analysis of crizotinib resistance after an additional significant amount of new data becomes available.

## RR and QTc prolongation:

Crizotinib  induces  a  dose-dependent  increase  of  the  RR-interval  (decrease  in  heart  rate  expected around 4 bpm decrease for a 100 ng/mL increase in crizotinib concentration).

There is a marked estimated decrease in heart rate at the average steady-state Cmax of 478 ng/mL after 250 mg BID dosing of crizotinib (A8081001) of 15.9 bpm (90% CI: 14.3, 17.5).

In addition to the mean changes, of main interest are the dispersion and the individual RR values as shown above overall and also according to race and sex.

Individual  values  for  concentration-RR  final  according  are  given  overall  in  Figure  1  of  Pop  PK  and according to sex and Race in Figure 2 and 3 of Pop PK:

QTc prolongation is a pharmacological class effect/safety concern for TKI.

The QT interval prolongation potential of crizotinib was assessed in all patients who received crizotinib 250 mg BID. Serial  ECGs  in  triplicate  were  collected  following  a  single  dose  and  at  steady-state  to evaluate the effect of crizotinib on QT intervals. Four of 382 patients (1.0%) were found to have QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) ≥ 500 msec, and 15 of 364 patients (4.1%) had an increase from  baseline  QTcF ≥ 60  msec  by  automated  machine-read  evaluation  of  ECG.  A  central  tendency analysis  of  the  QTcF  data  demonstrated  that  the  highest  upper  bound  of  the  two-sided  90%  CI  for QTcF was &lt;15 msec at the protocol pre-specified time points.

Automatic reading of ECGs is not the optimal way to best detect QT prolongations and study specific 'most appropriate correction method' (QTcS) is not likely to be used in clinical practice.

Of interest is the concentration-QTcF relationship provided (figure 4 and 5 of the Pop PK):

Figure 4 Concentration-QTcB relationship for males and Asian group

Figure 5 Concentration-QTcB relationship for females and Asian group

Of main interest is the dispersion and the individual QTcF values overall and also according to race and sex  as  outliers  QTcF  values  as  well  as  marked  individual  increases  in  QTcF  compared  with  baseline values could allow proper evaluation of risk of occurrence of clinical events.

Automatic reading QTcF was over 500 msec on at least one post baseline assessment in 4/308 patients (1.3%) and maximum change in QTcF was ≥ 60 msec in 3.5 %( 10/289), from preliminary data of studies  1001-1005.  QTcF  prolongation  from  389  msec  to  578  msec  was  observed  in  a  24-year  old Asian in one ongoing phase II study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Crizotinib lactam (M10) was the only metabolite observed in humans known to possess pharmacological activity against ALK or c-Met/HGFR.  Although it was the major metabolite in human plasma,  it  was  not  detected  in  urine  following  oral  crizotinib  administration.  Therefore,  a  marked increase  in  the  plasma  exposure  of  this  metabolite  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function  is  not anticipated. The other following metabolites observed in humans are considered inactive (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, and M8).

The  contribution  of  c-Met/HGFR  inhibition  to  crizotinib  anti-cancer  activity  will  be  further  elucidated given  that  c-MET  is  often  over-expressed  in  NSCLC  patients,  c-MET  over-expression  in  NSCLC  is associated  with  a  poor  prognosis,  and  no  information  has  been  submitted  on  the  prevalence  of  coexpression  of  high  levels  of  c-MET  and  ALK  mutation  in  NSCLC. However,  the  enrolment  of  ALKnegative NSCLC patient as a new cohort in Study A8081001 has been requested as Post-Marketing Commitment related to US-NDA approval. The applicant agreed to provide results from this cohort as soon as available.

While crizotinib is a class 4 compound within the BCS, the coadministration of food does not seem to enhance solubility or permeability of this compound.

Available data do not allow to definitively conclude whether or not crizotinib may cross the BBB; the absence of metastatic brain disease response does not necessarily imply the crizotinib inability to cross the BBB; moreover, additional information in patients with brain metastatses will be discussed in the efficacy section.

Because of extensive pre-systemic metabolism, hepatic impairment is likely to cause accumulation of crizotinib.  Clinical  trials  1001  and  1005  excluded patients with ALT or AST &gt;2.5 x ULN, or if due to underlying  malignancy,  &gt;5.0  x  ULN  or  with  total  bilirubin  &gt;1.5  x  ULN.  Exclusion  criteria  therefore prevented exploring the relationship between signs of hepatic toxicity and exposure (see CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.3/Corr.2).  Considering  that  lung  cancer  most  often  spreads  to  the  liver  and safety  issues  have  been  raised  insufficient  information  is  still  available  on  the  effect  of  hepatic impairment on PK/PD of crizotinib and active metabolite. In order to address this issue, the Applicant will conduct both Study A8081012 ('A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the  Pharmacokinetics  of  Crizotinib  in  Advanced  Cancer  Patients')  and  a  3-year  post-approval multinational  database  study  in  Europe  to  further  characterize  the  safety  of  crizotinib  in  patients, including those with hepatic impairment, in real-world settings (see section 2.7).

Insufficient information is available on the effect of severe renal impairment on crizotinib PK/PD and safety.  Therefore,  no  valid  dosing  recommendation  could  be  made  in  this  subgroup  and  additional information is required. The Applicant will conduct a clinical trial to determine the effect of severe renal impairment on single-dose pharmacokinetics of crizotinib (Study A8081020: 'A Phase I, Single-Dose, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of Crizotinib in Subjects with Impaired Renal Function') with the final clinical study report expected in Q2 2013 (see section 2.7).

In addition, it was recommended to the applicant to complete an updated population PK analysis to definitively assess the CLcr effect on crizotinib PK using pooled data from clinical trials (including but not limited to Studies A8081001 and A8081005).

The PK/PD of crizotinib has not been adequately evaluated in patients over 65 years of age and this information has been adequately reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. The Applicant will complete  an  updated  popPK  analysis  to  definitively  assess  the  effect  of  age  on  crizotinib  PK  using pooled data from clinical trials (including but not limited to Studies A8081001 and A8081005), with the final report to be submitted second half of 2013 (see section 2.7).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  further  investigate  the  influence  of  body  weight  and mainly  lean  body  weight  in  order  to  validate  dosing  recommendations  in  obese  and  underweighted patients.

Although  the  long  apparent  elimination  half-life  is  supportive  of  a  once-daily  dosing  regimen,  the Applicant  selected  a  twice-daily  dosing  schedule  for  the  RP2D  to  better  manage  the  frequency  and severity  of  gastrointestinal  events.  The  other  pharmacokinetic  reason  could  be  the  large  volume  of distribution  and  the  possibility  of  a  deep  compartment  in  very  slow  equilibrium  with  the  central compartment, although the amount of crizotinib in this deep compartment is likely small.

PK/PD analysis suggested that the patients at the lower end of the exposure range obtained with the normal clinical dose had doubled risk for increase in tumour size from baseline at the end of treatment, compared with medium and high exposure categories (data not shown). In order to better understand these results, the CHMP recommended the applicant to conduct a definitive Exposure-Response (ER) analyses for each of the main studies A8081001, A8081005, and the two Phase 3 randomised studies (A8081007 and A8081014) when final data are available, as summarised in the Population Modelling Analysis Plan with PFS and OS (if applicable) as efficacy endpoints and the race factor (Asian vs. nonAsian)  will  be  included  as  one  of  the  covariates  in  the  modelling.  A  final  ER  analyses  could  be conducted at the end of each study, using a similar approach.

A  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  analysis  suggested  a  relationship  between  crizotinib  plasma concentration and QTc. However, a reliable estimation of QTcF effect size is not possible at present, and large increases in QT interval (20 ms or over) cannot be reliably excluded because of limited data, and ECG interpretation issues. Additional data and analyses are required in order to have a reliable estimation of the size of the HR and QTc effect and potential clinical consequences. The Applicant has committed  to  amend  study  A8081014  in  order  to  include  additional  ECG  time  points  and  central blinded manual review and to present bradycardia and QT potentially related AEs/SAEs/deaths (such as  arrhythmias,  syncope,  seizure  and  sudden  death  cases,  bradycardias,  QT  increase)  and  draw reliable  conclusions  about  their  associations  with  HR  reduction  and  QTcF  prolongation  (see  section 2.7).

During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  specifically  investigate  the  occurrence  of enantiomeric conversion of R-enantiomer as the R enantiomer of Form A is reported to be the active form  of  crizotinib.  It  could  be  agreed,  that  conversion  following  identified  and  thus  expected mechanisms is not likely. Nevertheless, it could not be excluded that isomerisation through unknown mechanism may occur. It was therefore recommended to the applicant to investigate the potential for crizotinib to undergo chiral inversion using an in vitro human system.

## Drug-Drug interactions

CYP3A4  is  moderately  involved  in  crizotinib  metabolism  but  the  study  performed  with  rifampicin exhibits outstanding results.  The results from the planned DDI study with multiple doses of rifampin are therefore considered of primary importance in terms of clarification and definition of the need for dose modifications (see section 2.7).

The solubility  of  crizotinib  is  pH  dependant  (level  4  of  BPS)  with  solubility  decreasing  at  higher  pH. Furthermore,  preliminary  results  of  the  popPK  analysis  do  not  allow  discarding  a  clinically  relevant impact of PPI and H2 antagonists on crizotinib absorption. The CHMP recommended the applicant to conduct a single-dose study since the potential effect of gastric pH-elevating agents on crizotinib PK, if any,  would  be  mediated  via  altered  drug  absorption  and  not  post-absorptive  processes  (e.g.,  drug metabolism).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The planned DDI studies with ketoconazole or rifampin at steady-state will provide more evidence for the correct crizotinib dose adjustment in case of co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors and inducers in NSCLC patients. In the mean time, the proposal that concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers should be avoided is endorsed (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

The  effect  of  crizotinib  on  glucuronidation  enzymes  was  not  assessed.  Even  though  the  phase  II enzymes such as UGT are not mainly involved in crizotinib metabolism, it was recommended to the applicant to further investigate the inhibitory effect of the latter as well as its inducing effect.

The CHMP recommended the conduct of an in vitro study assessing the inhibitory potency of crizotinib on BSEP.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The data submitted by the applicant are considered appropriate. However, additional PK studies are proposed to address some deficiencies: effect of hepatic or renal impairment, reason for differences in exposure in Asian and drug-drug interaction. The long half-life, however, is likely to reduce the day-today variability in exposure related to variable bioavailability. The lack of data is reflected in the SmPC.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology and pharmacokinetics:

- to submit DDI studies with ketoconazole or rifampin at steady-state in order to allow defining dosing adjustments in case of co-administration.

- To submit the CSR of Study A8081012 'A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Crizotinib in Advanced Cancer Patients.' and the Post-Authorisation Safety Study (3-year post-approval multinational database study in Europe to further characterize the safety of crizotinib in patients, including those with hepatic impairment, in real-world settings).

- To present the results of a step-wise investigation in patients with severe renal impairment.

- To submit a definite assessment of the effect of age for the main studies A8081001, A8081005, A8081007 according to Population Modelling Analysis Plan at the time of submission of the study report for the pivotal study A8081007.

- To amend study A8081014 to include additional ECG time points and central blinded manual review. Furthermore, events such as sudden death, cardiac disorders, arrhythmias, syncope, dizziness, bradycardia, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, should be further presented and discussed together with the assessment potential QT prolongation (and the risk of electrolyte unbalances linked to important frequency of diarrhoea and vomiting).

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

The  MAA  for  crizotinib  is  based  on  2  ongoing  clinical  trials,  the  pivotal  phase  I/II  A8081001  study (referred to as study 1001) and the supportive phase 2 A8081005 study (referred to as study 1005), in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

Two phase III trials of crizotinib in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC are ongoing :

During the evaluation procedure, efficacy updates from the 2 uncontrolled studies (1001 and 1005) were provided as well as top-line summary results from the comparative Study A8081007.

## 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies)

In the dose escalation phase of study 1001, 38 patients with different types of tumours were assigned to study treatment, and 36 patients were treated with at least 1 dose of crizotinib beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1: 35 (97.2%) patients discontinued from treatment, mainly for progressive disease (22 [61.1%] patients).

Progressive  disease  was  noted  in  66.7%,  50.0%,  62.5%,  patients  treated  with  daily  dosing  of respectively  50,  100  and  200  mg  who  did  not  experience  AEs,  and  in  42.9  %,  75.0%,  66.7%  of patients treated with BID dosing of respectively 200, 250 and 300 mg BID for whom AEs frequency was respectively 14.3%, 25.0%, 16.7%.

The Applicant selected the 250 mg BID dosing because of the absence of DLTs in 8 patients treated at this dose level and the occurrence of 2 DLTs of Grade 3 fatigue in 2 out of 6 patients treated at the 300 mg BID dose.

## Treatments

## Treatment allocated

Crizotinib 250 mg was to be administered orally BID in continuous 4-week cycles. Doses were to be taken approximately 12 hours apart and at approximately the same times each day.

A substudy evaluated crizotinib taken with or without food.

A  cycle  was  defined  as  4  weeks  of  crizotinib  treatment  for  all  patient  groups  except  for  the  ALKnegative NSCLC cohort, where a cycle was defined as 3 weeks.

## Duration /Discontinuation

Crizotinib was to be continued until the occurrence of PD or clinical deterioration, unacceptable toxicity that  did  not  improve  with  dosing  interruption,  dose  reduction,  and/or  standard  medical  therapy, patient's withdrawal of consent, investigator's determination that it was in the patient's best interest to discontinue therapy, or initiation of treatment with another anticancer therapy.

Crizotinib  treatment  could  be  continued  beyond  RECIST-defined  PD  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the investigator, the benefit/risk assessment justified continuation of treatment.

## Interruption

Dosing interruption with or without dose reduction (by 1 or 2 dose levels) was allowed for treatmentrelated toxicity. Crizotinib treatment could be interrupted to allow surgery and/or palliative radiation therapy to localized sites of disease progression.

## Authorised Concomitant medications

At screening, all concomitant medication had to be approved by the sponsor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Supportive  care  (such  as  analgesics,  antiemetics,  antidiarrheals,  and  hematopoietic  growth  factors) was to be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.

Palliative radiotherapy and surgery were allowed.

## Unauthorised Concomitant medications

- Other anticancer treatments were not permitted during the study (except palliative radiotherapy and surgery)

- Concurrent use of potent CYP 3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole,  clarithromycin,  erythromycin,  ritonavir,  indinavir,  nelfinavir,  saquinavir,  amprenavir, delavirdine, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, and grapefruit juice)was not allowed for 7 days prior to the first dose of crizotinib and for the duration of crizotinib treatment.

-Concurrent use of potent CYP 3A inducers (including, but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, tipranavir, ritonavir, and St John's Wort) was not allowed for 12 days prior to the first dose of crizotinib and for the duration of crizotinib treatment.

- Concurrent use of drugs that were CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (including, but not limited to pimozide, aripiprazole, triazolam, ergotamine, and halofantrine)

## Objectives

The objectives of the study were:

1. Determine the safety profile of crizotinib including identification of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD);
2. Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimens of crizotinib;
3. Determine PK profile of crizotinib following oral administration including the effect of food;
4.  Perform  initial  evaluation  of  crizotinib-related  cytochrome  P450  3A4  (CYP3A4)  inhibition  using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe;
5.  Perform  exploratory  evaluation  of  c-Met/HGFR  genotype  and  expression,  pharmacodynamic  (PD) endpoints, and biomarkers for crizotinib;
6. Document any evidence of antitumor activity of crizotinib.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The evaluation of antitumor efficacy for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC was based on objective tumour response according to RECIST (version 1.0).

The primary efficacy endpoint in this cohort was ORR: ORR was defined as the percent of patients in the  Response  Evaluable  (RE)  population  achieving  a  confirmed  CR  or  confirmed  PR  according  to RECIST.

Other efficacy endpoints included: time to response (TTR), duration of response (DR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

The  primary  analyses  of  tumour  response  used  the  investigator's  recorded  measurements  and assessments for target, non target, and new lesions to programmatically evaluate response using rules based on RECIST (called 'investigator assessment').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  secondary  analysis  of  tumour  response  was  based  on  an  independent  radiology  review  (IRR) ('independent assessment') as available scans were also retrospectively reviewed by an independent radiology laboratory. Overall response evaluations were also noted by the investigator ('investigatornoted assessment').

## Tumour Evaluations

Disease assessment at baseline (screening) was to include a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; brain and bone scans were to be performed if disease at these sites was suspected.

Scans were to be repeated at all sites of known disease every 2 cycles (i.e., every 8 weeks unless treatment  delayed),  whenever  disease  progression  was  suspected,  and  at  the  end  of  or  withdrawal from study treatment. Sites where disease was not present at baseline were not required to be reimaged  on-study  unless  new  disease  was  suspected.  Disease  responses  (partial  response  (PR)  or complete  response  (CR))  were  to  be  confirmed  at  least  4  weeks  after  initial  documentation  of response.    Brain  and  bone  scans  were  repeated  as  appropriate  or  if  PD  was  suspected.    The  same imaging modality was to be used throughout the study to evaluate tumour burden. Scans were to be repeated  at  all  sites  of  known  or  suspected  disease  every  2  cycles  (i.e.,  every  8  weeks  unless treatment was delayed), whenever disease progression was suspected, and at the end of or withdrawal from study treatment. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.0 was used to evaluate disease response and progression.

## Sample size

## RP2D Cohorts

Following  identification  of  the  RP2D  of  crizotinib,  patients  were  enrolled  to  address  questions  in molecularly  defined  disease  and  to  conduct  PK,  MDZ  interaction,  food  effect,  positron  emission tomography (PET) imaging, and other PD markers.

At  least  25  patients  were  planned;  the  number  was  increased  as  a  result  of  the  antitumor  activity observed in the initial ALK-positive NSCLC patients.

A minimum of 25 to a maximum of 40 ALK-negative NSCLC patients were planned.

## Randomisation

Not applicable as it was a non-comparative single-arm study.

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable as it was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Analysis of ORR, DR, TTR, and DCR was performed for the RE population, the Safety Analysis (SA) population was used for the analysis of PFS and OS (see participant flow).

The planned statistical analyses and methods used to access the efficacy endpoints included:

-  Exact  method  based  on  F-distribution  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  for  ORR,  DCR  at weeks 8 and 16

- Amendment 3 added 2 RP2D cohorts: 1 to evaluate the effect of an MDZ drug-drug interaction and 1 to  evaluate  clinical  activity  in  an  enriched  population  (patients  with  tumors  harboring  c-Met  gene amplification or mutation, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases with ALK translocation). [18F] FLTPET was evaluated in a small subset of patients in the RP2D-enriched cohorts (N=6) as a noninvasive measure of tumor inhibition. The fed/fasted study was added.
- Amendment 4: EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC patients were allowed to enter, QTc eligibility criteria were modified  from  to  &gt;470  msec  for  both  males  and  females,  'prior  radiotherapy  to  &gt;25%  of  bone marrow' was removed from exclusion criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Amendment 8: allowed patients with stable brain metastases
- Amendment 9, patients with pulmonary embolism within 6 months prior to starting study treatment were allowed
- Amendment 12: Increased the number of patients, added an ALK-negative NSCLC cohort, reopened the dose-escalation cohort to determine a QD MTD, widened creatinine eligibility criteria to ≤ 2 x ULN, replace tablets by capsules , added  a screening ophthalmology examination and follow-up as clinically indicated  was,  treatment  allowed  without  regard  to  meals  after  Cycle  2  Day  1,  added  patients  with tumors having an ROS gene translocation to the RP2D-enriched cohort.
-  Amendment  13:  excluded  only  uncontrolled  atrial  fibrillation  criteria,  removed  coumadin  dosing restriction, modified PK sampling time points
-  Amendment  14:  modified  survival  monitoring  period,  removed  food  restriction  criteria,  added evaluation of active metabolites

## Numbers analysed

The SA population consisted of: 125  patients  of  the  ALK-positive  pre-treated  NSCLC  cohort,  the  35 patients  of  the  ALK-negative  NSCLC  cohort  and  48  out  of  63  patients  of  the  RP2D  Other  cohort assigned to treatment and treated.

Assessment of PFS and OS for the ALK-positive pre-treated NSCLC cohort was performed on the SA population.

The RE population consisted of: 121 patients out of the 125 patients of the ALK-positive NSCLC cohort (4  patients  were  excluded  as  they  did  not  meet  the  Response-Evaluable  criteria).  The Response-Evaluable population is defined as all patients in the Safety Analysis dataset who had an adequate baseline disease assessment and also met 1 of the following 2 criteria: a) had at least one post-baseline disease assessment at least 6 weeks from first dose, or b) withdrew from the trial or experienced progression/death at any time on study.

Assessment of ORR, DR, TTR for the ALK-positive pre-treated NSCLC cohort were performed on the RE population.

## Outcomes and estimation

At the time of the initial database snapshot for this application, 119 ALK-positive NSCLC patients were included  in  the  SA  population  (updated  to  125).  Patients  with  ALK  positive  NSCLC  were  evenly distributed with regard to sex (50% female), young (mean/median age of 51 years, 21-79, 86% &lt;65 years), mostly White (61%), and included 30% Asian, and were mainly (99%) never or only former smoking  (72%  never  smokers,  27%  ex-smokers).  Most  of  the  patients  had  metastatic  disease  at baseline and had a primary diagnosis of NSCLC with an histology of mostly adenocarcinoma (122/125, 98%) and all had an ECOG performance status of mainly 0 or 1 (87%). Most (70%) of these patients were previously pre-treated and most of them had received ≥ 2 prior systemic treatment regimens for metastatic disease.

## ORR:

The (initial database snapshot) ORRs from prior first-line and second-line for these patients of 16.3% and 9.7%, respectively, were similar to those reported in the literature in unselected advanced NSCLC patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 121 ALK-positive patients in the RE population treated with crizotinib 250 mg BID, 3 patients had confirmed CRs, and 70 patients had confirmed PRs, for an investigator-assessed ORR of 60.3% (95% CI: 51.0%, 69.1%).  Best overall response in patients included in the RE population and best change in target lesions are provided below.

The  ORR  was  independent  of  age  gender,  and  number  of  prior  metastatic  treatment  regimens.  In addition, best overall response appeared to be independent of percent ALK positivity.

There was a higher ORR in Asian (82.4%) than in non-Asian patients (52.4%).

These results on ORR were even higher in the patients' subgroup that was retested by a central lab MGH CTA especially when compared with patients not retested:  ORR was 63.6% (95% CI: 53.4%, 73.1%)  in  the  retested  MGH  CTA  subgroup  vs.  47.1%  (95%  CI:  23.0%,  72.2%,  and  no  CR),  i.e. 16.5% difference, with however overlapping CI (small number of not retested patients).

## PFS:

The initial preliminary estimate of median PFS was 10.0 months (95% CI: 8.2 months, 14.7 months).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Indirect  comparison  versus  other  treatment  was  provided  (data  not  shown).  These  analyses  were regarded as exploratory and to be confirmed by the results of the prospective randomized comparison (phase 3 study 1007):

The initial application included comparisons but most were based on small series and only phase III comparative studies can provide a definite answer with regard to respective efficacy of crizotinib and other therapies.

## Clinical studies in special populations

Until  now  available  studies  enrolled  mainly  middle  aged  (patient  population  younger  compared  with unselected NSCLC patients), white (25-30 % Asian), otherwise essentially healthy patients with good performance status and essentially normal organ functions.

Severe  renal  impairment  and  hepatic  impairment: Additional  data  have  been  requested  and  the Applicant  agreed  to  provide  additional  data/studies  in  special  populations  including  severe  renal impairment, hepatic impairment and elderly (see section 2.7).

Elderly  patients: Few  elderly  patients  were  included  in  the  studies  as  most  ALK+  NSCLC  patients appear younger. Of the  125  patients  in  study  1001,  18  (14%)  were  65  years  or  older.  Of  the  261 patients in study 1005, 30 (12%) were 65 years or older. No patients in Studies 1001 or 1005 were 85 years or older. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

Histology: Information is available from only 29 response-evaluable patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC in Studies 1001 and 1005. Partial responses were observed in 10 of these patients for an ORR of  31%,  which  was  less  than  the  ORRs  reported  in  Study  1001  (60%)  and  Study  1005  (53%). Comparisons with ORR in this subgroup of NSCLC patients treated with standard chemotherapy are not yet available. As most of the efficacy data is obtained in patients with ALK+ NSCLC/adenocarcinoma, it was considered critical to review additional data/analyses, including comparative data from study 1007 in  order  to  address  the  benefit/risk  of  crizotinib  (PFS/OS/ORR/safety)  versus  chemotherapy  in  ALK positive NSCLC patients according to histology (adenocarcinoma versus other).

## Patients with brain metastases

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pivotal  study  A8081001  did  not  require  baseline  brain  imaging  prior  to  patient  enrolment,  and therefore no data were provided from that study. The comparison of the clinical outcome according to the presence of brain metastasis has been provided only for patients enrolled in study 1005, which required baseline brain imaging.

Brain metastases were present in nearly 25% of the patients included in study A8081005.. The ORR is similar  in  the  61  patients  with  baseline  brain  metastases  and  in  the  194  patients  without  brain involvement,  but  the  rate  of  early  deaths  is  more  than  twice  in  patients  with  CNS  involvement  at baseline:  ORR  of  57.4%  [95%  CI  44.1%,  70.0%])  versus  52.1%  [95%  CI:  44.8%,  59.3%] respectively, with however 6 deaths in each subgroup (6/61, 9.8% versus 6/194, 3.1% respectively).

Twenty  patients  in  study  1005  were  enrolled  with  asymptomatic  brain  metastases  that  were  not irradiated, 17 of whom were evaluable for both brain metastasis and systemic tumour responses. Eight (47%) of these 17 patients had responses in the brain that matched or exceeded the systemic tumour responses,  2  (25%)  of  whom  had  complete  brain  metastasis  responses.  Nine  (53%)  of  these  17 patients  had  systemic  tumour  responses  that  exceeded  the  brain  metastasis  responses,  8  (89%)  of whom had stable brain disease for at least 3 tumour reassessments. The limited number of patients included in the analysis should be taken in consideration.

## Supportive study(ies)

## 1Study 1005

Study  1005 is  an  ongoing  multicenter,  multinational,  open-label,  single-arm,  Phase  II  study  of crizotinib in patients with advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) 'ALK-positive NSCLC' who have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.

It  evaluates  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  crizotinib  in  patients  with  previously  treated  ALK-positive advanced NSCLC and provides additional supportive efficacy data.

In the initial submission of data relevant to this study it was considered supportive as not all patients had been included and only preliminary results were available on selected efficacy criteria not including PFS. Further updates have been made available during the course of the procedure.

Results according to previous treatments were provided: response to crizotinib seems higher (indirect unplanned subjective comparison) than those reported to prior treatment regimens, regardless of the line of treatment and the previous agent used. In particular, the response to crizotinib seems higher to that retrospectively evaluated for prior 1st line, second line chemotherapy, single agent TKI (17.5%, 13.9%, and 3.5%, respectively), or pemetrexed and docetaxel (ORR was, however, lower for the latter with  a  wide  CI)  and  seem  larger  than  ORR  obtained  with  prior  chemotherapy.  This  analysis,  not pre-specified and lacking of independent adjudication of response to prior treatment, must be regarded as  exploratory  and  needs  to  be  confirmed  by  the  results  from  the  prospective  randomized  phase  3 study (study 1007).

The median PFS was 8.5 months in both the Overall (439 pts, 28.2% PFS events occurred, 95% CI 6.2, 9.9) and in the Mature Safety population (261 pts, 41.8% PFS events occurred 95% CI 6.5, 9.9). An updated PFS of 8.1 months (95% CI 6.8, 9.7), as of 2 January 2012, was reported for the Mature Safety population (261 pts, 65.5% PFS events occurred).

The probability of survival at 12 months was estimated as 61% (95% CI: 49%, 71%).

## 2'top-line summary' of study 1007

The  Applicant  provided  a  'top-line  summary'  of  study  1007  (including  data  from  visits  through  30 March 2012 of an Open-label, multicenter, randomised Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of crizotinib (starting  dose  of  250  mg  BID,  same  dose  as  in  the  previously  submitted  uncontrolled  studies)  vs second-line  standard  of  care  chemotherapy,  pemetrexed  (500  mg/m 2 ,  on  Day  1  of  every  cycle)  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

docetaxel  (75  mg/m 2 ,  on  Day  1  of  every  cycle),  in  ALK-positive,  advanced  NSCLC  patients  who received only one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

This is the first controlled trial in ALK-positive NSCLC patients.

The primary study objective was to demonstrate the superiority of crizotinib vs standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed  or  docetaxel)  in  terms  of  PFS,  based  on  Independent  Radiology  Review  (IRR).  This primary  objective  is  adequate.  Comparison  of  ORR,  OS,  safety  and  tolerability  were  secondary objectives. Efficacy secondary objectives of mainly OS and to a lesser extent ORR are adequate.

Three-hundred and eighteen patients (318) were planned to be randomised 1:1 to Arm A (crizotinib) or Arm B (pemetrexed or docetaxel) with stratification by ECOG performance status, brain metastases, and prior (yes, no) EGFR TKI  treatment.

Pemetrexed was the first option, unless patients had already received this drug in the context of a first-line chemotherapy or had a squamous histology. As the vast majority of ALK-positive NSCLC has a non-squamous  histology  (&gt;90%  of  the  patients  in  Study  1007  had  adenocarcinoma),  pemetrexed might  in  principle  be  more  active  in  these  patients.  This  is  supported  by  published  retrospective analyses, in small series of ALK-positive NSCLC patients, in which a good activity of pemetrexed was reported. In study A8081007, 58% of patients received pemetrexed and 42% docetaxel.

PFS and ORR were tested at the 1-sided 0.025 level while OS was tested at the 1-sided 0.0004 level corresponding to the number of OS events observed at the final PFS analysis. From available data, 347 patients  (173  in  the  crizotinib  arm  and  174  in  the  chemotherapy  group)  were  randomised,  from February 2010 to February 2012, in 105 sites in 21 countries. The reason for the inclusion of these extra-patients  has  not  been  provided.  The  Full  Analysis  (FA)  population  is  the  primary  set  for evaluating  patient  characteristics  /  disposition  and  efficacy  endpoints  and  includes  all  patients  who were randomized (n=347, 173 to crizotinib, 174 to the chemotherapy arm (99 pemetrexed [58%]  and 72 [42%] docetaxel)with study drug assignment according to the actual randomization.

Similar to the phase I-II uncontrolled studies 1001 and 1005, most patients were young (median 50 years), evenly distributed with regard to sex (56% women), never-smokers (63%) or light smokers, had  an  histology  of  adenocarcinoma  (92-94%)had  an  ECOG  0  or  1  (92%);12%  had  received  prior EGFR TKI.. A surprisingly quite higher proportion were Asian (45%) which should be further discussed when the CSR will be provided, as results of the previous studies had shown a much higher response rate in Asian.

With regard to histology, non-adenocarcinoma histology NSCLC was less than 8% (similar to the low rate  in  Studies  A8081001  and  A8081005)  and  none  of  the  crizotinib  patients  had  squamous  cell carcinoma. A quite large proportion of patients had brain metastases (35%) at baseline. There were more cycles started (10.5 vs. only 4) and more dose reductions in the crizotinib arm. A total of 85 (49%) patients in the crizotinib arm and 28 (16%) patients in the chemotherapy arm were on treatment at the time of data cutoff. The difference in treatment duration/FU and possible crossover make assessment of OS and safety more difficult.

## Primary efficacy criteria (PFS)

According  to  the  preliminary  data  presented  by  the  Applicant,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in median PFS was observed, with 7.7 (95% CI: 6.0, 8.8) and 3.0 (95% CI: 2.6, 4.3) months in crizotinib and chemotherapy arm, respectively: HR 0.487 (95% CI: 0.371, 0.638, p-value &lt;0.0001).

This was consistent both with PFS based on investigator's assessment in study 1007 (HR : 0.416 (95% CI: 0.314, 0.552), p&lt;0.0001) and with PFS with crizotinib in the previous uncontrolled studies (1001 and 1005).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Efficacy criteria

OS:

OS data showed no difference (nor trend) between treatment groups; OS data are not mature yet and the high rate of cross-over (62%) should be taken into account.

In  Study 1007, patients progressing in the control arm were allowed to cross-over to crizotinib and were enrolled in Study 1005. Actually, at the data cut-off of this analysis, 108 patients (meaning 62% of the total patients enrolled in the control arm) crossed over to receive crizotinib in study A8081005. Therefore, OS data will be confounded by the cross-over, do not allowing a direct comparison between the two arms.

## ORR:

According to the data  presented by the Applicant, the ORR (assessed by IRR) was 65.3% (95%CI: 57.7%, 72.4%) for crizotinib and 19.5% (95% CI: 13.9%, 26.2%) for chemotherapy.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Initial  available  data  came  from  2  single-arm/uncontrolled  multicenter,  multinational,  open-label, ongoing  phase  I-II  studies  (study  1001  and  1005)  of  crizotinib  in  patients  with  advanced  (locally advanced  or  metastatic)  'ALK-positive  NSCLC'  (NSCLC  harboring  a  translocation  or  inversion  event involving the ALK gene locus) with primarily a histology of adenocarcinoma who have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (84% in 1001, , all in study 1005). Study 1001 was originally designed as a phase 1 dose escalation trial for the definition of the RP2D. The crizotinib MTD, 250 mg BID, was selected on the basis of 2 DLTs of Grade 3 fatigue in 2 out 6 patients treated at 300 mg BID dose level.

ORR, DR and PFS are now mature for both studies. Response rates and PFS are concordant between studies  and  durable,  with  an  updated  ORR  of  60%  and  53%  for  previously  treated  ALK-positive advanced NSCLC RE population in Studies A8081001 and A8081005, respectively, and updated median DRs of 48.1 weeks and 42.9 weeks, respectively.

Median PFS reported in previously treated patients is slightly different between the two studies, being longer  in  Study  A8081001  [9.2  months  (95%  CI:  7.3,  12.7)]  compared  with  Study  A8081005 [8.5months (95% CI: 6.5, 9.9)] but this (small) difference seems mainly due to a larger variability in the former study rather than differences between studies.

Mature data for OS are not yet available.  The  1-year  survival  probability  is  now  estimated  as  72% (95% CI: 63%, 80%) in study 1001 and 61% (95% CI: 49%, 71%) in study 1005. Median OS is now 29.6 months (95% CI: 18.0 months, NA) with crizotinib in study 1001. The applicant also provided selected top-line results of the randomised controlled phase III trial in pre-treated ALK-positive NSCLC (1007). According to the data presented by the Applicant, a statistically significant difference in median PFS was observed, with 7.7 (95% CI: 6.0, 8.8) and 3.0 (95% CI: 2.6, 4.3) months in crizotinib and chemotherapy arm, respectively and HR 0.487 (95% CI: 0.371, 0.638, p-value &lt;0.0001). According to the  preliminary  data  presented  by  the  Applicant,  the  ORR  (assessed  by  IRR)  was  65.3%  (95%CI: 57.7%, 72.4%) for crizotinib and 19.5% (95% CI: 13.9%, 26.2%) for chemotherapy.

The  interim  analysis  for  OS  (with  only  96  events,  about  40%  of  the  events  required  for  the  final analysis) did not show significant differences with a median OS of 20.3 months (95% CI: 18.1, NR) in the crizotinib arm and 22.8 (95% CI: 18.6, NR) months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.021 (95% CI: 0.677, 1.540), with a p-value of 0.5394). Consistent ORR and PFS has been observed with crizotinib in the phase I and II studies, supported by the preliminary results of the phase III study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Impact of histology

Few available data (to date, very partial non comparative data provided on 32 patients only) seem to indicate a decreased benefit with crizotinib in patients with subtypes other than adenocarcinoma: ORR of 31 % for non adenocarcinoma patients; this ORR is half and  outside of the 95% CI of that observed with  crizotinib  in  the  comparative  study  1007:    65.3%  (95%CI:  57.7%,  72.4%)  for  crizotinib  and duration of response seems also shorter. This has been mentioned in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. The benefit/risk of crizotinib and comparison with chemotherapy (especially pemetrexed) is unknown in these patients at present. As ALK+ was targeted and this subgroup of patients is also likely to be small in the real life and may benefit from crizotinib treatment, no mention was added in section 4.1.

## Duration of treatment

With regard to duration of treatment, considering the lack of data showing a benefit from continuation upon progression, an appropriate text has been proposed in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

## Effect of crizotinib on other mutations

The  effect  of  crizotinib  on  other  than  ALK  mutations  is  not  known,  and  additional  data  have  been required (PAC) but the effect on one mutation may not preclude approval on an other mutations whose efficacy has been demonstrated.

In addition, available data do not allow to definitively conclude whether or not crizotinib may cross the BBB;  the  absence  of  metastatic  brain  disease  response  does  not  necessarily  imply  the  crizotinib inability to cross the BBB.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Initial  available  data  came  from  2  single-arm/uncontrolled  multicenter,  multinational,  open-label, ongoing  phase  I-II  studies  (study  1001  and  1005)  of  crizotinib  in  patients  with  advanced  (locally advanced or metastatic) 'ALK-positive NSCLC' (NSCLC harbouring a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus) with primarily a histology of adenocarcinoma who have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (70% in 1001, all in study 1005). The absence of direct comparative study  was  the  most  important  drawback:  indirect  comparison  with  historical  controls  from  different controlled studies in NSCLC and retrospective analyses of response to previous treatments in patients enrolled in Study 1005 were presented but of limited value.

## Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA

There is a need to provide confirmatory data (full study report) from the comparative study A8081007 and updated (OS) data from the 2 uncontrolled studies A8081001 and A8081005.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A  concordant  high  ORR  and  PFS  has  been  observed  with  crizotinib  in  the  2  phase  I/II  uncontrolled studies,  and  are  supported  by  the  preliminary  Top-line  results  of  the  phase  III  comparative  study (1007).

These results indicate that crizotinib has a positive clinically meaningful benefit as a single agent in previously treated patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

In  all  studies,  the  ORR  and  PFS  are  high,  which  might  be  supportive  to  a  better  OS.  However,  the premature OS data of the phase III study do not seem to indicate a better OS for patients treated with crizotinib  compared  with  chemotherapy.    This  might  be  due  to  the  immaturity  of  the  data  (40%  of expected events), the high cross over rate (62%, also demonstrating the need for effective therapy), or a poor safety profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  observed  effect  of  crizotinib  in  ALK-positive  NSCLC  patients  with  a  histology  other  than adenocarcinoma is limited, but appeared to be smaller. This has been mentioned in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the applicant was recommended to provide additional data.

At present, a positive benefit seems clearly established with crizotinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced pretreated NSCLC.

The  efficacy  results  must  be  confirmed  by  more  robust  data  (full  study  report)  from  the  direct prospective comparative study (1007), the full study report of the 2 uncontrolled studies  (including updated OS data), additional information on efficacy patients with histologies other than adenocarcinomas, .

The Applicant should also address some additional outstanding issues with regard to efficacy.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA:

- To submit the CSR of study A8081007 including a detailed analysis of outcome on post-progression treatments in Study 1007 as well as efficacy and baseline data according to race (Caucasian/Asian) by treatment groups

- To submit an update of OS data for both studies (1001 and 1005) when the final study report of each study is available. To compare and explain potential differences in OS for crizotinib in the 3 studies (1001 and 1005 and 1007).

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

-  To  submit  additional  data/analyses,  including  comparative  data  from  study  A8081007  in  order  to address the benefit/risk of crizotinib (PFS/OS/ORR/safety) versus chemotherapy in ALK-positive NSCLC patients according to histology (adenocarcinoma versus other).

## 2.6. Clinical safety

Safety analysis focused on data from two ongoing open-label, single-arm studies: pivotal study (study A8081001) and supportive study (A8081005). All patients who received at least one dose of crizotinib have been included in the studied safety population. These two phase 2 studies (1001 and 1005) were the single-arm studies without any comparative data.

Top-line preliminary safety comparative results from the open-label, multicenter, randomised phase 3 trial (A8081007) were made available during the review procedure.

Safety  experience  from  6  Phase  1  biopharmaceutical  and  Clinical  Pharmacology  studies  in  healthy volunteer subjects receiving 1 to 4 single doses of crizotinib was briefly mentioned in the dossier.

Only data on SAEs and deaths for patients in the crizotinib arm from the ongoing first-line phase 3 study, A8081014 have been included in the submitted documentation.

## Patient exposure

A total of 588 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC received crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily (BID) and were included in the safety analysis population dataset: 149 patients in study 1001 and 439 patients in study 1005, comprising the target population receiving the recommended dosing regimen for crizotinib treatment.

The baseline demographics were very similar between Study 1001 and Study 1005.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Both studies had an even distribution of men and women, most patients were relatively young with median age in their  early  50's,  and  most  patients  had  never  smoked,  although  approximately  onequarter were former smokers and a few were current smokers. The majority of patients were white, and nearly one-third were Asian, primarily Korean or Japanese.

The median duration of follow-up for the 149 ALK-positive NSCLC patients in Study 1001 was 16.6 months ([95% confidence interval (CI): 15.0 months, 18.6 months]. The median duration of treatment increased from 31.9 weeks in the preliminary CSR to 43.1 weeks for 149 ALK positive NSCLC patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  this  Day  120  Clinical  Data  Addendum;  65  out  of  the  149  patients  (43,6%)  were  treated  with crizotinib for more than 1 year.

The median duration of follow-up for the 439 patients in Study 1005 was 4.7 months ([95% CI: 4.2 months, 5.2 months]. The median duration of treatment decreased from 22.3 weeks in the first clinical data addendum (136 patients) to 15.7 weeks in this Day 120 Clinical Data Addendum (439 patients). However,  considering  the  mature  safety  population  (261  patients),  median  duration  of  treatment increased from 22.3 (0.9-53.1) weeks to 24.6 (0.9-68.4) weeks.

## Adverse events

In Study 1001 and in Study 1005, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent all causality AEs were Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Constipation, and Visual impairment.

Other events reported at frequencies ≥ 20% in one or both studies included Oedema peripheral, Dizziness, Fatigue, Rash, and Decreased appetite. In both Studies 1001 and 1005, hepatic events were reported frequently, and included Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (17.4% and 13,2%, respectively) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (14.1% and 9.3%, respectively). Four patients possibly met Hy's Law case criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury.

In study 1001, a total of 147 of the 149 evaluable patients with ALK-positive NSCLC cohort (98,7%), had at least 1 treatment-emergent all causality AE, and 144 patients (96.6%) had at least  1 treatment related AE. According to the provided data, a total of 58 patients (38.9%) experienced SAEs.

All causality Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 77 (51.7%) patients and Grade 5 AEs in 23 (15.4%) patients. 19 patients (12.8%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, 62 (41.6%) patients had AEs associated with a temporary discontinuation and 11 patients (7.4%) had dose reduction due to AEs.

Vision disorders including photopsia, diplopia, blurred vision, visual impairment and vitreous floaters occurred in 103 patients (69.1%). Majority of adverse events were assessed as treatment related by the investigators.

ALT increased was observed in 26 patients (17.4%). In addition, liver dysfunction could be suspected in patients with AST increased (21 patients-14.1%) or Alkaline phosphatase increased (11-7.4%) or blood bilirubine increased (1-0,7%), liver function test anormal (1-0,7%) or transaminases increased (2-1,3%).

Other common treatment-emergent all-causality AEs were anaemia, bradycardia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, seizure, edema, fatigue, neuropathy, and esophageal-related disorder.

In study 1005, 419 (95.4%) of 439 patients experienced a total of 3742 AEs, of which 2186 were considered treatment-related.

All causality Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 152 (34.6%) patients and Grade 5 AEs in 51 (11.6%) patients. Fifty three (53) patients (12.1%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, 110 (25.1%) patients had AEs associated with a temporary discontinuation and 43 patients (9.8%) had dose reduction due to AEs.

The most frequently observed TEAEs were as follows:

- Gastrointestinal disorders (356 - 81.1%) including nausea (217), vomiting (193) diarrhoea (173), constipation (145);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Eye disorders (256 - 58.3%) including visual impairment (162), photopsia (41) vision blurred (25), vitreous floaters (14), visual acuity reduced (2);
- Hepatic disorders have been reported, including ALT increased (58 - 13.2%), AST increased (41 9.3%), alkaline phosphatase increased (19 - 4.3%),hepatic function abnormal (3 - 0.7%), , cytolytic hepatitis (2 - 0.5%), , GGT increased (2 - 0.5%), hepatic enzyme increased (2 - 0.5%), liver function test abnormal (2 - 0.5%), hepatotoxicity (1 - 0.2%), hyperbilirubinemia (1 - 0.2%), liver disorder (1 - 0.2%), blood bilirubin increased (1 - 0.2%), . Four additional cases of liver disorders from study 1005 have been reported after the data cut-off of 01 June 2011. Three of them are potential Hy's law cases: 30-old male patient (2011266525), 58-old male patient (2011288949), 57-old male patient (2011300243) and one case of liver failure in 40-old female patient (2011267823). Two patients died.
- Peripheral neuropathy (12), sensory (14), motor (2);
- Cardiac disorders including sinus bradycardia (6), QT prolonged (8), syncope (8), palpitation (2), tachycardia (5), supraventricular tachycardia (1), bradycardia (5), atrial fibrillation (1) and AV block (1) each).

Overall, in both the ALK-positive NSCLC cohort of Study 1001 and Study 1005, the AE profile of crizotinib was characterised by events that were primarily gastrointestinal, visual, neurological, constitutional, and hepatic in nature.

The table below (Table 20) summarises the adverse drug reactions considered associated with crizotinib in the 386 patients with previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC:

Preliminary results of study 1007 (full study report not yet available)

In study 1007, 172 patient (100%) treated in the crizotinib arm experienced an AE, of which 164 patients (95.3%) experienced a treatment related AE, compared to respectively 168 of the 171 patients (98.2%) and 151 (88.3%) in the chemotherapy arm.

All causality AEs or Treatment related AEs preferred term or clustered term with a frequency of at least 2-fold greater in the crizotinib arm group compared with 'chemotherapy' group included Gastrointestinal disorder (Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Dysgueusia), Vision disorder, Hepatic disorders (elevated transaminase, Hepatotoxicity), Respiratory disorders (Pulmonary embolism, Interstitial lung disease) and Bradycardia. It has to be noted that, the only All causality AEs PT reported with a frequency 2-fold greater in the chemotherapy arm compared with crizotinib was Alopecia and for the Treatment related AEs were Rash, Alopecia and Dyspnoea.

Frequency and grading of the AEs reported (Crizotinib vs Chemotherapy):

- All grade SAEs (37.2% vs 23.4%);
- Grade 3 /4 SAEs (19.8% vs 17%)
- all causality AE (100% vs 98.2%);
- treatment related AEs (95.3% vs 88.3%);
- all causality grade 3-4 AE (44.2% vs 42.1%)
- treatment related Grade 3/4 AEs (31.4% vs 31%);

- Treatment related SAEs were more frequently reported in the chemotherapy arm (14%) compared to crizotinib arm (11.6%). Given that the study 1007 was open-label study, it is questionable whether there was bias in the treatment-related consideration of the adverse events.

- Permanent discontinuation from treatment: more patients in the crizotinib arm (30;17%) had AEs associated with permanent discontinuation from treatment (23; 14%) than in the chemotherapy arm.

More patients in the crizotinib arm had AEs associated with permanent discontinuation from the treatment ((30 (17%) vs 23 (14%) in the chemotherapy arm). It is surprising that less discontinuations were considered related to crizotinib than to chemotherapy, 11 (6%) and 17 (10%), respectively. This could be due to bias, taking into account that study 1007 was an open label study.

Overall, the AE profile of crizotinib compare to the AE profile of Chemotherapy does not seem similar:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in terms of frequency and grading: more all causality and treatment related AEs and more all causality grade 3-4 AE and treatment related Grade 3/4 AEs  have been reported with crizotinib, compare to chemotherapy. More patients with crizotinib discontinued the treatment due to AEs.

In terms of nature: AEs related to crizotinib as Bradycardia, QT prolongations, Syncope, ILD, Pulmonary Embolism, Hepatotoxicity, are unforeseeable and may be life threatening or fatal, whereas, AEs related to chemotherapy, mainly haematotoxicity, which may also be life threatening or fatal, seems more easy to monitor for the physician.

- From the available data, All causality AEs of elevated transaminases were more frequently reported in the crizotinib arm compared with the chemotherapy arm: 66 (38.4 %) versus 25 (14.6 %). Treatment related AES of elevated transaminases were more frequently reported in the crizotinib arm: 62 (36 %) versus 23 (13.5 %) respectively and treatment related Grade 3/4 SAES of elevated transaminases occurred in 2 patients with crizotinib (non in the chemotherapy arm). Three patients had permanent discontinuation from crizotinib due to 5 hepatic events (hepatic failure (1 G3), ALT increase (2 G3) and AST increase (2 G3)).

There were 6 events of Grade 4 increases in ALT and/or AST with crizotinib versus none in the chemotherapy arm; an additional fatal case of hepatic failure (Hy's Law case) considered as related to crizotinib has been reported after the date of data cut-off of the preliminary Topline Summary report.

## AEs in Pharmacological healthy volunteer studies

There were 6 studies involving healthy volunteers in the crizotinib clinical development program (Studies A8081008, A8081009, A8081010, A8081011, A8081015, and A8081016). In these studies, 110 subjects were exposed to 1-4 single oral (150 or 250 mg) doses of crizotinib with at least a 14-day washout period between doses, or to 1 single intravenous (50 mg) dose crizotinib. The most common adverse events reported in healthy volunteer studies were Nausea and Diarrhoea, the majority of which were mild in severity. One subject in Study A8081011 experienced an AE of liver enzyme elevation without total bilirubin elevation and was discontinued from the study. This event was considered moderate in intensity and resolved 21 days after the last dose of crizotinib. There were no other permanent discontinuations due to an AE in these studies, and there were no SAEs or deaths reported.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

The updated 30-day and 60-day all-cause mortality in the 588 patients in the all ALK-positive NSCLC across Studies 1001 and 1005 (Day 120 clinical data addendum) were 3.6% and 5.1% respectively. Seventy-one (71) of the 588 patients (12.1%) have died while on study (within 28 days of the last dose of study drug). For most of the deaths, the underlying cause was the disease under study. In Study 1001, one death was attributed to study drug toxicity (disseminated intravascular coagulation). In Study 1005, 3 deaths were considered treatment-related. One death was due to pulmonary embolism, 1 death of unknown cause and 1 death due to pneumonitis.

Ten (10) crizotinib treated patients who died in Study 1007 had SAEs with a fatal outcome. Of the 10 deaths reported, 3 were considered related to study drug: Cardiac arrest and Respiratory failure, Interstitial lung disease, and Pneumonitis.

Among the 63 patients in the RP2D cohort with tumours other than molecularly defined ALK-positive or ALK-negative NSCLC with data available for the updated report, there were 33 deaths (14 within 28

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days of the last dose of study drug); 27 were considered due to disease progression, and none were considered related to crizotinib treatment.

For study 1007, a total of 96 deaths had been reported as of the date of data cutoff.

·32 Grade 5 AEs (25 in the crizotinib arm and 7 in the chemotherapy arm) and 32 deaths (23 in the crizotinib arm and 9 in the chemotherapy arm) occurred respectively on study and in the survival follow up in study 1007;

·18 Grade 5 AEs and 12 deaths occurred respectively on study and in the survival follow up in patients who crossed over from the chemotherapy arm to study 1005, to receive crizotinib;

·1 death occurred in a patients enrolled by mistake in the crizotinib arm and reported during survival follow up on study 1005

•1 Grade 5 AE (suicide) reported before treatment started in the chemotherapy arm.

The rate of death reported at the database snapshot was similar in both arms (a total of 49 (28.3%) and 47 (27%) deaths, respectively, had been reported in the crizotinib, and the chemotherapy arms) and mainly related to the underlying disease in similar proportions: (40/49: 81.6%) for crizotinib (15/17: 88.2%) for chemotherapy and (26/30: 86.6%) for chemotherapy with crossover to study 1005.

One death in the crizotinib arm was reported as related to study treatment toxicity (ILD) compared to none in the chemotherapy arm. . Considering the chemotherapy treatment, all the study treatment toxicity events were observed only in 2 patients after crossover to crizotinib (pneumonitis (1) and a non informative data as the cause of death reported as 'docetaxel and PF1066 [crizotinib]').

Of note, in the previous results of study 1007 submitted: 3 deaths (2.3%) were considered related to crizotinib (Arrhythmia, Interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis), compared to one death (0.6%) considered related to chemotherapy (Sepsis). In addition, 2 deaths in the crizotinib arm (Death and Sudden death), initially considered non drug related are being re-evaluated for possible treatment relatedness. and an additional case of fatal heptotoxicity related to crizotinib was received at the French agency after date of data-cut-off of the top line summary.  However, no difference is observed in global deaths reporting between crizotinib and chemotherapy arms.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

In Study 1001, a total of 58 (38.9%) ALK-positive RP2D NSCLC patients experienced SAEs, of these, 9 (6.0%) had 10 SAEs considered related to crizotinib treatment.

In Study 1005, 126 (28.7%) patients experienced SAEs, of these, 29 patients (6.6%) had SAEs considered related to crizotinib.

In Study 1007, of the 172 patients treated with crizotinib, 64 (37.2%) had SAEs of whom, 20 (11.6%) had treatment related SAEs according to preliminary review by the Applicant.

Treatment related SAEs, were Interstitial lung disease (4), Pneumonia (2), pulmonary embolism (1), elevated transaminases (2), hepatotoxicity (1) and neutropenia (2) All other treatment-related SAEs, included but were not limited to Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, malaise, Renal cyst.

Of the 171 patients treated with chemotherapy, 40 (23.4%) had SAEs of whom, 24 (14%) had treatment related SAEs. These related SAEs were mainly related to haematological toxicity.

In Study 1014, 4 of the 19 patients treated with crizotinib had SAEs, of which 1 was considered treatment-related (oesophagitis).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the 63 patients in the RP2D cohort with tumours other than molecularly defined ALK-positive or ALK-negative NSCLC with data available for the updated report, there were 27 SAEs, 5 of which were considered related to crizotinib treatment, and 10 of which were associated with permanent discontinuation from crizotinib treatment.

## Immunological events

One single case of autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in patient treated with crizotinib for clear cell sarcoma. The event was considered treatment-related.

## Laboratory findings

Lymphopenia, neutropenia, ALT elevation, and hyponatraemia were the most common Grade 3 or Grade 4 abnormalities. Neutropenia and ALT elevation have been identified previously as AEs commonly associated with crizotinib use. Two febrile neutropenia events were reported in study 1005.

Four additional cases of liver disorders from study 1005 have been reported after the data cut-off date: three of them were potential Hy's law cases.

In both studies, there was no evidence of clinically significant effects of crizotinib on vital signs, or on PR or QRS complex intervals. Decreases in pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure were not clinically meaningful as evidenced by low frequencies of Bradycardia and Hypotension reported as AEs.

Overall, lymphopenia, neutropenia, ALT elevation, and hyponatraemia were the most common Grade 3 or Grade 4 abnormalities.

Electrocardiogram abnormalities involved bradycardia and QT prolonged.

## Safety in special populations

Experimental data did show reproductive toxicity (decrease in foetus body weight and increased postimplantation loss). In addition, even if according to ICH S9, fertility and early embryonic development studies are not warranted for marketing authorisation, effects on reproductive organs were seen in repeat-dose toxicity indicating a potential impairment of male and female fertility. Both men and women should therefore seek advice for fertility preservation before treatment.

Genotoxicity studies also suggest an aneugenic potential of crizotinib. Genotoxicity leads to a safety concern on embryo-foetal development in relation to effects on DNA gametes, including the case of male treated patients, as a partner of women of childbearing potential.

There is no clinical experience in pregnant women. However a treatment-emergent SAE of spontaneous abortion has been reported by the applicant (study 1001). Crizotinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant while receiving crizotinib, or treated male patients as partners of a pregnant women, should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy, and for at least 90 days after completing therapy

It is not known whether crizotinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, mothers should be advised to avoid breast-feeding while receiving crizotinib.

The applicant provided the analysis of safety data by age groups, sex and race. Overall, 308 patients were &lt;65-year old and 48 ≥ 65 year-old. The rate of AEs is variable but the number of patients in two

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

groups is rather low to reveal specific crizotinib related safety issues in any of these age groups, especially elderly patients.

Oedema peripheral (30% vs 18.6), dizziness (25% vs 13.6%) and ALT increased (18.3% vs 10.2%) were more frequent in female compared to male. Some grade 1 or 2 AEs were reported more or less frequently in Asian patients (77) compared to non-Asian (178 patients). However, grade 3/4 events were more frequently reported in non-Asian population.

No clinically significant effect of food on crizotinib exposure has been reported.

There have been no known cases of crizotinib overdose. No information regarding abuse of crizotinib is available.

Crizotinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, caution should be exercised when driving or operating machines as patients may experience vision disorder, dizziness, or fatigue while taking crizotinib.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

In clinical studies, prolonged QT interval was observed with crizotinib. Therefore, the concomitant use of crizotinib with medicinal products known to prolong QT interval or medicinal products able to induce Torsades de pointes (e.g., class IA [quinidine, disopyramide] or class III [e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide], methadone, cisapride, moxifloxacine, antipsychotics, etc.) should be carefully considered. A monitoring of the QT interval should be made in case of combinations of such medicinal products as reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Bradycardia has been reported during clinical studies; therefore, use crizotinib with caution due to the risk of excessive bradycardia when used in combination with other bradycardic agents (e.g., non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, beta-blockers, clonidine, guanfacine, digoxin, mefloquine, anticholinesterases, pilocarpine), as reflected in  section 4.5 of the SmPC.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In study 1001, 19 of the 149 ALK-positive NSCLC patients in the RP2D cohort (12.8%) had AEs that were associated with permanent discontinuation from treatment, of whom, 3 patients (2.0%) had treatment-related AEs associated with permanent discontinuation: Pneumonitis (2 patients, 1.6%) and ALT increased (1 patient, 0.8%).

In study 1005, 53 patients (12.1%) had AEs that were associated with permanent discontinuation from treatment. Fourteen (14) patients (3.2%) permanently discontinued treatment for AEs considered related to treatment: Pneumonitis (4 patients); ALT increased (3 patients); Nausea, Dyspnoea, Hypokalaemia, Colitis, Death, Pulmonary Embolism, and Cytolytic hepatitis (1 patient each).

In study 1007, 30 patients (17%) in the crizotinib arm and 23 (14%) in the chemotherapy arm had AEs associated with permanent discontinuation from treatment. The most common all causality AEs associated with permanent treatment (crizotinib vs chemotherapy) discontinuation were related to:

- respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: 9 (including ILD (3) and pulmonary embolism (2)) vs 3;

- general disorders and administration site conditions: 7 (including death (1), sudden death (1), disease progression (5) vs 3 (asthenia (2), fatigue (1));

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- blood and lymphatic system disorders: 0 vs. 4 (anemia (1), febrile neutropenia (3));

- and cardiac disorders: 1 (Arrhythmia) vs. 4 (cardiomyopathy (1), left ventricular dysfunction (1) and pericardial effusion (2)).

In addition, 3 patients had permanent discontinuation from crizotinib due to 5 hepatic events compared to none in chemotherapy arm.

Less discontinuations were considered related to crizotinib than to chemotherapy, 11 (6%) and 17 (10%), respectively. This could be due to bias, as this study was an open label study.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Clinical safety data are still mainly based on one pivotal study (1001) and one ongoing supportive phase 2 study (1005).

Top line preliminary efficacy and safety comparative results from the open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial (A8081007) were provided during the review procedure of the application.

Safety experience from 6 Phase 1 Biopharmaceutical and Clinical Pharmacology studies in healthy volunteer subjects receiving 1 to 4 single doses of crizotinib was briefly mentioned in the dossier.

Only data on SAEs and deaths for patients in the crizotinib arm from the ongoing first-line phase 3 study, A8081014, have been included in the submitted documentation.

Study A8081014 is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing oral crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg BID to pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin as firstline treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.

A total of 832 subjects have been treated with crizotinib in the studies included in the safety analysis: 588 patients with ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (149 from pivotal study 1001; 439 from supportive study 1005), receiving the recommended dosage of crizotinib 250 mg orally BID; 134 patients with advanced cancer enrolled in Study 1001 but who did not represent the target population and/or did not receive the recommended dosing regimen; and 110 healthy volunteers enrolled in clinical pharmacology studies.

The median treatment duration was 43.1 and 15.7 weeks in studies 1001 and 1005, respectively with 82 patients (14%) treated for more than one year (65 patients in study 1001 and 17 patients in study 1005).

The updated 30-day and 60-day all-cause mortality in the 588 patients in the all ALK-positive NSCLC patient population at the RP2D across Studies 1001 and 1005 were 3.6% and 5.1% respectively. Seventy-one (71) of the 588 patients (12.1%) have died while on study (within 28 days of the last dose of study drug). Majority of deaths (83%) were related to disease progression.

A total of 7 deaths are considered as related to crizotinib (taking into account study 1007): pneumonitis (2), interstitial lung disease (1), cardiac arrest and respiratory failure (1), treatment toxicity (1), unknown cause (1), pulmonary embolism (1) while the applicant mentioned 2 cases of study treatment toxicity.

Moreover, 2 fatal cases of liver disorders, related to study drug, in study 1005 were reported after the cut-off date, one case of liver failure in a 40 year-old female and one case of liver injury in a 57 yearold male. One additional fatal case of liver disorder, related to crizotinib in study 1007 was reported after the data cut-off date for the Top line Summary (73 year old female). The applicant will submit a safety review of hepatic disorders in Q1 2013.

A total of 147 (98.7%) and 419 (95.4%) patients experienced 1972 and 3742 adverse events in studies 1001 and 1005, respectively.

Hepatic enzyme elevations collected as laboratory abnormality and AE were frequently reported (17.4% ALT increased, 14.1% AST increased, 7.4% blood phosphatase alkaline in pivotal study). Cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome have occurred during crizotinib treatment in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials. Concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN without elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% patients in clinical trials. Increases to Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation were observed in 6% of patients in Study 1001 and 8% of patients in Study 1005. Grade 3 and 4 elevations were generally asymptomatic and reversible upon dosing interruption. Patients usually resumed treatment at a lower dose without recurrence; however, 1 patient from Study 1001 (&lt;1%) and 3 patients from Study 1005 (1%) required permanent discontinuation from treatment. Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. Crizotinib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.8 of the SmPC). Liver function tests should be monitored including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin twice a month during the first two months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for Grades 2, 3 or 4 elevation. For patients who develop transaminase elevations, dose adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

The risk of QT prolonged is expected regarding the risk with other tyrosine kinases and with regards to non-clinical data. In addition, PK/PD analysis suggested a relationship between crizotinib plasma concentration and QTc. QTcF intervals was ≥ 500 msec on at least 1 post baseline assessment in 4 of 308 patients (1.3%) who received crizotinib 250 mg BID in Studies 1001 and 1005.  Maximum change in QTcF was ≥ 60 msec in 10 of 289 patients (3.5%) in these 2 studies. According to the updated data, in studies 1001 and 1005, 4 patients experienced an AE of ECG QT interval prolonged, 3 events were considered as drug related. In phase 3 study 1007, 2 deaths due to cardiac disorders (Arrhythmia, sudden death) were reported. In addition the following Grade 3/4 AES were reported in the crizotinib arm: 6 'Electrocardiogram QT prolonged' (4 crizotinib related) and 5 Syncope (2 crizotinib related).

QTc prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. Torsade de Pointes) or sudden death. The risk of QTc prolongation may be increased in patients concomitantly taking antiarrhythmics and in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances (e.g., secondary to diarrhoea or vomiting). crizotinib be administered with caution to patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval. When using crizotinib in these patients, periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered.

One PAS study was proposed by the applicant to collect long-term safety data on crizotinib, to characterise the safety of crizotinib in subgroups of patients (e.g., elderly, patients with brain metastasis, renal and hepatic impairment), and further identify risk factors associated with QTc prolongation events (e.g., Torsade de pointes) in real world conditions. The Applicant committed to amend study A8081014 to include additional ECG time points and central blinded manual review. Furthermore, events such as sudden death, cardiac disorders, arrhythmias, syncope, dizziness, bradycardia, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, should be further presented and discussed together with the assessment potential QT prolongation (and the risk of electrolyte unbalances linked to important frequency of diarrhea and vomiting).

Crizotinib has been associated with severe, life-threatening, or fatal treatment-related pneumonitis in clinical trials with a frequency of 4 in 386 (1%) patients across Studies 1001 and 1005. All of these cases occurred within 2 months after the initiation of treatment. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Treatment with crizotinib should be withheld if pneumonitis is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

suspected. Other causes of pneumonitis should be excluded, and the treatment should be permanently discontinued in patients diagnosed with treatment-related pneumonitis.

Physiopathological crizotinib data are compatible with ophthalmological toxicity of the drug. Vision disorder occurred in patients treated with crizotinib. This event was reported as mild (96%), moderate (3%), and severe (&lt;1%) with median times to onset of 15 and 6 days in studies 1001 and 1005, respectively. None of the patients required dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation from crizotinib treatment for vision disorder; however 1 patient in study 1001 and 3 patients in study 1005 had temporary treatment discontinuation. Ophthalmological evaluation should be considered if vision disorder persists or worsens in severity.

Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation were the most commonly reported gastrointestinal events, and were primarily Grade 1 in severity. Supportive care for gastrointestinal events may include standard antiemetic and/or antidiarrhoeal or laxative medicinal products.

In case of non haematologic toxicities the following dose modifications are recommended:

In study 1001, decreases to Grade 3 or 4 leukocytes and platelets were each observed in patients at frequencies of &lt;3%, and decreases to Grade 3 or 4 neutrophils and lymphocytes were observed at a frequency of 10% and 14%, respectively. In study 1005, decreases to Grade 3 or 4 leukocytes were observed in patients at a frequency of 3%, decreases to Grade 3 or 4 neutrophils were observed at a frequency of 9%, decreases to Grade 3 or 4 lymphocytes were observed at a frequency of 14%, and decreases to Grade 3 or 4 platelets were observed at a frequency of &lt;1%. Complete blood counts including differential white blood cell counts should therefore be monitored, with more frequent repeat testing if Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities are observed, or if fever or infection occurs.

In case of haematologic toxicities, the following dose modifications are recommended:

Two cases of photosensitivity grade 1 have occurred. Photosensitivity is therefore included as a potential risk in the RMP (see section 2.7).

## Comparative safety data: Study A8081007 Top line summary

No new safety signal emerged from Study 1007 regarding crizotinib safety profile. However, the safety profile of crizotinib does not seem similar, in terms of AEs frequency/grading and in terms of AEs nature, compared to the safety profile of Chemotherapy.

All causality Grade 3-4 AEs or Treatment related Grade 3-4 AEs preferred term or clustered term with a frequency at least 2-fold greater in the crizotinib arm group compared with 'chemotherapy' group were Hepatic disorders (elevated transaminase, hepatotoxicity), Respiratory disorders (Pulmonary embolism, Interstitial lung disease) and Cardiac Disorders (Electrocardiogram QT Prolonged, syncope).

All causality/Treatment related Grade 3-4 AEs PT reported with a frequency 2-fold greater in the chemotherapy arm compared with crizotinib were related to haematological toxicity, fatigue, stomatitis.

More hepatic events were reported in the crizotinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. No Grade 4 hepatic events were reported in chemotherapy arm. It has to be noted that an additional fatal case of hepatic failure (Hy's Law case) considered as related to crizotinib has been reported to the French Agency after the date of data cut-off of this Top Line Summary report. It concerns a patient enrolled in the 1007 study.

Only 33 % of the deaths reported are discussed in the top line summary. These data are insufficient to conclude on any difference between crizotinib and chemotherapy arms.

## Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA

In order to further characterise the safety profile of crizotinib, the applicant should submit updated safety (SAEs and deaths) data for both studies 1001 and 1005. The applicant should also submit the CSR of study 1007 which will provide comparative safety data against chemotherapy. Finally, in view of the hepatic events observed with crizotinib, the applicant should submit the safety review of main (severe) hepatic disorders from all available main studies of crizotinib (1001, 1005 and 1007) at the same time as the full CSR of Study 1007 by Q1 2013.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The most common any grade adverse reactions (&gt;20%) across studies 1001 and 1005 were vision disorder, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, oedema, constipation, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions ( ≥ 3%) across both studies were increased ALT and neutropenia.

Crizotinib has been associated with severe, life-threatening, or fatal treatment-related pneumonitis and cases of QTc interval prolongation which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g., Torsade de Pointes) or sudden death have been observed.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome has also occurred. This event is of particular concern and the applicant has been requested to submit safety review of hepatic disorders by Q1 2013.

Based on preliminary data from study 1007, Crizotinib seems more toxic than standard chemotherapy with greater hepatotoxicity, pneumotoxicity and cardiotoxicity, potentially life threatening and fatal as well as more GI disorders that may impact treatment adherence. The main toxicity observed with chemotherapy was haematological toxicity. However no difference is observed in global deaths reporting between crizotinib and chemotherapy arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, these preliminary data are not complete and validated. Therefore, the applicant has committed to provide final safety data of studies 1001, 1005 and 1007, once available, and to update the SmPC accordingly..

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a conditional MA:

The Applicant should submit the safety review of main (severe) hepatic disorders from all available main studies of crizotinib (1001, 1005 and 1007) at the same time as the full CSR of Study 1007 by Q1 2013.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

- The Applicant should submit the CSR of Study A8081012 'A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Crizotinib in Advanced Cancer Patients.' By Q1 2014 and the Post-Authorisation Safety Study (3-year post-approval multinational database study in Europe to further characterize the safety of crizotinib in patients, including those with hepatic impairment, in real-world settings) by Q2 2018.

- The Applicant should present the results of a step-wise investigation in patients with severe and endstage renal impairment is agreed. Single dose finding should be provided and the need of repeated dose investigation, depending upon single dose findings will be further discussed when single dose data are assessed by Q2 2013 .

- The Applicant should submit a definite assessment of the effect of age for the main studies A8081001, A8081005, A8081007 according to Population Modelling Analysis Plan at the time of submission of the study report for the pivotal study A8081007 by Q1 2013.

- The applicant should submit DDI studies with ketoconazole or rifampin at steady-state in order to allow defining dosing adjustments in case of co-administration by Q3 2015.

- The Applicant should amend study A8081014 to include additional ECG time points and central blinded manual review. Furthermore, events such as sudden death, cardiac disorders, arrhythmias, syncope, dizziness, bradycardia, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, should be further presented and discussed together with the assessment potential QT prolongation (and the risk of electrolyte unbalances linked to important frequency of diarrhea and vomiting) by Q1 2013.

- The Applicant should submit the results of the PASS study A8081038 (to estimate the incidence rate and incidence proportion over a 3-year period of observation for hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis/ILD, QTc prolongation related events, bradycardia, and visual disorder among lung cancer patients receiving crizotinib prescriptions) by Q2 2018.

- The Applicant should submit the results of the visual effect substudy as part of Study A8081001 by Q2 2014.

Women of childbearing potential should be advised ot avoid becoming pregnant while receiving crizotinib. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy, and for at least 90 days after completing therapy. Crizotinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are no data in pregnant women using crizotinib. If crizotinib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient or their partner becomes pregnant while receiving crizotinib, then the patient or their partner should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. It is not known whether crizotinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, mothers should be advised to avoid breast-feeding while receiving crizotinib (see Section 5.3). Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with crizotinib (see Section 5.3). Both |

The following additional risk minimisation activities were required.

The MAH should ensure that, at launch and thereafter, all Healthcare Professionals who are expected to use and/or prescribe XALKORI are provided with an educational pack.

The educational pack should contain the following:

1. Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
2. Educational material for Healthcare Professionals.
3. Patient brochure including a Patient Alert Card (text as agreed by the CHMP).

The educational material for Healthcare Professionals should contain the following key elements:

1. XALKORI  prolongs  the  QTc  interval  which  may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  for  ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. Torsade de Pointes) or sudden death.
2. The risk of QTc prolongation may be increased in patients concomitantly taking antiarrhythmics and  in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances (e.g., secondary to diarrhoea or vomiting).
3. XALKORI should be administered with caution to patients:
- a. Who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation.
- b. Who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval.
4. The  need  for  a  periodic  monitoring  with  electrocardiograms  and  electrolytes  should  be considered when using XALKORI in these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5. Patients who develop a grade 3 QTc prolongation should stop taking XALKORI until recovery to Grade ≤ 1, then resume at 200 mg twice daily.
6. Patients who develop a grade 4 QTc prolongation should stop taking XALKORI permanently.
7. That XALKORI may cause vision disorders, including diplopia, photopsia, blurred vision, visual impairment, and vitreous floaters.
8. Ophthalmological  evaluation  should  be  considered  if  vision  disorder  persists  or  worsens  in severity.
9. The  concomitant  use  of  XALKORI  with  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors/inducers  and  CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices should be avoided.
10. The need to counsel patients about the risk of prolonged QTc and vision disorders and inform them of what symptoms and signs to be aware of and the actions to take.
11. The role and use of the Patient Alert Card.

## 2.8. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

The initial Application/indication (treatment of previously treated ALK- positive advanced NSCLC) was supported  by  the  results  of  two  uncontrolled  clinical  trials  evaluating  ORR  as  the  primary  efficacy endpoint. No controlled study was available.  Preliminary Top-line selected results of a controlled study (1007) have recently also been made available. These data are therefore considered supportive at this stage as the full clinical study report is not available.

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

A high ORR and PFS has been observed with crizotinib in the 2 phase I/II uncontrolled studies, and are supported by the preliminary Top-line results of the phase III comparative study (1007).

ORR, DR and PFS are mature for both uncontrolled studies. Response rates and PFS seem important, are concordant between studies and durable, with an updated ORR of 60% and 53% for previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC RE population in Study A8081001 and A8081005 respectively, and  an  updated  median  DRs  of  48.1  weeks  and  42.9  weeks  respectively.  Updated  PFS  were  9.2 months  and  8.5  months  respectively.  These  data  allow  to  establish  a  relevant  clinical  benefit  of crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC patients and seem to exceed second-line historical ORR controls from unselected  advanced  NSCLC  patients  and  the  ORRs  from  prior  treatment  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC patients.

Preliminary results of the comparative study 1007 and updated results from studies 1001 and 1005 therefore indicate that crizotinib has a positive clinically meaningful benefit (PFS, ORR, DR) as a single agent in previously pre-treated patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC (mainly adenocarcinomas)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Moreover,  Applicant's  selected  top-line  results  of  the  randomized  controlled  phase  III  trial  in  pretreated  ALK-positive  NSCLC  (study  1007)  have  been  provided.  According  to  the  data  presented, crizotinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant additional improvement in PFS of 4.7 months over second line chemotherapy pemetrexed-docetacel with 7.7 months (95% CI: 6.0, 8.8)  with  crizotinib  compared  to  3.0  (95%  CI:  2.6,  4.3)  months  in  the  pemetrexed-docetaxel chemotherapy arm respectively, HR 0.487 (95% CI: 0.371, 0.638), p-value &lt;0.0001).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The evidence in favour of the use of crizotinib in pre-treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients is based on results of a phase I-II study and supportive data from a phase II study. No full study report from randomized controlled studies is available at present. These results must be confirmed by more robust data (full study report) from the prospective comparative study (1007) and updated (full study report including updated OS) data from the 2 uncontrolled studies.

The pharmacokinetic characterisation of crizotinib has some deficiencies; effect of hepatic impairment and effect of severe renal impairment on crizotinib PK/PD and safety; reasons/impact for differences in exposure in Asian and drug-drug interactions; insufficient information in patients over 65 years of age. These deficiencies can be resolved post approval with the provision of additional data as reflected in section 2.7.

Additional data are needed in order to fully address the impact of crizotinib on QTc prolongation/heart rate reduction and should be correlated to AEs/SAES/deaths. The QTc assessment will be included in study A8081014.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most common adverse reactions observed in both studies (1001 and 1005) were vision disorders (visual impairment, vision blurred, vitreous floaters, and visual field defect) and GI disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation).

The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-4  adverse  reactions  included  increased  ALT.  Hepatic  enzyme elevations  were  frequently  reported  and  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Additional cases of liver disorders have been reported from study 1005 and 1007 including Hy's law cases and death.

As expected with some Tyrosine kinase targeting drugs, crizotinib has been associated with study-drug related pneumonitis/ ILD (including pneumonitis with fatal outcome).

Cardiac disorders including QT prolongation, bradycardia, syncope, dizziness, sudden death have also been observed during the conducted studies.

Most  of  the  decreased  in  neutrophil  count  was  mild  in  severity.  However,  grade  3  and  grade  4 neutropenia were common.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Results of study 1001 are based on a very limited population and limited follow-up and follow-up is even more limited for study 1005.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  longer  follow-up  and  comparative  data  are  necessary  in  order  to  better  characterise  the  clinical impact, incidence and severity as well as risk factors for occurrence of QTc prolongation/bradycardia, liver  toxicity  and  pneumonitis/  ILD.  The  applicant  will  therefore  conduct  a  post-authorisation  Safety Study (see section 2.7 RMP).

The Applicant will provide final results for the clinical studies included in the dossier. An analysis should be conducted separately for each clinical study. Pooled safety data in particular for events of interest, should  also  be  presented  (including  analyses  according  to  potential  factors  that  could  lead  to  overexposure).

Hepatotoxicity was identified as an important risk, the Applicant will provide a specific safety review of main (severe) hepatic disorders, especially severe hepatic cases from all available studies (including 1001, 1005, 1007).

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Crizotinib  is  intended  as  a  new  target  therapy  for  pre-treated  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC.  No specific therapy for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC is available at present.

The effect size, measured in terms of ORR and PFS data of crizotinib from the 2 uncontrolled studies and preliminary  data  of  the  comparative  phase  III  trial  is  large,  consistent  and  potentially  clinically significant when compared to results achieved after one or two lines of standard therapy in the general advanced  NSCLC  patient  population.    In  addition,  disease  control  seems  to  be  maintained  in  a significant percentage of the treated patient population for which results are available at present.

Moreover,  according  to  preliminary  data  of  the  comparative  phase  III  trial,  crizotinib  allowed  a statistically  and  clinically  relevant  additional  improvement  in  PFS  of  4.7  months  over  second  line chemotherapy pemetrexed-docetacel.

However, only preliminary data have been submitted in order to allow direct comparison of efficacy and safety of criotinib versus chemotherapy (permetrexed/docetaxel) and full clinical study reports are expected.

Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most common any grade adverse reactions (&gt;20%) across both studies were vision disorder, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, oedema, constipation, and  fatigue.  The  most  common  Grade  3  or  4  adverse  reactions  ( ≥ 3%)  across  both  studies  were increased ALT and neutropenia.

The observed effect of crizotinib has been mainly obtained in patients with ALK+ NSCLC and with an histology of adenocarcinoma. Very limited data are available to date in patients with an histology other than adenocarcinoma, but benefit in terms of ORR and DR appeared to be smaller (PFS not provided). This has been mentioned in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC and additional data/analyses are required in patients with ALK+ NSCLC and an histology other than adenocarcinoma.

The effect of crizotinib on other than ALK mutations is not known, and additional data are expected, but the effect on one mutation may not preclude approval on an other mutations whose efficacy has been demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit/risk of crizotinib in the proposed indication is considered positive.

Additional  data  (including  efficacy  and  safety)  will  be  needed  and  should  be  provided  Post-Approval (see Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures) within defined timeframes.

Preliminary  results  of  the  comparative  study  1007  and  updated  results  from  2  open  uncontrolled studies 1001 and 1005 indicate that crizotinib has a positive clinically meaningful benefit as a single agent in previously pre-treated patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

The benefit/risk of crizotinib in the proposed indication is considered positive based on the results of the uncontrolled studies and a statistically and clinical relevant additional improvement of median PFS of  4.7  months  provided  by  crizotinib  compared  to  second-line  chemotherapy  in  ALK-positive  NSCLC (based on Top-line preliminary results from study 1007).

Given that the comparative data (study 1007) are only selected top-line results and the study report has not been made available, only a conditional Approval can be granted and these interesting results must be confirmed by more robust data (full study report) of the direct prospective comparative study (1007) and updated (OS) data from the 2 uncontrolled studies.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Crizotinib  is  intended  as  a  new  target  therapy  for  pre-treated  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC.  No specific therapy for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC is available at present.

In general, it is considered that the identification of a biomarker that allows the selection of a patient population with a poor prognosis and responsive to the identified target treatment is a promising and valuable  therapeutic  approach  to  disease.  However,  no  comparison  between  ALK-positive  NSCLC natural  history  and  treatment  response  and  that  of  unselected  NSCLC  was  performed.  Thus  no evidence  of  a  more  aggressive  disease  or  unmet  medical  therapeutic  need  in  ALK  positive  NSCLC compared to the general population of NSCLC is available.

Preliminary results of the comparative study 1007 and updated results from studies 1001 and 1005 indicate that crizotinib has a positive clinically meaningful benefit as a single agent in mostly previously pre-treated patients with ALK-positive advanced Non Small Cell adenocarcinomas.

The  CHMP  considered  the  granting  of  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation.    Xalkori  aims  at  the treatment of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases and falls within the scope of Commission Regulation  507/2006  on  the  conditional  marketing  authorisation.  The  Committee  found that  although  comprehensive clinical data  referring  to  the  efficacy  of  the  medicinal  product  had  not been supplied, all of the following requirements were met:

-  The  risk-benefit  balance  of  the  medicinal  product,  as  defined  in  Article  1(28a)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC, is positive.

Based on the data presented to date, crizotinib has shown important activity with an ORR of 60.3% (95%  CI:  51.0%,  69.1%).  The  median  PFS  was  9.2  months  (95%  CI:  7.3  months,  12.7  months; N=125), with a 1-year survival probability of 72%. The crizotinib antitumor activity observed in Study A8081001  is  supported by preliminary data from study A8081005,  an  ongoing,  multicenter, multinational, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study in patients with previously treated ALK-positive advanced  NSCLC  and  top  line  results  from  the  ongoing  comparative  study  A8081007.  The  clinical results  obtained  to  date  support  the  clinical  benefit  of  single  agent  crizotinib  in  patients  with  ALKpositive advanced NSCLC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data.

Randomized Phase 3 studies are ongoing in second-line NSCLC (Study A8081007) and in first-line nonsquamous NSCLC (Study A8081014). As of June 2011, Study A8081007, which will confirm the clinical benefit  of  crizotinib  in  previously  treated  patients  with  ALK-positive  advanced  NSCLC,  was  70% enrolled, and Study A8081007 was completed in June 2012.

-  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled.

Although there are treatments available for NSCLC, there is very limited information on the efficacy of anticancer therapies in ALK-positive NSCLC.

-  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

To date, there are no therapies specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Molecularly targeted therapies such as crizotinib may offer patients an alternative therapeutic option.

The CHMP considered that the potential risks inherent in marketing Xalkori for the specific indication, while  additional,  more  comprehensive  data  will  be  available  in  the  future,  would  be  offset  by  the potential benefit to the patients. The CHMP agreed that the RMP for Xalkori in the approved indication was adequate to address any identified and unknown risks.

The CHMP concluded that all the requirements for the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation had been met.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Xalkori  in  the  treatment  of  adults  with  previously  treated  anaplastic lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)-positive  advanced  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  is  favourable,  and therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Risk Management System

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 3.2 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
-  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
-  at the request of the EMA

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

Prior to launch of the product in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall agree the content and format of the educational material with the National Competent Authority.

The MAH should ensure that, at launch and thereafter, all Healthcare Professionals who are expected to use and/or prescribe XALCORI are provided with an educational pack.

The educational pack should contain the following:

1. Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
2. Educational material for Healthcare Professionals.
3. Patient brochure including a Patient Alert Card (text as agreed by the CHMP).

The educational material for Healthcare Professionals should contain the following key elements:

1. XALKORI  prolongs  the  QTc  interval  which  may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  for  ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. Torsade de Pointes) or sudden death.
2. The risk of QTc prolongation may be increased in patients concomitantly taking antiarrhythmics and  in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances (e.g., secondary to diarrhoea or vomiting).
3. XALKORI should be administered with caution to patients:
- a. Who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation.
- b. Who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval.
4. The  need  for  a  periodic  monitoring  with  electrocardiograms  and  electrolytes  should  be considered when using XALKORI in these patients.
5. Patients who develop a grade 3 QTc prolongation should stop taking XALKORI until recovery to Grade ≤ 1, then resume at 200 mg twice daily.
6. Patients who develop a grade 4 QTc prolongation should stop taking XALKORI permanently.
7. That XALKORI may cause vision disorders, including diplopia, photopsia, blurred vision, visual impairment, and vitreous floaters.
8. Ophthalmological  evaluation  should  be  considered  if  vision  disorder  persists  or  worsens  in severity.
9. The  concomitant  use  of  XALCORI  with  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors/inducers  and  CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices should be avoided.

10. The need to counsel patients about the risk of prolonged QTc and vision disorders and inform them of what symptoms and signs to be aware of and the actions to take.
11. The role and use of the Patient Alert Card.

## Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Due date   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| In order to address the question of comparative benefit/risk (crizotinib vs. chemotherapy) in patients with non adenocarcinoma histology ALK positive NSCLC, the MAH must provide additional data/analyses, including comparative data from the comparative study (A8081007) in order to address the benefit/risk of crizotinib (PFS/OS/ORR/safety) versus chemotherapy in ALK positive NSCLC patients according to histology (adenocarcinoma versus other). | Q1 2013    |

## Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation

This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Due date   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The MAH should submit the CSR of study A8081007, expected in Q1 2013. The CSR should also include a detailed analysis of outcome on post-progression treatments in Study 1007 as well as efficacy and baseline data according to race (Caucasian/Asian) by treatment groups. | Q1 2013    |
| The MAH should submit updated safety (SAEs and deaths) and efficacy (PFS, OS) data for both studies 1001 and 1005. The Applicant should compare and explain potential differences in OS for crizotinib in the 3 studies (1001, 1005 and 1007).                               | Q1 2013    |
