## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Prepandrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. Prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted)

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

After mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains:

Split influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen * equivalent to:

A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) like strain used (PR8-IBCDC-RG2) 3.75 micrograms **

* propagated in eggs
- ** haemagglutinin

AS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DLα -tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams)

The suspension and emulsion vials once mixed form a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial.

## Excipient with known effect

The vaccines contains 5 micrograms thiomersal (see section 4.4).

For the full list of excipients see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection.

The suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid.

The emulsion is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus.

This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years onwards following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared with H5N1 subtype strains (see section 5.1).

Prepandrix should be used in accordance with official guidance.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults from the age of 18 years:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve months after the first dose for maximum efficacy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special population:

Based on very limited data, adults aged &gt;80 years may require a double dose of Prepandrix on an elected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune response (see section 5.1).

A complete vaccination course with Prepandrix consists of two doses.  However, in the event of an officially declared influenza pandemic, persons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of Prepandrix that contained HA antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the pandemic influenza strain may receive a single dose of Adjupanrix instead of two doses that are required in previously unvaccinated individuals.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Prepandrix in children aged less than 3 years and in children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years have not been established. No data are available.

There are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of an AS03adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and on administration of half a dose of the vaccine (i.e. 1.875 µg HA and half the amount of AS03 adjuvant) at 0 and 21 days in children aged 3 to 9 years.  See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass).

If a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs.

For instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine. See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1.

Immunisation should be postponed in subjects with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to thiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate).

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

Prepandrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with Prepandrix using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

There are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of influenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

Epidemiological studies relating to another AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Pandemrix H1N1, also manufactured in the same facility as Prepandrix), in several European countries have indicated an increased risk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated individuals. In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 1.4 to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 years have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data suggest that the excess risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination. There is currently no evidence to indicate that Prepandrix may be associated with a risk of narcolepsy.

Paediatric population Clinical data in children less than 6 years of age who received two doses of pandemic preparedness or zoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) indicate an increase in frequency of fever (axillary≥38°C) after the administration of the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) post-vaccination. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction There are no data on co-administration of Prepandrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are currently no data available on the use of Prepandrix in pregnancy.

An AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v has been administered to women in each trimester of pregnancy. Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200,000 women who have been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study.

Animal studies with Prepandrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity.

The use of Prepandrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary taking into account official recommendations.

## Breast-feeding

Prepandrix may be used in lactating women.

## Fertility

No fertility data are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

<!-- image -->

## Paediatric population

A clinical study (D-H5N1-009) evaluated the reactogenicity in children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age who received either two adult (i.e. 0.5 ml) doses or two half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) doses (21 days apart) of pandemic preparedness vaccine (H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 manufactured in Dresden, Germany).

A difference in the frequency of local and general solicited adverse reactions between half adult and adult doses was observed after each dose.  The administration of a second half adult or an adult dose did not enhance the reactogenicity, except for rates of general symptoms which were higher after the second dose, particularly for rates of fever in &lt;6 year olds. The per-dose frequency of adverse reactions was as follows:

| Adverse reactions   | 3-5 years   | 3-5 years   | 6-9 years   | 6-9 years   |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|

1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2 seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4fold increase in titre;

3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT.

A 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres was observed in 79.2% of subjects twenty-one days after the first dose, 95.8% twenty-one days after the second dose and 87.5% six months after the second dose.

In a second study, 49 subjects aged 18-60 years received two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 on days 0 and 21.  At day 42, the anti-HA antibody seroconversion rate was 98%, all subjects were seroprotected and the seroconversion factor was 88.6.  In addition, all subjects had neutralising antibody titres of at least 1:80.

## Administration of an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)

## Paediatric population

In a clinical study (D-Pan-H5N1-009), children aged 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years old received two doses of either a full (0.5 ml) or a half dose (0.25 ml) of an AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) at 0 and 21 days. At day 42, the anti-HA antibody responses were as follows:

In another clinical study (D-Pan-H5N1-038), 387 subjects aged 18-60 years received 1 dose of AS03adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 36 months after they had received two doses of A/Vietnam/1194/2004. The seroprotection rate, booster seroconversion rate and booster factor against A/Indonesia/5/2005 21 days after booster vaccination was 100%, 99.7% and 123.8, respectively. Other information The anti-HA and neutralising antibody responses to A/Indonesia/05/2005 elicited by AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from this same strain have been shown to be comparable with the immune responses to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 elicited by AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from this same strain.  Therefore, the data that have been generated with AS03adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 are considered to be relevant to the use of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005. In clinical studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) in subjects 18-60 years old, the anti-haemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody responses were as follows: anti-HA antibody Medicinal Product no longer authorised

3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT.

Although an adequate immune response was achieved at day 42 following two administrations of a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), a higher response was observed following two administrations of a double dose of vaccine.

Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Very limited data in seronegative subjects &gt;80 years of age (N=5) showed that no subject achieved seroprotection following two administrations of a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). However, following two administrations of a double dose of vaccine, the seroprotection rate at day 42 was 75%.

Subjects of D-Pan-H5N1-010 were followed up for persistence of the immune response.  The seroprotection rates 6, 12 and 24 months after vaccination were as follows:

| anti-HA antibody      | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   | Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004   |

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

1 Geometric Mean Titre 2 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titre 3 % of subjects reaching a serum neutralising antibody titre of at least 1:80 Information from non-clinical studies: The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models. In each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an AS03 adjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 (NIBRG-14). Doses of 15, 5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) or phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge.

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). The reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted using Prepandrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine:

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by means of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be available, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained in upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.
3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed vaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the vaccine.
4. The volume of the Prepandrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml.  The vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2).
5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23G.
7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes) before each withdrawal.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 1. What Prepandrix is and what it is used for

## What Prepandrix is and what it is used for

Prepandrix is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 years old. It is intended to be given before or during the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus.

Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but may be more serious.

## How Prepandrix works

When a person is given the vaccine, the body's natural defence system (immune system) produces its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.  None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

As with all vaccines, Prepandrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Prepandrix

Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Prepandrix should not be given:

- if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts such as: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or sodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
- if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be vaccinated with Prepandrix.

Do not have Prepandrix if any of the above apply to you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Prepandrix:

- if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate.
- if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be poor.
- if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with Prepandrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Prepandrix.
- if you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily.

Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having Prepandrix.  This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

## Children

If your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after the second dose, especially temperature over 38°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each dose are recommended.

## Other medicines and Prepandrix

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system.  Prepandrix can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor.

Prepandrix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs to happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm.  Any side effects that happen may be more serious.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you receive this vaccine

## Driving and using machines

Some side effects listed in Section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. It is best to see how Prepandrix affects you before you try these activities.

## Prepandrix contains thiomersal

Prepandrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## Prepandrix contains sodium and potassium

Prepandrix contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per dose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How Prepandrix is given

- From 18 years onwards: you will receive two doses of Prepandrix. The second dose should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve months after the first dose.
- From 80 years onwards:  you may receive two double injections of Prepandrix. The first two injections should be given at the elected date and the two other injections should preferably be given 3 weeks after.

## Use in children

In a clinical study, children 3 to 9 years of age have received either two adult (0.5 ml) or two half adult (0.25 ml) doses of a similar vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  Your doctor will decide the appropriate dose for your child.

Your doctor or nurse will give you Prepandrix.

- They will give Prepandrix as an injection into a muscle.

## Additional side effects in children

In a clinical study, children 3 to 9 years of age have received either two adult (0.5 ml) or two half adult (0.25 ml) doses of a similar vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  The frequency of side effects was lower in the group of children who received half of the adult dose.  There was no increase after the second dose whether the children received half of the adult or the adult dose, except for some side effects which were higher after the second dose, particularly for rates of fever in &lt; 6 years old children.

In other clinical studies where children 6 months to 17 years received Prepandrix, increases in the frequency of some side effects (including injection site pain, redness and fever) were seen after the second dose in children aged less than 6 years.

The side effects listed below have happened with H1N1 AS03-containing vaccines. They may also happen with Prepandrix. If any of the side effects below occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately:

- Allergic reactions leading to a dangerously low blood pressure. If this is not treated, it may lead to shock.  Your doctors will know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment ready to use
- Fits
- Generalised skin reactions including urticaria (hives)

The side effects listed below have happened in the days or weeks after vaccination with other vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu.  These side effects may also happen with Prepandrix. If any of the side effects below occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately:

Very rare : may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people

- Problems with your brain and nerves such as inflammation of the central nervous system (encephalomyelitis), inflammation of nerves (neuritis) or a type of paralysis known as 'GuillainBarré Syndrome'.
- Inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis).  This can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems

Rare : may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people
