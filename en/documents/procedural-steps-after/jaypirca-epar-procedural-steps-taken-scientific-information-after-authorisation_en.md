| PSUR / EMA/PSUR/0000268970            | - - In view of available data on pirtobrutinib from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including cases with a close temporal relationship, including positive de-challenges and re-challenges (of which one case had multiple positive rechallenges), the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pirtobrutinib and hepatic enzyme increased is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pirtobrutinib should be amended accordingly. | 18/09/2025 |            | SmPC               | Variation. |
