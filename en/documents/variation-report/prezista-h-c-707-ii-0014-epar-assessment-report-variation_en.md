## 1. Introduction

This submission pertains to the Specific Obligation (SO2 003.2): The data of the 48 week (primary analysis) final study report from study TMC114-C214 (A randomised, controlled, open-label trial to compare  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  TMC114/RTV  versus  LPV/RTV  in  treatmentexperienced  HIV-1  infected  patients)  should  be  presented  within  a  Type  II  variation  to  extend  the indication to the patient population studied, as appropriate.

Prezista was granted a conditional marketing authorisation (MA), which means that the MAH has to fulfil a number of SOs prior to requesting the switching to a full MA. A conditional MA is valid for one year only and needs therefore to be renewed annually. During the first renewal the MAH already presented data of one of the specific obligations: The 48 week (primary analysis) final study report from Study TMC114-C214. The CHMP concluded then that the MAH should file a type II variation for  inclusion  of  'treatment  experienced'  patients  in  the  indication.  Up  until  now  Prezista  is  only indicated  for  highly  experienced  adult  patients  who  failed  more  than  one  regimen  containing  a protease inhibitor.

Study TMC114-C214 (TITAN) is a randomised, controlled, open-label multi centre trial to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of darunavir (DRV) administered together with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir (RTV) versus Kaletra (lopinavir; LPV co-formulated with RTV), both in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The duration of the trial is 96 weeks. The Week 48 primary analysis is submitted in support of the current variation. The week 96 final study report is due by March 2009.

The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV at 48 weeks, when administered in combination with an individualised OBR.

The MAH proposed the following extension and changes in the approved indication:

' PREZISTA,  co-administered  with  100 mg  ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1) infection in treatment-experienced highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI) .'…

The proposed posology is the same as for the presently approved indication. Consequential changes for section 5.1 of the SPC were also proposed.

## 2. Clinical aspects

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.1 Methods

## 2.1.1 Design

This  is  a  randomised,  controlled,  open-label  multi-centre  trial  to  compare  the  efficacy,  safety  and tolerability DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV (both in combination with an OBR) in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The duration of the trial is 96 weeks. Primary efficacy analyses for this trial were performed when all patients had reached 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier (cut-off date of 17-01-2007).

Treatment-experienced  (but  LPV-,  DRV-,  tipranavir  (TPV),  and  enfuvirtide  (ENF)-naïve),  HIV-1 infected patients with viral load &gt; 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml were to be randomised. Patients had to be on their current highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (HAART) for at least 12 weeks. At baseline, patients changed their HAART. An optimised background regimen (OBR) consisting of at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

least  2  antiretrovirals  (Nucleoside/Nucleotide  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors  (NRTIs)  with  or without Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)), and the patients were randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  a  new  Protease  Inhibitor  (PI)  regimen  consisting  of  either DRV/RTV (600/100 mg twice daily; b.i.d.) or LPV/RTV (400/100 mg b.i.d.).

The trial included a screening period of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.  Patients  meeting  the  per  protocol  defined  criteria  for  virological  failure  (DRV/RTV  or LPV/RTV group), or who experienced a grade 4 adverse event (AE) or confirmed grade 4 (or specific grade  3)  laboratory  abnormality 1 considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  LPV/RTV  treatment  could enter a rollover phase during which all patients received DRV/RTV.

The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV at 48 weeks, when administered in combination with an individualised OBR.

In  addition,  safety,  tolerability,  durability  of  efficacy,  quality  of  life,  pharmacokinetics,  effects  of covariates, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships over 96 weeks were assessed.

## · Study Participants

Patients had to be on their current highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (HAART) for at least 12  weeks.  Initially,  patients  on  a  structured  treatment  interruption  (STI)  of  at  least  4  weeks  were permitted  to  be  enrolled.  When  the  protocol  was  subsequently  amended,  patients  on  a  STI  were excluded.

Main inclusion criteria were:

- a. Male or female, aged 18 years or older.
- b. Treatment with current HAART regimen for ≥ 12 weeks.
- c. Pre-screening  and  screening  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  &gt;  1000  copies/ml  (assayed  by  RNA  PCR standard specimen procedure) on current HAART regimen.

Main exclusion criteria were:

- a. Active  AIDS-defining  illness  with  the  following  exceptions:  stable  cutaneous  Kaposi's sarcoma or wasting syndrome.
- b. Previous or current use of LPV, ENF, TPV or DRV.
- c. Use of any non-ARV investigational agents within 90 days prior to screening.
- d. Use of disallowed concomitant therapy.
- e. Pregnant or breastfeeding.
- f. Patients  with  clinical  or  laboratory  evidence  of  significantly  decreased  hepatic  function  or decompensation (i.e., liver insufficiency), irrespective of liver enzyme levels.
- g. Subjects with a grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality as defined by DAIDS grading tables, with the following exceptions unless clinical assessment foresaw an immediate health risk to the subject:
- Pre-existing diabetes, or asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 glucose elevations;
- Asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 triglyceride or cholesterol elevations.
- h. Previously  demonstrated  clinically  significant  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  of  the excipients of the study medication DRV, LPV or RTV.

## · Treatments

After the screening period in which patients continued HAART regimen (4 weeks) in both groups the treatments were as follows:

1 according to the DAIDS scale

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Control Group (LPV/RTV)

Treatment period (96 weeks):

OBR consisting of ≥ 2  ARVs (NRTIs with or without NNRTIs) and LPV/RTV 400/100  mg  b.i.d.  given  as  three  133.3/33.3-mg  capsules  or  two  200/50mg (Meltrex) tablets per intake once Meltrex tablets became available*.

In case an NNRTI such as EFV or nevirapine (NVP) was included in the OBR, to compensate  for  the  expected  decrease  in  plasma  levels  caused  by  the  coadministration, an increased LPV/RTV dosage was required:

- capsule formulation: LPV/RTV 533/133 mg (4 capsules) b.i.d.;
- tablet formulation: LPV/RTV 600/150 mg (3 tablets) b.i.d.

* Once a patient had switched from the capsule to the tablet formulation, the patient had to remain on the tablet formulation for the remaining treatment period. Patients randomised to LPV/RTV subsequent to availability of the tablets, initiated therapy with the tablet formulation.

## DRV/RTV ** Treatment period (96 weeks):

## Group

OBR consisting of ≥ 2  ARVs (NRTIs with or without NNRTIs) and DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. given as: two 300-mg tablets of DRV + one 100-mg capsule of RTV per intake.

- ** DRV/RTV to be taken orally within 30 minutes after completion of a meal, every 12 hours.

## · Endpoints

## Efficacy

The primary endpoint was virological response, defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml at Week 48 (using the TLOVR algorithm).

The TLOVR (time to loss of virological response) algorithm: response and loss of response had to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and patients who prematurely discontinued were considered as nonresponders  after  withdrawal.  Patients  with  intermittent  missing  viral  load  values  were  considered responders if the preceding and succeeding visits indicated response. In all other cases, intermittent values were imputed with non-response.

Secondary endpoints included:

- -Virological response defined as a viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml (using the TLOVR algorithm);
- -Virological  response  defined  as  a  decrease  in  viral  load  of ≥ 1.0  log 10 compared  with  the baseline value (TLOVR);
- -Immunologic parameters (CD4+ cell count (absolute and %) and CD8+ cell count (absolute and %).
- -Compare  the  Quality  of  Life  (QoL)  questionnaire  results.  QoL  questionnaire  had  to  be completed  by  the  patient  if  a  validated  translated  version  was  available.  The  Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI) QoL questionnaire was used.

## Safety

Safety  evaluations  included  AEs,  clinical  laboratory  tests,  biochemistry,  haematology,  coagulation tests, urine analysis, hepatitis, serology/viraemia, blood pressure, ECG readings (performed by central ECG Lab.). The ECG parameters analysed were heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval,  QTcB  (QT  interval  corrected  for  heart  rate  according  to  Bazett),  and  QTcF  (QT  interval corrected  for  heart  rate  according  to  Fridericia).  Vital  signs  included  pulse,  systolic  blood  pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Resistance determinations

Viral  pheno-  and  genotype  determinations  were  performed  by  Virco  BVBA,  by  means  of  the Antivirogram and VircoTYPE HIV-1, respectively.

The number of all protease (PR) mutations (primary PI mutations, PI resistance-associated mutations [RAMs],  DRV  RAMs,  and  LPV  RAMs  as  defined  by  the  International  AIDS  Society  (IAS)-USA guidelines, and PI mutations as defined by FDA [FDA-defined PI RAMs]), and number of all reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations (NRTI RAMs and NNRTI RAMs as defined by the IAS-USA guidelines, and  extended  NNRTI  RAMs)  were  tabulated  per  treatment  group.  The  incidence  of  all  individual protease and RT mutations was also tabulated.

The  FC  measured  by  Antivirogram  was  analysed,  and  categorised  into  'susceptible'  or  'resistant' based on cut-off values. A drug was considered susceptible if the FC was below or equal to the clinical cut-off when this was available (i.e., LPV, TDF, abacavir [ABC], TPV, and DRV), or below or equal to the biological cut-off otherwise.

The  FC  measured  by  VircoTYPE  was  also  analysed.  For  each  drug,  FC  was  categorised  into 'susceptible/maximal response', 'reduced response' and 'resistant/minimal response' based on cut-off values. To get an idea of the overall sensitivity to a class of drugs (NRTIs, PIs, NNRTIs, all ARV), a total sensitivity score was calculated as the sum of continuous phenotypic sensitivity scores (CPSS) of the individual drugs in the corresponding class.

## · Sample size

Assuming a virological response (confirmed viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml) rate of 70% at 48 weeks in both  treatment  arms,  229  patients  were  required  per  treatment  arm  to  establish  non-inferiority  of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV with a maximum allowable difference (delta) of 12%, with a 1-sided significance  level  of α =  0.025  and  80%  power.  To  account  for  an  approximate  10%  of  patients expected  to  be  excluded  for  the  on-protocol  analysis,  a  total  of  500  HIV-1  positive  patients  were needed  in  the  trial,  250  per  treatment  group.    However,  95  supplementary  patients  were  recruited compared to what was planned per protocol. This was due to the high rate of enrolment in particular during the last month of recruitment for the trial.

A delta of 12 % was considered appropriate, as it was small relative to observed differences between LPV/RTV and other active regimen or between other ARTs in a similar patient population.

## · Randomisation

Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV and according to stratification for:

- -use of an NNRTI in the OBR (yes/no) (due to potential interaction that impacts on PI plasma levels)
- -screening plasma viral load (&lt; 50,000 or ≥ 50,000 copies/ml)

A central randomisation system  was  used.  Randomisation  was done  by  a  predefined randomisation list,  constructed  via  random  permuted  blocks  to  ensure  balance  across  treatments  groups  in  each stratum of the 2 stratification factors.

## · Blinding

No blinding took place (open-label). The MAH justified this by referring to a very high pill burden for patients.

## · Statistical methods

The present primary efficacy analysis was performed when all patients in this trial reached Week 48 or discontinued  earlier.  All  statistical  tests  were  interpreted  at  the  1-sided  2.5%  or  equivalently  at  the 95% 2-sided significance level, unless specified differently.

The primary objective analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority in virological response defined as a confirmed plasma viral load of &lt; 400 copies/ml with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. versus LPV/RTV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

400/100 mg b.i.d. at Week 48 with a delta/ non-inferiority margin of 12%. Secondary objectives were to  evaluate  other  virological  and  immunologic  parameters,  to  compare  the  QoL,  and  to  evaluate pharmacokinetics, effects of covariates, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships, as well as safety and tolerability over time.

In  case  non-inferiority  was  concluded,  superiority  in  virological  response  defined  as  a  confirmed plasma viral load of &lt; 400 copies/ml with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. versus LPV/RTV 400/100 mg b.i.d. at Week 48 was assessed.

Two populations were defined for analysis:

- -Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population:  all  patients  who  where  randomised  and  who  received  trial medication, regardless of their compliance with the Protocol.
- -On-protocol (OP) population: all randomised patients who received trial medication, and who did not take any disallowed ARV medication as described in the Protocol for &gt; 1 week; in addition,  patients  who  were  not  compliant  for  the  trial  medication  for  &gt;  4  weeks  were excluded.

The primary population for testing the primary efficacy parameter was the OP population.

A  logistic  regression  model,  including  baseline  log 10 plasma  viral  load  as  covariate  and  use  of  an NNRTI in OBR ('as  used',  not  'as  stratified')  as  factor,  was  applied  to  estimate  the  difference  in virological  response  rate  (defined  as  a  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  &lt;  400  copies/ml  [TLOVR]) between  DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV. For this purpose, 95% 2-sided confidence intervals  (CIs)  were derived to compare treatment groups at all time points.

The  main  comparison  was  at  Week  48:  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  2-sided  CI  of  the  difference between DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV did not exceed -12% (for the OP population), non-inferiority of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV was concluded. In case non-inferiority was concluded and the lower limit of the 95% 2-sided CI of the difference between DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV exceeded 0 (for the ITT population), superiority of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV could be concluded. Additionally, a 95% CI of the difference in proportion of response between the 2 treatments was derived by means of a normal approximation of the binomial distribution.

In addition, several sensitivity analyses were performed e.g. observed response defined as a viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml (without requiring confirmation of response or loss of response), and NC = F (noncompleter  is  failure  analysis).  In  addition,  the  impact  on  the  conclusions  of  discontinuation  due  to patient wish (DCPW; non compliance, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up) was assessed by a last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  analysis,  i.e.,  the  last  observed  virological  response  was carried forward to Week 48 for patients discontinuing due to patient wish.

## 2.1.2 Outcomes

## · Patient disposition

Trial  TMC114-C214  enrolled  595  patients,  148  (25%)  patients  prematurely  discontinued.  For disposition of the patients see the following table.

N = number of patients; n = number of observations.

a One patient received both DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV.

b Additionally taking into account one patient who discontinued due to an AE (diarrhoea) after 17 January 2007, the cut-off date for the current analysis.

The overall discontinuation rate (for any reason) was lower in the DRV/RTV group (21%) than in the LPV/RTV group (29%). The majority of discontinuations was due to AE/HIV related events (7%), or virological  failure  (6%).  Discontinuation  due  to  AE/HIV-related  events  occurred  with  similar frequency  in  both  treatment  groups  (7%);  discontinuations  due  to  virological  failure  occurred  less frequently in the DRV/RTV group (1%) than in the LPV-RTV group (11%).

Up to Week 24, the number of patients in the trial was similar for both treatment groups; at Week 24, this was 91% for both treatment groups. At Weeks 36 and 48, the number of patients remaining in the trial  was  higher  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group:  87%  versus  83%,  and  85% versus 77%, respectively. This was mainly due to a higher rate of discontinuations due to virological failure in the LPV/RTV group compared to the DRV/RTV Group.

At the time of database cut-off, 79.2% of DRV/RTV-treated patients and 71.0% of LPV/RTV-treated control patients were still in the trial. The mean duration of exposure for the respective treatment groups was 53.5 and 51.5 weeks.

## Compliance

Compliance  was  generally  high  in  both  treatment  groups.    The  proportion  of  patients  with  DRV plasma concentrations below the detection limit was ≤ 5%, and the proportion of patients with LPV plasma concentrations below the detection limit was ≤ 6% at all time points.

N = number of patients; n = number of observations.

The  trial  included  patients  who  were  not  highly  ART-experienced.  This  ranged  from  patients  who were NNRTI (23.7%) or PI naïve (31.4%) to those who had been experienced to ≥ 2  PIs  (31.1%). Approximately half of the patients had received ≥ 4 previous NRTIs.  The median FC (fold change in EC50)  for  DRV  and  LPV  was  0.6  and  0.7,  demonstrating  a  relatively  low  overall  PI  resistance. At baseline 32.0% of the patients in trial TMC114-C214 had ≥ 1 primary PI mutation and 9.4% had 1 DRV resistance-associated  mutation  (RAM).    The  median  number  of  primary  PI  mutations  was  0 (range: 0 - 6); the median number of PI RAMs was 4 (range: 0 - 17). The median number of DRV RAMs and LPV RAMs was 0 (range: 0 - 5) and 1 (range: 0 - 11), respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no notable differences between the treatment groups with respect to susceptibility to PIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs at baseline, or with respect to the number of susceptible PIs, NRTIs, or NNRTIs used in the screening ART, or underlying OBR. Most patients (87.5%) were able to use ≥ 1 NRTIs in the OBR to which the virus was susceptible.

There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  treatment  groups  with respect to the ARV therapies used in the initial OBR. The overwhelming majority of patients (90%) used  only  NRTIs  in  the  OBR.  The  majority  of  patients  used  2  or  3  NRTIs  (69%  and  25%, respectively);  the  three  combinations  emtricitabine  (FTC)  and  tenofovir  (TDF)  (11%),  lamivudine (3TC) and zidovudine (AZT) (10%) and 3TC, TDF and AZT (12%) were most frequently used.

## Concomitant disease

In  addition  to  the  cases  of  co-infection  with  hepatitis  B  or  C, the  incidence  of  other  concomitant diseases  at  screening  was  high  in  both  treatment  groups.    The  most  common  were  dermatologic conditions (29%) and conditions related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system (29%). These conditions were noted more frequently in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group (34% versus 23%, and 34% versus 24%, respectively). There were no other relevant differences between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups with respect to the concomitant diseases reported at screening. Eleven percent of all patients (10% and 13% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively) had a history of sulfonamide allergy.

## 2.2 Efficacy

## Primary endpoint

The percentage of patients with confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml at Week 48 in the OP population was 77% for the DRV/RTV group and 68% for the LPV/RTV group. The difference in virological response [95% CI] between the treatment groups was 9.5 [2.1; 16.9]; the lower limit of the 95%  CI  of  the  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  &gt;  -12%,  therefore,  non-inferiority  of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV was concluded. The lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the  treatment  groups  was  also  &gt;  0  (in  support  of  the  pre-defined  superiority  rationale).  Statistical comparison  using  the  logistic  regression  model  showed  an  estimated  difference  [95%  CI]  in virological response at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups of 9.1 [1.9; 16.4], with a p-value confirming non-inferiority of &lt; 0.001.

The results obtained for the ITT population were consistent with those of the OP population.

The favourable results of DRV/RTV were also reflected in the following display of the virological response (% patients with confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml at Week 48) according to the TLOVR algorithm. Of the 298 DRV/RTV patients, 31 (10.7%) experienced virological failure versus 65 of 297 (21.2%) LPV/RTV patients. There were less patients with an initial lack of response (7% versus  14%  of  patients)  and  less  rebounders  (3%  versus  6%  of  patients)  in  the  DRV/RTV  group compared to the LPV/RTV group.

The  MAH  illustrated  also  that  the  virological  response  (percentage  of  patients  with  viral  load &lt; 400 copies/ml)  at  Week  48  with  LPV/RTV  was  comparable  with  the  virological  response  rates observed  in  previous  trials  performed  with  LPV/RTV  400/100  mg  b.i.d.  in  treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients.  The difference in virological response at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups was apparently maintained across several subgroups by baseline e.g. DRV FC and LPV FC, number of DRV and LPV RAMs at baseline, STI at screening, number of susceptible NRTIs and susceptible ARVs in the OBR.  See the following table.

a Percent response estimated from a logistic regression model including use of an NNRTI in the OBR as factor and baseline log10 plasma viral load as covariate.

b  Confidence  limits  based  on  standard  error  obtained  by  application  of  the  delta  method  and  a  normal approximation to the difference in % response.

The different sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results for virological response defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml were robust and consistent across the different populations and imputation methods used.

The difference in virological response (viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml) at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups was maintained across several subgroups by baseline e.g. viral load, baseline DRV FC and LPV FC, number of DRV and LPV RAMs at baseline, STI at screening, use of an NNRTI in the OBR, number of susceptible NRTIs and susceptible ARVs in the OBR.

The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  showed  that  virological  response  defined  as  plasma  viral  load  &lt;  50 copies/ml was achieved more frequently in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group, see the following figure. The difference between the treatment groups in time to virological response defined as plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml was statistically significant (p = 0.0005), with a greater probability of responding to DRV/RTV treatment compared to LPV/RTV treatment (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.40 [1.16; 1.68]).

<!-- image -->

Similar, the Kaplan-Meier estimate showed that the proportion of patients never achieving a plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml was smaller in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group, and that loss  of  virological  response  over  time  occurred  less  frequently  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the LPV/RTV group. The difference between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups in time to loss of virological response defined as plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml was statistically significant (p = 0.0268), with a smaller probability of failing under DRV/RTV treatment compared to LPV/RTV treatment (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.74 [0.56; 0.97]).

Similar results were obtained for time to loss of virological response defined as a decrease of ≥ 1.0 log10  versus baseline, where the difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0397),  and  the  hazard  ratio  for  failing  under  DRV/RTV  treatment  relative  to  LPV/RTV treatment [95% CI] was 0.73 [0.54; 0.99].

Furthermore, the Week 48 mean change in log10 viral load from baseline in the ITT population was 1.95 and -1.72 log10 copies/ml for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively. See the following table.

Table 11 Change in log10 Viral Load at Week 48 (ITT - NC = F)

| Treatment Group   | LS Means a (SE)               |   Difference in LS Means | 95% CI of Difference in LS Means   |   P-Value |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| DRV/RTV LPV/RTV   | -1.98 (0.0979) -1.78 (0.1013) |                     -0.2 | [-0. 39; -0.00]                    |     0.046 |

a Least square means estimated from an ANCOVA including use of an NNRTI in the OBR and treatment group as factors, and baseline log10 plasma viral load as covariate.

These  results  for  the  mean  viral  load  DAVG  were  similar:  at  Week  48  this  was  -1.96  and  -1.78 copies/ml for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively.

The  majority  of  subjects  harboured  HIV-1  clade  B  (81.8%  and  80.8  %  in  the  DRV/RTV  and LPV/RTV group, respectively). Other clades that were found in at least 10 subjects in each treatment group were clade C (4.7% and 4.0 % in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV group, respectively) and clade CRF01\\_AE (7.4% and 9.1 % in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV group, respectively). Other clades were present  in  less  than  10  subjects  in  each  treatment  group.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  all  the  clades except for clade B, the number of subjects was relatively limited and therefore those results should be interpreted with caution.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The virologic response in the DRV/RTV group or in the LPV/RTV group in subjects harbouring clade C,  clade  CRF01\\_AE or 'other  clades'  was  not significantly  different  from  the  response  in  subjects harbouring clade B.

## Influence of the number of DRV or LPV RAMs on virological response.

A  diminished  virological  response  rate  defined  by  the  %  of  patients  with  confirmed  viral  load  &lt; 400 copies/ml at Week 48 (TLOVR [Non-VF Censored]) was observed for the DRV/RTV subgroup of patients  with ≥ 3  DRV  RAMs  (60%,  representing  &lt;  75%  of  the  overall  response  rate  for  the DRV/RTV group). The same was observed for the LPV/RTV subgroups of patients with 2 or ≥ 3 DRV RAMs (36% and 46%, respectively, representing &lt; 75% of the overall response rate for the LPV/RTV group). The median number of IAS-USA PI RAMs was 3 and 4 for the subgroups of patients with no DRV RAMs at baseline in the DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV groups, respectively. A higher median number of IAS-USA PI RAMs (range 8 - 13) was observed for all subgroups of patients with ≥ 1 DRV RAM at  baseline. Note that the number of patients in the subgroups with &gt; 1 DRV RAM at baseline was low. Similar results were observed for virological response defined as the percentage of patients with viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at Week 48 (TLOVR [Non-VF Censored]). See the figures below.

A similar trend was also observed for the mean change in log10 viral load.

A diminished virological response rate (percentage of patients with viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml at Week 48) was observed for the LPV/RTV subgroup of patients with ≥ 6 LPV RAMs (41%, representing &lt; 75% of the overall response rate for the LPV/RTV group). The presence of LPV RAMs at baseline did not influence virological response to DRV/RTV, even if the median number of IAS-USA PI RAMs was 12 in the  subgroup  of  patients  with ≥ 6  LPV  RAMs.  Similar  results  were  seen  for  virological response rate defined as percentage of patients with viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at Week 48 and for mean change in log10 viral load.

Proportionally  fewer  virological  failures  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group developed  DRV  RAMs  (18%  versus  23%),  LPV  RAMs  (25%  versus  36%),  IAS-USA  primary  PI mutations (21% versus 36%), IAS-USA PI RAMs (36% versus 48%), FDA defined PI mutations (21% versus 38%), or IAS-USA NRTI-RAMs (14% versus 27%). See the following table.

a Baseline and endpoint genotype was available for 28 of 31 virological failures; n = 28 was used to calculate the % for each mutation list.

c Based on the IAS-USA list of mutations.

Among the 5 patients in the DRV/RTV group who developed DRV RAMs endpoint, 1 patient had 2 DRV RAMs at baseline, while the other 4 patients already had ≥ 3 DRV RAMs at baseline. Two of these 5 patients were already resistant to DRV (FC &gt; 10) at baseline, and the other 3 patients became resistant to DRV after the development of the additional DRV RAMs. All 5 patients were resistant to LPV (FC &gt; 10) at baseline.

Among the 20 patients in the LPV/RTV group who developed LPV RAMs at endpoint, 10 patients had &lt; 6 LPV RAMs at baseline. Seven patients were already resistant to LPV (FC &gt; 10) at baseline, and all other patients except 2 became resistant to LPV after the development of the LPV RAMs.

Analyses  to  identify  the  protease  mutations  that  developed  in  &gt;  10%  of  virological  failures  on DRV/RTV treatment showed that the V32I mutation developed in 11% (3/28) of virological failures.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fewer  virological  failures  treated  with  DRV/RTV  than  with  LPV/RTV  lost  susceptibility  to  PIs  or NRTIs after  treatment:  4/31  (14%)  patients  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  were  susceptible  to  fewer  PIs (excluding DRV) after treatment compared to 18/65 (33%) patients in the LPV/RTV group. See the following table

## Immunological response

Statistical comparison between the treatment groups at Week 48 (ANCOVA) for the change in CD4+ cell  count  from baseline (ITT - NC = F) is summarised in the following table.  In both groups the median change (increase) in CD4 cell count was similar.

Table 14 Change in CD4+ Cell Count at Week 48 (ITT - NC = F)

| Treatment Group   | LS Means a (SE)   | Difference in LS Means   | 95% CI of Difference in LS Means   | p-Value   |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| DRV/RTV           | 94 (10.8)         | -11                      | [-32; 11]                          | 0.330     |

a Least square means estimated from an ANCOVA including use of an NNRTI in the OBR and treatment group as factors, and baseline log10 plasma viral load as covariate.

## QoL- FAHI score

FAHI  imputed  score  at  baseline  was  rather  high  (124  and  121  for  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV treatment  groups,  respectively),  leaving  relatively  limited  room  for  improvement.  There  were  no statistically or clinically relevant differences between the two treatment groups for the slight observed changes.

## Population PK/PD data (These were already assessed in the CHMP renewal AR).

Of the 298 patients randomised and treated with DRV/RTV, 285 patients with sparse sampling data were included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis for DRV.  The Bayesian estimates of the DRV pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling data are summarised in the below table.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 15 Population PK Estimates of DRV

| Parameter           | Median (Range)         |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| N                   | 285                    |
| AUC 12h , ng . h/ml | 55816 (32437; 177680)  |
| C 0h , ng/ml        | 3306.5 (1516.9; 13198) |

N = number of patients.

The analysis concluded that plasma trough DRV concentrations (C0h) exceeded the predefined target trough  concentration  of  550  ng/ml  (based  on  the  EC50  value  for  PI-resistant  HIV-1  strains  when corrected for protein binding) in all patients. Results from this analysis confirm previous findings in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients following dosing with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d.

Concomitant use of EFV and NVP at baseline, age, and weight did not influence the DRV AUC12h or C0h values. A trend toward higher DRV exposure in females (approximately 8%, N = 67) compared to males (N = 218), and higher exposure in Blacks (approximately 15%, N = 49) and lower exposure in Asian patients (approximately 16%, N = 27) compared to Caucasian patients (N = 154) was observed. These differences were not considered clinically relevant.

No apparent relationships were observed between the DRV pharmacokinetic parameters AUC12h and C0h, and the occurrence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial medication, or rash-, cardiac-, GI-, liver-, lipid- and glucose-related AEs, or AEs of the SOCs Nervous System Disorders, and Psychiatric Disorders.

## Discussion on Efficacy

Study C214 demonstrated the non-inferiority of the efficacy of DRV/RTV at the recommended dosage of  DRV/RTV 600/100  mg  b.i.d.  compared  to  LPV/RTV  both  in  combination  with  an  OBR  in  the studied ART-experienced HIV-1 infected patients based on the primary virological endpoint (i.e. the percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  &lt;  400  copies/ml  at  Week  48  in  the  OP population) at the chosen delta of 12%. DRV/RTV was at least as efficacious as LPV/RTV based on the  results  for  secondary  virological  and  immunological  response  parameters.  In  this  comparison, DRV/RTV treatment appeared to be associated with more favourable virological response as defined by the primary endpoint (77% for the DRV/RTV group and 68% for the LPV/RTV group). This was also  evident  from  the  results  for  the  percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load &lt; 50 copies/ml  at  Week  48  (which  was  a  secondary  endpoint)  and  other  secondary  virological parameters.

Justification  of  the  chosen  non-inferiority  margin  was  based  on  trials  with  other  PIs  and  not  on  a discussion  of  potential  clinical  relevance  in  the  context  of  morbidity  or  survival.  However,  the observed lower bound of the 95% CI was &gt; -10% and therefore there is no reason for concern in that regard.

Virological response tends to decrease over time at least partly due to viral resistance associated with RAM,  as  noted  also  in  the  original  pre-registration  assessment  for  the  highly  pre-treated  HIV-1 infected patients. The results of the Week 96 of the present ongoing trial are of interest for the further evaluation of the development of resistance and evaluation of the long-term safety of DRV/RTV in this  HIV-1  infected  population.  In  this  regard  there  is  an  ongoing  FUM,  to  which  the  MAH committed; in this  context,  the  MAH  should  also  present  the  virologic  response  by  clade  (see  also Letter of Undertaking).

The submitted population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal unexpected findings. Some small differences in plasma concentrations were observed between studied groups, but this is considered not clinically relevant.

## 2.3 Safety

Trial  TMC114-C214  showed  that  the  overall  AE  profile  of DRV/RTV  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  was comparable to that of LPV/RTV 400/100 mg b.i.d, which represents a standard of care for treatment-

experienced  patients.  Except  for  diarrhoea,  which  was  less  frequent  with  DRV/RTV  than  with LPV/RTV and rash which was more frequent with DRV/RTV, the incidence of the most common AEs was comparable for the 2 treatment groups. See the following table.

The  incidence  of  cardiac-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  for  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV groups. Heart-failure-related AEs were reported in 0.3% and 1% of patients in the respective treatment groups, ischemia-related AEs in 0.3% and 2%, and rhythm disturbance- or ECG- related AEs in 6% and 5%, respectively. The most frequent cardiac-related AE by preferred term was ECG QTc interval prolonged (2% and 0.3% with DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively). All other cardiac-related AEs occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group.

QTcF values of &gt; 500 ms were not observed. QTcB values of &gt; 500 ms were observed in 2% and 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Increases in QTcF of &gt; 60 ms were observed in 2% and 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Increases in QTcB of &gt; 60 ms were observed in 4% and 2% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively.  In  2  DRV/RTV-treated patients,  an  increase  in  QTcB  of  &gt;  60  ms  resulted in  a  QTcB value of &gt; 500 ms (509 and 502 ms, respectively). No other increases in QTc of &gt; 60 ms resulted in QTc values of &gt; 500 ms. No patients presented any clinical events related to QTc prolongation.

The  incidence  of  liver-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  The most frequent liver-related AEs (preferred term) were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2% in  both  groups),  gamma-glutamyl  tranferase  (GGT)  increased  (2%  and  1%  with  DRV/RTV  and LPV/RTV, respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (1% and 3%) and jaundice (1%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 0%). All other liver-related AEs occurred in &lt; 1 % of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group. Grade 3 or 4 liver-related AEs occurred in 4% of patients in both treatment groups.

Hyperbilirubinemia (increase in total bilirubin) was observed less frequently in the DRV/RTV group (2%)  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group  (6%).  Grade  3  or  4  hyperbilirubinemia  was  observed  in  2 DRV/RTV-treated patients and not in LPV/RTV-treated patients.

In  both  treatment  groups,  the  overall  incidence  of  liver-related  AEs  was  higher  in  patients  with hepatitis  B  or  C  co-infection  (25%  and  24%  with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively)  than  in patients not co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus (5% and 4%).

The  incidence  of  lipid-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  The most  frequent  lipid-related  AEs  (preferred  term)  were  hypertriglyceridaemia  (7%  and  10%  with DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively),  hypercholesterolaemia  (4%  and  6%),  blood  triglycerides increased (4% in both groups), blood cholesterol increased (4% and 3%), and hyperlipidaemia (3% and 4%). All other lipid-related AEs occurred in ≤ 2 % of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group.

Glucose-related AEs were reported in 3% and 4% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively.  None  of  the  glucose-related  AEs  were  reported  in  &gt;  1%  of  patients  in  any  treatment group and the incidence of glucose-related AEs was comparable between both treatment groups. One patient in the DRV/RTV group permanently discontinued the trial medication due to grade 2 diabetes mellitus (possibly related).

The incidence of increased amylase was higher in the DRV/RTV group (24%) than in the LPV/RTV group  (17%);  the  incidence  of  increased  lipase  and  creatinine  was  comparable  for  both  treatment groups (8% versus 5%, and 6% versus 8%, respectively). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 abnormalities for amylase (6% versus 3%), lipase (2% versus 0.3%), or creatinine (0% for both treatment groups). The increases in amylase and lipase were asymptomatic in all cases.

The incidence of haematology laboratory abnormalities was generally comparable for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups. The majority of haematology abnormalities in this trial were grade 1 or  2.    The  incidence  of  prothrombin  time  (PT)  and  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (PTT) abnormalities was low. Grade 4 increased PT was observed in 1 LPV/RTV-treated patient and not in DRV/RTV-treated patients; grade 4 increased PTT was observed in 1% of patients in both treatment groups. Grade 4 decreases in haemoglobin were observed in 1% of patients in the LPV/RTV group and not in the DRV/RTV group. There were no grade 3 or 4 decreases for white blood cell (WBC) count. Grade 3 decreases in platelet count were observed in 0.3% of patients in the DRV/RTV group and  1%  of  patients  in  the  LPV/RTV  group.  Grade  3  or  4  decreases  in  neutrophil  count  were  not observed in the DRV/RTV group and in 2% of patients in the LPV/RTV group.

The incidence of AEs related to urinalysis was low and comparable for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment  groups.  The  most  frequent  AE  related  to  urinalysis  was  haematuria,  reported  in  1%  of patients in both treatment groups. No AEs related to urinalysis were grade 3 or 4 in severity.

Serious Adverse Events were reported in 9% and 10% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively. All SAEs, except 2 (anaemia and cardiorespiratory arrest), occurred in only 1 patient in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group. The SAE anaemia occurred in 2 DRV/RTVtreated  patients,  and  the  SAE  cardiorespiratory  arrest  occurred  in  2  LPV/RTV-treated  patients.  The most  frequent  SAEs  by  SOC  (in  &gt;  1%  of  patients  in  any  treatment  group)  were  Infections  and Infestations (3% and 3%, with DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively), and Cardiac Disorders (0% and 2%).

Seven  percent  of  patients  of  both  treatment  groups  permanently  discontinued  treatment  due  to ≥ 1 AEs. The incidence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was generally comparable for the DRV/RTV and  LPV/RTV  treatment  groups.  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  were  most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

commonly from the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders (2% of patients in both groups), of which the AE diarrhoea (1% and 2% with DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively) was reported most frequently, and the SOC Investigations (2% in both groups). All other AEs leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group.

AEs  of  all  grades  that  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  DRV/RTV  or  LPV/RTV  were reported in 58.7% and 64.3% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Grade ≥ 2  AEs at least possibly related to DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV were reported in 36.9% and 40.7% of patients,  respectively.  The  majority  of  grade ≥ 2  AEs  at  least  possibly  related  to  DRV/RTV  or LPV/RTV occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in any treatment group.

## Discussion on Safety

The relative AE profile of DRV/RTV emerging from this Week 48 analysis of the study results for trial  TMC114-C214  indicates  that  DRV/RTV  at  the  recommended  dosage  (as  for  the  highly  pretreated patients) for this population is at least similar to the profile of LPV/RTV. The safety results of DRV/RTV from this study are in line with the earlier assessment of the safety of DRV/RTV during the renewal  procedure  in  which  the  present  results  were  integrated.  An  amendment  of  the  SPC  in  that regard is not needed.

## 3 Pharmacovigilance

## Risk Management Plan

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 5.0, dated 7 February 2008 was assessed to evaluate the need for an update in relation to this extension of indication.

The MAH conducted a comparative phase III trial TMC114-C214 with 298 less treatment-experienced patients on DRV/RTV and 297 less treatment-experienced patients on LPV/RTV. The adverse events profile  observed  after  48  weeks  (data  cut-off  date)  was  for  the  most  part  consistent  with  what  is already known for DRV in (highly) treatment-experienced patients. In the DRV/RTV group, 26.8% reported any grade 3 or 4 adverse event. In the SPC of DRV/RTV the percentage of any grade 2, 3, or 4 adverse events is 30% and 9% of these patients (DRV/RTV) experienced a severe adverse event.

However,  these  figures  cannot  be  compared  accurately,  because  the  MAH  provided  no  clear  data about the percentages of grade 3 and 4 adverse events separately in the study group. In the final study report, the MAH has to provide these figures per grade group (see also Letter of Undertaking).

The  most  common  events  were  diarrhoea  (32%  and  42%  with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV, respectively),  nausea  (18%  and  21%),  nasopharyngitis  (12%  and  11%),  headache  (11%  and  7%), abdominal pain (10% and 7%), upper respiratory tract infection (10% and 7%) and hypertriglyceridaemia (7% and 10%). This is consistent with the already known data for DRV/RTV.

The incidence and severity of the adverse events do not give cause for changes in the RMP, except for the rash-related adverse events.

In the comparative phase III trial TMC114-C214, the overall frequency of rash-related adverse events was  higher  during  treatment  with  DRV/RTV  (16.4%)  than  with  LPV/RTV  (7.1%).  However,  the incidence of grade 3 or 4 rash-related events was low in both groups (0.7% vs. 0%), but still higher than  the  already  known  percentage  for  DRV/RTV.  Rash  is  reported  in  the  SPC  as  common,  and generalised rash, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus as uncommon.

Rash-related adverse events, including Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), are already an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. In the complete dataset there have been 4 case reports of SJS, of which 1 'very likely related', 1 'doubtfully related', and 2 'not or doubtfully related'. Also, there is a higher incidence of rash-related events in the less treatment-experienced patients on DRV/RTV than in the control group.

The MAH therefore was requested to amend the RMP, section 2.2.1' Important Identified Risks': for all  rash-related  events  that  have  occurred  with  DRV/RTV.  It  was  also  requested  to  be  recorded whether the patients concerned were naïve, highly pre-treated or less pre-treated. The updated version 7.0 of the RMP dated 31 July 2008 was submitted in eCTD sequence 0079 in the framework of the PSUR covering the period PSUR 24 Dec 2007 - 23 Jun 2008.

The MAH consequently has also revised in this version of the RMP the presentation of the clinical data on rash-related events in Section 1.5.2.1.1 in order to distinguish the risk characteristics of the pooled safety data (n = 3063 subjects), from the less pre-treated subjects (TITAN trial) and from the naïve  subjects  (ARTEMIS  trial).  This  updated  version  is  currently  being  assessed  with  a  CHMP conclusion awaited during the November 2008 CHMP meeting.

## 4 Changes to the Product Information

The  CHMP  agreed  to  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  in  section  4.1  of  the  SPC,  however, requested  a  slight  rewording  to  highlight  both  the  new  and  the  old  patient  population.  The  MAH agreed to this request and updated the SPC in accordance (see also attachment 1).

Regarding the proposed changes to section 5.1, the CHMP requested that references to superiority of DRV/RTV above LPV/RTV should be deleted, as the trial design was aimed at non-inferiority. The MAH agreed and revised the section accordingly.

Also, proposed changes regarding the mention that no new RAM or FC findings of clinical relevance were observed were requested to be deleted. The CHMP regarded this information as not informative for the prescriber. The MAH agreed and updated section 5.1 accordingly (see also attachment 1). In addition, the MAH committed to update the resistance section according to the new template B of the revision of the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection.

The CHMP agreed to the initially proposed changes in the Package Leaflet.

## 5 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Study C214 demonstrated the non-inferiority of the efficacy of DRV/RTV at the recommended dosage of  DRV/RTV 600/100  mg  b.i.d.  compared  to  LPV/RTV  both  in  combination  with  an  OBR  in  the studied ART-experienced HIV-1 infected patients based on the primary virological endpoint (i.e. the percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  &lt;  400  copies/ml  at  Week  48  in  the  OP population) at the chosen delta of 12%. DRV/RTV was at least as efficacious as LPV/RTV based on the  results  for  secondary  virological  and  immunological  response  parameters.  In  this  comparison, DRV/RTV treatment appeared to be associated with more favourable virological response as defined by the primary endpoint (77% for the DRV/RTV group and 68% for the LPV/RTV group). This was also  evident  from  the  results  for  the  percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load &lt; 50 copies/ml  at  Week  48  (which  was  a  secondary  endpoint)  and  other  secondary  virological parameters.

Justification  of  the  chosen  non-inferiority  margin  was  based  on  trials  with  other  PIs  and  not  on  a discussion  of  potential  clinical  relevance  in  the  context  of  morbidity  or  survival.  However,  the observed lower bound of the 95% CI was &gt; -10% and therefore there is no reason for concern in that regard.

Virological response tends to decrease over time at least partly due to viral resistance associated with RAM,  as  noted  also  in  the  original  pre-registration  assessment  for  the  highly  pre-treated  HIV-1 infected patients. The results of the Week 96 of the present ongoing trial are of interest for the further evaluation of the development of resistance and evaluation of the long-term safety of DRV/RTV in this  HIV-1  infected  population.  In  this  regard  there  is  an  ongoing  FUM,  to  which  the  MAH committed; in this context, the MAH should also present the virologic response by clade.

The submitted population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal unexpected findings. Some small differences in plasma concentrations were observed between studied groups, but this is considered not clinically relevant.

The relative AE profile of DRV/RTV emerging from this Week 48 analysis of the study results for trial  TMC114-C214  indicates  that  DRV/RTV  at  the  recommended  dosage  (as  for  the  highly  pretreated patients) for this population is at least similar to the profile of LPV/RTV. The safety results of DRV/RTV from this study are in line with the earlier assessment of the safety of DRV/RTV during the renewal procedure in which the present results were integrated. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no amendments to the Product Information are needed in the framework of this extension of indication.

The CHMP considered the benefit risk balance of Prezista positive for the sought indication variation:

' PREZISTA,  co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1) infection  in  treatment-experiencedhighly  pre-treated  adult  patients,  including  those  that  have  been highly pre-treatedwho failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI).

In  deciding  to  initiate  treatment  with  PREZISTA  co-administered  with  100 mg  ritonavir  careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations  associated  with  different  agents.  Genotypic  or  phenotypic  testing  (when  available)  and treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA.'
