## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This assessment report concerns the requested extension of indication for Kalydeco (ivacaftor) to include cystic fibrosis (CF) patients aged 18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR) gene. CF is an autosomal recessive genetic condition with an incidence of approximately 1:3500 in most European and North American countries and 1:5000 to 1:20,000 in Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa. Progressive obstructive lung disease causes over 90% of deaths in patients with CF. Mutations in the gene coding for the CFTR result in an absent or dysfunctional protein at the surface of certain epithelia. Although CF affects multiple organs, the leading cause of mortality is the progressive loss of lung function. CFTR normally transports chloride to regulate salt, fluid, and pH balance in multiple organs. In people with CF, the loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction and elevated sweat chloride concentration (Van Goor et al, 2014).

More than 1500 CFTR mutations have been identified, but only the functional importance of a small number is known. Evaluation of the molecular defect in the CFTR protein caused by CFTR mutations has shown that the loss of chloride transport can be due to a reduction in the quantity and/or function of CFTR channels at the cell surface. As for other ion channels, gating of the CFTR channel is measured by open probability, and conductance of the CFTR channel is measured by current amplitude. The CFTR form that has lower open probability than normal CFTR has a gating defect, and the CFTR form that has lower current amplitude than normal CFTR has a conductance defect.

Some CFTR mutations cause more than 1 type of functional defect or reduce both the quantity and function of CFTR . Regardless of the type of defect caused by the CFTR mutation, CF disease severity generally correlates with the severity of the loss of chloride transport. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR -mediated chloride transport - referred to as 'minimal function' of CFTR - results in severe CF. A more moderate loss of CFTR -mediated chloride transport - referred to as 'residual chloride transport' or 'residual function' - results in less severe CF.

The R117H-CFTR mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine residue at position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. It is associated with residual chloride transport and a CF phenotype characterized by exocrine pancreatic sufficiency. Although generally characterized as a Class IV conductance mutation, R117H-CFTR is known to exhibit a defect in channel gating which has been documented in published studies (Sheppard et al., 1993) and in studies conducted by the MAH.  This finding supports, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the use of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that increases channel gating and, consequently, improves chloride transport, for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and the R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR . The clinical and functional analysis of the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or penetrance, i.e., it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to cystic fibrosis.  This phenotypic variability has been mainly attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H (Thauvin-Robinet C. et al, 2009).

The R117H-CFTR mutation is present in approximately 2 to 3% of patients with CF. In Europe, North America, and Australia, approximately 1,600 people with CF aged 6 years and older have at least 1 copy of an R117H-CFTR mutation. In the EU, approximately 744 people have the R117H-CFTR mutation, of whom approximately 360 people have the R117H-CFTR mutation and are 18 years of age or older.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the disease expression is relatively heterogeneous, the R117H-CFTR mutation may be associated with reduced lung function, gradually progressive obstructive lung disease, recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis, and increasing frequency of hospitalizations over the course of the lifespan due to pulmonary disease. As illustrated in figure below, which plots the distributions of percent predicted FEV1 in individuals with an R117H-CFTR mutation by age cohorts in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Registry, there is an evident progression in lung function decline with age. Among CF patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation who are 19 to 30 years of age, 34% of patients have a percent predicted FEV1 &lt;80%, and that number increases to 55% for patients aged more than 30 years.

Although the R117H-CFTR mutation may result in CF disease, the severity of CF per age group is generally less than that caused by the G551D-CFTR mutation or other CFTR mutations associated with a severe phenotype. Historically, due to the milder presentation of disease, many individuals with an R117H-CFTR mutation were not diagnosed with CF until the late childhood or adult years, when the disease had progressed and symptoms became much more evident. This has recently changed because of advances in newborn screening for CFTR mutations. More individuals with an R117H-CFTR mutation are now identified earlier in life, often without advanced pulmonary or gastrointestinal manifestations, since the symptoms of CF progress with patient's age. Available data about life expectancy in CF patients with a less severe CF phenotype, such as those with the R117H-CFTR , also have a markedly reduced median life expectancy of just 50 years with the median age of death being 38 years in the US and 32 years in the UK. In contrast, the life expectancy for non-Hispanic white males in the US is 76 years, and for males in Europe is 72 years. Due to the small number of CF patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation who have contributed data to searchable registries and the likelihood that many subjects with mild CF are not genotyped at their time of death it is difficult to estimate the impact of the R117H-CFTR mutation on life expectancy. Based on a simple numerical comparison, CFTR mutations associated with a less severe phenotype appear to result in a disease process that is approximately 10 years slower than for CF

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients who have mutations associated with severe disease (approximate median age of death of 26 years for severe CF and 38 years for less severe CF). Thus, while the R117H mutation is in the less severe spectrum of CF, it is associated with severe disease when compared to a normal population. The MAH conclude that there is therefore a clear and substantial unmet need in this population.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The main study in support of this application was:

Study VX11-770-110: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have the R117H-CFTR Mutation

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

No major new pharmacokinetic data is discussed in the documentation provided in support of this extension of the indication with the exception of a Population pharmacokinetic (PK) study (Report J178) and exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses for study 110. In addition, analytical methods for the determination of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in human plasma are also provided.

A method for the determination of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in human plasma containing K2EDTA by HPLC-MS/MS over the calibration range of 2.00 to 2000 ng/mL for ivacaftor and M1-ivacaftor and range of 10.0 to 10000 ng/mL for M6-ivacaftor was developed and validated at Covance. The prestudy validations of the analytical methods are satisfactory. The method demonstrated acceptable selectivity and the presence of haemolysed red blood cells and natural high lipid content in human plasma did not affect the quantitation of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in this method. All calibration standards utilized within the regression had back-calculated values that were within the acceptance criteria. For QCs, all intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy values were within the acceptance criteria. The data confirm that the presence of the co-administered drugs and selected concomitant medications (loratadine, triamcinolone, cetirizine dihydrochloride, DL-alpha tocopherol- vitamin E, ergocalciferol- vitamin D2, and ipratropium bromide monohydrate) does not affect the quantification of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor. There was no evidence of carryover and the matrix factor was not considered to impact assay performance in either plasma or CF plasma.

In general, the in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs as the precision and accuracy for all the three analytes met the acceptance criteria for all analytical runs. A total of 359 study samples were analysed in a total of nine analytical runs (no analytical runs failed) between November 20th, 2013 and November 25th, 2013 at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Covance) 3301 Kinsman Boulevard Madison, Wisconsin 53704 USA. A total of five study samples were re-assayed for ivacaftor with acceptable results (~1% of total number of samples analysed), 27 study samples were re-assayed for M1-ivacaftor with acceptable results (~8% of total number of samples analysed) and of six study samples were re-assayed for M6-ivacaftor with acceptable results (~2% of total number of samples analyzed).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The reasons for re-assay and the reported results were submitted and were considered acceptable. Incurred Sample Reproducibility was acceptable for all three analytes. For all analytes, the maximum storage period between collection and analysis was no longer that the current validated storage period at -60 ºC to - 80 ºC.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

The R117H mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine residue at position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. It affects the extracellular loop of the first of two membrane spanning domains that form the pore of the CFTR chloride ion channel. The R117H mutation is associated with residual chloride transport and a CF phenotype characterised by exocrine pancreatic sufficiency. Updated information on the mechanism of action of ivacaftor based on two recently published papers (Jih, K-Y, Hwang, T-C., 2013; Eckford, P.D.W, Li, C., Ramjeesingh, M., Bear, C.E., 2012) has been provided showing that ivacaftor increases the frequency of the ATP-independent channel gating mode, but the mechanism has not been completely elucidated.

Although R117H is usually considered as a class IV conductance mutation, the in vitro experiments performed in Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing the aberrant R117H -CFTR protein show that the main molecular defect is a decrease in channel gating with a minor decrease in channel conductance compared to normal CFTR channels. This finding supports, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the use of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that increases channel gating and, consequently, improves chloride transport for the treatment of patients with CF and the R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR .  It should be noticed, however, that the in vitro responses seen in these experiments do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response (e.g. sweat chloride) or clinical benefit.

The clinical and functional analysis of the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to cystic fibrosis. This phenotypic variability has been partially attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H .  The poly-T tract is present in every copy of the CFTR gene and occurs in one of three forms: 5T, 7T, or 9T . Depending on which poly-T form is present in the same copy of the CFTR gene with R117H (i.e. in cis ) differing outcomes may occur. The R117H mutation in cis with the 5T variant typically results in more severe CF than the R117H mutation in cis with the 7T variant. Although many individuals with the R117H mutation associated to the poly-T variant 7T will not have cystic fibrosis lung disease some cases of severe disease have been reported in patients carrying a severe CF mutation (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). The 9T variant is highly unlikely to cause disease. The difference in clinical consequence is likely due to the lower amount of CFTR protein synthesized in people with the 5T variant compared to those with the 7T variant, as well as other factors such as modifier genes, environmental factors, and other complex CFTR alleles. Examples of complex CFTR alleles in addition to 5T and 7T include the number of TG repeats in intron 8 along with the 5T mutation (e.g., TG11-5T , TG12-5T , TG13-5T ) as well as missense mutations, such as M470V , R668C , G576A , D443Y , R74W , and D1270N . In conclusion, R117H by itself does not act as a CF-causing mutation. However, under certain circumstances, and, as always, when another CF-causing mutation is present, R117H can cause disease.  In order to correctly interpret data from the R117H mutation in trans with an additional CFTR mutation it is necessary to know the phase of the mutations. The phase refers to the specific combination of mutations that are present together in the same copy of the CFTR gene. For instance, a patient may have the following mutations: R117H/G551D and 5T/7T . Determining the phase means determining which poly-T variant ( 5T , 7T , 9T ) is in the same copy of the CFTR gene as R117H and which is in the same copy as G551D . For some patients, testing of their parents is necessary to determine the phase of the mutations. This information is relevant for the subgroup analysis by poly-T variant that was performed in study 110.  The results of study 110 were analysed by the presence of the poly-T variant ( 5T or 7T ) in cis with the R117H mutation. However, this information was not available for all patients enrolled in the study for various reasons. As a consequence, some assumptions were made for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with the following genotypes: R117H/F508del and R117H/R117H . What is lacking is the complete genotype of all patients, i.e. including not only the mutations of the CFTR in trans but also the poly-T variants in cis for both alleles, i.e. the phase of the mutations. This is addressed in the section on clinical efficacy. Because of the phenotypic variability of the R117H-CFTR mutation, diagnosis of CF should be mainly based on clinical criteria alone. Patients with this mutation and a mutation that is known to cause CF should undergo periodic assessment as the clinical manifestations of the disease may appear later in life. Regarding the CFTR mutation in the second allele, the majority of patients (76.8%) enrolled in study 110 had the F508del mutation on the second allele, a processing mutation that results in minimal amounts of CFTR reaching the surface. Ivacaftor treatment did not result in clinical benefit in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation although limited in vitro response in chloride transport was seen, showing that this mutation has some defective channel gating. Each of the other second alleles was present in no more than 2 subjects.

Of the 793 patients with cystic fibrosis carrying a R117H mutation in CFTR 2, 590 had F508del in the second allele. Their average sweat chloride is 60 mEq/L, their percent predicted FEV1 is in the range of 72-113% in patients below 10 years old (n=36); for those between 10-20 years old (n=75) their percent predicted FEV1 ranges between 67-121% and between 29-113% for patients above 20 years of age (n= 213). Twenty-four percent are pancreatic-insufficient and 25% are infected by P aeruginosa . Regarding other CFTR mutations in the second allele of patients enrolled in study 110, stop codon (nonsense) mutations such as E60X , G103X , G542X , R553X , S489X , and W1282X are expected to significantly disrupt CFTR protein production and result in little or no functional CFTR protein in the cell. As a consequence, it was expected that patients in study 110 with a stop codon mutation had sweat chloride values above the threshold of 60 mmol/l. This is the case with the exception of a single patient randomised to placebo who had as a second CFTR mutation R553X-7T and a baseline sweat chloride of 52.25 mmol/l. With the exception of G103X all other stop codon mutation are described in CFTR 2. Patients carrying these mutations in the CFTR 2 database have sweat chloride values well above 60 mEq/L. No information has been found for G103X in CFTR 2. G103X is described in a single patient in CFTR 1. The patient in study 110 with the genotype R117H-5T / G103X-7T was randomised to placebo, his baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 63.50% and his baseline sweat chloride 82 mmol/l.  Average sweat chloride of patients included in CFTR 2 who carry one of the below mutations found in the second allele of the CFTR gen of patients enrolled in study 110 are as follows:

- 2184InsA: this is an insertion/deletion mutation that it is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=132) in the CFTR 2 database is 98 mEq/L.
- 3659DELC: this is an insertion/deletion mutation that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=247) in the CFTR 2 database is 101 mEq/L.
- 621+1G-&gt;T: This is an splice mutation that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=793) in the CFTR 2 database is 102 mEq/L.
- DELTA I507 : This is an insertion/deletion mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=306) in the CFTR 2 database is 97 mEq/L.
- R560T : This is a missense mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=196) in the CFTR 2 database is 101 mEq/L.
- S341P : This is a missense mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=7) in the CFTR 2 database is 98 mEq/L. This

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mutation has been shown in vitro to cause a severe conductance defect that is not responsive to ivacaftor in vitro  (Van Goor F, Yu H, Buron B, Hoffman BJ.; 2014).

For an additional patient the CFTR mutation in the second allele was unknown. Two patients were homozygous for R117H .

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

The MAH provided an updated Pop-PK model for ivacaftor based on the prior model by adding data from study 110. In addition, revised plasma concentration datasets for studies 007 (single dose, cross-over, relative bioavailability/food study), study 101 (phase 2a dose escalation in CF patients with the G551D mutation), study 102 (phase 3 study in CF patients aged 12 years and older with the G551D mutation), and 104 (phase 2 study in CF patients homozygous for F508delCFTR mutation) replaced previous datasets for this analysis, while data from study 002 (single dose, cross-over, relative bioavailability/food study) were not incorporated into the model due to the reported issues with the bioanalytical assay. The model does not incorporate metabolites M1 and M6. Thirty-four ivacaftor-treated patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation contributed to the analysis with 321 ivacaftor concentrations.  The original model was refined, starting from the base model, and the covariate modelling approach followed was similar to the one performed for the prior model, i.e., parameter estimation was emphasized in front of the stepwise hypothesis testing. Formulation was removed from the model as a potential covariate. The reason was that formulation was not a significant covariate in the previous model, consistent with the similar relative bioavailability for the 50% DL-SDD and 80% DL-SDD formulations. The base model incorporated weight as an allometric function for all structural parameters. Sex, age and patient status did not explain in a clinically meaningful way the variability in ivacaftor PK. Ivacaftor Cl/F was reduced by 21% in patients with the R117H mutation compared to CF subjects with a gating mutation. The estimated values for CL/F (90%CI) was 14.3 (12.7, 16.0) L/h for patients with R117H mutation vs. 18.2 (16.9, 19.3) L/h for patients with nonR117H mutation. This change is claimed not to be clinically significant.

The typical estimates (90% CI) of PK model parameters for the reference subject (70 kg, male, 18 years, CF subject, nonR117H mutation) were 18.2 (16.9, 19.3) L/hr for CL/F, 246 (196, 254) L for apparent (oral) central volume of distribution (Vc/F), 150 (48.1, 362) L for apparent (oral) peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F), 3.09 (1.98, 14.0) L/h for apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), 2.96 (2.88, 3.17) h for zero-order dose duration (D1) and 0.721 (0.530, 0.765) h-1 for first-order absorption rate (ka). Summary statistics for ivacaftor Cmin and AUC in study 110 show overlap with the values observed in previous studies. Similarly, when data from children aged 6 to 11 years in study 110 are added the same tendency remains, i.e. exposure in them is higher than in adults. An ivacaftor dose of 150 mg q12 achieved a mean Cmin,ss of 1240 ng/mL in paediatric patients from 6 to 11 years of age while the same dose resulted in a mean Cmin,ss of 683 ng/mL for adults. Mean AUC was 19,300 ng/mL.h for 6 to 11 year olds, compared to 10,300 g/mL.h for adults.

For comparison purposes with previous studies, the MAH was asked to provide non-compartmental PK analysis of study 110 sorted out by age subgroup. The non-compartmental PK analysis shows that there is a considerable overlapping in PK parameters between studies. Oral clearance per age group in study 110 is similar to that of patients with G551D and nonG551D gating mutations with the only exception being the clearance observed in the adolescent group of study 102 which seems abnormally higher.

No attempt has been made to include PD endpoints in the modelling exercise as the graphical inspection of potential relationships between PK parameters and PD endpoints such as change in percent predicted FEV1 did not give any insight in this direction.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The newly provided data refer to the analytical methods that have been used in study 110 in order to determine ivacaftor, M1 and M6 concentrations in human plasma. In addition, updated pop-PK analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including data from study 110 was discussed. The pop PK analysis estimates that patients with a R117H mutation have a small reduction in clearance. A non-compartmental analysis of study 110 PK data by age group shows that there is a considerable overlapping in the PK parameters between this study and prior studies of ivacaftor. As in the prior studies exposure in children aged 6 to less than 12 years old is higher in relation to that seen in adult patients.

The in vitro experiments performed by the MAH (and also published data) confirm that the main molecular defect of the aberrant R117H-CFTR protein is a defect in channel gating rather than a defect in conductance (also present). This justifies, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, treatment with ivacaftor of patients carrying this mutation.

The clinical and functional analysis of the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to CF. This phenotypic variability has been mostly attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). Depending on which poly-T form is present in the same copy of the CFTR gene with R117H (i.e. in cis ) various outcomes may occur. The R117H mutation in cis with the 5T variant typically results in more severe CF than the R117H mutation in cis with the 7T variant. Although many individuals with the R117H mutation associated to the poly-T variant 7T will not have CF lung disease some cases of disease with early symptoms have been reported in patients carrying a severe CF mutation (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). The 9T variant is highly unlikely to cause disease. Those subjects who have the mutation known to cause CF should undergo periodic assessment as the clinical manifestations of the disease may appear later in life.

It can be concluded that by itself, R117H does not act as a CF-causing mutation. However, under certain circumstances, and, as always, when another CF-causing mutation is present, R117H can cause disease. In general, the mutations present in the second allele of the CFTR (i.e. in trans ) of patients enrolled in study 110 are all considered disease-causing mutations in CFTR 2. No information has been found in CFTR 2 for G103X which seems to be a nonsense mutation, i.e. also a severe CFTR mutation. This mutation is described in a single patient in CFTR 1. In study 110, patient with the genotype R117H5T / G103X-7T was randomised to placebo and his baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 63.50%, his baseline sweat chloride 82 mmol/l.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The pop-PK analysis indicates that parameter estimates seen in patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation are similar to those of patients with CFTR mutations such as G551D , nonG551D gating mutations and patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation with the exception of a reduction in clearance, for which no physiological explanation is evident but is attributed to variability. A non-compartmental PK analysis of study 110 shows that there is a considerable overlapping in PK parameters between studies. Oral clearance per age group in study 110 is similar to that of patients with G551D and nonG551D gating mutations. As in the prior studies, exposure in children aged 6 to less than 12 years old is higher than in adult patients.

From a pharmacodynamic point of view, treatment with ivacaftor of patients carrying a R117H mutation is justified because the predominant in vitro defect of the aberrant R117H -CFTR protein is a defect in channel gating, although R117H is usually classified as a class IV, i.e. conductance mutation. However, given its phenotypic variability and the usually milder course of the disease with symptoms and signs appearing sometimes later in life, treatment with ivacaftor should be considered for patients with a disease phenotype compatible with cystic fibrosis.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

No dose-response studies have been performed. Patients in studies 110 and 112 (open label extension) were treated with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h based on the in vitro potency of ivacaftor towards the R117H mutation relative to other mutations that cause gating defects as well as tolerability, pharmacokinetic data, and the responses observed in studies 102 and 103, supporting the initial MAA submission of Kalydeco. A population PK model was subsequently developed based on the prior model for ivacaftor and incorporating data from study 110 showing, as previously mentioned, that  parameter estimates seen in patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation are similar to those of patients with other CFTR mutations studied in the ivacaftor clinical programme.

## 2.4.2. Main study

## Title of Study

Study VX11-770-110: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have the R117H-CFTR Mutation.

## Methods

Study 110 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a R117H -CFTR mutation. As shown in figure below, the study included a Screening Period (Day -35 to Day 15), a Run-In Period (Day -14 to Day -1 relative to the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Period (Day 1 [first dose of study drug] to Week 24), and a Follow-up period 3 to 4 weeks after the last week of study drug. Study visits during the Treatment Period occurred on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Patients were offered after the Follow-up period to be enrolled in study 112.

Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CF (defined as a sweat chloride value ≥ 60 mmol/L [by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis] OR 2 CF-causing mutations AND chronic sinopulmonary disease), aged 6 years and older, were required to have at least 1 allele of the R117H -CFTR mutation. Patients were excluded if they had a CFTR gene mutation leading to CFTR channel with gating defect (i.e., any 1 of the following mutations: G551D, G178R, G551S, S549N, S549R, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D ). In addition, patients must have had percent predicted FEV1 of 40% to 90% inclusive for subjects aged 12 years and older or 40% to 105% inclusive for subjects aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) based on the Hankinson or Wang equations. The Hankinson standard was used for male subjects 18 years and older and female subjects 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male subjects aged 6 to 17 years and for female subjects aged 6 to 15 years.

Study drug (ivacaftor 150 mg or ivacaftor-matched placebo) was administered every 12 hours with fatcontaining food such as a standard 'CF' high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack for up to 24 weeks in addition to patients' usual prescribed CF therapy. An amendment of the study protocol allowed patients to receive hypertonic saline in an attempt to improve enrolment.

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ivacaftor in patients CF who have the R117H -CFTR mutation using as the main efficacy variable the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24. Secondary endpoints were absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24, absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24, change from baseline in the respiratory domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) through week 24 and time to first pulmonary exacerbation. Safety was a secondary objective. There were also a number of exploratory (tertiary)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endpoints.

Enrolment was planned for a 40-80 subjects. An unblinded interim analysis for safety and efficacy was performed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after 40 patients had completed Week 8 Visit and, based on the results and rules pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the DMC did not recommend any changes. Enrolment was kept open until the study was terminated early by the sponsor and recruitment was halted after 70 subjects were randomized, based upon the power calculations and Week 24 Visit by the time of study termination were considered to have completed their assigned treatment duration and were offered enrolment study 112. All available data were included in the final analyses regardless of whether subjects completed 24 weeks of study drug treatment.

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratifying for age and percent predicted FEV1 at screening to receive either 150-mg ivacaftor or ivacaftor-matching placebo q12h, in addition to their usual prescribed CF therapy. Only two adolescent patients were enrolled which could be attributed to the fact that the years and older should have a percent predicted FEV equal or below 90%, which apparently is not the case for most adolescent patients with an R117H mutation.

after exceeding the minimum number of subjects defined in the protocol. Subjects who did not have their Study 110 was planned to be analysed with approximately 80 subjects but recruitment was halted after 70 subjects were randomised. The MAH was requested to provide a detailed justification for not proceeding to 80 patients based on power calculations and the arguments used to stop the trial recruitment. The MAH's response states that based on feasibility, enrolment in study 110 was planned for a minimum of 40 and a maximum of approximately 80 subjects. The study enrolled at the high end of the planned range (70 subjects). The MAH estimate that 50 adult patients is equivalent to approximately 18% of all the adult EU patients with an R117H allele, and approximately 40% to 60% of those eligible for a study requiring FEV1 less than 90 percent predicted. One of the scenarios for sample size estimation discussed by the MAH is that with 80 patients and assuming a treatment effect of 5% in absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 and a standard deviation (SD) of 8%, the study would have been powered at 80%. As a consequence, with 70 patients (8 of whom were not allowed to complete the full course of treatment), it seems that the study was underpowered. This may be justified by the limited number of patients available. According with the MAH there are about 1600 patients in Europe, Australia and the United States with a R117H allele and cystic fibrosis. The actual sample size of study 110 represents about 5% of them.  The fact that 38 patients were screened but considered not eligible mainly due to the requirements on percent predicted FEV1 at baseline seems to reinforce the MAH's view that the number of patients available meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria is limited. specific inclusion criterion related to the baseline percent predicted FEV1 stipulated that patients aged 12

The MAH stated that the SAP was finalised 5 days before the database lock and the unblinding of data, which guarantees the independence of the SAP to the current data. The primary analysis for the primary efficacy variable (absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24) was based on a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Data were assumed missing at random and no imputation of missing data was done for the primary analysis. The MAH was requested to clarify the assumption that missing data occurred indeed at random. According to the MAH, there was very little missing data in study 110, with only 2 subjects withdrawing from treatment during the study. These 2 subjects withdrew due to a pregnancy and non-compliance with the study protocol. There were additional 8 subjects who were not allowed to complete the full 24 weeks of treatment due to the sponsor's decision to stop the study early. All of them were considered as missing at random (MAR). While the argumentation for considering some of the cases as MAR is not fully supported, it is acknowledged that the amount of missing data is limited and that the sensitivity analyses showed that results are consistent with the underlying assumptions. Given the small amount of missing data (with at least some of them likely to be MAR), the consistency of the treatment effect estimates results from the different approaches,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

it is considered that the selection of the estimate would be unlikely to impact study conclusions. In relation to the covariance matrix used in the MMRM analysis, it has been clarified that the compound symmetry covariance matrix was used because it was found to be suitable for analyses of spirometry data in previous studies of ivacaftor. Alternative covariance matrices have been used and all results were found to be consistent with that of the primary analysis. The consistency of treatment effect over different visits was evaluated using the primary MMRM with treatment by visit interaction added to the model. To assess the robustness of the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses including pattern mixture model, dropout reason-based multiple imputation (using ANCOVA), and stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test were implemented. Regarding the Wilcoxon rank-sum test it has been clarified that no imputation of missing data was done for the primary analysis. Two patterns were modelled; the completer and early termination patterns. This is considered acceptable taking into account the small amount of missing data. A responder analysis was also conducted by categorizing the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24 as ≥ 3.5% or &lt;3.5, ≥ 5% or &lt;5%, ≥ 7.5% or &lt;7.5%, and ≥ 10% or &lt;10%. The analysis for rate of change from baseline in BMI (secondary efficacy variable) was based on a linear mixed effects model (LMM). The primary analyses for change from baseline in sweat chloride value and change from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score were similar to that of the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e. MMRM. Time to first pulmonary exacerbation was analyzed using Cox regression; additionally, Kaplan-Meier methods were used to produce graphical presentations of the survival curves by treatment and to estimate cumulative survival rates by treatment.

Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints were performed in the same manner as the primary analysis for the following subgroups: age at baseline ( ≥ 18 years and 6 to 11 years [inclusive]); percent predicted FEV1 at baseline (&lt;70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and ≥ 90% of the predicted value); geographic region (North America and Europe); sex (female and male); Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P aeruginosa ) infection status at baseline (yes and no); and R117H allele poly-T variant ( 5T, 7T, or 9T ). A subgroup analysis for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive) was not conducted because there were only 2 subjects in that age group.

The tertiary efficacy variables included pulmonary exacerbations, change from baseline in non-respiratory domains of the CFQ-R through 24 weeks of treatment, rate of change from baseline in weight, rate of change from baseline in height, CF-related complications, change from baseline in inflammatory mediators, change from baseline in qualitative microbiology cultures, change from baseline in immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), and change from baseline in faecal elastase-1. The primary analysis for tertiary efficacy variables was performed for the FAS only.

Following database lock, post-hoc analyses were carried out. These analyses were primarily focused on exploring any potential differences in results due to age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H allele poly-T variant. Additional summary statistics were also carried out based on age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and genotype characteristics.

Interim analysis (IA) for safety and efficacy was carried out after 40 subjects had completed the Week 8 visit. In order to control the overall type I error rate, a Bonferroni-type adjustment was applied. This reflected an allocated significance of 0.0052 for the IA. The significance level for the final analysis (week 24) was set at 0.0448 as enrolment was not stopped after the IA. The IA was conducted by a CRO independent of the sponsor; the CRO communicated directly with the DMC, as described in DMC Charter. Following review of the IA data and after applying the pre-specified rules, the DMC recommendation was to continue with enrolment. While the Bonferroni- type adjustment to control the overall type I error has not been justified and it is not usually applied for conducting interim analysis, the alpha levels are agreeable. The plan to handle multiplicity as stated in the SAP is endorsed. Thus, the level of significance is set at 4.48% two-sided level.

The above table shows patient disposition in study 110. One hundred and eight patients were screened, out of whom 70 patients were randomised to ivacaftor (n=36) or to placebo (n=34). Four subjects in the ivacaftor group and 2 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol violations. Four subjects in the ivacaftor group and 4 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from the CCS because they did not complete the full 24-week treatment period. A total of 32 in the ivacaftor group and 35 in the placebo group completed their full assigned duration of dosing. Two subjects in the ivacaftor group discontinued treatment prematurely: 1 because of noncompliance with the ophthalmologic examination and 1 because of pregnancy. Of the 67 subjects who completed the assigned duration of dosing, 59 subjects (28 in the ivacaftor group and 31 subjects in the placebo group) completed the full 24-week Treatment Period. The remaining 8 subjects did not complete 24 weeks of treatment because the study was terminated early by the sponsor.

## Recruitment

Study 110 was initiated on 03 July 2012 and completed on 25 October 2013 in 27 study sites in North America (25) and Europe (2 centres in the UK where 15 patients were randomised).

## Conduct of the study

The clinical study protocol was amended 4 times, 1 of which was a country-specific amendment for the UK. The final protocol (Version 4.0) is dated 11 June 2013. The main amendments were related to the clarification of the statistical analysis that was to be performed for the interim analysis and the control of the type I error. Also, amendments had to be implemented to deal with the analysis of patients who had not had their Week 24 Visit completed in the event of early study termination. These patients were to be considered to have completed their assigned treatment duration. In addition, clarifications were provided regarding concomitant medication, e.g. cycling antibiotic therapy. The exclusion of hypertonic saline use as part of the concomitant medication was removed.

A total of 70 patients were randomized (36 to placebo and 34 to ivacaftor) and 69 of them were dosed (a patient randomised to placebo was never dosed). Therefore, 69 patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS), i.e., 35 in the placebo group and 34 in the ivacaftor group. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) includes 63 patients, i.e. 33 patients on placebo and 30 on ivacaftor. Six patients were excluded from the PPS for major protocol violations.

## Outcomes and estimation

The primary efficacy variable of study 110 was the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through week 24, which is the recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF given that lung function in cystic fibrosis CF declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality.

The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for the FAS was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus 0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.11% (-1.13, 5.35). This difference was not statistically significant.  The MAH stated that this result, even if not statistically significant, favours ivacaftor. However, the lack of statistical significance and the 95%CI indicate that either an improvement or impairment are possible. In contrast, the analysis of the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 by mixed model from Week 24 through the Follow-up Visit (a treatment-free period after the last dose of ivacaftor or placebo) in study 110 showed a treatment difference (95%CI) of ivacaftor versus placebo of -2.32 (-4.28, -0.36). Results of the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable were consistent with the results of the primary analysis, i.e. no statistical significant differences between both groups of treatment were seen. Similarly, analysis of the primary variable in the PPS and CCS were consistent with the results of the analysis in the FAS.

The absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24 for individual subjects is presented in figure below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Note:Subjects who did not reach the Week 24Visit are not included in this figure

Of the 28 patients in the ivacaftor group who completed 24 weeks of treatment, 20 had an improvement in percent predicted FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment, 1 had no change in percent predicted FEV1, and 7 had a decline in percent predicted FEV1. Six of the 7 patients in the ivacaftor group who had a decline in percent predicted FEV1 were children 6 to 11 years old.

Table below shows the results of a responder analysis conducted by categorizing the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 as ≥ 3.5% or &lt;3.5%, ≥ 5% or &lt;5%, ≥ 7.5% or &lt;7.5%, ≥ 10% or &lt;10%.

Note: Absolute change through Week 24 is the average change from baseline over 24 weels for percent predictedFEV1.

Narratives were requested for those patients on ivacaftor who had an increase from baseline in percent predicted &lt;5% as well as for patients on placebo whose percent predicted FEV1 increased ≥ 5%. A total of 16 patients in the ivacaftor group had an absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 &lt;5% at Week 24 (11 females and 5 males). Of these, 7 (43.75%) had a decline in percent predicted FEV1 that ranged between -7.3 (an 11-year-old female patient with R117H-7T / F508del-9T ) to -2.0 (a 9-year-old female with R117H-7T/F508del-9T ). Five patients were females and 2 male patients. Six of these were children (i.e. under the age of 12 years) and the poly-T variant was 7T in four cases. Two patients with a stop codon mutation in the second CFTR allele had a decreased of -4.7 (an 8-year-old male patient with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

R117H-7T/S489X-7T ) and almost no change from baseline (0.6) in the case of a 22-year-old female patient with R117H-5T/G542X-9T .

Overall, the above results show that children and patients with the 7T variant tend to respond worse to ivacaftor, although the MAH suggest that age confounds the results from the R117H-7T subgroup. While the analysis of the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for all patients by sex shows that female patients have a better response to ivacaftor, among patients in the ivacaftor group who experienced a decreased from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 5 were female patients versus 2 male patients.

## Sweat chloride

The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was -26.3 mmol/L for the ivacaftor group and -2.3 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was -24.0 mmol/L (-28.0, -19.9). Table below shows the results of a responder analysis that was conducted by categorizing absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 as ≥5 or &lt;5 mmol/L decrease, ≥10 or &lt;10 mmol/L decrease, ≥15 or &lt;15 mmol/L decrease, and ≥20 or &lt;20 mmol/L decrease.

Absolute change through week 24 is the average change from baseline over 24 weeks for sweat chloride

Narratives were requested for ivacaftor-treated patients who had less than 10 mmol/L of decrease from baseline in sweat chloride and for placebo patients with a decrease equal to or above 10 mmol/L. In addition, waterfall plots of changes from baseline in sweat chloride at week 2 and at week 24 (see figure below) were provided with the individual genotypes identified.

Note: Labels on the bars give the subject's second CFTR allele followed by the poly-T tract on the Rll7H allele.

Only two patients on ivacaftor experienced a decrease in sweat chloride below 10 mmol/L. One of them was a 54-year-old male who was homozygous for R117H-7T and an 18-year-old female with R117H5T/F508del-9T . Both of them had sweat chloride values at baseline below 60 mmol/l (i.e. 43 and 45.8 mmol/l) and they experienced a mild decrease in sweat chloride at week 24 of -3.75 and -9.5 mmol/l, respectively. The number of patients on placebo who had a decrease in sweat chloride &gt;10 mmol/L at week 24 was 17, most of them with the 5T variant (12 patients). The decrease ranged between -32 mmol/L and -12.25 mmol/L. This includes three patients with a stop codon mutation in the second CFTR allele. While variability in the measure of sweat chloride may explain some of these changes, it is difficult to explain the highest decreases. Data at week 2 of study 112 shows that almost all of these patients had a decrease in sweat chloride when they were switched to ivacaftor but the magnitude of the change was, in general, limited. The change in sweat chloride at week 24 is based on 30 patients on placebo and 26 on ivacaftor out of the 35 and 34 in the overall FAS population of study 110. It is assumed that 8 patients (4 in each group) are those who were not allowed to complete 24 weeks of treatment. Two additional patients withdrew due to a pregnancy and non-compliance with the study protocol. Therefore, sweat chloride values are not available for 3 additional patients.

## Body Mass Index (BMI)

The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 by LMM in the FAS was 0.49 kg/m2 in the ivacaftor group versus 0.23 kg/m2 in the placebo group. The treatment difference (95%CI) was 0.26 kg/m2 (-1.57, 2.10). The mean change from baseline in BMI-for-age z-score (CDC growth chart for the 22 patients who were 20 years of age or younger) at Week 24 by LMM was 0.13 points in the ivacaftor group versus 0.03 points in the placebo group. The treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.10 points (0.57, 0.77). The result is not surprising since the body weight in these patients was normal (some patients were even overweight or obese) and the majority of subject were pancreatic sufficient. However,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

it would be informative to look at individual changes from baseline in body weight/BMI in underweight or pancreatic insufficient patients. Hence, the MAH was requested to perform an additional analysis in such patients. The MAH did not provide the requested data; only individual baseline characteristics and summary statistics were presented. Two and 8 patients were underweight at baseline in the ivacaftor and placebo groups, respectively. This rate is in line with the imbalance in the rate of pancreatic insufficient patients in the ivacaftor and placebo groups. Both underweight ivacaftor patients were &lt;11 years old and carried R117H-5T variant. One of the underweight ivacaftor-treated patients had weight data only until week 2 visit, and this patient had a weight gain of 1 kg from baseline by week 2. The other patient had a weight gain of 1 kg (increase in weight-for-age z-score of 0.35) and a BMI increase of 0.710 (z-score: 0.4390) by week 24. According to the data provided there was at least one patient in the placebo group who had weight gain of 2 kg (BMI increase: 0.94 kg/m2). All pancreatic insufficient patients (at baseline, based on fecal-elastase-1 values) were older than 40 years, their genotype was R117H-5T/ F508DEL-9T . Two of them received ivacaftor, 5 received placebo. All pancreatic insufficient patients were wellnourished or even obese. One patient in ivacaftor put on weight by 1.3 kg (BMI increased by 0.49 kg/m2) and the other one 2 kg (BMI increased by 0.59 kg/m2) during the 24 week period. There were only 3 patients in the placebo group who had weight and BMI values at week 24, the values varies between high boundaries, one of them lost weight by 4 kg and other put on weight by 3 kg during 24 weeks. Nutritional status has been improved in the two ivacaftor-patients, but it cannot be clearly concluded that this favourable effect is different from placebo.

Overall, based on the currently available data, a conclusion cannot be drawn on whether ivacaftor may improve nutritional status in underweight or pancreatic insufficient patients.

## Respiratory domain of the CFQ-R

The mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 was greater in the ivacaftor group (7.6 points) than in the placebo group (-0.8 points). The estimated treatment difference (95%CI) was 8.4 points (2.17, 14.61).

## Pulmonary exacerbations

All protocol defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred in patients ≥ 18 years of age. In the placebo group (n=35) 13 patients had 17 pulmonary exacerbations (event rate: 0.30) while in the ivacaftor group (n=34) 11 patients had 13 events (event rate: 0.25). The rate ratio (95%CI) was 0.84 (0.41, 1.73). The number of patients with pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or IV therapy was 6 on placebo and 2 on ivacaftor. The proportion of event-free patients was 0.69 in the ivacaftor group versus 0.58 in the placebo group. The calculated hazard ratio of 0.93 was not statistically significant. The survival curve shows that there seems to be a different temporal pattern with more pulmonary exacerbations in the ivacaftor group at the beginning of the study (e.g. Days 0-15: 3 events; Days 1656: 4 events) than in the placebo group (1 and 2 events, respectively). Whether this is related to the effect that has been described for some ivacaftor-treated patients, especially at the beginning of treatment, related to the increase in pulmonary secretions is not known.

In summary, study 110 did not meet the primary objective, which was to show that treatment with ivacaftor for 24 weeks was superior to placebo as the treatment difference in the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was not statistically significant. As for the secondary variables, changes in sweat chloride and in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R show larger changes in the ivacaftor group. The sweat chloride is considered a marker of the CFTR activity. The results of study 110 in terms of sweat chloride are reassuring when the in vitro pharmacodynamic data is considered but so far no correlation with the change in percent predicted FEV1 could have been shown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table below summarizes the tertiary efficacy endpoint results for the FAS (with the exception of number and count of pulmonary exacerbations that have been shown above). No analysis of CF-related complications was performed because no episodes of pancreatitis or DIOS occurred during the study.

## Ancillary analyses

The following pre-planned subgroups analyses were included in the SAP for the primary and secondary efficacy variables:

- -Age Group at Baseline (6 to 11years, 12 to 17 years, and ≥ 18 years);
- -Percent Predicted FEV1 Severity at Baseline (&lt;70%, 70% to 90%, &gt;90% of the predicted value);
- -Geographic Region (US and EU);
- -Sex (Female and Male);
- -Pseudomonas infection status at baseline (yes or no);
- -Poly T status ( 5T , 7T , 9T).

Only subgroup analyses by age at baseline, by poly-T variant and by baseline percent predicted are detailed. For the remaining subgroups above mentioned the results of the analyses performed on the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 are as follows: Female patients had a larger treatment difference (95%CI) than male patients, i.e. females: 3.66 percentage points (-0.92, 8.24); males: 0.09 percentage points (-5.04, 5.21). This difference is not explained by imbalances in age or R117H poly-T variant between the male and female patients, i.e. it remains basically unexplained. Among patients in the ivacaftor group who experienced a decreased from baseline in percent predicted FEV1, 5 were female patients versus 2 male patients. The treatment differences (95%CI) were larger in Europe than in North America; i.e. North America: 1.78 percentage points (-2.02, 5.59); Europe: 4.15 percentage points (-4.82, 13.12). Patients with P aeruginosa infection at baseline had a larger treatment difference than subjects without P aeruginosa infection at baseline, i.e., infected: 3.53 percentage points (-1.91, 8.98); not infected: 0.87 percentage points (-3.08, 4.81). Sweat chloride response was consistent across all subgroups and for all of them treatment differences favoured the ivacaftor group. The analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of the change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 by baseline percent predicted FEV1 (&lt;70%; ≥70% -≤90 %; &gt;90%) showed the following results:

- subgroup of &lt;70%: the mean (SE) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.45 percentage points (2.03) in the placebo group (n=15) and 4.46 percentage points (2.16) in the ivacaftor group (n=13). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was 4.01 percentage points (-2.09, 10.12).
- subgroup ≥70% -≤90%: the mean (SE) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.21 percentage points (1.63) in the placebo group (n=14) and 2.81 percentage points (1.70) in the ivacaftor group (n=14). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was 2.60 percentage points (-2.27, 7.48).
- subgroup &gt;90%: the mean (SE) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was 2.22 percentage points (1.82) in the placebo group (n=6) and -2.11 percentage points (1.64) in the ivacaftor group (n=7). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -4.32 percentage points (9.93, 1.29).

Larger absolute changes in percent predicted FEV1 were seen for the ivacaftor group across the above subgroups of baseline percent predicted FEV1, with the exception of the baseline percent predicted FEV1 &gt;90% subgroup. The figure below summarises these results.

Patients ≥ 18 Years of Age (26 patients on placebo; 24 on ivacaftor): The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for patients ≥ 18 years of age was greater for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage points) than for the placebo group (-0.46 percentage points). The treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 4.97 percentage points (1.15, 8.78). Based on the fact that a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference favouring ivacaftor versus placebo was observed in the age group of patients aged 18 years and older, the MAH sought an indication limited to adult patients. This, in the opinion of the MAH, was scientifically sound because it was already anticipated that children and adolescents could show different efficacy profiles in response to ivacaftor treatment primarily because of the differences in the manifestation of disease at different ages. Specifically, CF patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation have less advanced disease in childhood and adolescence compared to older patients. Therefore, a pre-planned subgroup analysis by patient age was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included in the SAP for the primary and secondary endpoints (although these pre-planned subgroup analyses were not intended for regulatory claims).

Consistently with an effect of ivacaftor is the fact that during the (treatment-free) Follow-up Period of Study 110, a greater decline in percent predicted FEV1 occurred in the ivacaftor group (-3.15%) than in the placebo group (-1.13%). A responder analyses for the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 shows that 13 (54.2%) ivacaftor-treated patients experienced an increase in percent predicted FEV1 of ≥ 5% versus 4 (15.4%) placebo-treated patients.

Individual patient responses for the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24 for subjects ≥18 years of age who completed 24 weeks of treatment are shown in the below waterfall plot.

Note:Subjects who did not reach the Week 24Visit are not included in this figre

Of the 21 ivacaftor-treated patients with 24 week data, 19 had an increase in percent predicted FEV1 and 1 had no change in percent predicted FEV1. Only an ivacaftor-treated  patient had a decline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24. This patient's percent predicted FEV1 values were low throughout the study: 42.3 percentage points on Day 1; 41.91 percentage points at Week 2; 44.66 percentage points at Week 4; 40.88 percentage points at Week 8; 40.88 percentage points at Week 16, and 37.44 percentage points at Week 24. This patient did not have a pulmonary exacerbation or other respiratory adverse events reported around the time of the Week 24 visit.

Regarding the secondary variables, the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride in the placebo group was -4.0 mmol/L and -25.9 mmol/L in the ivacaftor group (n=23). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -21.9 mmol/L (-26.5,-17.3). Larger mean changes were also observed for the mean change in BMI (placebo: 0.22 kg/m2; ivacaftor: 0.53 kg/m2) and in the pooled respiratory domain of the CFQ-R (placebo: -0.46; ivacaftor: 12.18). Protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred only in patients in this age group and, consequently, the results described for the overall population apply.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a consequence of the difference observed in this age group in the change in percent predicted FEV1, post-hoc analyses (following database lock) were also carried out in this age group and in the 6 to 11 year-old group. These analyses were primarily focused on exploring any potential differences in results due to subject age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H allele poly-T variant. Additional summary statistics were also carried out based on subject age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and genotype characteristics.

Results of these subgroup analyses limited to the subjects ≥ 18 years old are presented in figure below for the primary efficacy variable.

In the above subgroup analyses limited to patients ≥ 18 years old, the following trends were observed: Patients in the ivacaftor group with a baseline percent predicted FEV1 of ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% showed a larger mean change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 (5.09 percentage points) than patients in the placebo group (-1.35 percentage points). Similar results were observed in patients with a baseline percent predicted FEV1 of &lt;70% (4.46 and 0.45 percentage points respectively).  When the geographical region is considered, the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was similar between the 2 subgroups (Europe: 4.51 percentage points; North America: 4.81 percentage points). Treatment differences for change from baseline in sweat chloride (Europe: -22.6 mmol/L; North America: -22.9 mmol/L) were similar for both geographic regions. When P aeruginosa infection status at baseline is considered, a larger treatment difference in the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was seen for the patients not infected with P aeruginosa than those infected (infected: 4.32 percentage points; not infected: 5.73 percentage points). The treatment differences for absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride (infected: -23.0 mmol/L; not infected: -24.4 mmol/L) were similar for both subgroups.

Patients aged 12 to 17 years (a patient in each group): No statistical analysis was conducted because only 2 patients were enrolled.

First patient was a 13-year-old female with CFTR genotype R117H-7T/F508DEL-9T . At baseline, this patient had a percent predicted FEV1 of 87.63, a sweat chloride value of 44.25 mmol/L, a BMI of 28.04 kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 100 points. The patient was discontinued from the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

16 days after the first dose of ivacaftor due to non-compliance in completing the required ophthalmologic examination at Screening. The only Treatment Period visit that the subject had was the Week 2 Visit, at which there was no substantial change in percent predicted FEV1 (baseline 87.63; Week 2: 88.23), but the patient's sweat chloride showed a -17.25 mmol/L absolute change from baseline.

Second patient, randomised to placebo, was a 17-year-old female with a CFTR genotype R117H5T/W1282X-7T , who completed the full 24 weeks of treatment. At baseline, the subject had a percent predicted FEV1 of 88.67 percentage points, a sweat chloride value of 74.75 mmol/L, a BMI of 21.86 kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 77.78 points. At the Week 24 Visit, the patient had a 7.53 percentage points absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline and a corresponding increase in CFQ-R respiratory domain score to 94.44 points. The subject's sweat chloride value at the Week 24 Visit was slightly higher than at baseline.

Patients 6 to 11 years of age (8 patients on placebo; 9 on ivacaftor): Table below summarizes the primary endpoint, the secondary endpoints, and the relative change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 results for FAS patients 6 to 11 years of age (both inclusive). No protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred in children 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) during the treatment period.

Absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was 3.51 and -2.82% percentage points in the placebo and ivacaftor groups, respectively with the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo below zero. This is not consistent with the results observed for this age group in studies 103 ( G551D-CFTR mutation) and 111 (nonG551D-CFTR gating mutations) where the difference between placebo and ivacaftor in the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 favoured ivacaftor and was above 10 percentage points. The MAH suggest that this appears to be a spurious result driven by an unusual placebo response and generally no or minimal change in FEV1 in subjects in the ivacaftor group. The placebo group had an improvement in mean percent predicted FEV1, from 93.98% at baseline to 98.43% overall post-baseline, while the ivacaftor group had a slight decline in mean percent predicted FEV1 from 97.49% at baseline to 96.25% overall post-baseline. To further explore this issue a comparison of the change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 values was performed that showed that in the placebo group 4 patients had a decrease in percent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

predicted FEV1 between Screening and Baseline, and 6 ivacaftor patients had an increase in percent predicted FEV1 between Screening and Baseline. This could have contributed to the observed treatment difference in the primary endpoint in subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The run-in period in study 110 was used to stabilise patients before dosing them. Those patients whose clinical status was not stable during this period were excluded from the study but it would appear that there were a number of patients whose FEV1 increased or decreased during this period. The MAH was requested to discuss how exclusion criteria were applied at screening and baseline in study 110, particularly in the youngest age group.  Patients were required to be clinically stable during screening; however, FEV1 measurement is associated with a degree of inherent variability and can vary between visits, even in subjects who are clinically stable. In this respect, the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria for spirometry set an upper limit of 150 mL for variance between pulmonary function tests at the same visit/time (or 100 mL if the FVC is ≤ 1.0 L). It is accepted that variation in percent predicted FEV1 can be seen even in stable patients. However, it is still unclear why some subjects had a decrease in percent predicted FEV1 between screening and baseline in the placebo group. Moreover, the fluctuation in spirometry parameters seems very high and does not seem to be related either to the study drug or to changes in clinical status. Further clarification was requested for four patients who showed substantial changes in spirometry parameters that could not be explained either by the study drug or by changes in clinical status. No appropriate explanation for the high observed variability in FEV1 could be given other than the expected high variability in spirometry in young children in general.

Subgroup analyses by R117H poly-T variant ( 5T or 7T ): The CFTR poly-T tract is present in every copy of the CFTR gene and occurs as 1 of 3 variants ( 5T , 7T , or 9T ). R117H-5T results in a more severe disease phenotype than R117H-7T , while R117H-9T is highly unlikely to cause disease. CF genotyping was performed on all subjects at screening. Although this analysis provided the subjects' poly-T variant genotype, it did not specify the phase of the mutations, i.e. which CFTR allele each variant was located on, since different sequencing assay would have to be used. Therefore, allele-specific long-range PCR was conducted using an optional DNA sample (Sample A) from the subjects who consented to that sample. For subjects who either had DNA samples that could not be analysed or did not consent to the optional DNA samples, the poly-T variant for the R117H allele was derived if the subject had either a R117H/F508DEL or R117H/R117H genotype. All subjects who had the R117H/F508DEL genotype were considered to have one 9T variant; it was assumed that the 9T was on the F508DEL allele, and therefore the other variant ( 5T or 7T ) was on the R117H allele. This assumption was considered valid because: (1) if a subject had R117H-9T they would have had a very mild disease phenotype (e.g., sweat chloride &lt;60 mmol/L) and would not have qualified for entry into the study, and (2) a survey of the scientific literature indicates that the F508DEL allele has always been reported with the 9T variant except in some Lebanese Maronites, 1 North Iranian individual, and 1 Hispanic individual. For subjects who did not have either a R117H/F508DEL or R117H/R117H genotype, the 5T / 7T status for the R117H allele could not be derived.

In the FAS population, the number of patients with confirmed R117H-5T was 24 in the placebo group and 14 on the ivacaftor group. These figures for the R117H-7T poly-T variant were 5 and 11, respectively. The poly-T variant 5T (which usually confers an increased risk of disease severity) was more frequent in patients randomised to placebo. The poly-T variant that predominates in patients with a second mutation other than F508del is 7T . The confirmed plus derived dataset includes the following number of patients: 27 patients on placebo and 21 on ivacaftor with the 5T variant while for the 7T variant the numbers are 7 and 12 respectively. Eight of these 19 patients were children. The largest difference is seen in the number of patients in the ivacaftor group for whom a 5T variant has been derived, i.e. 7 patients. The analysis by poly-T status 5T or 7T in the confirmed plus derived dataset is based on some assumptions for 15 patients for whom the poly-T status could not be identified. The assumption related to the poly-T variant 9T in cis with the F508del mutation is acceptable. However, it is unclear how assignment of the poly-T status in cis with R117H was done for these patients with no confirmed variant. Overall, there were 19 patients with sweat chloride below 60 mmol/l (10 on ivacaftor and 9 on placebo). Out of these, 15 (7 on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo and 8 on ivacaftor) had sweat chloride values below 60 mmol/l and a confirmed poly-T status. In 10 of them the confirmed variant is 7T and in the remaining 5 it is 5T . Therefore, the assumption that if a subject had R117H-9T they would have had a very mild disease phenotype (e.g., sweat chloride &lt;60 mmol/L) does not seem completely justified. The analysis by poly-T status in the confirmed plus derived dataset should be viewed with caution. The analysis performed in the confirmed data set of the FAS shows that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 in patients with the 5T variant was 0.73 percentage points (1.20) in the placebo group and 6.02 percentage points (1.57) in the ivacaftor group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.3 percentage points [95% CI 1.3, 9.3]. For the 7T variant the results were as follows: placebo: -0.92 percentage points (3.09); ivacaftor: 0.72 percentage points (2.10). The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 0.2 percentage points (95% CI -8.1, 8.5).

In the confirmed plus derived dataset, the mean (SD) baseline percent predicted FEV1 for patients with a 5T variant was 68.30 (18.84) in the placebo group and 70.48 (17.40) in the ivacaftor group. At Week 24 these figures were as follows: 71.16 (23.10) and 74.50 (17.23) respectively. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was 1.57 (6.45) and 6.30 (7.33) in the placebo and ivacaftor groups, respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was 3.19 (-0.48, 6.87). At week 24 percent predicted FEV1 was only available for 24 and 18 patients in the placebo and ivacaftor groups respectively. As for patient with the 7T variant (confirmed plus derived), the mean (SD) baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 81.05 (9.01) in the placebo group and 84.85 (20.48) in the ivacaftor group. At Week 24 these figures were as follows: 82.32 (10.08) and 87.94 (19.24) respectively. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was 2.85 (5.93) and 0.45 (5.82) in the placebo and ivacaftor groups respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -1.46 (-8.69, 5.77). At week 24 percent predicted FEV1 was only available for 6 and 9 patients in the placebo and the ivacaftor groups respectively.

Regarding sweat chloride the results of the absolute mean change from baseline favour the ivacaftor group in patients with a 5T or a 7T variant. For patients with the 5T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 24 was -6.6 mmol/l (19.2) in the placebo group and -35.4 mmol/L (14.3) in the ivacaftor group. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -25.1 ( -30.1, 20.0). For patients with a 7T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 24 was -9.9 mmol/l (10.3) and -20.4 mmol/l (10.0) for the placebo and the ivacaftor groups respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -20.6 ( -28.1, -13.1).

It has been considered whether R117H-7T patients should be excluded from the indication as this variant leads to normal splicing and is rarely associated with disease manifestations and these are usually mild. However, severe lung disease has been also described in these patients and consequently their inclusion in the indication is supported but a cautionary warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC with a cross-reference to section 5.1 indicating the limitations of the effect seen in ivacaftor in patients with a 7T variant.  The results by the poly-T variant 7T previously shown may be confounded by age given that out of the 19 patients (confirmed plus derived dataset) in study 110 with an R117H-7T allele, 8 were children 6 to 11 years of age. Of the patients ≥18 years of age with an R117H-7T allele, 4 were in the placebo group and 6 were in the ivacaftor group. Although these numbers are small, no clear FEV1 response was evident in the subgroup of subjects ≥ 18 years of age with an R117H-7T allele either. This issue should be

taken into account by prescribing physicians. If treatment with ivacaftor is being considered for patients with an R117H mutation the phase of the poly-T variant should be identified whenever possible, as described in the SmPC.

Subgroup analyses by the second CFTR mutation: The majority of subjects (76.8%) had the F508del mutation on the second allele. Although ivacaftor can potentiate F508del-CFTR , the processing defect caused by F508de l results in minimal amounts of CFTR reaching the surface, and ivacaftor treatment did not result in clinical benefit in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Each of the other second alleles was present in no more than 2 subjects. The nonF508del second alleles are known to produce either no or truncated CFTR protein ( 2184InsA, 3659DelC , 621+1G&gt;T , E60X , G103X, G542X , R553X , S489X , and W1282X ) to cause severe processing defects ( F508Del , R560T , and DelI507 ), or to cause a severe conductance defect that is not responsive to ivacaftor in vitro ( S341P ). One ivacaftortreated patient with the genotype R117H-7T / R553X-7T had, however, a baseline sweat chloride below of 52.3 mmol/l. Table below shows summary statistics of the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 for patients in the FAS population.

*22 patients on placebo/22 patients on ivacaftor

The data above presented suggest that patients with a stop codon mutation responded worse to ivacaftor than patients with the F508del mutation as shown by an absolute change from baseline at week 24 of 2.04 versus 4.9 percentage points. In the FAS population the number of patients with the F508del mutation is 25 (71.4%) on placebo and 28 (82.4%) on ivacaftor. In age group ≥18 years of age, 19 patients in each group (73.1% on placebo, 79.2% on ivacaftor) had this mutation in the second allele of the CFTR .

Summary statistics by age subgroup were provided for the mean change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride for patients with a second CFTR mutation as follows: F508del , stop

codon mutations and 'other' mutations in the second allele. Only two patients (a child and an adult) were in both the stop codon and ivacaftor groups while five patients (an adolescent and four adults) were in both the stop codon and placebo groups.  Due to the limited data, a firm conclusions on whether patients with a second stop codon mutation respond worse to ivacaftor cannot be made. The mean change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was -4.65 (child) and 0.56 (adult) percentage points in the two ivacaftor-treated patients. In terms of the mean change in sweat chloride, data at week 24 are not available for the child while the adult patient showed a decrease of 51.5 mmol/L from baseline. In patients aged 18 years and older, an analysis is presented by the second CFTR allele (i.e. F508del ; Other) that shows the following: nineteen patients in each group had F508del as the second CFTR mutation in this age group; seven patients on placebo and 5 on ivacaftor had other mutations. The treatment difference (95%CI) for those with the F508del was 4.41 percentage points (-0.36, 9.18). The treatment difference (95%CI) for patients with other mutations was 6.85 (0.5414, 13.1500) percentage points.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No analyses were performed across trials. However, baseline data and disease characteristics of patients enrolled in study 110 were compared to those of patients enrolled in studies 102 (adult and adolescent patients with a G551D mutation), 103 (patients aged 6 to 11 years with a G551D mutation) and study 111 (patients aged 6 years and older with a nonG551D-CFTR gating mutation). It is concluded that consistently with the milder phenotype associated with the R117H-CFTR mutation patients in study 110 had lower mean sweat chloride concentrations (approximately 70 mmol/L) than subjects from studies 102, 103, and 111 (approximately 100 mmol/L). The recruited R117H subjects had well preserved BMIs (mean: 23.76 kg/m2) and a high proportion with pancreatic sufficiency. Regarding percent predicted study 110 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age had a baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 approximately 10 percentage points higher than study 103 patients and a categorical distribution favouring higher baseline percent predicted FEV1 values. Similarly, the results of these studies have been discussed to give context for the efficacy claim of study 110. In studies 102, 103, and 111 (Part 1) analysis of the primary endpoint (absolute change in percent predicted FEV1) showed a substantial treatment effect in favour of ivacaftor that was statistically significant. Treatment differences in mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 were in all cases above 10.0 percentage points. In particular, in study 103 the treatment difference was 12.5 percentage points. The relevance of data from the previous studies of ivacaftor to support its efficacy in the age subgroup of patients aged 18 years and older with a R117H mutation is questionable. Precisely because the latter patient population is usually less severe better results would have been expected. On the other hand it is acknowledged that there may be less room for showing improvement. However, there are factors (such as the poly-T variant, the usually milder phenotype etc. in the case of the R117H -CFTR mutation) that make comparisons across these populations complex.

## Clinical studies in special populations

The results of studies 110 and 112 have been discussed elsewhere in this report; both studies included paediatric population.

Two 68-year-old patients were enrolled in study 110. Both of them were randomised to placebo. One of them apparently experienced adverse events of cough, sputum increased and pyrexia that are reported as not related and of moderate severity. They were considered as non-serious AEs in study 112. A moderate increase in percent predicted FEV1 was seen for both patients after twelve and two weeks of treatment with ivacaftor in study 112. Regarding sweat chloride, no change was seen in one of these patients while for the other a decrease of 30 mmol/l was seen at week 2 of study 112. Narratives have been provided strictly for two patients ≥ 65 years old enrolled in study 110. However, the overall median age in study 110 was 32 years while it was 23 years in study 111 (nonG551D gating mutations) and 24 years in study 102 ( G551D-CFTR mutation). The maximum age reported in these studies is 68, 57 and 53

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years respectively. As a consequence, a more conservative approach would have been to consider at the very least to provide narratives for patients ≥ 60 years old. The MAH is requested to provide the number of patients ≥ 55 years old treated with ivacaftor in studies 110, 111 and 102 and the corresponding rollover studies. A total of 10 patients ≥55 years of age were treated with ivacaftor, of which 5 subjects turned 55 d uring ivacaftor treatment. In addition, 4 subjects from study 113 were ≥55 years of age during either study 113 (a pilot study testing the effect of ivacaftor on lung function in subjects with cystic fibrosis and residual CFTR function) or the rollover study 112. As a conclusion the number of patients treated with ivacaftor who are at least 55 years old is still limited.

## Supportive study

Study 112 is an ongoing, open-label, rollover study of orally administered ivacaftor (150 mg q12h) designed to evaluate the safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy of long-term (approximately 104 weeks) ivacaftor treatment. This study enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110 (patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation), study 111 (patients with a nonG551D-CFTR gating mutation), and study 113 (patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Summarized in this report are results from a study 112 interim analysis, through the Week 12 Visit, of data from patients who were previously enrolled in study 110. Patients from study 111 and study 113 who enrolled in study 112 were not included in this interim analysis.

A schematic of the study 112 design is provided in figure below.

Because patients in study 110 underwent a 3 to 4-week washout during the study 110 Follow-up Period, data from study 112 can provide additional information about ivacaftor efficacy in subjects with a R117HCFTR mutation, i.e. the purpose of the inclusion of this data in the present submission is to give support to the claim of efficacy of ivacaftor in patients aged 18 years and older. In addition, in spite of the fact that patients aged 6 to 11 years did not respond to ivacaftor in study 110 they were enrolled in study 112. Consequently, this study also provides helpful information for them. For study 110 patients who enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, the Safety Follow-up Visit for study 110 was used as the Baseline Visit for study 112. In the following, patients from the ivacaftor group in study 110 are referred to as patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (i.e., patients who received ivacaftor in study 110 and in study 112), and patients from the placebo group in study 110 will be referred to as patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group (i.e., patients who received placebo in study 110 and ivacaftor in study 112).

Of the 69 patients enrolled in study 110, 65 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, 2 enrolled in an observational arm of study 112 and 2 did not enrol in study 112 due to early discontinuation of treatment in study 110. The FAS for this interim analysis includes 65 patients: 30 patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group and 35 patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group. The 2 patients enrolled in the observational arm of study 112 were included in the Safety Set but not in the FAS. Of the 65 patients in the FAS, 64 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

completed at least 12 weeks of treatment in Study 112. A patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group discontinued between Week 2 and 12 and three other patients (1 placebo/ivacaftor and 2 ivacaftor/ivacaftor) discontinued after Week 12. Of these only one patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group discontinued dosing due to an adverse event of pulmonary exacerbation. Of the 65 patients enrolled in the ivacaftor treatment arm of study 112, 49 were ≥ 18 years of age at the start of study 110, 15 were 6 to 11 years of age, and 1 was 12 to 17 years of age. Baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 was 71.0% in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 72.7% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group, which was comparable to the baseline FEV1 in Study 110 (placebo: 70.2%; ivacaftor: 75.7%; overall: 72.9%) because of the 3 to 4week wash out at the end of study 110. In study 112, the mean baseline sweat chloride concentration was 65.4 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 55.3 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Fortynine FAS patients who were ≥ 18 years of age at the start of study 110 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112 (placebo/ivacaftor: 26 patients; ivacaftor/ivacaftor: 23 patients). Baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 was 61.9% in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 68.7% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group, which was again comparable to the baseline FEV1 in study 110 (placebo: 62.2%; ivacaftor: 67.0%). In study 112, the baseline sweat chloride concentration was 66.0 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 53.8 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Fifteen FAS patients 6 to 11 years of age at the start of study 110 enrolled in study 112 (placebo/ivacaftor: 8 patients; ivacaftor/ivacaftor: 7 subjects). Their overall baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 was 92.1% (97.5% in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 85.8% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group). Percent predicted FEV1 baseline in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group was lower than that of study 110 (97.5%). This difference was likely due to a patient who suffered a large decrease in percent predicted FEV1 during study 110 due to a pulmonary exacerbation. This subject remained on ivacaftor throughout the pulmonary exacerbation and his FEV1 returned to baseline during study 112. In study 112, the baseline sweat chloride concentration was 62.8 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 60.4 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Summary statistics were the pre-planned analysis for the overall population, patients aged ≥ 18 years, and patients aged 6 to 11 years. Following database lock additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in percent predicted FEV1 using a one-sample t-test.

## Outcomes

## Full Analysis Set, all patients (n=65)

Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.00 percentage points (7.67) and 6.04 percentage points (10.42) in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=27 from the initial number of 30 at baseline). There is a discrepancybetween the initial number of patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (30) and those for whom spirometry data is available (27) at week 12   that has been addressed by the MAH.  The reasons for the lack of data for these 3 patients have been clarified as requested. For the overall population, the mean (SD) change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 12 was 5.45 percentage points (8.91).

## Full Analysis Set, Patients ≥ 18 Years of Age (n=49)

Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.47 (7.99) percentage points and 4.73 (6.39) percentage points in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=20 from the initial number of 23 at baseline). The MAH should clarify this discrepancy in the number of patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. The mean (SD) overall absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 5.15 percentage points (7.21)

Full Analysis Set, Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only 1 patient in this age group was enrolled in the placebo/ivacaftor group,  a 17-year-old White female with R117H-5T / W1282X-7T . At study 110 baseline his percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride were 88.67 and 74.75 mmol/l. At study 112 baseline, these figures were as follows: 96.20 and 82 mmol/l, i.e. she had experienced an increase of 7.5 and 7.3 mmol/l in percent predicted FEV and sweat chloride respectively. At study 112 week 12 his percent predicted FEV1 was 100.59 (above the baseline of study 110 and study 112). At week 2 his sweat chloride was 44.5 mmol/l, i.e. a large reduction was observed with respect to baseline values of studies 110 and 112.

## Full Analysis Set, Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age (n=15)

Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 3.58 (7.76) percentage points and 9.78 (10.42) percentage points in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. There was a slight decrease in percent predicted FEV1 in the placebo/ivacaftor group at week 2 in study 112. Although the decrease is numerically very small, similar phenomenon was observed by the analysis of the youngest subgroup in study 110 that was attributed to unlucky pre-treatment trends in study 110. The MAH argues that a dip in percent predicted FEV1 in the placebo/ivacaftor group in 6-12 years old is not consistently seen across ivacaftor/ivacaftor or adult subgroups or previous studies with ivacaftor. In addition, no safety concern was raised. The argumentation, that if a drug-based mechanism was responsible for the dip at week 2, then the effect would be expected in both age groups is not completely understood, since the MAH explains the age restriction with different clinical effect of ivacaftor across age groups. No further issues are raised given the limited magnitude of the drop. The mean (SD) overall absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 6.47 percentage points (13.31).

In conclusion, the results seen in study 112 in terms of change from baseline at week 12 in percent predicted FEV1 in the placebo/ivacaftor group improve the results seen in study 110 in patients receiving ivacaftor. This is seen in the age group ≥ 18 years old, particularly in those aged 6 to 11 years old. With a single exception, the increase at week 12 in percent predicted FEV1 is higher in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group than in the placebo/ivacaftor group for all subjects and age groups. The results of the post-hoc statistical analyses performed show treatment differences between groups in percent predicted FEV1 that are statistically significant except for patients in the 6 to 11 year-old group. This is attributed to a single patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group who had an increase of 49.72 percentage points at week 12 following resolution of a pulmonary exacerbation.

However, results of study 112 require detailed discussion of the follow-up period of study 110 in which none of the patients received treatment. Summary statistics of the progression of percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride at week 24 and at the end of the follow-up period in study 110 for all patients in the FAS as well as for the age subgroups of 6 to 11 years old and ≥ 18 years old have been provided upon request. Tables below show this information and also baseline and week 12 data from study 112 for percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride.

- 6 to 11 years old: 8 on placebo/ivacaftor; 7 on ivacaftor/ivacaftor

The above table shows that in the ivacaftor group baseline values of study 112 are systematically lower than values at follow-up of study 110. This leads to an increase in the change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 12 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.

Regarding sweat chloride (see table below), the same applies, i.e. sweat chloride values at follow-up of study 110 and at study 112 baseline do not coincide with the highest differences seen in the ivacaftor group. The only exception corresponds to the analysis of all FAS patients in which the mean sweat chloride at follow-up of study 110 is higher than that at study 112 baseline. The decrease in the mean absolute change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor in study 112 was of similar magnitude in the placebo/ivacaftor and ivacaftor/ivacaftor groups and ranged from a minimum of 14.8 mmol/l (patients ≥ 18 years old) in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group to a maximum of 25.4 mmol/l (age group from 6 to 11 years) also in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This extension of the indication of Kalydeco to patients with cystic fibrosis with an R117H-CFTR mutation is based on a single, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (study 110) of 24 weeks of duration. As such, and in line with regulatory guidance, this study is expected to provide a compelling evidence of efficacy in the concerned patient population. CF being a rare disease and the allele R117H not as frequent as other CFTR mutations such as F508del it is justified that a single study is conducted. In Europe, North America, and Australia, approximately 1,600 people with CF aged 6 years and older have at least 1 copy of an R117H-CFTR mutation according to the MAH. Study 110 enrolled 70 patients in North America and Europe and was terminated prematurely by the sponsor. The MAH justified this with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the limited number of available patients with an R117H allele and CF who would meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in particular the restrictions imposed by baseline percent predicted FEV1. This is reinforced by the fact that out of the 108 patients screened in study 110, 38 could not be randomized mainly due to the failure to meet the inclusion criterion related to percent predicted FEV1.

Of the three main pillars on which the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is based the great are of uncertainty is related to the decision on whether the two mutations present are disease-causing. This is particularly the case of the R117H mutation that is described as a mutation of variable penetrance. Therefore, it would appear that requiring two disease-causing mutations AND a compatible clinical (lung disease) AND biochemical (i.e. sweat chloride values well in the range of the disease) phenotype (rather than two diseasecausing mutations OR a sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L) could have overcome issues related to patients/mutations having a normal sweat chloride value at baseline. As the diagnostic criteria of CF used in study 110 stipulated that chronic sinopulmonary should be presented no further issues were raised except for the charcaterisation of patients with sweat chloride below 60 mmol/L.

Additional concerns of the CHMP included differences in baseline of study population in terms of severity of the lung disease: P aeruginosa lung infection/colonisation at baseline (one of the main phenotypic features of CF lung disease) was present in 54.3% of patients on placebo and 44.1% of patients on ivacaftor. The mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 in the FAS population was 70.23% in the placebo group and 75.70% in the ivacaftor group. In the oldest age group these values are 62.21% and 67.03%. Pancreatic insufficiency was also more frequent in the placebo group (28.6% versus 8.8%).  In the confirmed plus derived dataset the number of patients on placebo with the poly-T variant 5T is 27 and 21 on ivacaftor. In the age group ≥ 18 years old these numbers are 21 and 17 respectively. The treatment difference in the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was not statistically significant. However, in a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age, a difference between treatment groups was seen, which favoured ivacaftor in the age group ≥ 18 years of age. Data from patients ≥18 years of age were considered independently based on the following:

- ivacaftor has been proven to be effective for other CFTR mutations based on its mechanism of increasing CFTR channel open probability,
- there is age-based heterogeneity in the Full Analysis Set of patients enrolled in study 110
- more patients ≥ 18 years of age were enrolled than the minimum enrolment target set for the entire study
- biological plausibility exists for a different treatment response in the age groups
- a consistency of treatment effect is observed across subgroups when limited to subjects ≥ 18 years of age, and
- the study 110 results were replicated in study 112

The MAH supplied plausible explanation for the differential results seen in adults and children with an R117H mutation. While there is no age dependency on the effect of ivacaftor at the level of the sweat gland, the lungs of CF patients are progressively damaged with age. Three types of additional analyses have been provided and discussed by the MAH: a forest plot analysis of absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 among the subgroups, including P values and the treatment by subgroup interaction as requested (refer to the description of the results of study 110), a regression analysis (conducted by FDA) and a data-driven tree procedure, labelled as 'interaction trees'. Unlike other subgroups, there is a clear separation of the point estimates for the age subgroups, and the confidence intervals are nonoverlapping. Furthermore, the age is the most significant predictor of therapeutic effect. The regression analysis considered partitions by baseline FEV1 (&lt;70% predicted, 70% to 90% predicted, and &gt;90%) and by poly-T variant genotype ( 5T or 7T ). Both factors were correlated with age because subjects 6 to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

11 years of age had higher baseline FEV1 and were more likely to have R117H-7T allele. In the 6 to 11 year-old group, only 8% of the patients have decreased FEV1 and 46% of the patients have no clinical symptoms at all. According to published data, the average age when mild form of CF is diagnosed is 11.8 years. It is noted that there are reports of serious clinical symptoms in younger children, but the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation registry data provided by the MAH show that clinical symptoms which require medical treatment are indeed more common over the age of 18 years. It is acknowledged, however, that numbers in the children group are limited and that the results in this group may be partially driven by the fact that a high number of children have well-preserved lung function and the 7T variant.

In addition, patients with the 7T allele are a cause for concern as they represent a separate subgroup. The average response is practically zero, hence some patients improved and some patients actually deteriorated. Given the extremely small sample size (ivacaftor n= 4, placebo n= 6) it is not possible for the CHMP to draw any firm conclusion. Treatment decisions should be made considering all factors in the clinical practise. An adequate warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC with a crossreference to section 5.1.

Overall, based on the above information, the CHMP concluded that an indication for adult patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation could be approvable.

In the context of a potential extrapolation from adults to children, the MAH was requested to discuss treatment with ivacaftor for patients with lung disease as shown by percent predicted FEV1 equal to or less than 90% given the results seen in the adult group of patients included in study 110. This has been rejected by the MAH on grounds that lung disease may exist even in the presence of a normal percent predicted FEV1 and also because the data set available in study 110 to support defining a percent predicted FEV1 cut-off for the R117H mutation is limited. No other proposals were discussed but it is recognised that there may be young patients with an R117H mutation for whom treatment with ivacaftor could be considered based on clinical findings. These are, for instance, not only percent predicted FEV1, but also its trajectory over time, as well as the frequency of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and pulmonary infections (such as P. aeruginosa ), the period at which a patient is at greater risk of decline in lung function (e.g. adolescence) and the presence of additional risk factors such as the 5T variant. This was acknowledged and therefore, the CHMP accepted that an indication based on a pre-specified percent predicted FEV cut-off was not reasonable.

The MAH was also requested to discuss the available evidence of benefit in treating adult and paediatric patients with an R117H mutation who have well preserved lung function. However, in study 110 almost all subjects with higher than 90% percent predicted FEV1 at baseline were children, due to the inclusion criteria. The efficacy data are therefore almost the same in the subgroup of patients with &gt;90% percent predicted FEV1 baseline as in the subgroup of children: FEV1 and the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R data favoured placebo and even the individual results suggest that the true effect of ivacaftor seems zero in these subjects. In study 103 (children with a G551D-CFTR mutation), 52 children aged 6 to less than 12 years old were enrolled to receive placebo or ivacaftor 150 mg BID. Their mean baseline PPFEV1 was around 85% (as compared to 94.0 and 97.5 percentage points in the placebo group and ivacaftor groups of study 110 respectively). The mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was greater in the ivacaftor group (12.58%) than in the placebo group (0.13%) with an estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo of 12.45 percentage points (95% CI: 6.56, 18.34). In study 111 (patients with gating mutations other than G551D ) the treatment difference was 9.8 percentage points (14 patients in the ivacaftor group and 13 in the placebo group). In contrast, a seemingly deteriorating effect was observed in children in study 110 and there are practically no data in adolescents. Beyond central values and statistical considerations even individual data suggest that the true effect of ivacaftor may be zero. Or rather more precisely, these effects -even if exist- are undetectable by parameters such as spirometry, CFQ-R rating scale or measurement of indirect nutritional parameters in such a relatively short duration. No new data can be generated for the moment. There is some evidence from case reports

that children with an R117H-CFTR mutation may be clinically ill but the benefit of ivacaftor has not been proven in this age group. Consequently, the indication remains restricted to adult patients.

A stopping rule based on sweat chloride for patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation was also proposed for patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation and not for patients with gating mutations which (as a group) are believed to be at an increased risk for more progressive and aggressive lung disease. Furthermore, two published papers (Seliger V et al, 2013; Durmowicz A et al, 2013) were discussed at the time of assessment of the extension of the indication of Kalydeco to patients with CFTR gating mutations other than G551D that show that some patients may respond to ivacaftor in spite of the fact that their sweat chloride did not decrease at least 20 mmol/l from baseline.  However, the studies by Selinger and Durmowitz are based on limited datasets (patients with G551D-CFTR mutation). The MAH was requested to perform a similar analysis of study 110 versus studies 102, 103 and 111. Scatter plots of absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24 (week 8 for study 111) sorted by type of mutation ( G551D versus R117H ) versus absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at the earliest point in time at which it was measured in each of the studies considered were provided for the ivacaftor and placebo groups. The graphical inspection of the scatter plots provided show that almost all patients with a G551D-CFTR mutation who showed a decrease in sweat chloride of at least 20 mmol/l also showed an increase (improvement) in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24. More variability in response was seen in patients with nonG551D gating mutations and in patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation.  However, no correlation was found for ivacaftor-treated patients with the exception of children with an R117H-CFTR mutation (n=5) for whom the correlation coefficient was -0.70. The inspection of the scatter plot of study 110 shows that sweat chloride values were not sufficiently discriminative at the level of individual patients in order to make a decision on whether a particular patient should stop treatment with ivacaftor when sweat chloride level has not decreased. This conclusion is based on the database provided that only includes patients with sweat chloride and FEV1 values available at the points in time above requested (i.e., first available value of sweat chloride and the one of percent predicted FEV1).

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The CHMP raised several questions during the assessment of the results of study VX11-770-110. However, after the assessment of the responses of the MAH, no issues pertaining to clinical efficacy were pending since the MAH adequately responded to all raised issues. The CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk ratio in the extended indication of Kalydeco is positive and the new indication is:

Kalydeco tablets are  indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

Kalydeco is also indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

A cautionary statement is included in section 4.4 in relation to patients with an R117H 7T genotype and a cross-reference to section 5.1 was made where results by poly-T status are mentioned (including the limitations of such an analysis given the small numbers of patients with a confirmed 7T variant). The physicians are advised that less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H -7T mutation associated with less severe disease. Whenever possible the phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be determined as this may be informative in considering treatment of patients with an R117H mutation.

## 2.4.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The MAH provided 24-week safety data from patients with cystic fibrosis who have an R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene exposed to ivacaftor and/or placebo in study 110. Week 12 interim data from the long-term (104 weeks) open-label study 112 are also submitted. This study enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a nonG551D-CFTR mutation), and study 113 (patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Only serious adverse events from patients from study 110 are addressed. Therefore, the main basis for the safety analysis is study 110.

## Patient exposure

The safety set of study 110 includes 69 patients who have received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor or placebo in study 110. Out of these 69 patients, 45 received treatment (21 on ivacaftor, 24 on placebo) for a period equal or longer than 24 weeks. The number of patients who received at least 24 weeks of treatment is below the expected number of 59 (i.e. 8 patients who could not complete the 24-week course of treatment plus the two ivacaftor-treated patients who discontinued prematurely). This discrepancy is assumed to be due to patients who missed some of their doses. Of the 69 patients enrolled in study 110, 65 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112 and 2 enrolled in the observational arm of study 112.  Two patients did not enrol in study 112 due to early discontinuation of treatment in study 110. All ongoing patients completed the Week 12 Visit in study 112, with the exception of 1 subject.

## Adverse events

In study 110, the proportion of patients with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 94.1% (32/34) versus 100% (35/35) in the placebo group. The System Organ Class (SOC) with the highest incidence of adverse events during both treatments was infections and infestations (61.8% of ivacaftortreated patients and 68.6% of placebo-treated patients). By Preferred Term, the AEs with the highest incidence in both treatment groups were infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (38.2% [13 patients] in the ivacaftor group and 40.0% [14 patients] in the placebo group) and cough (29.4% [10 patients] in the ivacaftor group and 25.7% [9 pateints] in the placebo group). Sputum increased was reported by 5 (14.7%) ivacaftor-treated patients and 4 (11.4%) placebo-treated patients (see table below).

Notes: SOC and PT within SOC were sorted in descendimg order of frequency in the ivacaftor colummn. A subject with multiple events within an SOC or within a PT was counted only once within an SOC or PT, respectively. Adverse events were coded from MedDR.A, Version 15.1.

Taking into account the limited sample size it can be questioned that only those adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with ivacaftor are summarised. In particular those adverse events that have been specifically requested to be followed in the PSURs such as hypersensitivity reactions, depression and suicide/self-injury, cataracts, haemoptysis and hyperbilirubinaemia are very unlikely to be captured with this approach. The MAH responded that the AEs of depression and suicide/self-injury, cataracts, and hyperbilirubinemia did not occur in either treatment group in study 110 while hypersensitivity and haemoptysis occurred only in placebo-treated patients; hence, no update to the SmPC was needed. The CHMP made the following observations after assessing the submitted data: while abdominal pain was reported for 4 patients in the ivacaftor group and none in the placebo group, there were also two additional preferred terms of 'abdominal pain upper', 'abdominal discomfort' making a total of 8 patients on ivacaftor with these related symptoms versus 2 on placebo. 'Abdominal tenderness' is an additional related preferred term that was reported by a placebo-treated patient. Within the SOC of 'Investigations', the number of Preferred Terms related to results of liver function tests include 'alanine aminotransferase increased', 'blood bilirubin increased', 'hepatic enzyme increase' and 'liver function test abnormal'. While it is stated that no patients experienced hyperbilirubinemia in study 110, the AE data in children include a case of blood bilirubin increased (apparently below 2xULN). Overall, this does not change the conclusions about the safety of ivacaftor but is relevant information for the Product Information and, consequently, the MAH was requested to recalculate the frequency of these and other adverse events that seem to be split in different preferred terms. Consequently, an extensive revision of section 4.8 was performed by the MAH, also in line with the SmPC guideline. This is acceptable to the CHMP.

The incidence of patients with AEs considered by the investigator to be related or possibly related to the study drug was 8.8% (3 patients) in the ivacaftor group and 20.0% (7 patients) in the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One (2.9%) patient in the ivacaftor group had an AE of increased C-reactive protein (CRP) that was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Regarding the severity of the adverse events reported, compared with placebo, ivacaftor was associated with a higher incidence of mild events (50.0% during ivacaftor treatment versus 28.6% during placebo treatment) and a lower incidence of severe events (2.9% during ivacaftor treatment versus 14.3% during placebo treatment). There were no life-threatening adverse events in this study.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There were no deaths in study 110. Four patients (11.8%) treated with ivacaftor and 6 patients (17.1%) treated with placebo reported serious adverse events (SAE). The most common SAE in both treatment groups was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF: 3 patients (8.8%) in the ivacaftor group and 6 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group. SAEs of cellulitis and constipation each occurred in 1 (2.9%) patient in the ivacaftor group. None of the SAEs were considered related to the study drug. Patients from study 110 who rolled into study 112 reported a total of 12 SAEs. These SAEs were reported by 8 patients treated with ivacaftor (there were no SAEs in the observational arm). Of the 12 SAEs, 9 were infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF (one of them was considered possibly related to study drug), 1 was influenza, and two were angioedema and urticaria. There were no SAEs in the observational arm.

## Laboratory findings

Results of all Liver Function Tests (LFT) at all-time points were not available for 6 patients in the placebo group and 7 patients in the ivacaftor group and hence, the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in LFT could not be determined. The narratives of the 4 patients randomised to ivacaftor who did not complete 24 weeks of treatment show that in study 110 none of these patients had laboratory results in which alkaline phosphatise was &gt;2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT was &gt;3 x ULN, AST was &gt;3 x ULN, or total bilirubin was &gt;2 x ULN. Out of the 13 patients with no LFT values at week 24, two additional patients discontinued the study and in the remaining 3 patients (one of them on ivacaftor) LFT measurements were not performed at week 24 for unexplained reasons. While the incidence of shifts from normal to high LFT values at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 was low (&lt;15% across study visits), and there was no clear pattern for an increasing incidence of shifts over time in either treatment group for alkaline phosphatase, AST, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), this is not the case for ALT for which 4 patients in the ivacaftor group (versus none  in the placebo group) had a shift from normal at baseline to high at week 24. In the ivacaftor group, no patients had a maximum ALT or AST that was &gt;5 × ULN. Two patients (5.9%) had at least 1 maximum ALT value &gt;2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN. One patient had at least 1 maximum ALT value &gt;3 x ULN to ≤ 5 x ULN; this patient also had at least 1 maximum AST value &gt;2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN. Figures of liver function tests show that there is an overlap of values between both treatment groups for almost all liver function tests. However, the mean change in total bilirubin is systematically higher in the ivacaftor group with almost no overlapping between groups. The magnitude of the change is limited as shown by a maximum mean change of 5 micromol/L (i.e. 0.3 mg/dl).  Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the lab abnormalities being followed in the PSURs.  In study 110, no subjects had a maximum total bilirubin value &gt;2 × ULN in either treatment group.

A considerable degree of overlapping exists in the mean change of other chemistry parameters that have been plotted over time (e.g., albumin, total protein and creatinine); however, in general, the magnitude of the changes is limited. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (sec), Prothrombin Time (sec) and Prothrombin Time INR (ratio) were the coagulation parameters determined. There is no hint that ivacaftor affects coagulation but the results of the analysis of these parameters in study 110 should be viewed with caution due to the fact that a considerable number of samples were affected by an insufficient sample.

With respect to ECG assessment, no subject had a QTc value greater than 500 msec. Two patients had maximum increases into the category of &gt;450 to ≤ 480 msec in QT interval corrected by Bazett ' s

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

formula (QTcB) in the ivacaftor group. One patient (2.9%) in the placebo group and 4 patients (11.8%) in the ivacaftor group had maximum increases of &gt;30 to ≤ 60 msec in QTcB. No patients in the placebo group and 2 patients (5.9%) in the ivacaftor group had maximum increases of &gt;30 to ≤ 60 msec in QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF). No patient had a maximum on-treatment increase from baseline in QTc interval &gt;60 msec. The CHMP did not raise a concern.

## Safety in special populations

Analyses of the incidence of adverse events by subgroups in study 110 were discussed by the MAH only for those occurring in at least 15% of patients, something that makes their interpretation more difficult. A total of 17 patients aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive), 2 patients in the 12 to 17 years (inclusive), and 50 patients in the ≥ 18 year-old group were included in study 110. In the ≥ 18 year-old subgroup, 26 patients received treatment with placebo, and 24 patients received treatment with ivacaftor. Among patients aged 6 to 11 years, 8 patients received placebo and 9 patients received ivacaftor. Table below shows adverse event that occurred in at least 15% of patients sorted out by age group.

Notes: A subject with multiple events within an SOC or within a PT was coumted only once within an SOC or PT, respectively. Adverse events were coded from MedDRA, Version 15.1.

More patients on placebo than on ivacaftor reported adverse events in the ≥ 18 year-old age group, i.e. 26 (100.0%) patients versus 23 (95.8%) respectively. Adverse events more commonly reported by ivacaftor-treated patients (as compared to placebo) were nasal congestion (20.8% on ivacaftor versus 3.8% on placebo), oropharyngeal pain (16.7% and 0% respectively), and wheezing (16.7% versus 3.8% respectively). In the 6 to 11 year-old group all patients in each treatment group reported at least an adverse event. Adverse events reported by children were oropharyngeal pain (25.0% on ivacaftor versus 11.1% on placebo, respectively), nasal congestion (12.5% versus 0% respectively), abdominal pain (22.2% versus 0%, respectively) and headache (22.2% versus 12.5% respectively). The incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF in the ≥ 18 years subgroup was 45.8% (11 patients, 14 events) in the ivacaftor group and 50.0% (13 patients, 23 events) in the placebo group. The incidence of cough was 37.5% (9 patients, 12 events) in the ivacaftor group and 26.9% (7 patients, 8 events) in the placebo group. None of the subjects in the ≥ 18 years or 6 to 11 years subgroups had haemoptysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Given that only those adverse events that occurred in at least 15% of patients are discussed, the MAH has been requested to provide in tabular format the number and percentage of all adverse events per treatment group sorted out by SOC and Preferred Term, which was performed by the MAH. Two patients (8.3%) in the ivacaftor group and 6 patients (23.1%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 SAE in the ≥ 18 years subgroup. The most common SAE in both treatment groups was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF. One patient had a SAE of cellulitis in the ivacaftor group.

There was 1 pregnancy in study 110, where the patient received her last dose at study Week 16; no doses were missed. Based on the subject's history of premature rupture of membranes, she had a cervical cerclage procedure performed at 14 weeks and 2 days of gestation. She was admitted for cervical insufficiency at 15 weeks gestation and developed gestational diabetes mellitus at 25 weeks and 5 days. The subject delivered a healthy baby at 28 weeks gestation via caesarean section due to premature rupture of membranes. The investigator confirmed that cervical insufficiency and gestational diabetes were not AEs.

A total of 13 patients with a baseline percent predicted FEV1% &lt;70% received ivacaftor; in the categories of ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% and &gt;90% these numbers were 14 and 7, respectively. These figures for patients receiving placebo were 15, 14 and 6, respectively. The incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF was similar during both treatments for the three baseline FEV1% predicted categories. However, in the category of baseline percent predicted FEV1 &lt;70% the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations was higher than in the other two categories, i.e. 8 (53.8%) patients on ivacaftor versus 5 (35.7%) in those with ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% and 1 (14.3%) in those with &gt;90%. The incidence of adverse events in the SOC 'Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders' is higher in the ivacafor group than in the placebo group for patients with baseline percent predicted &lt;70%. Six (42.6%) patients on ivacaftor and 5 (33.3%) on placebo reported cough. Nasal congestion was reported by 1 (6.7%) and 5 (38.5%) patients, respectively. Oropharyngeal pain was reported only by 4 (30.8%) ivacaftor-treated patients. Other adverse events reported by more ivacaftor-treated patients are wheezing (3 patients vs. 1), upper-airway cough syndrome (2 patients vs. none on placebo). No ivacaftor-treated patients reported haemoptysis during study 110. However, this adverse event was reported by 6 placebo-treated patients (5 of them in the category of percent predicted FEV1&lt;70%).

The overall incidence of patients with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 95.8%, (23 patients, 119 events) in North America and 90.0% (9 patients, 37 events) in Europe. The overall incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF during ivacaftor treatment was 33.3% (8 patients) in North America and 50.0% (5 patients) in Europe. In placebo group, the overall incidence of patients with adverse events was 100.0% (30 patients, 173 events) in North America and 100.0% (5 patients, 31 events) in Europe; the  incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF was 33.3% (10 patients, 13 events) in North America and 80.0% (4 patients, 11 events) in Europe. The higher incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and haemoptysis in Europe in the placebo group was justified by the small number of patients in this subgroup and the fact that all 5 patients in the Europe placebo subgroup were ≥ 18 years of age. By comparison, the North America placebo subgroup included patients 6 to 11 years of age (8 patients), 12 to 17 years of age (1 patient), and ≥ 18 years of age (21 patients).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

No patients had adverse events that led to study drug interruption during ivacaftor treatment. During ivacaftor treatment, 2 patients missed doses of ivacaftor treatment (one case missed 8 doses, one case missed one dose) due to AEs of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF. The events were considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug. Two patients in the placebo group had AEs that led to study drug interruption. One patient had dehydration, gastroenteritis, and hypokalaemia that were considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug. An additional patient had diarrhoea

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and vomiting and missed 14 doses of placebo. The events resolved and were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug.

## Post marketing experience

Adverse events of special interest that are being monitored in the PSURs are hypersensitivity reactions, depression and suicide/self-injury, haemoptysis and hyperbilirubinaemia. Due to the finding of a doserelated increase in cataracts in juvenile rats in a nonclinical study, an ophthalmologic examination was performed at screening for all subjects. A follow-up ophthalmologic examination was also carried out in subjects aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) at Week 24. Minimal changes in visual acuity were observed in both treatment groups, and no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment were detected. No subjects developed lens opacities during study 110. According to the MAH the noncongenital cases are confounded by the absence of a pre-treatment ophhalmological examination and a strong risk factor for development of cataract such as diabetes type I, corticosteroid use or familiar history of cataract. However, in one of the cases the patient underwent an eye examination prior to initiation of ivacaftor, without mention of cataracts and other of the patients underwent ophthalmological examination during treatment with ivacaftor without diagnostic of cataract but a follow-up ophthalmological examination several months after identified lens opacity. Therefore, a causal association to ivacaftor in these 2 cases could not be excluded. In addition, the progression of these lens abnormalities and the impact on vision in the long-term exposure is unknown. Given that lens opacities (cataracts) observed in the juvenile rat toxicity study were considered ivacaftor-related, there is a plausible causal relationship. This was already addressed by the PRAC and an adequate warning was included in the PI of Kalydeco tablets. Cataracts are being followed in the PSURs. At the time of assessment of the current procedure the MAH informed CHMP that a report of cataracts had been received in a paediatric patient older than 12 years old via PSUR.

## 2.4.6. Discussion on clinical safety

The MAH provided 24-week safety data from patients with cystic fibrosis who have an R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene exposed to ivacaftor and/or placebo in study 110. The safety set of this study includes 69 patients who have received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor or placebo. Week 12 interim data from the long-term (104 weeks) open-label study 112 are also submitted. This study enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a non-G551DCFTR mutation), and study 113 (patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Analysis of the occurrence of AEs and SEAs, including events of special interest, laboratory parameters, safety data in special populations, etc., did not reveal major inconsistencies with the already known profile of ivacaftor. The CHMP requested some re-calculations of originally submitted analyses and these were provided by the MAH. The current Product Information of this medicinal product reflects the latest safety profile.

## 2.4.7. Conclusions on clinical safety

In conclusion, the CHMP was of the opinion that the safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with R117HCFTR mutation in study 110 was consistent with the one already known for this medicinal product. Some concerns were raised in order to clarify or to provide further safety data related to liver toxicity and coagulation parameters among others, but they were not considered critical and have been adequately addressed by the MAH during this procedure; the SmPC reflects the most up-to-date safety profile of Kalydeco.

## 2.4.8. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle should follow the EURD list.

## 2.5. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.6 is acceptable. An updated risk management plan consolidating the versions submitted for procedures EMEA/H/C/002494/X/0034G (version 4.8) and EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0027 (version 4.6) was submitted within version 4.9. In addition, minor revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update. The PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.9 with the following content:

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Ivacaftor 150 mg administered every 12 hours for 24 weeks has been associated with an improvement in the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 in a subgroup of patients aged 18 years and older with cystic fibrosis and an R117H mutation of the CFTR who were enrolled in a 24-week, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study 110. The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 for patients ≥ 18 years of age was greater for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage points) than the placebo group (-0.46 percentage points). The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 4.97 percentage points (95% CI: 1.15, 8.78). Percent predicted FEV1 is the recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF given that lung function in CF declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. This improvement in FEV1 was accompanied by a decrease from baseline in sweat chloride (a marker of CFTR activity) and by an increase in the respiratory domain of the pooled Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) that was above the minimal clinically important difference. Descriptive statistics show that the improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was observed in this age group in patients with baseline percent predicted FEV1 equal to or below 90% (a single adult patient was enrolled with percent predicted FEV1 &gt;90%). Similarly, the results indicate that the presence of the poly-T variant 5T, which is known to affect the phenotypic expression of patients carrying the R117H mutation, does not seem to impair the effect of ivacaftor on these patients.

In the overall population of study 110, the effect on sweat chloride in the ivacaftor arm was consistent across all age groups. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was 26.3 mmol/L for the ivacaftor group and -2.3 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was -24.0 mmol/L (-28.0, -19.9).

After the last dose of ivacaftor or placebo in study 110 patients were followed for 3 to 4 weeks before being enrolled in study 112, a roll-over, ongoing study intended to address the long-term safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with a R117H-CFTR mutation (patients with nonG551D gating mutations are also being followed in this study). The data provided seem to show that, as a group, during the treatment-free follow-up period patients who were on ivacaftor lost their moderate gain in percent predicted FEV1 seen during the 24-treatment period of study 110. Similarly, the limited data provided for study 112 (12-week interim analysis) show that patients who were randomised to placebo in study 110 improved their FEV1 when they started to receive ivacaftor in study 112. This was also the case of patients who were initially randomised to ivacaftor and enrolled in study 112.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Study 110 where ivacaftor 150 mg was administered every 12 hours for 24 weeks did not meet its objective, as treatment with ivacaftor was not shown to be statistically different from placebo in a number of efficacy variables including change in percent predicted FEV1, change in BMI and time to first pulmonary exacerbation. The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 for the FAS (all patients) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus 0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.11 percentage points (-1.13, 5.35). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age, a difference between treatment groups favouring ivacaftor in the age group ≥ 18 years was observed. In the adult group, although larger mean changes were observed for the mean change in BMI for the ivacaftor group (placebo: 0.22 kg/m 2 ; ivacaftor: 0.53 kg/m 2 ), the 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was (-1.90, 2.51).  Similarly, it is not known whether ivacaftor may be efficacious in adult patients with a percent predicted FEV1 above 90% since only a single adult patient on ivacaftor was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

available for the analysis while in children the effect seem favoured the placebo group. Hence, no amendments to the prescriber's information in this respect can be justified.

In essence, positive results from a subgroup analysis in the event of a failed primary endpoint in a pivotal trial are not sufficient for gaining regulatory approval unless there are exceptional circumstances. The draft guidance 'EMA/CHMP/539146/2013, Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials', classifies the current situation as 'Scenario 3': 'The clinical data presented fail to establish statistically persuasive evidence but there is an interest in identifying a subgroup, where a relevant treatment effect is evident and there is compelling evidence of a favourable risk-benefit'. This guidance defines the minimum requirements that should be met in order to justify 'exceptional circumstances'. Overall, it is accepted that the results in the adult group have biological plausibility and that further analyses performed support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in this group when all other evidence is considered.

The effect of discontinuing prescribed therapies for CF while remaining on ivacaftor treatment has not been evaluated. During study 110, patients continued on their prescribed CF therapies. Thus, ivacaftor will remain recommended for use in addition to other prescribed therapies for CF.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with an R117H -CFTR mutation in study 110 was consistent with that observed in studies 102, 103 and 111 in patients with gating mutations and no new safety concerns emerge from the review of the safety data. The AEs with the highest incidence in both treatment groups were infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF and cough. The number of pulmonary exacerbations reported for safety purposes is usually higher than the number of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations analysed for efficacy that should meet stricter criteria. AEs for which the incidence was at least 5% higher with ivacaftor treatment than with placebo treatment included nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, wheezing, upper airway cough syndrome, bacterial disease carrier and others. All of them were reported previously. In the ivacaftor group, no patients had a maximum ALT or AST value that was &gt;5 × ULN. Two patients had at least 1 maximum ALT value &gt;2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN. Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the laboratory abnormalities being monitored in the PSURs. AEs associated with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) occurred in 3 (8.6%) subjects in the placebo group and 1 (2.9%) subject in the ivacaftor group. Lens opacities, which are of concern in the paediatric population, were not reported in study 110. The risks are considered to be in line with previous findings, no other significant unfavourable effect could be observed in studies 110 and 112. Overall, the safety profile of ivacaftor was well characterised and remains within that observed with the use so far. Adverse drug reactions and potential risks are readily identified clinically or with routine laboratory monitoring, and are considered adequately managed with appropriate risk-management tools described in the SmPC and in the RMP.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

It is likely that the limited number of patients enrolled in study 110 contributed to the difficulty to capture the AEs that occur less frequently. The MAH is obliged to monitor and report a number of specific AE in the PSURs, which is reassuring. The SmPC reflects the most accurate safety information on ivacaftor and is hence considered acceptable to the CHMP. As discussed previously, the newly available data do not alter the overall safety profile of Kalydeco.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

CF lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Patients with CF typically experience a progressive loss of lung function, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure. The rate of FEV1 decline may vary depending on several factors, such as genotype and environmental factors. Correlation between the genotype and the lung disease phenotype is particularly weak. The R117H-CFTR mutation is considered to have variable penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to cystic fibrosis. This phenotypic variability has been mainly attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H .

Although study 110 did not achieve its objective, i.e. ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks was not shown to be statistically different from placebo in a number of efficacy variables including change in percent predicted FEV1, a difference between treatment groups was seen that favours ivacaftor in the age group ≥ 18 years in a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age. As a consequence, the claimed indication was restricted to this age group; adults with CF who had an R117H-CFTR mutation.

While the R117H mutation may cause a disease that is in the less severe spectrum of CF, it may be associated with severe disease when compared to a normal population. Overall, it was accepted that the results seen in the adult group have biological plausibility and that the further analyses performed support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in this age group when all other evidence is considered.

In summary, based on the above information, the CHMP concluded that an indication for adult patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation could be approvable and would bring benefit to the patient with this diagnosis.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Cystic fibrosis represents an area with a high-unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. In patients with CF, lung function declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. Treatments that target the underlying chloride transport defect by restoring the function of the CFTR protein may decrease the morbidity and increase the lifespan of individuals with CF. In addition, the opportunity to intervene at an earlier stage in the progression of disease may further limit organ damage, reduce the morbidity, and prolong life. Although there is evidence of a pharmacodynamic response to ivacaftor in patients with an R117H mutation, no statistically significant improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was observed with ivacaftor in the overall study population in study 110. However, in the subgroup of patients aged 18 years and older an effect of ivacaftor cannot be excluded. In addition, further analyses have been performed that support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in patients with clinical manifestations of CF, in particular with lung disease, who had an R117H-CFTR mutation. The main exception refers to patients with the 7T variant. The apparent lack of efficacy of ivacaftor in this group of patients is addressed with appropriate warnings in the SmPC. The safety risks are considered to be in line with previous findings, no other significant unfavourable effect could be observed in studies 110 and 112. Based on the data and analyses provided in the frame of this procedure, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk ration for ivacaftor remains positive and the indication can be broadened to patients with CF aged 18 years and older who have a R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change(s):

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

Extension of indication to include the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged 18 years and older who have a R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the annexes and to align the product information with the latest QRD template. An updated RMP version 4.9 was agreed as part of this procedure.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol (mannitol) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.
