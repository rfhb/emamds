## 1 Background information on the procedure

## 1.1 Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BeiGene Ireland Ltd submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 31 January 2022 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL) based on results from Study BGB-3111-304; an ongoing, international, Phase 3, open-label, multiple-cohort, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib versus B+R in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL, and  Study BGB-3111-305; an ongoing, international Phase 3, open-label, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib with R/R CLL/SLL.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4,5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

An updated RMP version 1.1 (specific for the proposed indication CLL/SLL) was also submitted.

In addition, as part of the application the MAH requested a 1-year extension of the market protection.

The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0398/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products.

## Scientific advice

The MAH did seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP in 2016; EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/2016/II and in 2017a follow up EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/FU/1/2017/II. The overall study design features for study 304 (1L CLL)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were agreed upon with EMA, although the interim analysis was discouraged. Initially, the MAH proposed one pivotal study to support the use of zanubrutinib in treatment-naïve (TN) and R/R CLL patients. However, the CHMP did not support this proposal and expressed several concerns regarding the design and power of the study to support the claimed indication. In the follow-up advice in 2017 the MAH proposed study 304 in TN patients. For study 304 the proposed study design and primary endpoint (PFS by IRC) were endorsed by the CHMP. The MAH changed the originally proposed study design in patients with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS was changed to ORR).

## 2 Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

## Problem statement

## Disease or condition

The claimed the therapeutic indication was applied as: BRUKINSA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The final approved indication is: Brukinsa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

## Epidemiology

CLL/SLL is the most common leukemia in the Western world, with an incidence of 4.2 cases in every 100,000 persons per year. The incidence increases to &gt; 30 in 100,000 per year in people aged more than 80 years. In the US, incidence of CLL is 4.9 cases per 100, in Europe, 4.9 CLL/SLL cases per 100,000 persons.  It  is  estimated  that  there  are  approximately  191,000  cases  and  61,000  deaths  per  year attributed to CLL/SLL worldwide.

The median age at time of diagnosis is 70 years, and approximately two-thirds of patients are over 65 years  of  age.  The  disease  is  more  common  in  men  versus  women,  and  in  Caucasian  versus  black, Hispanic, or Asian populations.

## Biologic features

The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  classification  considers  CLL  and  SLL  to  be  different  clinical manifestations of the same disease; therefore, CLL and SLL are considered collectively.

While CLL/SLL is a highly heterogenous disease in terms of disease course, with several patient-related (such as age and comorbidity) and disease-related (such as stage and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement  status)  factors  that  carry  prognostic  significance,  the  loss  of  the  TP53  locus  on chromosome 17p13.1 (del(17p)) is the most significant poor prognostic feature in this disease.

## Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis

Patients with loss of 17p13.1, as well as those that harbor a mutation of the TP53 gene, have a grim prognosis in response to chemoimmunotherapy and tend to show marked resistance against genotoxic chemotherapies that cannot be overcome by the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies. While the overall 5year survival rate is high (&gt; 85% in the USA) for those who receive appropriate treatment, fewer than 25% of the highest-risk subset of patients (based on TP53 gene dysfunction and clinical factors) would be expected to survive 5 years. Staging of CLL/SLL is typically per either the modified Rai or Binet staging system.

CLL/SLL is considered a treatable but essentially incurable disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Management

Until recently, the treatment of CLL/SLL was based on chemotherapy, particularly the alkylating agents chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and more recently, bendamustine. In the 1990s, the purine analogue fludarabine  was  shown  in  clinical  trials  to  improve  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  compared  to chlorambucil, except for elderly CLL/SLL patients, and became a standard initial therapy in younger patients  with  CLL/SLL.  The  addition  of  anti-CD20  antibodies,  such  as  rituximab,  to  chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in the clinical outcomes of previously untreated CLL. Treatment standards for CLL/SLL have evolved since the advent of effective inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, allowing for several choices of treatment regimens and single-agent therapies for the general population of both treatment-naïve (TN) and previously treated CLL/SLL.

Treatment options for CLL/SLL patients include multiagent chemoimmunotherapy, such as fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab  (FCR),  bendamustine/rituximab  (B+R),  and  chlorambucil/ obinutuzumab (Cl+O). Such treatments, however, are less effective in patients with high-risk disease; furthermore,  many  patients  cannot  tolerate  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy  due  to  age  and comorbidities. Other treatment options include BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib or acalabrutinib and PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib; however, these treatments also have significant toxicities, such as atrial fibrillation for ibrutinib and colitis for PI3K inhibitors, which limit tolerability and may lead to treatment discontinuation. Front-line treatment recommendations as per European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines are summarized below.

1. Patients without TP53 mutation or del(17p)
1. IGVH unmutated
1. Fit: ibrutinib or FCR (or BR in patients above 65 years)
2. Unfit:  venetoclax  +  obinutuzumab  or  ibrutinib  or  acalabrutinib  or  chemoimmunotherapy  (if  contraindicated  to  targeted  therapy  or  if  they  are  not available) or chlorambucil + obinutuzumab
2. IGVH mutated
1. Fit: FCR (or BR in patients above 65 years) or ibrutinib
2. Unfit: venetoclax + obinutuzumab or chlorambucil + obinutuzumab or ibrutinib or acalabrutinib
2. All  patients  WITH  TP53  mutation  or  del(17p):  ibrutinib  or  acalabrutinib  or  venetoclax  +/obinutuzumab or idelalisib + rituximab

Second-line CLL/SLL treatment is guided by the duration of the first remission for relapsed disease. Refractory disease is defined as having either no response to treatment or relapse within 6 months after the last treatment. ESMO guidelines recommend a change of therapeutic regimen in case of symptomatic relapse within 3 years, or refractory disease, in which case treatment with venetoclax (+/- rituximab), ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, or other BTKi monotherapy should be considered. Patients with remissions of more than 3 years may be re-exposed to the same time-limited regimen; however, repetition of the FCR regimen is not recommended. Other treatment options include acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, venetoclax + rituximab, or idelalisib + rituximab. For patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p), allogenic stem-cell transplantation should be considered for fit patients. The US NCCN guidelines' list of preferred regimens for  RR  CLL/SLL  patients  are  the  same  as  for  frontline  treatment  except  venetoclax  monotherapy  is recommended only for patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p).

## About the product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Zanubrutinib is a potent and irreversible next-generation BTK inhibitor. Zanubrutinib is more selective than  ibrutinib  for  BTK  inhibition.  Zanubrutinib  has  been  studied  in  an  extensive  ongoing  clinical development program in a number of B-cell malignancies.

## The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

The overall study design features for study 304 (1L CLL) were agreed upon with EMA in the context of the EMA Scientific Advice EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/2016/II and in a follow up

EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/FU/1/2017/II although the interim analysis was discouraged. Initially, the MAH proposed one pivotal study to support the use of zanubrutinib in treatment-naïve (TN) and R/R CLL patients. However, the CHMP did not support this proposal and expressed several concerns regarding the design and power of the study to support the claimed indication. In the follow-up advice in 2017 the MAH proposed study 304 in TN patients. For study 304 the proposed study design and primary endpoint (PFS by IRC) were endorsed by the CHMP. The MAH changed the originally proposed study design in patients with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS was changed to ORR.

## 2.2 Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. An environmental risk assessment (ERA) in the course of the initial MAA for treatment of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is ongoing, and BeiGene committed to provide the final ERA report by December 2022. This summary was written to support the type II variation application of zanubrutinib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and the current type II variation on CLL.

## Introduction

In relation to the initial MAA, a Phase 1 environmental risk assessment was performed:

The logKOW value of zanubrutinib is below 4.5 (i.e., 3.2 at pH 5, 3.6 at pH 7 and 3.7 at pH 9). Since, Log KOW &gt; 3, bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) is triggered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of zanubrutinib (0.022 μ g/L) was above the action limit of 0.01 μ g/L using an Fpen of 0.00014, which was based on prevalence of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia of 1.4 per 1000 as  stated  in  the  orphan  designation  application.  Furthermore,  as  there  are  no  indications  that zanubrutinib affects reproduction of vertebrate organisms at low exposure levels, the MAH committed to perform a standard Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment.

Some of these studies were submitted with this variation.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

## Summary of ongoing Environment Risk Assessment program for MZL

The Phase I and Phase II Tier A assessments except for the fish early life stage toxicity test (OECD 210) were completed, which triggered Phase II Tier B assessment for sediment and bioaccumulation, which has been initiated.

All studies were conducted in accordance with organization for economic cooperation (OECD) guidelines and in compliance with the OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The main study results are summarized below.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The ERA assessment leaded to the conclusions below:

1. Log KOW &gt; 3, hence a bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) is triggered. This study is ongoing.

However, the fish tissues were solubilised by Solvable (Perkin Elmer) and bleached by hydrogen peroxide (30%). This procedure was probably used for de-colouring of the bilirubin content of the fish tissues. Unfortunately, oxidation of the parent or even a loss of the label due to the formation of 14CO2 cannot be ruled out. BCF data could be strongly underestimated and would also explain the low recovery in the fish samples.

Further, the applicant stopped the uptake phase after 28 d (despite an &gt;20% increase of tissue concentration)  and  waived  the  depuration  phase  of  the  study.  An  extended  uptake  and/or  a depuration phase could have given further information about the kinetics and quality assessment of the BCF data.

Therefore, the applicant is asked to explain why hydrogen peroxide was used as bleaching agent after solubilisation, although the 14C parent substance can be subject to strong oxidation and loss of the label as 14CO2 is possible.

Further, the applicant should clarify for what reason the uptake phase wasn't extended although an increase of the tissue concentration &gt;20% (mean measured) was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A new study is expected, if no reasonable explanations for the aspects as shown in the rationale are provided (OC).

1. Brukinsa is not readily biodegradable (OECD 301B).
2. A study based on Technical Guidance OECD 308 was submitted to concluding that a Phase II Tier B assessment for sediment is triggered.

The applicant is asked to extend the evaluation of the water/sediment study to the transformation products TP-1 and TP-3. Both TPs accumulate in the course of the study in sediment and have, therefore, to be considered as very persistent (CHMP recommendation) .

The applicant is kindly asked to revise the persistence classification of Zanubrutinib in the PBT assessment part of the ERA into not persistent. Rationale: In the PBT assessment part of the EPAR table Zanubrutinib is wrongly classified as persistent. This classification is based on the results of a study according to OECD TG 301B, whereas, the results of the study according to OECD TG 308, normalised to 12 °C, are relevant for the classification. Since the provided study according to OECD TG 308 indicates that Zanubrutinib is not persistent, the classification should be changed, but the formation of persistent transformation products could be mentioned (CHMP recommendation) .

3. Brukinsa is not a risk to microbial communities (OECD 209), algae (OECD 201) or daphnia (OECD 211), however a Fish early life cycle test did not provide a NOEC for larval growth of the fathead minnow (NOEC&lt;0.017 mg/L, OECD 210). A new study is planned to be completed December 2022.
4. In support of a Phase II Tier B assessment, a sediment-water Chironomid toxicity test (OECD 218)  is submitted. At 289 mg/kg d.w. sediment emergence of midges was 5% of control. NOEC was 89 mg/kg d.w.

However, the data are missing in the study report. According to the guideline OECD 218 these data have  to  be  submitted.  In  order  to  evaluate  whether  no  significant  difference  exists  between emergence of males and females the numbers of emerged males and females per vessel and per day should be provided. Without this information cumulative emergence as sole result cannot be used.

The applicant is asked to provide details on the sex ratio of the Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity Test (OECD 218). Although it was indicated that sex and number of emerged midges had been recorded according to the test protocol, the respective results on the sex ratio had not been included in the study results. Therefore, separate number of emerged male and female midges should be provided (numbers of emerged males and females per vessel and per day).

In addition, the information on LOQ and LOD of the analysis are missing. These should also be submitted (CHMP recommendation) .

The MAH has accepted the CHMP recommendations and a final environmental risk assessment is awaited post-approval. This should include the last ongoing study, adequate response to OCs and an updated PECSURFACEWATER with the new indication.

## Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects

The  MAH  was  granted  a  deferral  and  a  waiver  in  children  below  18  years  of  age  in  treatment  of lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma  and  1  year  of  age  for  treatment  of  mature  B-cell  neoplasms  on  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

grounds that these two diseases do not occur in the respective paediatric subsets of the population, in October 2019. At that time, the paediatric investigation plan was planned to be completed by 2026. In vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies investigating efficacy of zanubrutinib in paediatric B-cell tumour cell lines were deferred.

In the most recent PIP compliance check report (outcome 15 October 2021), the non-clinical studies were referred and assessed by the PDCO; the PIP was deemed compliant and no further non-clinical studies were required.

## Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The environmental risk assessment is still ongoing. The final report, including the last study to support Phase II tier A assessment and updated PECSURFACEWATER with the new indication, including adequate response to outstanding issues, is awaited by the end of 2022/beginning of 2023.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points are recommended for further investigation:

1. OECD 305: The applicant is asked to explain why hydrogen peroxide was used as bleaching agent after solubilisation, although the  14 C parent substance can be subject to strong oxidation and loss of the label as  14 CO2 is possible.
2. Further, the applicant should clarify for what reason the uptake phase wasn't extended although an increase of the tissue concentration &gt;20% (mean measured) was observed.
3. A new study is expected, if no reasonable explanations for the aspects as shown in the rationale are provided.
4. OECD 218: The applicant is asked to provide details on the sex ratio of the Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity Test. Although it was indicated that sex and number of emerged midges had been recorded according to the test protocol, the respective results on the sex ratio had not been included in the study results. Therefore, separate number of emerged male and female midges should be provided (numbers of emerged males and females per vessel and per day).
5. In addition, the information on LOQ and LOD of the analysis are missing. These should also be submitted.
6. OECD 308: The applicant is asked to extend the evaluation of the water/sediment study to the transformation products TP-1 and TP-3. Both TPs accumulate in the course of the study in sediment and have, therefore, to be considered as very persistent.
7. Moreover, the applicant is asked to revise the persistence classification of Zanubrutinib in the PBT assessment part of the ERA into not persistent. Rationale: In the PBT assessment part of the EPAR table Zanubrutinib is wrongly classified as persistent. This classification is based on the results of a study according to OECD TG 301B, whereas, the results of the study according to OECD TG 308, normalised to 12 °C, are relevant for the classification. Since the provided study according to OECD TG 308 indicates that Zanubrutinib is not persistent, the classification should be changed, but the formation of persistent transformation products could be mentioned.

Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) samples to assess zanubrutinib plasma concentrations were collected from all patients assigned to Arm A (Cohort 1/1a) and Arm C prior to dosing (within 30 minutes of dosing), 2 hours (± 30 minutes) after dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days or 4 weeks).

## Study BGB-3111-305:

Sparse PK samples were collected from all patients assigned to Arm A (zanubrutinib) on Cycle 1 Day 1 predose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose), 2 hours postdose (± 30 minutes), and before patient discharge (4-6 hours post-dose); and predose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose) on Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 4 Day 1. (1 cycle = 28 days).

## Bioanalytical methods

Plasma samples were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of zanubrutinib in K2EDTA human plasma. The lower limit of quantitation was 1.0 ng/mL. The updated performance of the bioanalytical method for determination of

Zanubrutinib concentrations in Study BGB-3111-112, Study BGB-3111-304, and Study BGB-3111-305 is assessed.

## Population PK analyses

PopPK analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling in NONMEM 7, Version 7.4.3, Perl-Speaks-NONMEM (PsN) Version 4.2 and R 4.1.0 or above. Population PK estimation was performed using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method in NONMEM.

A population PK model for zanubrutinib has previously been developed and validated based on data from 632 subjects enrolled in 9 clinical studies (BGB-3111-103, BGB-3111-104, BGB-3111-105, BGB-3111106,  BGB-3111-AU-003,  BGB-3111-1002,  BGB-3111-205,  BGB-3111-206,  and  BGB-3111-302).  The previous model was a two-compartment model with sequential zero-order then first-order absorption and first-order elimination. The previous model was updated with sparse data (data cut-off 21 June 2021) from two Phase 3 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  (CLL/SLL)  following  160  mg  BID  zanubrutinib.  The  previous covariate relationships impacting the PK of zanubrutinib were re-assessed. Observations with |CWRES| &gt;5 were considered as outliers and excluded from the PK analysis dataset. A total of 6500 samples from 1291 subjects were included in the updated Pop PK analysis. Studies 304 and 305 contributed with 1044 and 534 data points from 389 and 271 subjects respectively, where 44 data points were excluded from study 304 and 457 data points (mainly due to missing dosing time) were excluded from study 305.

Testing of covariates one-at-a-time using a stepwise forward addition showed that effect of health status, age, race, and ALT on CL/F and age on Vc/F were significant (p&lt;0.01). Race on CL/F was removed in the backward elimination process (p&lt;0.001).

Baseline body weight, sex, race, AST, bilirubin, CrCL, tumor type, and use of acid-reducing agents did not show statistically significant impact on the PK of zanubrutinib. Health status, baseline ALT, and age were found to be statistically significant covariates on CL/F. Age was identified as a significant covariate on  Vc/F.

The covariate sensitivity analysis (Figure 6) showed that predicted steady-state Cmax (Cmax,ss) and AUC over the 12-hour dosing interval (AUCss) after repeated-dose administration of 160 mg were 297 ng/mL and 1110 ng·h/mL in a typical patient. This corresponds to a total daily AUCss of 2220 ng*hr/mL. The model predicted geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss after repeat-dose administration of 320 mg  QD  were  2220  ng*hr/mL,  580  ng/mL,  and  5.81  ng/mL,  respectively  in  patients  with  B-Cell malignancies.  This  analysis  also  indicated  that  health  status  (patients  versus  HVs)  was  the  most influential covariate on the PK of zanubrutinib. The impact of health status on zanubrutinib CL/F resulted in a 61.2% higher AUCss and a 41.2% higher Cmax,ss in HVs compared to patients with B-cell malignancies. Of note, a total of 90 HVs were included in this analysis. This result of higher exposures in HVs estimated by the population PK model is consistent with observed clinical data in healthy subjects versus patients based on cross-study comparisons. The impact of ALT and age on zanubrutinib exposure was relatively small  compared  with  the  overall  variability  of  the  population,  and  therefore,  ALT  and  age  are  not considered to be clinically meaningful covariates.

## Exposure-response analyses

## Exposure metrics:

The  final  population  pharmacokinetic  model  for  CLL  was  applied  to  predict  zanubrutinib  exposure. Zanubrutinib plasma concentration time profiles were simulated using the Bayesian post hoc individual PK parameters. Derived exposure metrics were: AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss.

## Efficacy:

In Study BGB-3111-304, efficacy endpoints were PFS (primary) and ORR (secondary). PFS was assessed by IRC and defined as the length of time from randomization until disease progression or death. In Study BGB-3111-305, the primary endpoint was ORR (PR or higher). ORR was determined by IRC and defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a PR or CR. The ORR (PR-L or higher) was also explored as a secondary efficacy endpoint for BGB-3111-305. The E-R relationships for efficacy endpoints of ORR (PR or higher) and ORR (PR-L or higher) were explored separately and conducted based on the data from patients:

- patients without del17p (Arm A) in Study BGB-3111-304 (n=278)
- patients with del17p (Arm C) in Study BGB-3111-304 (n=110)
- patients in Study BGB-3111-305 (n=173)

Plots of Kaplan-Meier PFS curves stratified by quartiles of model-predicted AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss suggested that PFS was not different among zanubrutinib exposure quartiles based on the data from 388 patients in Study BGB-3111-304. There was no apparent relationship between PFS and any of the zanubrutinib  exposure  metrics  in  the  zanubrutinib  treated  patients  in  Study  BGB-3111-304.  The probability of response plots and logistic regression models for ORR (PR or higher) or ORR (PR-L or higher) indicated none of the zanubrutinib exposure metrics had a significant effect on E-R relationship for these endpoints (p&gt;0.01).

## Safety:

A total of 660 patients from studies BGB-3111-304 (n=389) and BGB-311-305 (n=271) were included in  the  pooled  exposure  safety  analyses.  The  E-R  relationship  was  assessed  between  zanubrutinib exposure  metrics  (AUCss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss)  and  safety  endpoints,  including  AEs  leading  to treatment  discontinuation  and  AEs  of  interest  (grade  ≥3  neutro penia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia, infections/infestations, secondary primary malignancies, atrial fibrillation/flutter, major bleeding events, and any bleeding events).

The exposure ranges appeared to be similar in patients who experienced AEs of interest relative to those who were not based on 660 patients from studies BGB-3111-304 (n=389) and BGB-3111-305 (n=271). The probability of response plots and logistic regression models showed that there were no evident E-R relationships between exposure metrics (AUCss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) and the probability of occurrence of safety measures.

## Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion

In the initial MAA (the WM indication), the ADME characteristics of zanubrutinib were documented. There is no reason to believe that the ADME characteristics should be significantly different in patients with CLL/SLL. Accordingly, the Applicant's proposed changes to SmPC section 5.2 are limited to revisions reflecting the characteristics of the 1291 subjects included in the current submission's updated PopPK analysis. This is endorsed.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Dose proportionality and time dependency of PK parameters were addressed in the initial WM application: Cmax and AUC0∞ appeared to increase dose -proportionally after single-dose oral administration of zanubrutinib from 40 mg to 320 mg in patients with B-cell malignancies.  The present application concerns the same proposed dose regimen (a 320 mg total daily dose administered as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily), and the dose proportionality and PK time dependency are not expected to differ from the previously approved WM indication.

## Dose justification

The proposed dose regimen in patients with CLL/SLL is a 320 mg total daily dose (administered as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily). This is based on the totality of safety, efficacy, PK and pharmacodynamics (BTK occupancy data) results from studies BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-3111-205, BGB-3111-304, and BGB-3111-305.

In Study BGB-3111-AU-003 at dose regimens of 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice daily, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed during the dose-escalation part of the study. Moreover, nearly full occupancy of BTK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was achieved in patients at all administered doses. The BTK occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed at 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily. At the 160 mg twice daily dose, the median BTK occupancy of 100% was observed at steady-state trough and 94% in the 320 mg once daily group. To maximize the inhibition in target tissue, the 160 mg twice daily dose has been used in studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305, as well as other ongoing Phase 2/3 studies. The results of pivotal Phase 3 studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305 provided the primary evidence of effectiveness in patients with CLL/SLL and supported the proposed zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg twice daily.

In study BGB-3111-AU-003, the overall response rate was 100% (N = 40/40) for the 320 mg once daily dose compared to 92.8% (N = 77/83) for the 160 mg twice daily dose. The CR rate was 22.5 % (N=9/40) for the 320 mg once daily dose compared to 13.3% (N = 11/83) for the 160 mg twice daily dose. Although the number of CLL/SLL patients treated at 320 mg once daily (N=40) is limited relative to those at 160 mg twice daily dose (N=83), the totality of data, including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, efficacy, and exposure-response analyses, provided support for the recommended 320-mg total daily dose for patients with CLL/SLL. Objective responses have been observed in patients with various B-cell malignancies (including CLL/SLL, MCL, WM, MZL, and FL) at all tested dose levels from 40 mg to 320 mg. Numerically comparable overall response rates have also been observed between the once daily and twice daily regimens in patients with MCL and WM (Tam, et

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

al 2021). Furthermore, no remarkable difference in AEs between the 2 regimens in the safety population in study BGB-3111-AU-003 were observed (Ou et al 2021).

Additional data support a 320 mg once daily regimen as an option in addition to the 160 mg twice daily regimen for patients with CLL/SLL. Given the same total daily dose (320 mg) and linear PK, similar exposures/AUC are achieved between the 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice daily dose. At the 320 mg once daily dose, a sustained and profound BTK inhibition in PBMC and lymph node tissue were also observed. E-R analyses indicated that there was no evident E-R relationship between exposure (AUC024,ss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) and safety endpoints (AEs of interests) in patients with B-cell malignancies (Report BGB-3111-CP-007) and in patients with CLL/SLL (Report BGB-3111-CP-011). There were no significant relationships between zanubrutinib exposure and AEs including cytopenias, infections, and bleeding. In addition, the E-R analysis in patients with CLL/SLL (Report BGB-3111-CP-011) and other B-cell malignancies including MCL (Report BGB-3111-CP-003), WM (Report BGB-3111-CP-007), and MZL (Report BGB-3111-CP-009) indicated that efficacy (ORR) does not appear to be significantly impacted by Cmax or Cmin, and therefore the same total daily dose and corresponding AUC delivered by a 320 mg once daily regimen are expected to result in a similar ORR as that of the 160 mg twice daily regimen.

The totality of the data summarized here thus support the recommended dose of a 320 mg total daily dose (as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily) in adult patients with CLL/SLL. This is based on consistent and sustained BTK occupancy in PBMCs and target tissue, high rates of overall response in patients with CLL/SLL, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

## Title of Study

Study BGB-3111-112: A Phase 1, Open-label, Fixed-sequence Study to Investigate the Effect of the Moderate CYP3A Inducer Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Zanubrutinib in Healthy Male Subjects.

## Methods

## Figure 7: Study Schematic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Abbreviation: PK = pharmacokinetics.

All subjects received study drugs in a fixed sequence, as follows:

- Day 1: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib after an overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours
- Days 3 to 10: Oral dose of 300 mg rifabutin once daily (QD) with food (standard meal)
- Day 11: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib and QD dose of 300 mg rifabutin after an overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours.

## Sampling

On PK sampling days (Days 1 and 11), blood samples for analysis of plasma zanubrutinib were collected predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours postdose. The allowed sampling windows for PK blood samples were as follows: within 15 minutes prior to dosing for the predose sample timepoint; ± 5 minutes for sampling timepoints ≤12 hours; ± 30 minutes for sampling timepoint at 24 and 36 hours.

## Results

A total of 13 subjects were enrolled and were evaluable for PK analysis.

Following the administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone on Day 1 and the coadministration with 300 mg rifabutin on Day 11, median times of the maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of 1.50 and 2.00 hours postdose were observed, respectively (Figure 8). Systemic exposure to zanubrutinib was lower following the coadministration of 320 mg zanubrutinib with 300 mg rifabutin compared to the administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone, with a geometric mean area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) approximately 44% lower and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) 48% lower (Table 1). This represented a decreased exposure of 1.8-fold for AUC0t and AUC0-∞ , and 1.9-fold for Cmax when zanubrutinib was administered with a moderate CYP3A inducer.

There was a less than a 50% reduction of systemic exposures (AUC) of zanubrutinib following coadministration of zanubrutinib with rifabutin, a moderate CYP3A inducer, compared to administration of zanubrutinib alone. Thus, based on the emergent data from Study BGB-3111-112, a revision to the current dose recommendation for concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is proposed; it is recommended that patients use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers. This updated recommendation is based on the totality of data, including (1) less than 50% decrease in zanubrutinib AUC for concurrent use of a moderate CYP3A inducer, (2) an efficacy signal at doses as low as 40 and 80 mg (BGB-3111-AU-003 CSR), (3) maximal BTK inhibition (median BTK occupancy of 100%) in PBMC samples starting at doses of 40 mg once a day, and (5) no identifiable E-R relationships for efficacy or safety endpoints.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Zanubrutinib is a next-generation, potent BTK inhibitor. Like other active BTK inhibitors, zanubrutinib forms an irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of the BTK protein.

## Primary pharmacology

No new pharmacodynamic analyses pertaining to BTK occupancy have been conducted since the initial WM application. For the latter, ' Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed in the Chinese phase 1 study BGB-3111-1002 and in the global phase 1/2 study BGB-3111-AU-003 based on PD data from 13 and 50 subjects, respectively. The primary PD endpoint was the BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) '.

The number of lymph node samples included was low, 12 and 18 samples in patients with 320 mg QD and 160 mg BID dosing, respectively.  As per Figure 3 below, from the Applicant's previously submitted Report BGB-3111-AU-003-PD-01, although data was very limited, there was no apparent association of lymph node BTK occupancy and tumour types, including CLL:

## PK/PD modelling

To support dose recommendations, exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships were evaluated in patients with CLL/SLL receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy in studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305. The exposure-response (E-R) analysis for efficacy was conducted separately for BGB3111-304 in patients with TN CLL/SLL and BGB 3111 305 in patients with R/R CLL/SLL. E-R analysis also included patients with CLL/SLL for the pooled exposure-safety analysis (Report BGB-3111-CP-011, N=660).

The exposure for zanubrutinib was summarized as cumulative steady state AUC over 24 hours (AUC024,ss), Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss. Exposure data (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) derived from the population PK analysis (Report BGB-3111-CP-010) were used in the analysis. Analyses were performed using data from all patients who had ≥ 1 set of the estimated PK parameters. Individual PK parameters from these studies were merged with the corresponding efficacy or safety data from studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305 (Report BGB-3111-CP-011). In both studies, zanubrutinib was administered orally as a 160 mg BID regimen.

## Exposure-Efficacy Relationship - Study BGB-3111-304

Data from BGB-3111-304 Arm A, in patients with CLL/SLL without del17p (N=278 with PK) and in Arm C, with del17p (N=110 with PK) were included in the E-R analysis of efficacy outcomes. The efficacy in patients with CLL/SLL was investigated with the responder group including patients with best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or higher, and partial response with lymphocytosis (PR-L) or higher; the non-responder group included patients with best overall response of stable disease and progressive disease.

## Exposure-Response Relationship for Efficacy in Patients with TN CLL/SLL (without del17p) ORR Assessed by IRC (PR-L or higher)

Box plots of zanubrutinib exposure by IRC-assessed objective response (PR-L or higher) of CLL/SLL patients in Arm A, without del17p, are presented in Figure 4. Although a range of exposures was observed in both responders and non-responders, the median AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss values were similar in responders compared with those of non-responders. The probability of ORR (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR + PR) by quantiles of zanubrutinib exposure is shown in Figure 5. Based on visual inspection of exploratory plots, the E-R logistic regression model for IRC-assessed ORR with Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss was developed and the diagnostic plots of the model are presented in Figure 6. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed that Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss were not associated with the probability of ORR in patients with TN CLL/SLL without del17p (p-value &gt;0.1). Overall, there was no apparent E-R relationship for zanubrutinib based on response assessments of ORR (PR-L or higher).

## Exposure-Efficacy Relationship

Data from study BGB-3111-305 Arm A, in patients with R/R CLL/SLL (N=173) were included in the E-R analysis of efficacy outcomes.

The efficacy in patients with R/R CLL/SLL was investigated with the responder group, including patients with best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or higher, and partial response with lymphocytosis (PR-L) or higher; the non-responder group included patients with best overall response of stable disease and progressive disease.

inspection of exploratory plots, the E-R logistic regression model for IRC-assessed ORR with Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUC0-24,ss was developed and the diagnostic plots of the model are presented in Figure 12. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed that Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss were not associated with the probability of ORR in patients with RR CLL/SLL (p-value&gt;0.1). Overall, there was no apparent E-R relationship for zanubrutinib, based on response assessments of ORR (PR or higher).

## Exposure-Safety Relationship

Exposure-safety analyses were performed using pooled data from 2 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB3111-305). A total of 660 patients were included in the exposure-safety analyses (Report BGB-3111CP-011). E-R relationships were assessed between zanubrutinib exposure metrics (model predicted Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC0-24,ss ) and adverse events (AE) of interest (Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 anemia, Grade ≥ 3 infections/infestations, all events of second ary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding events and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation). The summary of the safety endpoints is shown below.

The analysis showed that there were no evident E-R relationships between exposure (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) and the probability to have AEs of interest examined. The exposure ranges appeared to be similar in patients experiencing AEs of interest relative to those who were not. Plots showing a probability of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia versus steady -state exposures (Cmax,ss, AUC0-24,ss, and Cmin,ss) are shown in Figure 13. Similarly, no evident E-R relationships were observed for other safety endpoints, including Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 anemia, Grade ≥ 3 infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding events and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Zanubrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved in the EU for treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.

The present application concerns approval of zanubrutinib as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The current application's clinical pharmacology package includes data from a Phase 3, open-label study of zanubrutinib in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL (Study BGB-3111-304), a Phase 3, openlabel study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (BGB-3111-305) and a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112).

No new bioanalytical methods were applied for detection of zanubrutinib. A previous Pop PK model, a two-compartment model with sequential zero-order then first-order absorption and first-order elimination, was updated with data from studies 304 and 305 to characterise the PK of zanubrutinib in CLL/SLL patients.

All  patients with CLL/SLL from studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305 were exposed to an initial zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg twice daily. The justification for the dose selection relies on data submitted with the initial WM application, including analyses of PK, BTK receptor occupancy in PBMCs and lymph node biopsies, and exposure-response for safety and efficacy. Multiple cohorts of patients with various B-cell  malignancies  including  CLL/SLL  comprised  the  clinical  populations  studied  in  the  initial  WM

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

application; Their demographic characteristics were comparable to those expected for adult patients with CLL/SLL. The rationale of the dose selection is overall acceptable.

No relation to exposure was found for either efficacy or safety endpoints in the CLL/SLL patient population.

The ADME characteristics were described in the original WM marketing application, and the Applicant's proposed changes to SmPC section 5.2 are limited to revisions reflecting the characteristics of the 1291 subjects included in the current submission's updated PopPK analysis. Based on the efficacy, safety and PK results observed, the selected dose regimen of 320 mg total daily dose, identical to the currently approved posology for WM (administered as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily) is considered acceptable.

As part of the current MAA package, the MAH has submitted a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112) of zanubrutinib co-administered with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin. Rifabutin was found to decrease average zanubrutinib exposure by nearly half, with a geometric mean AUC approximately 44% lower and Cmax 48% lower. Based on these results, the MAH proposes to revise the current SmPC recommendation to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers, suggesting that moderate CYP3A inducers may instead ' be used with caution ' during zanubrutinib treatment. However, results of Study BGB-3111-112 became available and were assessed during the initial Brukinsa EU MAA, no new clinical efficacy data has been provided by the MAH pertaining to zanubrutinib dosing regimens starting below 320 mg daily, and data on BTK receptor occupancy in target tissues below the current recommended total daily dose of 320 mg are likewise lacking. The lack of observable exposureresponse and exposure-safety relationships is also used as one argument to justify that no dose adjustments are needed in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inducers. This argument is not fully agreed by the CHMP. While it is agreed on the basis of the plots for probability of IRC-assessed objective response vs. exposure in studies 304 + 305 that a 50% reduction in exposure in the median patient would not likely result in appreciable change in probability of response, no predictions can be made on the basis of the model for the effect of 50% exposure reduction in patients who are on the lower end of the exposure range. Hence, the concern that average decreased zanubrutinib exposure in the order of 50% may result in decreased efficacy remains. Accordingly, changes to SmPC recommendations regarding co-administration of zanubrutinib with moderate CYP3A inducers with the addition of the CLL/SLL indication were not supported; the currently approved wording to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers has remained in section 4.5 of the SmPC.

## Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacology package included in the current application includes data from a Phase 3, open-label study of zanubrutinib in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL (Study BGB-3111-304), a Phase 3, open-label study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (BGB-3111-305) and a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112). Based on data submitted with the initial (WM) EU MAA, the two proposed dose regimens, 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily, were found to give comparable exposure (AUC), and the same posology for the CLL/SLL indication is considered acceptable based on the efficacy, safety and PK results provided with the current application.

The exposure-response analyses provide support that zanubrutinib efficacy in the median patient is unlikely to be compromised in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inducers. However, no reliable predictions from the exposure-response model can be made for those patients who are on the lower end of the exposure range resulting from 160 mg BID or 320 mg QD dose, hence the currently approved SmPC wordings to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers still remain.

The men and women ≥ 18 years of age included in this trial had a confirmed diagnosis of CLL or SLL that met the IWCLL criteria and required treatment as defined by at least 1 of the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progressive marrow failure; massive, progressive, or symptomatic splenomegaly; massive, progressive, or symptomatic lymphadenopathy; progressive lymphocytosis with rapid doubling time; or constitutional symptoms.

Patients must have been relapsed or refractory to at least 1 prior systemic therapy for CLL/SLL, with the last dose of prior therapy for CLL/SLL &gt; 14 days before randomization and had measurable disease (defined as ≥ 1 lymph n ode &gt; 1.5 cm in longest diameter, and measurable in 2 perpendicular diameters, or an extranodal lesion must measure &gt; 10 mm in longest perpendicular diameter). A line of therapy was defined as completing at least 2 cycles of treatment of standard regimen according to current guidelines, or of an investigational regimen on a clinical trial.

Patients had no history of prolymphocytic leukemia or Richter's transformation, no known CNS involvement by leukemia or lymphoma, no currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease, and no HIV infection or active infection with hepatitis B or C.

## Treatments

## BGB-3111-304

Each treatment cycle consists of approximately 28 days. Patients are treated as follows:

1. In Arm A (Cohort 1/1a) and Arm C (Cohort 2), zanubrutinib was administered orally at 160 mg twice daily.
2. In Arm B (Cohort 1/1a), bendamustine was administered IV at a dose of 90 mg/m 2 /day on the first 2 days of each cycle for 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered IV at a dose of 375 mg/m 2  for Cycle 1, and at a dose of 500 mg/m 2  for Cycles 2 to 6.

Patients in Arms A, B, and C remained on study treatment (with a maximum of 6 cycles of B+R in Arm B) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression was confirmed by independent central review.

Patients in Arm B of Cohort 1/1a may be eligible to receive crossover treatment with zanubrutinib at the time of disease progression, confirmed by independent central review. For patients who crossed over from Arm B to receive next line zanubrutinib, safety and laboratory assessments were to be performed per the zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) Schedule of Assessments and tumor response was to be evaluated by the investigator.

Arm C: Patients assigned to Cohort 2 (Arm C) received zanubrutinib monotherapy 160 mg twice a day (two 80-mg capsules twice a day) and were to remain on zanubrutinib until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

## Zanubrutinib Dose Reductions for Hematologic Toxicity

Hematologic toxicity was based on the Grading Scale for Hematologic Toxicity in CLL Studies. Dosing was to be held for individual patients under any of the following conditions, based on investigator assessment of study-drug relatedness:

1. Grade 4 neutropenia that is persistent for at least 10 consecutive days
2. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that is persistent for at least 10 consecutive days
3. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding
4. ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rituximab

No dose reductions for rituximab were to be allowed. A 28-day cycle length should be maintained, if possible. If rituximab was delayed, then bendamustine should be delayed as well.

## BGB-3111-305

## Zanubrutinib

Zanubrutinib 160 mg was taken twice a day with or without food.

On the days of PK blood sampling, study drug administration for patients assigned to Arm A (zanubrutinib) occurred at the center under the supervision of the investigator or his/her designee after the pre-dose blood sampling had occurred. The investigator or his/her designee instructed the patient not to self-administer the study drug prior to the office visit on those days.

## Ibrutinib

Patients randomized to Arm B received ibrutinib as per the Summary of Product Characteristics at a dose of 420 mg orally once daily.

## Dose Interruption and Modification

Zanubrutinib and ibrutinib treatment modifications applicable to hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities are outlined in Table 8.

## Zanubrutinib Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity

Dosing was held for individual patients under any of the following conditions, based on investigator assessment (using Hallek et al 2008) of study drug relatedness:

1. Grade 4 neutropenia (that was persistent for at least 10 consecutive days)
2. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (that was persistent for at least 10 consecutive days)
3. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding
4. ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia

For the first occurrence of hematologic toxicity, zanubrutinib treatment could restart at full dose upon recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline . Dose modification for p atients with ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding requiring medical intervention were discussed with the medical monitor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Zanubrutinib Dose Modifications for nonhematologic toxicity were given in the table below. For patients experiencing symptomatic and/or incompletely controlled atrial fibrillation, the study drug could be restarted at either the original dose or dose level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator, after the atrial fibrillation was adequately controlled. Zanubrutinib was permanently discontinued for any intracranial hemorrhage.

If the HCV RNA was ≥ 15 IU/mL, the HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was ≥ 100 IU/mL, or a rechecked detectable copy number was recorded during monthly monitoring, then study drug was stopped, and antiviral therapy initiated.

2. MRD
3. PK parameters
4. Self-administered Activity and Quality of Life questionnaire

## Sample size

## BGB-3111-304

The sample size calculation for Cohort 1 is based on the primary efficacy analysis of PFS comparison between Arms A and B in Cohort 1. Assuming the HR (Arm A/Arm B) in Cohort 1 is 0.58, 118 events are required to achieve 83.5% power at 2-sided alpha of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis, when 1 interim analysis is planned after 73% of the target number of events at final analysis. If 450 patients are enrolled to Cohort 1 and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arms A and B over a 25-month period (actual patient enrollment up to November 2018 and 28 patients per month enrollment rate after) and the hazard rate for drop-out of 0.0017/month, 118 events are expected to be accumulated at 41 months from study start. This assumes a median PFS in Arm B of 42 months and that PFS follows exponential distribution. Approximately 710 patients will be enrolled, with 450 patients without the del17p mutation in Cohort 1 available for the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 80 additional patients from Chinese sites without the del17p mutation in Cohort 1a, and approximately 100 patients with the del17p mutation in Cohort 2 and approximately 80 patients with del17p or pathogenic TP53 variant in Cohort 3. Sample size selection for Cohort 1a was to accumulate enough PFS events among patients enrolled from Chinese sites at the final analysis to support more than 80% probability of demonstrating an HR &lt; 1 among patients enrolled from Chinese sites if the PFS HR based on the ITT Analysis Set crosses the prespecified statistical boundary at the final analysis.

Sample size selections for Cohorts 2 and 3 were driven by estimated patient availability.

## BGB-3111-305

The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint of overall response rate. Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 600 patients would provide more than 90% power to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib at the noninferiority margin of 0.8558 (response ratio) and 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 with 1 interim analysis at 69% information fraction. The response rate for ibrutinib was approximated from published clinical data (Byrd et al 2019).

The non-inferiority margin was derived using the 95%-95% fixed margin method (FDA Guidance for Industry: Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness 2016). The efficacy of ibrutinib (M1) in response ratio scale was estimated as 2.1781 from the results of RESONATE and RESONATE2 trials by a fixed-effect meta-analysis. Requiring 80% of M1 to be retained in zanubrutinib, a non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 is generated. The margin is within the clinically acceptable limit.

Assuming a hazard ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 0.9, 205 events would be required to achieve 80% power at a 1-sided alpha of 0.025 to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib at the noninferiority margin of 1.3319 (hazard ratio) in PFS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If the 600 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 arms over a 24-month period including a 9month ramp-up period before reaching the peak enrollment of 33 patients/month with a 0.0017/month hazard rate for drop-out, 205 events were expected to be accumulated in 45 months after study start. A median PFS of 47 months for ibrutinib and an exponential distribution for PFS were also assumed.

Justification of the noninferiority margin for ORR

A non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 in response ratio was derived using the 95% to 95% fixed margin approach (FDA Guidance for Industry Non-Inferiority 2016). In the RESONATE trial (Byrd et al 2014), the ibrutinib effect over ofatumumab represented by the ratio of response rate (PR or higher) was 10.43 with a 95% CI of (5.2, 21.0) based on the independent review committee assessment. Thus, M1 is 5.2, the lower bound of the 95% CI. Since the effect size of ibrutinib is versus an active control (ofatumumab), rather than placebo, the choice of M1 is conservative, and a non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 (for the response ratio) retains over 90% of M1 (on the log scale).

Justification of the noninferiority margin for PFS

A non-inferiority margin of 1.3319 was derived using the 95% to 95% fixed margin approach based on the RESONATE study. In the updated RESONATE results (Brown et al 2014), the estimated PFS HR for ibrutinib versus ofatumumab was 0.106 with a 95% CI of (0.073, 0.153). Therefore, the control arm effect (M1) is 0.153 in HR and -1.877 in log HR. A noninferiority margin of 1.3319 for the HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) retains approximately 85% of M1 (on the log scale).

## Randomisation

## BGB-3111-304

Patients will be randomized using the IRT system for this study by permuted block stratified randomization. The stratified randomization will be produced, reviewed, and approved by an independent statistician.

Central randomization (1:1) will be used to assign patients in Cohort 1/1a to one of the following study drug treatments:

1. Arm A: zanubrutinib
2. Arm B: bendamustine + rituximab (B+R)

Randomization will be stratified by age (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C v s A or B), immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status (mutated vs unmutated), and geographic region (North America vs Europe vs Asia-Pacific).

Because Cohort 1a enrolls only patients from Chinese sites, geographic region will not be a randomization stratification factor for Cohort 1a. Patients in Cohort 2 (Arm C) will receive treatment with zanubrutinib. Patients in Cohort 3 (Arm D) will receive treatment with venetoclax + zanubrutinib.

## BGB-3111-305

Interactive Response Technology (IRT) was used to randomize patients to treatment arm and to assign study drug as applicable. Randomization will be performed as study by permuted block stratified randomization. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner to either Arm A (zanubrutinib) or Arm B (ibrutinib). Randomization was stratified by age (&lt; 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), geographic region (China versus non-China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status (present or absent).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

## BGB-3111-304

Study BGB-3111-304 was open-label. The assessment of PFS for Cohort 1 was performed by an independent central review committee. Access to aggregated efficacy summary treatment results was not provided before database lock.

## BGB-3111-305

Treatment with zanubrutinib or ibrutinib was open label since the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effects endpoints in this study were unlikely to be biased by knowledge of the study treatment.

Treatment with zanubrutinib or treatment with ibrutinib was open label; however, the independent central review for response assessment was blinded to study treatment. The independent DMC was not blinded. However, due to the open-label nature of the study, the sponsor did not have access to aggregated data summaries by actual study treatment assignment while the study was ongoing. This was done to avoid unwanted bias due to the possibility of inconsistent queries among patients with different treatments or overinterpretation of immature accruing data. A Data Integrity Protection Plan was put in place to describe the steps taken prior to database lock for the primary analysis of efficacy to restrict data access and minimize these potential biases for the study.

## Statistical methods

## BGB-3111-304

Analysis Populations for Efficacy

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population includes all enrolled patients who are assigned to a treatment group. The ITT population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses.

The Per-Protocol Population includes patients who received any dose of study medication and had no major protocol deviations. Criteria for exclusion from the Per-Protocol Population will be determined and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis.

## Primary Efficacy Analysis: PFS

The distribution of PFS, including median PFS and PFS rate at selected timepoints such as 12, 24 and 36 months,  will  be  summarized  descriptively  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  for  each  arm.  The  95% confidence interval for median and other quartiles of PFS will be generated by using Brookmeyer method, whereas the 95% confidence interval for PFS rate at selected timepoints will be generated by using Greenwood formula. The primary inferential comparison of PFS

H0: Hazard ratio (HR) (Arm A/Arm B) = 1

Ha: HR (Arm A/Arm B) &lt;1

between treatment groups will use the logrank test stratified by age (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C vs A or B), and IGHV mutational status (mutated vs unmutated) per IRT. The HR will be estimated  using  a  stratified  Cox  proportional  hazard  model.  Duration  of  follow-up  for  PFS  will  be estimated by reverse Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper and Smith 1996).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the primary analysis of PFS, the point estimate of the hazard ratio and its 95% CI will be computed based  on  fixed  design  procedures  using  a  Cox  model.  The  adequacy  of  the  proportional  hazard assumption will be evaluated by examining Schoenfeld residual plot and Kaplan-Meier plot. If strong evidence of non-proportionality of the treatment effect is observed, the time axis will be partitioned using  the  time  points  suggested  by  the  residual  plot  and  a  piecewise  Cox  model  will  be  fitted  as  a sensitivity analysis.

## Censoring rules for PFS

These conventions are based on December 2018 FDA Guidance for Industry, 'Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics,' and December 2012 EMA Appendix 1 to the Guideline on the  Evaluation  of  Anticancer  Medicinal  Products  in  Man,  'Methodological  Consideration  for  using Progressive-free Survival (PFS) or Disease-free Survival (DFS) in Confirmatory Trials.'

Table 10 Date of Progression or Censoring for Progression free Survival

| Situation                                                                        | Date of Progression or Censoring                                                  | Outcome    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| No baseline disease assessments                                                  | Date of randomization                                                             | Censored   |
| New  CLL/SLL related  treatment started before documentation of PD or death      | Date of last disease assessment prior to start of a new CLL/SLL related treatment | Censoreda  |
| Death or PD immediately after two or more missed consecutive disease assessments | Date of last disease assessment with documented non-progressionb                  | Censored   |
| Alive and without PD documentation                                               | Date of last disease assessment                                                   | Censored   |
| Death or PD between planned disease assessments                                  | Date of death or first disease assessment showing PD, whichever occurs first      | Progressed |
| Death before first disease assessment                                            | Date of death                                                                     | Progressed |

a Patient with a confirmed PD within 30 days or death within 90 days of start of next line therapy will not be censored. Censoring the event from a patient at a date close to patient PD or death date will fall into informative censoring thus biases the treatment effect. Further, counting the event is unlikely to overestimate the overall PFS.

\"Not Done.\"

## Sensitivity analyses for PFS

1. PFS Analysis Based on the Per-Protocol Analysis Set: the Per-Protocol Analysis Set instead of the ITT analysis set will be used as the analysis population. The analysis method will be the same as that for the primary PFS analysis.
2. Initiation of Non-Protocol CLL/SLL Related Therapy Treated as a PFS Event: initiation of nonprotocol CLL/SLL related therapy will be treated as a PFS event whereby PFS is broadly defined as duration from randomization to documented disease progression, initiation of non-protocol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CLL/SLL related therapy, or death, whichever occurs earlier. The data censoring rules were the same as those for the primary analysis of PFS except that the use of non-protocol CLL/SLL therapy will be treated as an event rather than a mechanism for censoring. The analysis method was the same as that for the primary PFS analysis.

3. Initiation of Non-Protocol CLL/SLL Related Therapy Treated as neither a PFS Event nor a Censoring Event: In this sensitivity analysis, the use of non-protocol CLL/SLL related therapy will be ignored. The data censoring rules are the same as those for the primary analysis of PFS except that the initiation of non-protocol CLL/SLL related therapy will be excluded as a mechanism for censoring. The analysis method will be the same as that for the primary PFS analysis.
4. Death or Disease Progression Immediately After Two or More Missed Consecutive Disease Assessments as a PFS Event: death or disease progression immediately after two or more missed consecutive disease assessments will be treated as a PFS event. The analysis method will be the same as that for the primary PFS analysis.
5. PFS Analysis under a Non-Proportional Hazard Function: If there is a substantial deviation from the proportional hazard assumption, a piecewise Cox model will be fitted to model the nonproportional hazard.
6. PFS Analysis based on all Patients Randomized to Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a: the primary PFS analysis will be repeated using all patients randomized to Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a.
7. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 was treated as a Censoring Event
8. PFS Analysis based on Interval Censoring: PD event dates were assumed as interval censored, i.e. occurred between date of disease assessment right before PD and date of disease assessment with detected PD. A non-parametric method was used to compare the 2 arms with the interval censored data (Huang 2008).

## Secondary Efficacy Analyses

## Overall Survival (OS) in Cohort 1

The distribution of OS, including quartiles, will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method per each arm. Median follow-up for OS will be estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential follow-up also termed 'reverse Kaplan-Meier' (Schemper and Smith 1996).

The inferential comparison of OS

H0: Hazard ratio (HR) (Arm A/Arm B) = 1

Ha: HR (Arm A/Arm B) &lt; 1

between treatment groups will use the logrank test stratified by age (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C vs A or B), and IGHV mutational status (mutated vs unmutated) per IRT. The HR for BGB-3111 arm over the BR arm will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

The survival rate at selected landmark times (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years from randomization) will be estimated for each treatment group by the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimate with its 95% confidence interval using Greenwood formula.

## Censoring rules for OS

Patients who are alive or lost to follow-up as of the data analysis cut-off date will be right censored at the patient's date last known to be alive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sensitivity analyses for OS

1. The OS result will be assessed using additional sensitivity analyses, all of which will be based on the ITT analysis set, including the followings:
2. On-Treatment Analysis: Initiation of BGB-3111 in BR Arm Patients Treated as a Censoring Event In this sensitivity analysis, initiation of BGB-3111 in BR arm patients will be treated as a censoring event. The analysis method remains the same as that for the primary analysis of OS.
3. Estimation Based on Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) Method (Robin and Finkelstein 2000) In this analysis, BR arm patients crossed over to receive any BGB-3111 will be artificially censored at the time of switch, and remaining BR arm patients will be weighted based upon covariate values and a model of the probability of being censored. This allows patients who have not been artificially censored to be weighted in order to reflect their similarities to patients who have been censored in an attempt to remove the selection bias caused by the censoring - patients who did not crossover and have similar characteristics to subjects who did cross-over receive higher weights. The IPCW version of Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, and Cox partial likelihood of the HR will be used for the OS analysis. The IPCW method will be only considered when more than 20% BR arm patients crossed over to receive BGB-3111.
4. Estimation Based on Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE) Algorithm (Branson and Whitehead 2002) The IPE procedure is an extension of rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM). It uses parametric methods and a counterfactual framework to estimate the causal effect of the BGB- 3111 treatment. In this analysis, a parametric accelerated failure time model is fitted to the original unadjusted ITT data to obtain an initial estimate of the treatment effect. The failure times of BR arm patients who received any BGB-3111 are then re-estimated using the model, and this iterative procedure continues until the new estimate is very close to the previous estimate, i.e. 'converged.' Similar to the analysis based on IPCW method, this analysis will be only considered when more than 20% BR arm patients crossed over to use BGB-3111.

## Overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort 1

ORR will be estimated as the crude proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieve PR (including PR-L) or higher. Associated 95% Clopper-Pearson CI will be calculated by treatment group. The odds ratio (and 95% CI), which will be provided as a measure of the relative treatment effect, will be estimated using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. The BR arm will serve as the reference treatment group in the calculations of the odds ratio. Given the high level of ORR (95%) observed in the BR arm patients in CLL10 study (Eichhorst et al 2016), the comparison between treatment groups for the ORR endpoint in cohort 1 will be descriptive. Patients with no post-baseline response assessment (due to any reason) will be considered as non-responders.

## Interim analyses

Up to 2 analyses of PFS are planned: an interim analysis and the final analysis. The outcomes determined by the IRC will serve as the primary data source for the primary analysis of PFS. The monitoring boundary for early stopping in PFS will be determined using O'Brien-Fleming alpha spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) for efficacy and Haybittle-Peto method (Haybittle 1971; Peto et al 1976) for futility so that the overall Type I error is less than or equal to 0.025 (1-sided). The interim analysis will be performed when approximately 86 events (73% of the target number of events at final analysis) from Arms A and B in Cohort 1 are observed. It is estimated that it will take approximately 33 months to observe 86 events under the assumptions described in Section 4. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

futility will be non-binding. Information is based on number of events. Monitoring boundaries will be calculated for the interim analysis based on the actual number of PFS events observed up to the data cut-off of the interim analysis. Deviation from the scheduled interim analyses will not affect overall Type I error.

The inferential comparisons for the secondary endpoints will also be performed if a stopping boundary for PFS is met at any of the analyses.

The final analysis of OS will be performed at the end of the study, approximately 5 years after first patient randomized. Two interim analyses of OS are planned at the time of the interim and final analysis of PFS. Given a 3-year 92% survival rate observed in the BR arm patients in the CLL10 study (Eichhorst et al 2016), the planned interim OS analyses are not expected to have enough power to show statistical difference between the two arms. Therefore, a one-sided 0.00005 alpha will be set for each of the two planned interim analyses.

## Multiplicity considerations: Secondary Endpoint Testing Procedures

The inferential tests associated with the interim and final analyses of PFS in cohort 1 (primary efficacy endpoint) will be assessed against an overall 1-sided significance level of 0.025. Study-wide type-I error will be controlled at the level 0.025 for the testing of the primary endpoint and one secondary endpoint OS in cohort 1. All other inferences will be descriptive without multiplicity adjustment. OS is tested only if the primary endpoint, PFS, is significant.

The significance level for the OS analysis at the interim and final PFS analysis will be 0.00005, and the final OS analysis will be assigned a one-sided alpha of 0.0249. The secondary endpoint testing procedure is closed testing procedures and preserves the family-wise error rate at 0.025 in the strong sense.

## SAP addendum

The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) addendum is to describe the additional analyses for overall survival to be performed per the requests from the US FDA. As specified in the protocol, the final analysis of OS for cohort 1 will be performed approximately 5 years after the first subject was randomized in Cohort 1. The first subject was randomized on October 31, 2017, and the final analysis is planned for November 2022.

## BGB-3111-305

## Analysis Populations for Efficacy

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients. The ITT Analysis Set was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses except for the interim analysis of response endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and rate of PR-L or higher, which were based on the first 415 randomized patients as prespecified for the interim analysis.

The Per-protocol Analysis Set includes patients who received any dose of study drug and had no critical protocol deviation.

The Safety Analysis Set includes all patients who received any dose of study drug.

## Primary Efficacy Analysis

## Primary endpoint ORR

The primary hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint of ORR per investigator assessment will be to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Noninferiority testing for ORR

The null and alternative hypotheses for the noninferiority test are as follows:

H0NI: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≤ 0.8558

HaNI: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) &gt; 0.8558

The noninferiority hypothesis of ORR will be tested at each analysis using a stratified Wald test against a null response ratio of 0.8558 .

## Superiority testing for ORR

If the noninferiority in ORR per investigator assessment is statistically significant, then the superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in ORR will be tested. The null and alternative hypotheses for the superiority test are as follows:

H0SUP: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≤ 1

HaSUP: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) &gt; 1

The superiority hypothesis of ORR will be tested using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the response ratio will be constructed using a normal approximation. ORR will be summarized for each treatment arm along with its corresponding 95% CI.

## Response in case of intercurrent events

BOR is defined as the best response from the randomization date to the data cut-off date, disease progression or the start of new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever comes first. Patients without any postbaseline disease assessment (regardless of the reason) will be considered as non-responders.

## Supportive analyses for ORR

1. While the primary efficacy endpoint is per investigator assessment, ORR per independent central review will also be analyzed to support the primary analysis. In the United States, ORR assessed by independent central review will be the basis for regulatory decisions.
2. The noninferiority of the primary endpoint of ORR will also be analyzed in the Per-protocol Analysis Set.
3. Sensitivity analysis of investigator-assessed overall response rate was performed that counted assessments of PR-L that were subsequently followed by PR or higher responses as confirmed best overall responses of PR for CLL patients.
4. To account for disease progression due to study drug interruption, ORR and BOR will be summarized based on all disease assessments through the data cut-off date, disease progression or the start of new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever comes first; however, disease progression that occurs within 6 weeks of a study drug interruption of at least 7 days will not be counted as disease progression for the purpose of this sensitivity analysis.
5. To account for the impact of COVID-19, investigator-assessed overall response rate was summarized for each treatment arm excluding patients who died due to COVID-19.

## Secondary Efficacy Analyses

## PFS per investigator

Noninferiority testing for PFS per Investigator Assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The null and alternative hypotheses for the noninferiority test are as follows:

H0NI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≥ 1.3319

HaNI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) &lt; 1.3319

At the final analysis of PFS, hypothesis testing for the noninferiority of PFS per investigator assessment will be based on the entire ITT Analysis Set using a stratified Wald test and will have a 1-sided significance level of 0.02498.

## Superiority testing for PFS per Investigator Assessment

If the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in PFS per investigator assessment is statistically significant, then the superiority in PFS per investigator assessment will be tested. The null and alternative hypotheses for the superiority test are as follows:

H0SUP: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≥ 1

HaSUP: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) &lt; 1

Hypothesis testing for the superiority of PFS per investigator assessment will be based on the entire ITT Analysis Set using a stratified log-rank test and will have the same 1-sided significance level of 0.02498 (equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cut-off of 0.04996) used for the noninferiority PFS testing.

## Additional descriptive analysis for PFS

The HR for PFS and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox regression model. The distribution of PFS, including the median and other quartiles, and the PFS rate at selected timepoints such as 12, 18 and 24 months, will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for each treatment arm. The 95% CI for the median and the other quartiles of PFS will be estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. The duration of follow-up for PFS will be estimated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper and Smith 1996). Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS will be presented for each treatment arm.

## Censoring rules for PFS

## Table 11 Date of Progression or Censoring for Progression free Survival

| Situation                                                           | Date of Progression or Censoring                                             | Outcome   |

| Death or PD more than 6 months [1] from the last disease assessment | Date of the last disease assessment before death or PD                       | Censored  |
| Alive without documentation of PD                                   | Date of last disease assessment                                              | Censored  |

[1] 12 months if a patient is on the assessment schedule of every 24 weeks.

## Source: SAP

## Key secondary endpoint of PFS

1. The non-inferiority of the key secondary endpoint of PFS will also be analyzed in the Per protocol Analysis Set.
2. Alternative  censoring  rules  such  as  censoring  for  new  CLL/SLL  therapies  will  be  applied  as another sensitivity analysis of PFS.
3. To account for disease progression due to study drug interruption, PFS will also be summarized where disease progression that occurs within 6 weeks of a study drug interruption of at least 7 days will not be counted as disease progression for the purpose of this sensitivity analysis.
4. To account for the impact of COVID-19, PFS will be summarized for each treatment arm while additionally censoring deaths due to COVID-19.

## Key secondary SAFETY endpoint: Atrial fibrillation/flutter incidence

Hypothesis testing on the rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter will be performed using an unstratified chisquared test if the expected counts in the 2 x 2 contingency table (treatment arm by atrial fibrillation/ flutter status) are at least 5 patients. If any expected count in the 2 x 2 contingency table is less than 5 patients, then hypothesis testing will be performed using Fisher's exact test.

## Multiplicity Adjustment

To control the study-wide type I error, individual significance levels will be adjusted for the tests of the primary endpoint of ORR per investigator assessment (noninferiority and superiority), and the key secondary endpoint of PFS per investigator assessment (noninferiority and superiority). Multiplicity due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to multiple endpoints and multiple tests will be handled per the graphical approach by Maurer and Bretz (2013) utilizing fixed sequence hierarchical testing. Hypothesis testing will be performed according to the multiplicity adjustment as per the flowchart below

Figure 22: Flowchart for the multiplicity adjustment.

<!-- image -->

One interim analysis of ORR was planned at approximately 12 months after 415 patients have been randomized, and the final analysis of ORR will occur approximately 12 months after 600 patients have been randomized. Hypothesis testing for the noninferiority of ORR at the interim analysis will be based on the first 415 randomized patients only and will have a 1-sided significance level of 0.005. The monitoring boundaries for the noninferiority test are based on the O'Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. Hypothesis testing for the noninferiority of ORR at the final analysis will be based on the entire ITT Analysis Set and will have a 1-sided significance level based on the actual information fraction (or covariance) of the interim and final test statistics. With 652 patients in the ITT Analysis Set at the final analysis, the actual information fraction is 64% (415/652), and the 1-sided significance level for the final analysis will be 0.0235.

A single analysis of PFS is performed for the purpose of inference when approximately 205 PFS events have occurred; however, a 1-sided significance level of 0.00001 will be applied to each of the two descriptive analyses of PFS for the interim and final analyses of ORR to compensate for the potential type I error increase from the descriptive analysis. From the time of the ORR analyses to the analysis of PFS after 205 events have occurred, the sponsor will continue to maintain trial integrity according to the DIPP.

If the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in ORR is statistically significant, then the superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in the key secondary endpoint of atrial fibrillation/flutter will be tested but separately from the fixed sequence hierarchical testing that includes ORR and PFS. The interim analysis will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set restricted to the first 415 randomized patients and according to the actual treatment received. The final analysis will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set according to the actual treatment received. The monitoring boundaries for the superiority test are based on the O'Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. If hypothesis testing for the superiority of the rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter is performed at the interim analysis, it will have a 1-sided significance level of 0.005 (equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cut-off of 0.0099). If hypothesis testing for the superiority of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter is performed at the final analysis, it will have a 1-sided significance level of0.0235 (equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cutoff of 0.0469).

## Changes to the SAP and planned analyses

This clinical study report reflects analyses performed on data collected through a cutoff date of 31 December 2020. After review of the interim analysis data by the independent DMC (20 April 2021), the DMC determined that the boundary was met for noninferiority of overall response rate.

## Changes to the Planned Analyses

The following analyses are provided in the CSR but were not defined in the SAP or study protocols.

Patient disposition, characteristics, prior systemic therapies and study drug exposure were provided for the first 415 patients randomized.

Efficacy summaries were provided based on the first 415 patients randomized. These included analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review as well as sensitivity analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review that censored for new CLL/SLL therapies and overall survival. Analyses of duration of response by investigator assessment and by independent central review were also provided that include censoring for new CLL/SLL therapies. The above efficacy analyses of PFS and duration of response were performed for the subgroup of patients with del17p and the subgroup of patients with del17p and/or TP53 mutations.

Summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events among the first 415 patients randomized were provided based on the Safety Analysis Set, including treatment-emergent adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term, Grade 3 or higher, serious, those leading to death or treatment discontinuation. Additionally, treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest were summarized for the first 415 patients randomized. Shift tables for comparison of baseline toxicity grade versus worst postbaseline toxicity grade were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. Box-and-whisker plots showing the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and outlier values (ie, &gt; 1.5 times the interquartile range) were provided for laboratory parameters of interest.

## Changes in Study Conduct and Planned Analyses Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic

An internal committee was formed to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) on BeiGene clinical studies in February 2020. This cross-functional team assessed and developed appropriate contingency measures in line with local and global regulatory guidance to maintain patient safety and study integrity. The measures were initially focused on sites in China and subsequently expanded to the global sites. Patients were prospectively informed of the specific COVID-19 responses, potential impacts on study conduction, and signed a consent addendum.

- Added inclusion criterion 12 to ensure it is clear throughout the protocol that FISH analysis for del(17p) is required in order to ensure patients are enrolled in the proper cohort
- Modified exclusion criterion 5 to change 'superficial' to 'non-muscle-invasive' regarding bladder cancer in accordance with the most current NCCN guidelines
- Modified exclusion criterion 18 to add venetoclax (for Arm D) and to ensure that patients in Arms A, B, and C would not be excluded for hypersensitivity to venetoclax (or its excipients) when they will not receive this study drug
- Added exclusion criterion 21 regarding active and/or ongoing autoimmune anemia and/or autoimmune thrombocytopenia
- Added exclusion criterion 22 regarding ongoing treatment with warfarin or warfarin derivatives in Arm D only
- Moved the overall survival endpoint from secondary to exploratory

## Amendment 3 (11 February 2020)

A total of 653 patients enrolled before Amendment 3 of the study protocol, and a total of 53 patients enrolled in the study under Amendment 3. Key changes to the conduct of the study implemented with Amendment 3 were as follows:

- Throughout document, updated the overall sample size to approximately 680 patients, with approximately 80 additional patients from Chinese sites without del(17p) in Cohort 1a to allow for continuing enrollment of patients from Chinese sites to support further analysis in the Chinese population
- Added secondary endpoints to allow for the comparison of PFS, overall response rate, and duration of response between Arms A and B in pooled Cohort 1/1a patients from Chinese sites

## Amendment 4 (10 February 2021)

A total of 706 patients enrolled before Amendment 4 of the study protocol, and a total of 4 patients enrolled in the study under Amendment 4. Key changes to the conduct of the study implemented with Amendment 4 were as follows:

- Updated the required number of PFS events for the interim analysis in the sample size consideration and interim analysis sections to increase statistical power at the interim analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Notable changes include:

· Added an option to re-escalate the zanubrutinib dose after dose reduction with approval from the medical monitor based on available safety data for zanubrutinib

· Added a statement that TLS has been infrequently reported with zanubrutinib and ibrutinib treatment based on available safety data for TLS in patients administered ibrutinib and zanubrutinib

## Changes to the Planned Analyses

The subgroup analyses by race were not included as most patients (89.1%) were white. Subgroup analyses for complex karyotype defined as ≥ 5 abnormalities were excluded due to the small number of patients with ≥ 5 abnormalities in karyotype at the baseline; furthermore, complex karyotype assessment was not complete at the time of the data cutoff.

There were some discrepancies in stratification by IRT versus eCRF. Thus, a sensitivity analysis using the eCRF stratification factors was conducted. The results were similar to the primary analysis using IRT stratification.

For the primary analysis and the sensitivity analyses specified in the SAP, treatment discontinuation due to adverse event (AE) was handled following the treatment policy strategy, ie, PFS was defined regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event (ICE). Two sensitivity analyses were conducted following two additional strategies to handle the ICE: composite strategy (ie, consider treatment discontinuation due to AE as a component event for PFS); and hypothetical strategy (ie, PFS was censored at the last adequate disease assessment prior to treatment discontinuation due to AE).

The scores and mean changes for each domain of EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were summarized for each assessment timepoint. The responder analysis for GHS/QoL was not conducted because there was not a well-defined threshold to define 'improved' or 'worsened' and the summary of mean changes and the comparison using a restricted maximum likelihood based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) have provided adequate information to assess the treatment effect on the GHS/QoL. Since Cohort 1a efficacy data are preliminary, no efficacy analyses will be presented in this CSR.

## Protocol deviations

The CRO identified potential protocol deviations in 2 ways: observable protocol deviations were identified by CRO monitors and other project team members, usually during site visits coincident with the source document verification process; and programmatic protocol deviations were identified via automated edit checks of the data in the clinical database. In China, these activities were conducted by BeiGene. Protocol deviations were assessed as either protocol deviation (non-important) or important and reviewed by the CRO or BeiGene's clinical operations team (China) in consultation with the medical monitor before a final determination was made. Important protocol deviations were defined as those that were likely to have had a major impact on the patient's rights, safety, well-being, and/or on the validity of the data for analysis. The final determination of important protocol deviations was made by the medical monitor, using the criteria that define important protocol deviation in the ICH E3 guidelines as follows.

- Patient randomized even though he/she did not satisfy study eligibility criteria
- Patient developed study drug withdrawal criteria but was not withdrawn
- Patient received wrong study treatment or incorrect dose
- Patient received prohibited concomitant treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Critical protocol deviations are a subset of important protocol deviations that have the potential to affect the results of analyses of the primary or secondary objectives of the study. Critical protocol deviations were identified and used to define the Per-protocol Analysis Set.

## Protocol Deviations - Cohort 1

Important protocol deviations (IPDs) were reported in 10 (4.1%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 2 (0.8%) patients in the B+R arm. Three patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 1 patient in the B+R arm reported critical protocol deviations. Important protocol deviation that related to COVID-19 were reported in 2 (0.8%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 0 (0.0%) patient in the B+R arm. IPDs are summarized. Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported important and critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases.

## Protocol Deviations - Cohort 2

Important protocol deviations were reported in 2 (1.8%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm. One patient (0.9%) in the zanubrutinib arm reported critical protocol deviation. No important protocol deviation that related to COVID-19 was reported in the zanubrutinib arm.

Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported important and critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases.

## Amendment 3 (31 January 2020)

A total of 217 patients enrolled under Amendment 3 of the study protocol. Key changes to the conduct of the study implemented with Amendment 3 were as follows:

- Increased the sample size from approximately 400 patients to approximately 600 patients.
- Updated study duration to approximately 51 months.
- Clarified that the CT or MRI would be performed as specified per the Schedule of Assessments , independent of possible study drug hold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Clarified that samples taken at progression leading to permanent study drug discontinuation would be used for the assessment of relevant BTK pathway genes.
- Added information on warnings and precautions for zanubrutinib.
- Revised zanubrutinib dose reduction for nonhematologic toxicity.
- Revised the summary of tumor lysis syndrome events in clinical studies for permitted medications.
- Revised the summary for the primary endpoint (overall response rate) analysis to state that overall response rate was assessed by investigator, with assessment by independent central review performed to support the primary analysis and as the basis of regulatory decisions (in the United States).

· Revised the summary for the key secondary endpoint (PFS) analyses to state that PFS was assessed by investigator, with assessment by independent central review performed to support the key secondary endpoint analysis and as the basis of regulatory decisions (in the United States).

· Updated the noninferiority and superiority testing analysis summary for the primary endpoint (overall response rate)

- Updated analysis summary for key secondary endpoint (PFS) to remove the interim analysis and state that a single analysis would be performed.
- Deleted summary of planned sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint (overall response rate) and the key secondary endpoint (PFS).

· Added to the note of Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 that patient may continue study treatment post first assessed PD due to drug hold if it was perceived that the patient would benefit from continued treatment.

## Changes  to  Planned  Data/Sample  Collection  Drop  Out  of  the  Self-Administered  Quality  of  Life Questionnaires

Optional self-administration of a device-based quality of life questionnaire and activity tracker was planned for this study. However, this evaluation was aborted because data were obtained only from 2 zanubrutinib-treated patients. Questionnaires were completed once at baseline prior to treatment initiation without follow-up. Data for passive activity tracking and walk test data prior to treatment initiation was collected from 1 patient without follow-up. Data were not provided in this CSR.

## PK Sample Collection and Informed Consent Form

Forty-seven out of 327 patients in the zanubrutinib arm were not included in the PK reporting at the data cutoff date because confirming their consent with respect to the location of the bioanalytical laboratory was in process.

## Changes to the Planned Analyses

The following analyses are provided in the CSR but were not defined in the SAP or study protocols.

Patient disposition, characteristics, prior systemic therapies and study drug exposure were provided for the first 415 patients randomized. Efficacy summaries were provided based on the first 415 patients randomized. These included analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review as well as sensitivity analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review that censored for new CLL/SLL therapies and overall survival. Analyses of duration of response by investigator assessment and by independent central review were also provided that include censoring for new CLL/SLL therapies. The above efficacy analyses of PFS and duration of response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were performed for the subgroup of patients with del17p and the subgroup of patients with del17p and/or TP53 mutations.

Summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events among the first 415 patients randomized were provided based on the Safety Analysis Set, including treatment-emergent adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term, Grade 3 or higher, serious, those leading to death or treatment discontinuation. Additionally, treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest were summarized for the first 415 patients randomized. Shift tables for comparison of baseline toxicity grade versus worst postbaseline toxicity grade were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. Box-and-whisker plots showing the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and outlier values (ie, &gt; 1.5 times the interquartile range) were provided for laboratory parameters of interest.

## Protocol deviations

Study conduct was monitored by the CRO and the sponsor's medical monitor (BeiGene). The CRO identified potential protocol deviations in 2 ways: observable protocol deviations were identified by CRO monitors and other project team members, usually during site visits coincident with the source document verification process; and programmatic protocol deviations were identified via automated edit checks of the data in the clinical database. In China, these activities were conducted by BeiGene. Protocol deviations were assessed as either minor or important and reviewed by the CRO or BeiGene's clinical operations team (China) in consultation with the medical monitor before a final determination was made. Important protocol deviations were defined as those that were likely to have had a major impact on the patient's rights, safety, well-being, and/or on the validity of the data for analysis. The final determination of important protocol deviations was made by the medical monitor, using the criteria that define important protocol deviation in the ICH E3 guidelines as follows.

- Patient randomized even though he/she did not satisfy study eligibility criteria
- Patient developed study drug withdrawal criteria but was not withdrawn
- Patient received wrong study treatment or incorrect dose
- Patient received prohibited concomitant treatment

Critical protocol deviations are a subset of important protocol deviations that have the potential to affect the results of analyses of the primary or secondary objectives of the study. Critical protocol deviations were identified and used to define the Per-Protocol Analysis Set. Important protocol deviations were reported in 5 (1.5%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 2 (0.6%) patients in the ibrutinib arm. One patient (064005-004) had a critical protocol deviation (prohibitive medication or treatment) in the zanubrutinib arm. There were no important or critical protocol deviations related to COVID-19.

Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported important and critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases.

This study also has a Cohort 2 of patients with deletion 17p who receive zanubrutinib treatment only since chemotherapy is not appropriate as therapy for this population. Progression-free survival will be compared between the 2 arms in Cohort 1 (patients without deletion 17p) using a stratified log-rank test based on the following 3 randomization stratification factors: age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C vs A or B), and IGHV mutational status (mutated vs unmutated). | Study BGB-3111-304 is a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label randomized study of zanubrutinib versus bendamustine plus rituximab (B+R) in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) without deletion 17p (Cohort 1).

The primary hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint of overall response rate by investigator assessment was to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib. One interim analysis occurred approximately 12 months after 415 patients had been randomized. The final analysis will occur approximately 12 months after 600 patients have been randomized. If noninferiority is demonstrated either at the interim or the final analysis, further testing for the superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib will be performed. Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 600 patients will provide more than 90% power to demonstrate the non- inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib at the non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 | Non-inferiority followed by Superiority (sequential testing).

a Responders are defined as patients with a best overall response of partial response or higher.

b Response ratio is the estimated ratio of the overall response rate of the zanubrutinib arm divided by that of the ibrutinib arm.

- c P-value is calculated for noninferiority via stratified test statistic against a null response ratio of 0.8558 and for superiority via stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test statistic.

d Clopper-Pearson confidence interval.

- e Hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard of the zanubrutinib arm divided by that of the ibrutinib arm.

f Event free rates are estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with 95% CIs estimated using the Greenwood's formula.

## Supportive studies

Two studies, BGB-3111-AU-003 and BGB-3111-205, provide supportive efficacy data for this submission. They are briefly summarized below. Refer to the clinical study reports for additional details on these supportive studies.

## Study BGB-3111-AU-003

Study BGB-3111-AU-003 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter, international doseescalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2) study designed to investigate the safety and PK of zanubrutinib in patients with B-cell malignancies. This first-in-human study for zanubrutinib has been completed. A total of 125 patients with CLL/SLL were enrolled in the study, with a median duration of treatment of 37.13 months (range: 0.8 to 71.5 months) for patients with R/R CLL/SLL, and 49.17 months (range: 3.6 to 65.3 months) for patients with TN CLL/SLL. Data for these patients are presented in Module 2.7.3 and briefly below.

The study was conducted at sites in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. The study was conducted in 2 parts and included patients with TN (N = 22) and R/R CLL/SLL (n = 103) who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. This dose finding and expansion study was the first -in-human study for zanubrutinib and has a median follow-up time of 50.87 months (range: 11.1 to 65.3 months) for patients with TN CLL/SLL and a median follow-up time of 40.44 months (range: 5.3 to 71.5 months) for patients with R/R CLL/SLL. These extensive data help to support high overall response rates, long duration of response, and long PFS in patients with CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib. Results from Study BGB-3111-AU-003 demonstrate that zanubrutinib is safe and effective in patients with CLL/SLL.

Efficacy results for Study BGB-3111-AU-003 are briefly described here; In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, the overall response rate (PR with lymphocytosis or better) was high at 94.2% (97 of 103 patients; 95% CI: 87.8%, 97.8%). The overall response rate was similar in patients with del(17p) mutation (92.3% [12 of 13 patients; 95% CI: 64.0%, 99.8%]). The PR or better rate overall was 90.3%, with a lower rate in patients with del(17p) mutations (84.6%). The CR/CRi rate was 15.5% overall, with a rate of 7.7% (1 patient) in patients with del(17p)+ disease. The overall response rate (PR-L or better) and the PR or better rate in patients with TN CLL/SLL was 100.0% (22 patients; 95% CI: 84.9%, 100.0% for both), with no difference in either rate according to del(17p) mutation status. The CR/CRi rate overall was 22.7%; none of the patients with del(17p) achieved a CR.

In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, the median PFS was 61.4 months (95% CI: 50.4 months, not evaluable) with a median follow-up of 39.4 months. Twenty-four (23.3%) events were observed, including 23 events of disease progression and 1 death. The median PFS was lower in patients with del(17p) (50.2 months) than in patients without del(17p) (61.4 months). Overall, PFS rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 96.0%, 90.6%, and 82.8%, respectively. Lower rates were observed in patients with del(17p) disease (92.3%, 75.5%, and 75.5% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively).

Among patients with TN CLL/SLL, the median PFS was not evaluable (95% CI: 41.4 months, not evaluable) with a median follow-up of 49.4 months. Events were observed in 5 patients (22.7%), including 4 disease progression events and 1 death. Progression-free survival rates overall at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 95.2%, 90.5%, 81.0%, and 74.4%, respectively. With an overall median follow-up time of 48.9 months (range: 5.3 to 71.5 months), the median overall survival was not reached in either patients with R/R CLL/SLL or patients with TN disease. Overall survival rates for patients with CLL/SLL on the study were 98.4%, 95.8%, 91.1%, and 86.2% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Rates were similar for patients with TN disease (100.0%, 95.2%, 90.5%, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

90.5% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively) and R/R disease (98.0%, 95.9%, 91.2%, and 84.6% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively).

In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, overall survival was also similar in patients with del(17p)+ and del(17p)CLL/SLL. The median overall survival was not reached after a median follow-up time of 44.5 months (range: 9.4 to 62.6 months) for patients with del(17p)+ and 49.3 months (range: 5.8 to 71.5 months) for patients with del(17p)- CLL.

## Study BGB-3111-205

Study BGB-3111-205 was a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in patients with CLL/SLL who had relapsed or whose disease was refractory after ≥ 1 prior treatment regimen(s). The study was conducted at sites in China. Ninety -one patients were enrolled and treated with zanubrutinib and received zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily continuously in repeated 28-day cycles. Study BGB-3111-205 demonstrates that zanubrutinib is safe and effective in a population of mostly high-risk patients from China with CLL/SLL. Patients enrolled on BGB-3111-205 were of poor prognosis. At study entry, most patients had advanced clinical stage disease (Binet Stage C CLL [67.1%], Rai Stage III or IV CLL [67.1%], or Stage IV SLL [77.8%]). Over one-half of all patients (56.0%) had unmutated IGHV; approximately one-quarter of all patients had diseas e with ≥ 1 poor prognostic cytogenetic feature including del(17p), del(11q), and/or TP53 mutation. Approximately onehalf of patients had received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. For most patients (79.1%), their disease was refractory to the most recent systemic therapy.

The overall response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of PR-L or better was 87.9% (95% CI: 79.40%, 93.81%; p &lt; 0.0001 with respect to the null hypothesis of 32% [based on the overall response rate in the historical control as of the study start]). The median PFS for this study, as assessed by investigator assessment, has not been reached. The estimated PFS event-free rates by investigator assessment at 24 and 36 months were 80.5% (95% CI: 70.52%, 87.42%) and 68.1% (95% CI: 56.56%, 77.24%), respectively. With a median follow-up time for PFS of 34.5 months (range: 0.8 months, 41.4 months), as estimated by the reverse Kaplan-Meier method, the median PFS as assessed by independent central review, has not been reached. The estimated PFS event-free rates as assessed by independent central review at 24 and 36 months were 80.5% (95% CI: 70.52% to 87.42%) and 68.1% (95% CI: 56.56% to 77.24%), respectively.

Median overall survival (an exploratory study endpoint) has not been reached. The estimated overall survival rates at 24 and 36 months were 89.8% (95% CI: 81.27%, 94.55%) and 86.5% (95% CI: 76.62%, 92.44%), respectively, through a median follow-up time of 35.1 months.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The MAH provided two pivotal studies, 304 and 305. Both are RCTs. While study 304 investigates the use of zanubrutinib in 1L, study 305 investigated the use of zanubrutinib in R/R setting. The line agnostic indication has been sufficiently justified by including and showing efficacy in not only treatment naïve patients, but also in patients with more than 1, 2 and 3 prior therapies. Overall, the design of the studies, objectives and endpoints are endorsed. Scientific advice for study 304 has been followed by the MAH. For study 305, the MAH changed the originally proposed study design in patients with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS was changed to ORR).

In study 305 the primary endpoint was ORR (investigator-based) and PFS (investigator-based) is the only efficacy secondary endpoint considered in the testing strategy. The safety secondary endpoint of rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was partially included in the testing strategy. The type I error due to multiple endpoints is controlled using a hierarchical approach.

One interim analysis was planned for ORR to be performed after the first 415 randomized patients had the opportunity to receive treatment for at least 12 months. The monitoring boundaries for the noninferiority test were based on the O'Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025.

A single analysis of PFS for the purpose of inference was planned when approximately 205 PFS events have occurred. However, two descriptive analyses of PFS for the interim and final analyses of ORR were to be performed. A 1-sided significance level of 0.00001 was to be applied to each of the analyses to compensate for the potential type I error increase from the descriptive analyses.

The secondary safety endpoint rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter would only be tested if the non-inferiority hypothesis for ORR is rejected, but outside the testing strategy for PFS. The monitoring boundaries for the superiority test are based on the O'Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025.

To summarize, the testing strategy is based on a hierarchical testing combined with alpha spending functions to control the type I error due to interim analyses. One interim (64 % of information fraction) and one final analysis are planned for ORR. First, non-inferiority will be tested, and if the null hypothesis is rejected, superiority will be tested. If superiority for ORR is shown, PFS was to be tested, first for non-inferiority and then for superiority. Two descriptive and one final analysis for PFS were planned to take place at the interim analysis for ORR, at the final analysis of ORR, and after 205 events for PFS have occurred. For the descriptive analyses, an alpha of 0.00001 was assigned. The secondary safety endpoint rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was to be tested for superiority if noninferiority for ORR was shown. To control the type I error due to multiple looks, the O'Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function was implemented for ORR and atrial fibrillation rate.

It is not considered appropriate to label the PFS interim analyses as descriptive since alpha is allocated and the 'descriptive' analysis occurs before the inferential analysis. The consequences of making the PFS interim results public may compromise the interpretation of the 'final' PFS results. Of note, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

currently available PFS results are considered 'descriptive' by the MAH. Updated results were requested (see Result section).

The MAH clarified that the atrial fibrillation endpoint is not controlled for type I error inflation in the strong sense. It is reassuring that a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the zanubrutinib arm was reported in two head-to-head studies. However, this does not compensate for the lack of strong control of the family-wise type I error in the 305 study for the endpoint frequency of atrial fibrillation.

The current version of the SAP is version 1.0 dated March 12 th , 2021. The data cut-off date was 31 st December 2020.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Study  304 met  its  primary  endpoint  showing  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful improvement of PFS. Median PFS is 33.7 months in the BR arm, while it is not reached in the zanubrutinib arm.  The  MAH  performed  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  -  all  are  in  line  with  the  primary endpoint/objective of the study. Data are immature. Therefore, the MAH is asked to commit to providing the final PFS analysis as well as OS analysis post-approval (REC). In general, the secondary endpoints seem to support the primary endpoint, however, due to lack of control for multiplicity, no firm conclusions can be drawn. The ORR by IRC is 90% in Cohort 2. The median duration of follow up was 27.9 (range: 1.0 to 38.8) and the event-free rate at 24 months 88.9% (95% CI 81.3, 93.6). These data clearly show that zanubrutinib lead to clinically meaningful results in CLL patients with del17p.

The DMC determined on the 20 April 2021 that the boundary for non-inferiority of ORR (investigatorbased) was crossed and thus the study primary endpoint was met. In the CSR, several supplementary tables and descriptive analyse were presented. Those analyses do not affect the interpretation of the results of the trial.

Study 305 also met its primary objective showing non-inferiority with 1-sided p-value. The ORR rate was 78.3% vs. 62.5% in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib arms respectively. The response ratio is 1.25 (1.10 - 1.41). Superiority was met when applying a 2-sided p-value. However, for the interim analysis, only the first 415 randomized patients were included. The MAH was requested to present ORR, PFS results (investigator-  and  IRC  assessed)  and  OS  results  for  all  randomized  participants  regardless  of  their treatment duration using the ITT and PP-populations: With a median follow-up time of 22 months at the Final analysis ( +11 months) the ORR by INV (and IRC) in the ITT population was of the same magnitude as at the Interim analysis. A number of sensitivity analyses were planned and conducted. All are in line with the primary endpoint, showing at least non-inferiority to ibrutinib.

Despite inclusion exclusion criteria of study 304 in the frontline setting clearly indicate that patients should have been unsuitable for treatment chemoimmunotherapy (FCR), study 305 showed noninferiority and superiority (based on INV assessment) against ibrutinib in the R/R setting. Having in mind that ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems justified to extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 304 and the comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports the use of zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients. There are no scientific arguments to require a non-inferiority study in 1 st  line against ibrutinib. In conclusion, a restriction of zanubrutinib to unfit patients in 1L is not scientifically nor clinically justified and the MAH's proposal for 4.1 of the SmPC is supported.  As SLL is not considered a distinct entity to CLL,  the final indication only refers to CLL as follows:

'BRUKINSA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The MAH has provided two RCTs to support the claimed indication for CLL. Both studies met their primary objective, and are overall considered reasonably well-designed and well-conducted. Study BGB-3111-305 is the pivotal clinical study on which basis the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the treatment of patients with R/R CLL. The study is ongoing. The MAH accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to submit the final study report upon completion of the clinical study, which is expected in March 2023.

## 2.5 Clinical safety

## Introduction

The zanubrutinib safety profile is derived from 1550 patients with CLL/SLL and other B-cell malignancies enrolled into 9 clinical studies (2 Phase 1 studies, 4 Phase 2 studies, and 3 Phase 3 studies, including 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies), as described below. All of these studies have completed enrollment; 5 studies are complete, and 4 studies are ongoing.

Comparative safety data on the use of zanubrutinib in patients with CLL/SLL are derived from the 2 Phase 3 studies, Study BGB-3111-304 (versus B+R) and Study BGB-3111-305 (versus ibrutinib).

## Adverse events

## Study 304:

A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date or was worsening in severity from baseline (pre-treatment) on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days for Arms A and C patients and 90 days for Arm B patients following study drug discontinuation or the  start  of  new  anticancer  therapy  for  CLL/SLL,  whichever  comes  first.  Worsening  of  a  treatmentemergent adverse event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib, or beyond 90 days  after  the  last  dose  of  rituximab  or  bendamustine,  was  also  considered  a  treatment-emergent adverse event. Two sets of summary tables were provided: Treatment-emergent adverse events and combined treatment-emergent adverse events plus adverse events/serious adverse events reported during the Post-treatment Follow-up phase (termed 'Treatment-Emergent + Post-Treatment' in the safety tables). All adverse events, treatment-emergent or otherwise, were presented in patient data listings.

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event plus post-treatment phase adverse events were reported as the number (and percentage) of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events plus posttreatment phase adverse events by system organ class and preferred term. A patient was counted only once by the highest severity grade according to CTCAE v4.03 within a system organ class and preferred term, even if the patient experienced more than 1 treatment-emergent adverse event or post-treatment phase adverse event within a specific system organ class and preferred term.

## Study 305:

A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or the day prior to initiation of a new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever occurred first. If a treatment-emergent adverse event worsened to Grade 5 more than 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of a new CLL/SLL therapy, the Grade 5 AE was considered treatment-emergent. Only treatment-emergent adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  included  in  the  summary  tables.  All  adverse  events,  treatment-emergent  or  otherwise,  were included in patient data listings.

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was reported as the number (and percentage) of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. A patient was counted only once by the highest severity grade according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03 within a System Organ Class  and  Preferred  Term,  even  if  the  patient  experienced  more  than  1  treatment-emergent adverse events within a specific System Organ Class and Preferred Term.

N = number of patients who received zanubrutinib at the initial dose of 160 mg BID or 320 mg QD. Percentages are based on N, unless otherwise specified.

TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date or was worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Worsening of an event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of new anticancer therapy is also considered as treatment-emergent.

Adverse events were graded by NCI-CTCAE (v5.0 in LTE1 study and v4.03 in all other studies), except for hematologic toxicities in BGB-3111-304 and -305 studies where IWCLL 2008 Grading Scale was used.

Treatment-related TEAEs include those events considered by the investigator to be related, probably or possibly related, or with missing assessment of the causal relationship.

## Higher by ≥ 5% in B+R compared with zanubrutinib

- Nausea: B+R 32.6% versus zanubrutinib 10.0%
- Vomiting: B+R 14.5% versus zanubrutinib 7.1%
- Constipation: B+R 18.9% versus zanubrutinib 10.0%
- Rash: B+R 19.4% versus zanubrutinib 10.8%
- Pyrexia: B+R 26.4% versus zanubrutinib 7.1%
- Infusion related reaction: B+R 18.9% versus zanubrutinib 0.4%

- Neutropenia: B+R 45.8% versus zanubrutinib 12.9%

- Neutrophil count decreased: B+R 12.3% versus zanubrutinib 2.5%

- Anemia: B+R 18.9% versus zanubrutinib 4.6%

- Thrombocytopenia: B+R 13.7% versus zanubrutinib 3.8%

## Higher by ≥ 5% in zanubrutinib compared with B+R

- Contusion: zanubrutinib 19.2% versus B+R 3.5%

- Upper respiratory tract infection: zanubrutinib 17.1% versus B+R 11.9%

## Study 305:

The incidences of adverse events were generally comparable between the zanubrutinib arm and ibrutinib arm (Table 14.3.1.2.2.1 and Table 14.3.1.2.3.1). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence difference of ≥ 5% between the 2 arms (Table 25):

- Diarrhoea: zanubrutinib 11.7% versus ibrutinib 18.8%

- Muscle spasms: zanubrutinib 2.5% versus ibrutinib 9.6%

- Atrial fibrillation: zanubrutinib 1.5% versus ibrutinib 7.4%

Source: ADSL,ADAE.Data cutoff: 31DEC2020.Data extraction:19MAR2021.

Abbreviation: TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.

TEAE is defined as an AE that has an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the day prior to initiation of a new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever occurs first. If a TEAE worsens to grade 5 more than 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of a new CLL/SLL therapy, the grade 5 AE will be treatment-emergent.

Notes: Adverse events were classified based on MedDRA Version 23.0.

Adverse event grades were evaluated based on NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03.

Patients with multiple events for a given preferred term and system organ class were counted only once for each preferred term and system organ class, respectively.

TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date or was worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Worsening of an event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of new anticancer therapy is also considered as treatment-emergent.

Patients with multiple events for a given Preferred Term and with multiple Preferred Terms within a System Organ Class are first by System Organ Class and then by Preferred Term within each System Organ Class in the 'All Zanubrutinib' column. Adverse events were graded by NCI-CTCAE (v5.0 in LTE1 study and v4.03 in all other studies), except for hematologic toxicities in BGB-3111-304 and -305 studies where IWCLL 2008 Grading Scale was used.

N = number of patients who received zanubrutinib at the initial dose of 160mg BID or 320mg QD. Percentages are based on N, unless otherwise specified.

Exposure adjusted incidence rate was calculated as the number of patients experiencing the event of interest divided by the total exposure time, which was calculated as the total time of all patients from the first dose date to the first event date, or from first dose date to the treatment-emergent period end date if there was no event.

TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date or was worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Worsening of an event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of new anticancer therapy is also considered as treatment-emergent.

Patients with multiple events for a given Preferred Term and with multiple Preferred Terms within a System Organ Class are counted only once at the Preferred Term and System Organ Class levels, respectively. Events are sorted by decreasing frequency MedDRA Version: 24.0.

TEAEisdefined as anAE that had an onset date or wasworsening inseverityfrombaseline(pretreatment)on or after thefirst dose of study drug andupto30days after thelast dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Worsening of an event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after last dose of study drug and prior to initiation of new anticancer therapyisalso considered astreatment-emergent.

Treatment-related TEAEs include those events considered by the investigator tobe related, probably or possibly related, or with missing assessment of the causal relationship. /bgb\\_3111/filing\\_cll\\_2021/iss/dev/pgm/tlfs/t-teae-sum-sub-i.sas 24AUG202102:44t-40-teae-sum-sex-i.rtf

Adverse events were graded by NCI-CTCAE (v5.0 in LTE1 study and v4.03 in all other studies), except for hematologic toxicities in BGB-3111-304 and -305 studies where IWCLL 2008 Grading Scale was used.

## Post marketing experience

Cumulatively, as of 24 July 2021, approximately 7,576,866 capsules of zanubrutinib have been supplied to the market in Canada, China and the USA (equivalent to 1,894,217 daily doses; approximately 62,309.8 person-months; 5192.5 person-years. No regulatory actions concerning safety have been taken since the International Birth Date of 14 November 2019.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The safety pool for this application consists of 938 patients with CLL/SLL and a total of 1550 with B-cell malignancies (the All Zanubrutinib pool), which is the safety pool presented in the SmPC (updated from 779  patients  for  the  initial  application  for  WM).  The  All  Zanubrutinib  pool  all  received  either  the recommended dose of 160 mg BID (93.2%) or 320 mg QD (6.2%) as monotherapy. The median duration of exposure for this safety pool is 23 months. In line with the Scientific advice by the CHMP;  'With respect to safety, taking into account the increasing experience with BTK inhibitors and the preclinical data  suggesting  that  BGB-3111  is  more  selective  than  ibrutinib  (which  should  result  in  higher tolerability),  the  proposed  safety  database  (more  than  1000  patients  exposed,  500  patients  with CLL/SLL)  were  considered  overall  adequate  for  the  assessment  in  the  claimed  indication'-    this  is considered an adequate safety pool.

Two randomized Phase 3 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305) support the safety in the applied indication for CLL:

## Study BGB-3111-304:

Patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised against bendamustine + rituximab (BR) in patients not deemed fit to receive FCR. Furthermore, there was a non-randomised arm of patients with del17/ tp53 mutation receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy; these patients were also included in the safety population. Zanubrutinib had lower rates of neutropenia and gastrointestinal adverse events (particularly nausea and vomiting) compared with B+R. Higher rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was seen with B+R compared with zanubrutinib (B+R 13.7%; zanubrutinib 8.3%;);  the  same  concerns  treatment  modification  (B+R  70.0%;  zanubrutinib 47.9%).

## Study BGB-3111-305:

Patients with R/R CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised against the firstgeneration  BTK-inhibitor  ibrutinib.  Diarrhoea  and  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  appeared  lower  among zanubrutinib-treated patients than in patients treated with ibrutinib.

Generally, the safety profiles of the zanubrutinib treatment arms in studies 304 and 305 were consistent with results in the approved prescribing information and no new adverse events were observed.

## Integrated Safety Analysis Set

In the Integrated Safety Analysis Set (N=1550), the overall zanubrutinib safety profile also appeared consistent with the known safety profile. No new signals for zanubrutinib were identified when safety findings were evaluated in the larger pooled All Zanubrutinib group.

Across all groups, neutropenia and hypertension were the most commonly (&gt; 5% of patients) reported ≥Grade 3 adverse events. The lower frequenci es of pneumonia and neutrophil count decreased could well be explained by the treatment-naïve patients in study 304 and the shorter follow-up in study 305.

In Study 304 SAEs reported in &gt;1% of patients were pneumonia (3.1%), COVID-19 (2.0%), COVID-19 pneumonia (2.0%), and atrial fibrillation (1.8%).

In Study 305 SAEs reported in &gt; 1% of patients were pneumonia (3.1%) and COVID-19 (2.2%)

In  the  ISS  pneumonia  was  the  most  common  SAE  in  every  group  studied  reported  in  6.8%  of  the population.

Adverse events were the most common cause of death in both studies and comparable between arms.

The safety database has been doubled in size with this application and thus allows for better characterization of the safety profile of Brukinsa. The ADRs Table under section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated and justification as to why some of the common ADRs should not be included was provided (see SmPC section 4.8).

Tumour lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with zanubrutinib therapy, particularly in patients who were treated for CLL. A relevant warning has been included in the SmPC section 4.4 advising to assess relevant risks (e.g., high tumour burden or blood uric acid level) and take appropriate precautions (see SmPC section 4.4).

The safety database has been doubled in size with this application and thus allows for better characterization of the safety profile of Brukinsa. The MAH is asked to update the Table 3 in the SmPC; atrial fibrillation and flutter were included. In addition, hypertension, TLS, Hyperuricemia, pruritus, purpura and Peripheral oedema were also added on the list of ADR in Table 3 of Section 4.8 these ADRs were added in the PL as well (see PI).

## Additional expert consultations

Not applicable.

## Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety

Not applicable.

## Conclusions on clinical safety

Zanubrutinib treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent across patient groups. The spectrum of adverse events observed across all patient groups is consistent with the known toxicity profile for the BTK inhibitor class as well as those intrinsic to B-cell malignancy patient populations and were generally manageable, and for the most part, were reversible.

No new safety concerns were observed.

## 3 Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1 Therapeutic Context

## Disease or condition

BRUKINSA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

## Available therapies and unmet medical need

Treatment options for CLL/SLL patients include multiagent chemoimmunotherapy, such as fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR), bendamustine/rituximab(B+R), and chlorambucil/ obinutuzumab (Cl+O). Such treatments, however, are less effective in patients with high-risk disease; furthermore,  many  patients  cannot  tolerate  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy  due  to  age  and comorbidities. Recent treatment options include BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib have also been approved however, these treatments have significant toxicities,  which  limit  tolerability  and  may  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Front-line  treatment recommendations as per European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines are summarized below.

- Patients without TP53 mutation or del(17p)
- o IGVH unmutated
-  Fit: ibrutinib or FCR (or BR in patients above 65 years)
-  Unfit: venetoclax + obinutuzumab or ibrutinib or acalabrutinib or chemoimmunotherapy (if contraindicated to targeted therapy or if they are not available) or chlorambucil + obinutuzumab
- o IGVH mutated
-  Fit: FCR (or BR in patients above 65 years) or ibrutinib
-  Unfit: venetoclax + obinutuzumab or chlorambucil + obinutuzumab or ibrutinib or acalabrutinib
- All  patients  WITH  TP53  mutation  or  del(17p):  ibrutinib  or  acalabrutinib  or  venetoclax  +/obinutuzumab or idelalisib + rituximab

## Main clinical studies

Study BGB-3111-304 is an ongoing, international, Phase 3, open-label, randomised study designed to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib versus B+R in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. Approximately 710 patients will be enrolled in the study.

The study included approximately 450 patients in Cohort 1 and approximately 80 additional patients from Chinese sites in Cohort 1a to support further analysis in the Chinese population. Cohort 1a was opened to enrollment in China when the Cohort 1 sample size was reached. Patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a were randomised 1:1 to receive zanubrutinib (Arm A) or B+R (Arm B).

There are 2 additional cohorts in the study which were not randomised: Cohort 2/Arm C, with approximately 100 planned patients with CLL/SLL with del(17p), and Cohort 3/Arm D, with approximately 80 planned patients with del(17p). Patients in Cohort 2 (Arm C) received zanubrutinib monotherapy in a non-randomized fashion since chemoimmunotherapy is not indicated as treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for patients with del(17p) due to poor response reported in this patient population. Patients in Cohort 3 (Arm D) received zanubrutinib in combination with venetoclax and are not included in this application.

Study BGB-3111-305 is an ongoing, international Phase 3, open-label, randomised study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in 652 patients (600 planned) with R/R CLL/SLL. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the following treatment arms:

- Arm A: Zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily
- Arm B: Ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily

## 3.2 Favourable effects

Study 304 met its primary endpoint by showing a median PFS of 33.7 months in the BR arm, while it is not reached in the zanubrutinib arm; the hazard ratio (95% CI) being 0.42 (0.28, 0.63). The MAH performed a number of sensitivity analyses - all are in line with the primary endpoint/objective of the study.

The ORR by IRC is 90% in Cohort 2. The median duration of follow up was 27.9 months (range: 1.0 to 38.8) and the event-free rate at 24 months 88.9% (95% CI 81.3, 93.6).

Study 305 also met its primary objective showing non-inferiority with 1-sided p-value. The ORR rate was 78.3% vs. 62.5% in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib arms respectively. The response ratio is 1.25 (1.10 - 1.41). Superiority was met when applying a 2-sided p-value.

## 3.3 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The IRC-assessed PFS results for study 304 with a DCO date of 07 May 2021 was considered as the final inferential analysis of PFS. The MAH has provided updated INV-PFS with a DCO date of 07 March 2022 (+10 months) remaining consistent with the primary analysis with a HR of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.48, descriptive P&lt;0.0001). The MAH will provide the final OS analysis from Study 304 expected in Q2 2023.

Despite inclusion /exclusion criteria of study 304 in the frontline setting clearly indicating that patients should have been unsuitable for treatment chemoimmunotherapy (FCR), thus covering also 1 st  line patients, study 305 showed non-inferiority against ibrutinib in the R/R setting. Having in mind that ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems justified to extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 304 and the comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports the use of zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients.

The MAH will provide the final CSR from Study 305.

## 3.4 Unfavourable effects

Study BGB-3111-304:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised against bendamustine + rituximab (BR) in patients not deemed fit to receive FCR. Furthermore, there was a non-randomised arm of patients with del17/ tp53 mutation receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy; these patients were also included in the safety population. Zanubrutinib had lower rates of neutropenia and gastrointestinal adverse events (particularly nausea and vomiting) compared with B+R. Higher rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was seen with B+R compared with zanubrutinib (B+R 13.7%; zanubrutinib 8.3%;) or treatment modification (B+R 70.0%; zanubrutinib 47.9%;).

## Study BGB-3111-305:

Patients with R/R CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised against the firstgeneration  BTK-inhibitor  ibrutinib.  Diarrhoea  and  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  appeared  lower  among zanubrutinib-treated patients than in patients treated with ibrutinib.

Generally, the safety profiles of the zanubrutinib treatment arms in studies 304 and 305 were consistent with results in the approved prescribing information and no new adverse events were observed.

## Integrated Safety Analysis Set

In the Integrated Safety Analysis Set (N=1550), the overall zanubrutinib safety profile also appeared consistent with the known safety profile. No new signals for zanubrutinib were identified when safety findings were evaluated in the larger pooled All Zanubrutinib group.

The profile of adverse events of special interest was similar in the All Zanubrutinib, All R/R CLL/SLL, and All CLL/SLL groups. In the All Zanubrutinib group, events within the categories of infections (65.7%), hemorrhage (48.1%), and neutropenia (27.5%) were the most frequently reported. Across all groups, neutropenia and hypertension were the most commonly (&gt; 5% of patients) reported ≥Grade 3 adverse events.

## 3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Long term safety data are still needed to be evaluated, more information will be expected from ongoing studies such as BGB-3111-LTE1; an Open-label, Multicenter, Long-term Extension Study of Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) Regimens in Patients with B-cell Malignancies aiming to evaluate the longterm safety of zanubrutinib, as monotherapy or in combination, in patients with B-cell malignancies who participated in a parent study for zanubrutinib (see RMP). Further data will also be provided from the final study report from study 305.

## 3.7 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Second-line CLL/SLL treatment is guided by the duration of the first remission for relapsed disease. Refractory disease is defined as having either no response to treatment or relapse within 6 months after the last treatment. ESMO guidelines recommend a change of therapeutic regimen in case of symptomatic relapse within 3 years, or refractory disease, in which case treatment with venetoclax (+/- rituximab), ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, or other BTKi monotherapy should be considered. Patients with remissions of more than 3 years may be re-exposed to the same time-limited regimen; however, repetition of the FCR regimen is not recommended. Other treatment options include acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, venetoclax + rituximab, or idelalisib + rituximab. For patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p), allogenic stem-cell transplantation should be considered for fit patients. The US NCCN guidelines' list of preferred regimens for  RR  CLL/SLL  patients  are  the  same  as  for  frontline  treatment  except  venetoclax  monotherapy  is recommended only for patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p).

Since study 305 showed non-inferiority against ibrutinib in the R/R setting and having in mind that ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems justified to extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 304 and the comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports the use of zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients. There are no scientific arguments to require a non-inferiority study in 1L against ibrutinib.

The integrated safety pool has doubled since the initial approval for Waldenström's MB; from 779 to 1550 patients. Zanubrutinib treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent across patient groups. The spectrum of adverse events observed across all patient groups is consistent with the known toxicity profile for the BTK inhibitor class as well as those intrinsic to B-cell malignancy patient populations and were generally manageable, and for the most part, were reversible. No new safety concerns were observed.

## Balance of benefits and risks

Collectively results from Studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305, including favourable PFS and ORR,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

durable responses, and improvements in important safety and tolerability assessments such as events leading to discontinuation or interruption of treatment, provide substantial evidence of a positive benefitrisk assessment for zanubrutinib in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL. In study 305 zanubrutinib demonstrated efficacy across risk groups.

## Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

In addition, as part of the application the MAH requested a 1-year extension of the market protection. However, since 1-year extension has been already granted by the CHMP as part of the procedure II-02 in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), an assessment as part of this procedure would be considered redundant and was not performed.

## 3.8 Conclusions

The overall B/R of Brukinsa is positive.

## 4 Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Brukinsa; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.3 of the RMP has also been submitted.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Brukinsa is not similar to Gazyvaro within the meaning

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## 5 EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope
