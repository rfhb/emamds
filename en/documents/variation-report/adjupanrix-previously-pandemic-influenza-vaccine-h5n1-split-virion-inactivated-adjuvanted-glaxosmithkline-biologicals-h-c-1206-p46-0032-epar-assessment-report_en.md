## Introduction

On 4 th  April, the MAH submitted the D203 report and annex report (Day 364) for paediatric study FLU D-PAN H5N1-032 for Adjupanrix (mock-up pandemic license) and  Prepandrix (pre-pandemic license), in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  Monodose  Hepatitis  A vaccine Havrix was used as an active control in this study.

The applicant states that the above mentioned study is part of a clinical development program and acknowledges  that  this  study  was  performed  with  another  strain  (A/Indonesia/05/2005  (H5N1)  like PR8-IBDC-RG2 influenza strains) than the strain included in Adjupanrix (A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like  strain  used  (NIBRG-14)).  Nevertheless  the  data  were  deemed  useful  from  the  perspective  of licenses for both Adjupanrix and Prepandrix.

A short clinical expert statement has been provided.

The applicant stated that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for the above mentioned product.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that FLU D-PAN H5N1-032 is a part of a clinical development program. A line listing of the concerned study was annexed.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

As in initial MAA

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted interim report for: FLU D-PAN H5N1-032.

## 2. Clinical study

The  study  FLU  D-PAN  H5N1-032  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  open,  active-controlled  study  to evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  prime-boost  schedule  of  the  H5N1  candidate  vaccine adjuvanted  with  AS03B  administered to  children  aged  3  to  17  years  old.  The  priming  and  boosting H5N1  antigens  were  D-Pan  H5N1  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005,  respectively, adjuvanted with AS03B. The D-Pan formulation administered in the study corresponded to the half of an adult dose, i.e. H5N1 vaccine formulation containing 1.9 µg of HA antigen and AS03B.

The study was conducted in a single centre in Philippines.

## Methods

- Objective(s)

Co-primary immunogenicity objective:

- -To assess the superiority of the HI antibody response against A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (H5N1) 10 days following H5N1 vaccination on Day 182 (1.9 μg A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 [H5N1] HA antigen adjuvanted with AS03B) in subjects previously primed with two doses of heterologous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  vaccine  (Group  H5N1\\_H5N1)  versus  non  primed  subjects  (Group Havrix\\_H5N1).

Criterion to be used for the co-primary objective:

- -If  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the  HI  geometric  mean  titer (GMT) ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1\\_H5N1 compared to Group Havrix\\_H5N1) is greater than 1.0, then  the  superiority  of  priming  vaccination  was  shown  and  an  anamnestic  immune  response demonstrated.

Co-primary safety objective:

-  To  evaluate  the  safety  of  the  pediatric  H5N1  vaccine  when  administered  as  a  two-dose  primary vaccination  to  subjects  3  to  17  years  of  age  in  terms  of  occurrence  of  medically  attended  adverse events (MAEs) from Day 0 to Day 182 [ and to Day 364 ] .

Secondary safety objective:

-  To  evaluate, after each vaccination, safety and reactogenicity in terms of 7-day solicited local and general symptoms, unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 21 days after each dose and Day 0 to Day 84 overall, and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the entire study.
- Study design

This is a phase III, randomized, open, active-controlled, single-center study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity  of  a  prime-boost  schedule  of  the  H5N1  candidate  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03B administered to children 3 to 17 years of age. Subjects were assigned to four treatment groups in a ratio of 3:3:2:2 at the first visit, stratified by age (3-9 years and 10-17 years).

Blood samples were to be collected:

- On Days 0, 42, 182, 192 and on Day 364 for Group H5N1\\_H5N1 and Group Havrix\\_H5N1;
- On Days 0, 42, 182 and on Day 364 for Group H5N1\\_Havrix;
- On Days 0, 42, and 182 for Group Havrix\\_Havrix.

## · Statistical Methods

## Primary confirmatory analysis:

The primary analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. Since the percentage of subjects excluded from this ATP cohort was greater than 5% in any treatment group, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated cohort (TVc) was performed. The GMT ratio was obtained using an ANCOVA model on the logarithm-transformed titers. The ANCOVA model included the treatment group as fixed effect and the pre-vaccination (Day 182) log-transformed titer  as  regressor. The GMT ratio and its 95% CI were derived as exponential-transformation of the corresponding group contrast in the model. If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1\\_H5N1 compared to Group Havrix\\_H5N1) was greater than 1.0, then the superiority of priming vaccination was shown and an anamnestic immune response demonstrated.

## Secondary confirmatory analysis:

No confirmatory analyses were performed on secondary objectives.

## · Immunogenicity results

The  co-primary  immunogenicity  objective  was  met  and  thus  an  anamnestic  immune  response  was demonstrated, as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the HI GMT ratio on Day 192 (Group H5N1\\_H5N1 compared to Group Havrix\\_H5N1) was greater than 1 (the value of the lower 95% CI was 7.30).

## · Safety results

The percentage of subjects with MAEs up to Day 182 was 36.9% in the pooled H5N1 groups versus 30.8% in the pooled control  groups.  Results  suggest  an  increase  in  fever  following  the  second  and particularly the third dose of H5N1 vaccine for children &lt;6 years of age. No other safety concerns were identified.

## Serious adverse events:

Up to Day 203, seven non fatal SAEs were reported for five subjects. All events were resolved and none were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

## Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events:

There were no SAEs leading to premature discontinuation.

## Pregnancies

In  addition  to  one  subject  (group  H5N1\\_Havrix)  who  reported pregnancy  up  to Day  203,  five  other subjects reported pregnancy during this study period until Day 364. Two of the subjects were in the group H5N1\\_Havrix, while three subjects were in the H5N1\\_H5N1 group. All subjects were exposed to the vaccine before conception. Three subjects out of the five gave birth to male live infants, whereas pregnancy was still ongoing on Day 364 for the remaining two.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The D203 report of the study D-Pan H5N1-032 allows the following conclusions to be made:

- -The co-primary immunogenicity objective was met and an anamnestic immune response was demonstrated;
- -The percentage of subjects with MAEs up to Day 182 was 36.9% in the pooled H5N1 groups versus 30.8% in the pooled control groups;
- -Results  suggest  an  increase  in  fever  following  the  second  and  particularly  the  third  dose  of H5N1 vaccine for children &lt;6 years of age;
- -No other safety concerns were identified.

The Annex report (Day 364) did not reveal new safety issues.

In the absence of any significant new data on vaccine effectiveness or new safety concerns, there is no need for an update of the product information.
