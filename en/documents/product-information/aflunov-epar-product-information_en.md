For the full list of excipients see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe. Milky-white liquid.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus in individuals 6 months of age and above.

AFLUNOV should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Individuals 6 months of age and older: administer two doses (0.5 ml each), at least 3 weeks apart.

Data on a third dose (booster) administered 6 months after the first dose are limited (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

There is limited experience in elderly over 70 years of age (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the event of an officially declared influenza pandemic due to A/H5N1 virus, individuals previously vaccinated with one or two doses of AFLUNOV that contained haemagglutinin (HA) antigen derived from a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the influenza pandemic strain may receive a single dose of AFLUNOV instead of two doses that are required in previously unvaccinated individuals (see section 5.1).

## Paediatric population

No data are available in children aged less than 6 months.

## Method of administration

The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants or in the deltoid muscle region of the upper arm in older individuals.

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) of this vaccine.

However, in a pandemic situation caused by the strain included in this vaccine, it may be appropriate to give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 and to residues (eggs and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, hydrocortisone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide).

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

Immunisation should be postponed in patients with febrile illness untill the fever is resolved.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Immunocompromised individuals, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced immune response to active immunisation.

The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally.

There are no data with AFLUNOV using the subcutaneous route of administration. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

## Protection against influenza

There is no immune correlate of protection established for influenza A (H5N1). A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. Some degree of cross-reactive immunity has been observed against H5N1 viruses of clades different to that of the vaccine strain. However, the degree of protection that may be elicited to H5N1 strains of other clades is unknown (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of AFLUNOV with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines.

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'

## Potassium

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

AFLUNOV may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, and immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs.

There are no data on co-administration of AFLUNOV with vaccines other than non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Limited data were obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with AFLUNOV or similar pandemic H1N1v vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1 were insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.

However, it is estimated that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more than 90,000 women were vaccinated during pregnancy with Focetria (an H1N1 pandemic vaccine similar to AFLUNOV) which contains the same amount of adjuvant MF59C.1 as AFLUNOV.

Post-marketing spontaneously reported adverse events and an interventional study do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy.

In addition, two large observational studies designed to assess the safety of Focetria exposure in pregnancy showed no increase in the rates of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abortions, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, neonatal deaths, and congenital malformations among almost 10,000 vaccinated pregnant women and their offspring compared with unvaccinated controls.

Since AFLUNOV is expected not to be used in an emergency situation, its administration during pregnancy might be deferred as a precautionary approach.

Healthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.

## Breast-feeding

There are no data regarding the use of AFLUNOV during breast-feeding. The potential benefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering AFLUNOV during breast-feeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

There are no data concerning human fertility. A study in rabbits did not indicate reproductive or developmental toxicity of AFLUNOV (see section 5.3). Male fertility has not been assessed in animals.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Aflunov has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant containing either the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 or the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 strain has been evaluated in nine clinical trials in healthy subjects involving 5055 adults and elderly (7.5 or 15 micrograms HA), and children (7.5 micrograms HA). There were 4041 adults subjects 18 to 60 years of age, 540 elderly subjects 61 years of age and above. In the paediatric population, there were 214 subjects 6 to 35 months of age, 167 subjects 3 to 8 years of age and 93 subjects 9 to 17 years of age.

The overall safety profile was similar across the adult, elderly and paediatric populations.

Irrespective of antigen dose, or age group, most local and systemic adverse reactions after administration were of short duration, with onset close to the time of vaccination, and were mild or moderate in severity. Across all trials, there was a general trend towards decreased reports of local adverse reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

In adults 18 to 60 years, the most frequently reported (≥ 10%) adverse reactions were injection site pain (59%), myalgia (34%), headache (26%), injection site redness (24%), fatigue (24%), injection site induration (21%), injection site swelling (15%), chills (13%) and mal a ise (13%).

The majority of these side effects usually disappear within 3 days without treatment.

## Clinical trials in special populations

Adverse reactions in special populations have been evaluated in two clinical trials, V87\\_25 and V87\\_26, involving adult (18-60 years) and elderly (≥ 61 years) subjects who were either healthy or with underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across studies V87\\_25 and V87\\_26, the safety of AFLUNOV in healthy adult and elderly subjects was consistent with existing safety data from previous clinical trials. However, in immunocompromised subjects 18 to 60 years of age, slightly higher rates of nausea (13.0%) were reported. In addition, higher rates of arthralgia (up to 23.3%) were reported in both adult and elderly subjects, who were immunocompromised or with underlying medical conditions.

The following solicited adverse reactions were additionally collected in these two studies and reported with the following frequencies across subjects who received AFLUNOV irrespective of age or health status: diarrhoea ( up to 11.9% ), loss of appetite ( up to 10.9% ) and vomiting ( up to 1.7% ). In both studies, subjects with underlying medical and immunosuppressive conditions reported higher frequencies of diarrhoea, loss of appetite and vomiting compared to healthy subjects (irrespective of age).

## Post-marketing surveillance

No post-marketing experience exists for AFLUNOV.

In addition to the adverse events listed from clinical studies, the following adverse events were reported from post-marketing surveillance with H1N1v Focetria vaccine (licensed for use from 6 months of age during the 2009 influenza pandemic, and containing the same MF59 adjuvant and manufactured with the same process as AFLUNOV).

## Blood and lymphatic system disorders

Lymphadenopathy.

## Immune system disorders

Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis including dyspnoea, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, in rare cases leading to shock.

## Nervous system disorders

Dizziness, somnolence, syncope, presyncope, neuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions and neuritis.

## Cardiac disorders

Palpitation, tachycardia.

## Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders

Cough.

## Gastrointestinal disorders

Abdominal pain.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Generalised skin reactions including pruritus, non-specific rash, angioedema.

## Muscoskeletal and connective tissue disorders

Muscular weakness, pain in extremities.

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Asthenia.

The following additional adverse events were reported from post-marketing surveillance with seasonal non-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines in all age groups and a seasonal trivalent MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine approved for use in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older:

## Blood and lymphatic system disorders

Thrombocytopenia (in some cases reversible platelet counts less than 5000 mm 3 ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Nervous system disorders

Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis and Guillain Barré syndrome.

## Vascular disorders

Vasculitis which may be associated with transient renal involvement.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Erythema multiforme.

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Extensive swelling of injected limb lasting more than one week, injection-site cellulitis-like reaction (some cases of swelling, pain, and redness extending more than 10 cm and lasting more than 1 week).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine ATC Code J07BB02.

Clinical efficacy and safety

Clinical trials with AFLUNOV have been conducted with either the former A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) (clade 1) or the current A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5NI) vaccine strain (clade 2.2.1).

Immune response to AFLUNOV A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5NI)

## Adults (18-60 years)

## A phase II clinical trial (V87P1) was conducted with AFLUNOV

(A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in 312 healthy adults. Two doses of AFLUNOV were administered three weeks apart to 156 healthy adults. Immunogenicity was assessed in 149 subjects.

In phase III clinical trial (V87P13) 2693 adult subjects were enrolled and 2566 received two doses of AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset (n=197) of subjects.

In a third clinical trial (V87P11) 194 adult subjects were enrolled and received two doses of AFLUNOV (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity was assessed in 182 subjects.

The seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate** and the seroconversion factor*** for anti-HA antibody to H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and to H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 in the adults measured by SRH assay was as follows:

A single vaccination with AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) induced high and rapid serological response in subjects primed 6 to8 years previously with two doses of a different surrogate H5N vaccine, having same formulation as AFLUNOV but using the strain H5N3.

In a phase I clinical trial (V87P3) adult subjects aged 18 to 65 years primed 6 to 8 years previously with 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine/A/Duck/Singapore/97, were administered 2 booster doses of AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). SRH results after the first dose, that mimic prepandemic priming plus single heterologous booster dose, revealed seroprotection and seroconvers ion rates of 100% (74 - 100) and an 18-fold increase in SRH area (GMR).

## Alternative vaccination schedules:

In a clinical trial evaluating 4 different vaccination schedules in 240 subjects 18 to 60 years of age, where the second dose occurred either 1, 2, 3 or 6 weeks after the first AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) dose, all vaccine schedule groups after 3 weeks from the second vaccination achieved high levels of antibodies as evaluated with SRH. SRH seroprotection rates ranged from 86% to 98%, seroconversion rated from 64% to 90%, and GMR ranged from 2.92 to 4.57 . The magnitude

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of immune response was lower in the group who received the second dose 1 week later and higher in the groups with longer interval schedules.

## Subjects with underlying medical or immunosuppressive conditions:

Immunogenicity of AFLUNOV (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) in adults (18 to 60 years) and elderly (&gt;61 years) subjects with underlying medical conditions (Study V87\\_25) or immunosuppressive conditions (mainly HIV-infected subjects) (Study V87\\_26) in comparison to healthy adults (18-60 years) and elderly (&gt;61 years), was evaluated in two randomised, phase III controlled clinical trials (with a seasonal trivalent inactivated MF59-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine approved for use in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older as a comparator). In trial V87\\_25 and V87\\_26, 96 and 67 subjects, respectively, were over the age of 70 years. In both trials, immunogenicity of AFLUNOV was shown by HI, SRH and MN assays following both the first and second dose.

Geometric mean area*, seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody to H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 measured by SRH assays 21 days after the second dose were as follows:

HI results for the two clinical studies revealed lower values than those reported in previous studies. Seroconversion rates against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 ranged from 37.50% to 43.10% in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

healthy adults, and from 19.18% to 26.47% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 21.43% to 30.65% in healthy elderly subje cts, and from 24.49% to 27.86% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies.

MN results against homologous A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 indicate a seroconversion rate of 66.67% in healthy adults, and ranging from 33.57 % to 54.14% in adults with immunosuppressive or underlying medical conditions, respectively; seroconversion rates ranged from 24.39 % to 29.03% in healthy elderly subjects, and from 31.65% to 39.42% in elderly subjects with immunosuppressive or underlying medical conditions. Similar trends were observed for seroprotection rates in both studies.

In both studies V87\\_25 and V87\\_26, the lower levels of antibodies (as measured by HI, SRH and MN assays) and reduced seroprotection rates in adults and elderly (≥ 61 years old) subjects with underlying medical or immunosuppressive conditions, suggest that AFLUNOV may not elicit the same level of protection against A/H5N1 strain as compared to healthy adults (see section 4.4). These studies provided limited immunogenicity data in subjects with some underlying medical (in particular, renal impairment and peripheral cardiovascular disease) and immunosuppressive conditions (in particular, transplant recipients and patients under cancer treatment). In these trials, lower levels of antibodies and reduced seroprotection rates against homologous H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were also measured in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to healthy adults, though previous studies showed induction of sufficiently immunogenic responses against H5N1 strains (see above for information on elderly).

## Paediatric population

The immunogenicity of aH5N1 in the paediatric population was assessed in studies V87P6 and V87\\_30.

Study V87P6 was conducted with AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in 471 children from 6 months to 17 years of age. Two doses (7.5 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml each) of AFLUNOV were administered three weeks apart and a third dose ( 7.5 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml) 12 months following the first dose. After 3 weeks from the second vaccination (day 43) all age groups (i.e. 6 to 35 months, 3 to 8 years and 9 to 17 years) achieved high levels of antibodies to (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) as evaluated with SRH and HI assays as presented in table below.

MN results against a A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection rate of 9 9% (95% CI: 94-100), a seroconversion rate ranging from 9 7% (95% CI: 91-99) to 9 9% (95% CI: 96-100) and a GMR ranging from 29 (95% CI: 25-35) to 50 (95% CI: 44-58).

Study V87\\_30 was a randomised, observer-blind, multicentre study to measure the immunogenicity of six formulations in terms of H5N1 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and MF59 adjuvant ratio. In this study, 420 paediatric subjects 6 months to 8 years of age were divided into two age cohorts: 6 to 35 months of age (N=210) and 3 to 8 years of age (N=210).

The vaccine was administered in two separate injections given 3 weeks apart. Antibody levels against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were measured by HI and MN assays three weeks after the second vaccination (Day 43). The immunological response for the the approved formulation (7.5 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjuvant, 0.5 ml dose) and the study formulation with half the antigen content (3.75 micrograms HA with 100% MF59 adjvant, 0.5 ml dose), are presented below.

## Information from non-clinical studies

Efficacy against challenge with virus homologous and heterologous to vaccine strains was evaluated in the ferret model (Study 765-N106857). AFLUNOV (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 clade 1) and an AFLUNOV-like H5N1 vaccine (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 clade 2.2.1) were tested. Animals received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

one or two doses of vaccine containing 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of antigen, followed by intranasal challenge on Day 42 after the second vaccine dose with a lethal dose of A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus.

All animals receiving 2 doses of AFLUNOV were protected, and 9 4% of animals receiving a single dose of AFLUNOV were protected. 8 7% of animals challenged with virus heterologous to the vaccine strain after 2 doses of vaccine were protected, and a single dose of heterologous vaccine protected 5 6% of the animals.

In a similar study, intranasal challenge was delayed until approximately 4 months after the second dose of vaccine was administered (Study 780-N007104). In this study 1 00% of animals were protected against homologous challenge, and 8 1% of animals were protected against heterologous challenge. Vaccination protected animals from lethal challenge even when HI antibody titres were low or undetectable.

In Study 673-N106850, AFLUNOV containing 7.5 micrograms of antigen (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) was immunogenic, able to fully protect against mortality and to reduce virus shedding from nasal washes after a lethal homologous challenge. In Study CBI-PCS-008, AFLUNOV containing either 7.5 or 15 micrograms of antigen (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) was able to reduce the proportion of animals shedding virus as well as the amount of virus shedding after a non-lethal homologous challenge. Serological testing indicated both doses were immunogenic and induced cross-reactive antibodies against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (Study VIV-PCS-001).

Efficacy against challenge with the heterologous virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 was also tested (Study 2810200). Ferrets received one or two doses of vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Two doses of vaccine protected 9 2% of animals, and a single dose of vaccine protected 5 0% of animals against challenge with the A/Indonesia/5/2005 virus. Lung damage was reduced in vaccinated groups. Viral shedding and viral titres in lungs were also reduced, suggesting that vaccination may reduce the risk of viral transmission.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data obtained with AFLUNOV and with seasonal influenza vaccine containing MF59C.1 adjuvant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (through the end of the lactation period).

## · Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs)

The requirements for submission of PSURs for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

PSUR submission when AFLUNOV is used during an influenza pandemic:

During a pandemic situation, the annual frequency of PSUR submission may not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for benefit-risk balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.

In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared and the zoonotic vaccine is used, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall submit more frequent simplified PSURs with a periodicity defined in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## D. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

## · Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.

## AFLUNOV suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe

Zoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What AFLUNOV is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive AFLUNOV
3. How AFLUNOV is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store AFLUNOV
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What AFLUNOV is and what it is used for

AFLUNOV is a vaccine for use in individuals 6 months of age and older, intended to be given in the context of outbreaks of zoonotic influenza viruses (coming from birds) with pandemic potential to prevent flu caused by H5N1 viruses similar to the vaccine strain reported in section 6.

Zoonotic influenza viruses occasionally infect humans, and can cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Human infections are primarily caused by contact with infected animals, but do not spread easily between people.

AFLUNOV is intended also to be given when there is anticipation of a possible pandemic due to the same or a similar strain.

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

As with all vaccines, AFLUNOV may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive AFLUNOV

## You should not receive AFLUNOV:

- if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of AFLUNOV (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to be vaccinated with AFLUNOV provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an allergic reaction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine

- if you have had any allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in the vaccine, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics), hydrocortisone or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (see section 6. Further information);
- if you have a severe infection with fever (over 3 8°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with AFLUNOV;
- if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with AFLUNOV the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given AFLUNOV.
- in the presence of immune deficiencies AFLUNOV may be administered but a protective immune response may not be elicited.

Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.

Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

AFLUNOV may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, especially elderly subjects and those with weakened immune systems, such as HIV patients, or those with underlying long term medical problems, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart problems. Tell your doctor if you have a weak immune system or an underlying long term medical problem.

In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

## Other medicines and AFLUNOV

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.

Data obtained in adults showed that AFLUNOV can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There is no information on administration of AFLUNOV with noninfluenza vaccines. If administration of AFLUNOV with other vaccines can not be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before receiving this vaccine. Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine.

## Driving and using machines

Some effects mentioned under section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How AFLUNOV is given

Your doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle) or upper thigh, depending on the muscle mass. The vaccine should never be given into a vein

## Individuals 6 months of age and older::

One dose of 0.5 ml will be given. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.
