## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes.  This disorder afflicts an estimated  6%  of  the  adult  population  in  Western  society  and  over  2%  worldwide.    The  worldwide prevalence of T2DM is increasing and expected to grow by 3% per annum, reaching a total of 220 million  cases  by  2010.    Although  the  Diabetes  Control  and  Complications  Trial  (DCCT)  and  the United  Kingdom  Prospective  Diabetes  Study  (UKPDS)  have  shown  that  intensive  treatment  of hyperglycaemia leads to a lower incidence of diabetes complications (e.g., retinopathy and nephropathy),  many  patients  remain  inadequately  treated  using  diet/exercise  regimens  and  existing therapies.  Furthermore,  over  time,  there  is  a  progressive  loss  of β -cell  function  that  has  been  best characterized in the UKPDS study, but has also been observed in other studies of patients with T2DM. This  gradual  loss  of β -cell  function  underlies  the  progressive  deterioration  in  glycaemic  control  in T2DM and the corresponding need for more intensive therapies to treat patients with the disease.

Currently available therapies are:

- Sulphonylureas (SU), which increase insulin secretion. Their main adverse effects are hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
- Metformin (Met), which increases intestinal glucose utilisation, decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. Metformin may also improve dyslipidaemia. Gastrointestinal undesirable effects and lactic acidosis represent the main adverse effects.
- Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as pioglitazone, which increase insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Undesirable effects are fluid retention or weight gain, possibility of increased fracture rate in female patients and possibly increased risk of heart failure.
- Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which have shown limited efficacy but with no risk of hypoglycaemia. Gastrointestinal undesirable effects limit compliance.
- Insulin, which is used in type 2 diabetes when oral agents have failed to achieve glycaemic control or in case of complications. Insulin may cause hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
- Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors), such as sitagliptin, which enhance active incretin levels leading to increases in insulin release and decreases in glucagon levels in a glucose-dependant manner. Common adverse events are upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache.

A  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  tablet  (Velmetia  (MK-0431A))  containing  2  antihyperglycaemic agents (AHAs)-one novel (sitagliptin phosphate [MK-0431]) and one commonly used (metformin hydrochloride)--with complementary mechanisms of action for lowering glucose has the potential to provide a new treatment option for patients with T2DM.

The  application  concerns  a  centralised  procedure  in  accordance  with  article  10b  of  Directive 2001/83/EC as amended - relating to applications new fixed combination products.

Relevant Guidelines for this product are:

- Note  for  guidance  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00).
- Note for guidance on fixed combination medicinal products (CPMP/EWP/240/95).

## The claimed indication was:

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:

Velmetia is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.

Velmetia is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled with any two of the three agents: metformin, sitagliptin, or a sulphonylurea.

## The approved indications are:

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:

Velmetia  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  patients inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.

Velmetia is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  their  maximal  tolerated  dose  of metformin and a sulphonylurea.

## The proposed dose recommendations are:

For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.

For patients switching from co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin, Velmetia may be initiated at the dose of sitagliptin and metformin already being taken.

For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea the dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Velmetia  is  used  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  a  lower  dose  of  the  sulphonylurea  may  be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Sitagliptin (Januvia) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that has been approved for marketing in the EU in March 2007. The indication is:

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Januvia is indicated:

- to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.
- to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, Januvia is indicated:

- in combination with the PPAR γ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPAR γ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Metformin is  a  biguanide  that  has  been  used  widespread  for  T2DM.  It  has  become  the  most commonly selected first-line agent in the treatment of patients with T2DM. It was originally granted national authorisations in the EU between 1959 and 1997. Following a referral to the CPMP under Article 11 of Council Directive 75/319, as amended, a decision on a harmonised SPC for metformin was issued in February 2001. Metformin is authorized for the indications:

' Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients, when dietary management and exercise alone does not result in adequate glycaemic control.

-  In  adults,  metformin may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral anti-diabetic agents or with insulin.

-  In  children  from  10  years  of  age  and  adolescents,  metformin  may  be  used  as  monotherapy  or  in combination with insulin .'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommended starting dose of metformin is two or three times daily 500 or 850 mg taken with or after meals. Due to frequent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, uptitration is recommended at 10-15 day intervals. The recommended maximum daily dose is 3000 mg but most patients do not tolerate such high doses and the additional effect achieved with daily doses beyond 2000 mg is usually minor.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Velmetia  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  sitagliptin  and  metformin  hydrochloride  as active  substances  in  the  strength  combinations  50  mg/850  mg  and  50  mg/1000mg.  The  other ingredients  are  microcrystalline  cellulose,  povidone,  sodium  stearyl  fumarate,  sodium  lauryl  sulfate and purified water. The film consists of polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc, iron oxide red, iron oxide black and purified water.

The film-coated  tablets  are  marketed  in  opaque  blisters  (outside  PVC/PE/PVDC  coated  blister  foil, inside heat seal laquered with aluminum foil).

## Drug Substance

Two  active  substances  are  used  in  this  fixed  combination  product,  sitagliptin  and  metformin hydrochloride.

## Sitagliptin

The drug substance is sitagliptin as monohydrate phosphate salt and its chemical name is 7-[(3 R )-3amino-1-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3a ]pyrazine phosphate (1:1) monohydrate according to the IUPAC nomenclature.

Sitagliptin is a white to off-white powder and exhibits pH dependent aqueous solubility. It is soluble in water  and N,N -dimethyl  formamide,  slightly  soluble  in  methanol,  very  slightly  soluble  in  ethanol, acetone  and  acetonotrile  and  insoluble  in  isopropanol  and  isopropyl  acetate.  The  above-mentioned active substance contains a chiral centre and is used as a single enantiomer (R).

## · Manufacture

Sitagliptin is synthesised in two reactions steps, hydrogenation, in order to obtain the stereospecific free base, followed by the preparation of the phosphate monohydrate salt. Finally the active substance is purified by crystallisation.

The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Critical parameters have been identified and adequate in-process controls included.

Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented.

Structure elucidation has been performed by ultraviolet spectroscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and the molecular weight as determined by mass spectroscopy is in agreement with the expected molecular weight.  The results of the X-ray crystallography are consistent with the proposed molecular structure.

## · Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for colour (white to off-white powder), identification (IR), assay (98.5-101.5 % w/w HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition and water content (Karl Fisher).

The  specifications  reflect  all  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  active  substance.  The  analytical methods,  which  were  used  in  the  routine  controls,  were  described  and  their  validations  are  in accordance with the ICH Guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Impurities  have  been  described,  classified  as  process  related  impurities  and  possible  degradation products,  and  qualified.  Residual  solvents  were  satisfactorily  controlled in the active  substance.  All limits  are  in  accordance  with  ICH  requirements.  The  chiral  purity  was  also  tested.  Certificates  of analyses for the active substances issued by the finished product manufacturer were provide and all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines and demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. The active substance is not susceptible to degradation under the influence of light. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies support the retest period.

## Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride's chemical name is 1,1-Dimethylbiguanide monohydrochloride according to the IUPAC nomenclature. This active substance is described in the Ph. Eur. It is a white, hygroscopic crystalline powder that is odourless and has a bitter taste. The compound is freely soluble in water, slightly  soluble  in  ethanol  and  practically  insoluble  in  chloroform,  acetone,  ether  and  in  ethylene chloride.  It  has  a  specific  crystalline  form  and  has  not  demonstrated  polymorphism  or  solvates. Particle  size  does  not  significantly  influence  dissolution  of  metformin  hydrochloride,  because  it  is freely soluble in water.

The chemistry, manufacturing and control information on metformin hydrochloride has been evaluated by  the  EDQM  and  a  European  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the  Monograph  of  the  European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) has been issued.

Metformin  hydrochloride  which  was  used  in  all of the formulation  development  meets  the specifications of Ph. Eur. Monograph.

The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriates for controlling the quality of this active substance.

Batch analysis data of the three batches of metformin hydrochloride drug substances are provided. The three lots are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines  and  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  metformin  hydrochloride.  The  re-test  period proposed was considered acceptable according to the stability data submitted.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. Velmetia film-coated tablets were developed 3 tablet strengths of sitagliptin / metformin hydrochloride (50 mg/500 mg, 50 mg/850, 50 mg/1000 mg) which were used either in clinical trials or in stability program. However, only two tablet strengths (50 mg/850 and 50 mg/1000 mg) will be marketed in the EU.

The  main  aim  of  the  applicant  was  to  develop  a  formulation  which  would  be  bioequivalent  to individual sitagliptin phosphate and metformin hydrochloride tablets co-administered. The formulation was optimized to provide rapid release of the both active substances. In this context, the excipients have been chosen in order to take into account the following objectives: facilitate rapid dissolution of the drug substances as expected with an immediate release dosage form; provide satisfactory chemical stability and provide appropriate process robustness.

A  fluid  bed  granulation  process  was  selected  based  on  the  poor  compatibility  of  metformin hydrochloride and its high drug load in the fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  was  noticed  that  the  formulation  development  activities  were  driven  by  both  product  quality  and process robustness  considerations.  The  key  points  examined  during  formulation  development  were: the effect of binder level on granule and tablet properties, the effect of surfactant on tablet dissolution, and  the  effect  of  lubricant  on  stability,  tablet  compression  performance  and  tablet  dissolution. Furthermore, it was verified that the excipient levels were optimized to provide high quality tablets for film-coating  as  well  as  maintain  rapid  dissolution  of  both  active  substances.  Additionally,  the composition optimization sought  to  minimize  the  excipient  quantities  consistent  with  achieving  the desired quality attributes, and to minimize the tablet sizes.

Results of formulation and process development studies demonstrate that the tablet formulation and the manufacturing process are robust and under control.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing processes such as fluid bed granulation, drying, granulation milling, blending and lubrication,  compression,  and  film-coating  unit  operations.  Furthermore,  the  equipment  used  is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. It was demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

## · Product Specification

The  drug  product  specifications  were  established  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  and  include  the following  tests:  appearance,  identification  (IR  and  HPLC),  assay  (95.0%-105.0%)  of  both  drug substances,  degradates  (sitagliptin)  and  related  substances  (metformin)  by  HPLC-testing,  dose uniformity, dissolution, and microbial limits (Ph Eur).

All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  drug  product  were  properly  described. Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the CHMP and ICH guidelines.

Batch  analysis  data  on  three  clinical  and  pilot  scale  batches  scale  batches  confirm  satisfactory uniformity of the product at release

## · Stability of the Product

The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guideline. Three production scale batches of 50/500 mg and 50 mg /1000 mg have been stored at long term and accelerated conditions in the proposed market packaging. The bracketing of the 50/850 mg tablets by testing only 50/500 mg tablets and 50/1000 mg tablets was considered acceptable.

Two  production  batches  per  strength  were  stored  under  photostability  stress  testing  under  ICH conditions.  The photostability results show that the tablets are not sensitive to light.

Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant guidelines. The results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  finished  product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were not unresolved quality issues.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Velmetia is a fixed dose combination product containing two approved drugs, sitagliptin (Januvia) and metformin.

The non-clinical primary and secondary pharmacodynamics (PD) of sitagliptin have been previously fully evaluated and approved. Preclinical animal models that accurately mimic the  human pharmacology of metformin, however, are not available. Hence, there are no primary and secondary pharmacodynamic reports for the FDC.

The preclinical safety  of  the  individual  drugs  has  been  fully  evaluated  and  approved  by  regulatory agencies.  As  the  known  pharmacological  properties  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  do  not  suggest undesirable combination effects, no additional safety pharmacology studies were performed.

Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  in  preclinical  species  are  of  limited  relevance  to  human physiology,  as  such,  and  with  support  of  the  clinical  data  no  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction studies with the FDC have been reported.

The applicant provided minimal data on the toxicology of metformin, based on the package inserts and NDA of the products Fortamet and Glucophage. However, metformin is a well-known substance and there is an extensive amount of clinical experience. Therefore, from a preclinical point of view, it was not considered necessary to request more safety data regarding metformin.

The applicant received Scientific Advice pertaining to the toxico-pharmacological development of the FDC from the CHMP on 21 January 2005. This scientific advice was followed, and as such a series of toxicity studies in dogs were conducted to assess the potential for both toxicological and toxicokinetic interactions with co-administration of both compounds.

Pivotal studies regarding sitagliptin, and the combination of metformin and sitagliptin, were performed in  compliance with GLP. However, the exploratory single dose oral toxicokinetic study TT05-1150 and the repeated-dose toxicology study with metformin alone (TT06-6018) were non-GLP studies.

Metformin is a well-established substance. It is not known whether published studies with metformin were performed in compliance with GLP.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Sitagliptin is an orally-active DPP-4 inhibitor that acts as an incretin enhancer. The main mechanism of  action  of  sitagliptin  is  inhibition  of  the  activity  of  the  DPP-4  enzyme,  which  hydrolyzes  active incretin hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP),  to  produce  inactive  degradation  products.  These  hormones  are  released  after  a  meal  (by specialized  endothelial  cells  in  the  intestine)  and  play  an  important  role  in  the  glucose  homeostasis (glucose-dependent  insulin  biosynthesis  and  secretion).  As  such,  GLP-1  and  GIP  increase  insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells when glucose concentration is elevated, but not during hypoglycaemia. In turn, higher insulin levels result in enhanced uptake of glucose in tissues. GLP-1 also  lowers  glucagon  secretion  from  pancreatic  alpha  cells  which,  along  with  higher  insulin  levels, leads to reduced hepatic glucose production. Efficacy of sitagliptin in lowering blood glucose levels after a dextrose challenge was shown in lean mice, in diet-induced obese mice and in diabetic db/db mice. With respect to the pharmacology of the metabolites of sitagliptin, M1, M2, and M5 were shown to be ~300-, 1000-, and 1000-fold less active,  respectively,  than  sitagliptin as DPP-4 inhibitors. The DPP-4 inhibitor activity of M3, M4, and M6 was not determined. The levels of these metabolites in human plasma are low and they are not expected to have a meaningful impact on the pharmacological activity of sitagliptin.

Metformin is a well-established treatment for type 2 diabetes.  The efficacy of metformin is believed to be mediated primarily via inhibition of hepatic glucose production.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The selectivity  of  sitagliptin  was  assessed  in  a  number  of  assays,  including  several  proline-specific enzymes, proteases, ion channels and 5-HT2 receptors. Sitagliptin appeared to have little affinity for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these biological biomolecules (generally IC50 &gt;100 µM). Only a weak activity was demonstrated in assays for some ion channels (IKr, L-type Ca channel, and Na channel Site II) and 5-HT2 receptors. Considering  safety  pharmacology  data,  together  with  the  safe  clinical  use  of  5-HT2  receptor antagonists,  these  observations  are  not  considered  to  be  a  major  concern  for  sitagliptin  in  T2DM. Sitagliptin is not expected to inhibit DPP-4 related proteins DPP-8, DPP-9, FAP and PEP, with IC50s exceeding 50 µ M. DPP-6 and DPP-10 are homologues of DPP-4 that lack a catalytic serine residue and  are  therefore  inactive  as  peptidases.  Both  proteins  appear  to  modulate  cellular  trafficking, membrane targeting, and functional properties of neuronal Kv4-mediated A-type potassium channels. Though  it  is  not  known  whether  sitagliptin  can  bind  to  the  hydrolase  domain  of  DPP-6/10,  such binding even if it occurred would not be expected to influence potassium channel function.

No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  assays  were  performed  with  metformin;  these  studies  were  not considered necessary in view of the extensive clinical experience accumulated over the many years on the market.

No secondary pharmacodynamic assays were performed with the fixed dose combination.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Sitagliptin caused no effect on respiratory system, renal function, platelet function, the gastrointestinal system, and behavioural and other CNS effects. Minor cardiovascular effects were observed in dogs (decreased blood pressure and heart rate). Sitagliptin inhibited hERG current in a hERG channel assay at  high  concentrations  (IC50  &gt;  100x  human  Cmax  at  maximally  recommended  dose  of  100  mg/day sitagliptin). No effects were observed on ECG or QT-interval in dogs.

No formal safety pharmacology studies have been performed on metformin. These studies were not considered necessary in view of the extensive clinical experience accumulated over the many years on the market.

No specific safety pharmacology studies were conducted with the FDC. It is accepted that the known pharmacological  properties  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  do  not  suggest  undesirable  combination effects  that  would  require  further  safety  pharmacology  studies.  ECG  recordings  were  however performed during the repeated-dose toxicology studies in order to investigate potential interactions and how any PD or pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions might affect the QT c . These measurements did not reveal any treatment-related effects.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No  preclinical  PD  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed  on  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and metformin. This is endorsed as sitagliptin and metformin act through different mechanisms of action, hence  adverse  PD  interactions  are  not  expected.  Furthermore,  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and metformin is a clinically approved combination.

No  non-clinical data were provided on possible PD  interactions of sitagliptin/metformin in combination with a sulphonylurea (SU). However, clinically, no relevant concerns were discovered regarding the safety of the combination of sitagliptin/metformin with glimepiride.

## Pharmacokinetics

Sitagliptin is a moderate to high clearance drug, with a relatively short plasma half-life. Sitagliptin was rapidly  absorbed,  bioavailable,  and  exhibited  fairly  linear  oral  pharmacokinetics  in  rat  and  dog. In vitro plasma  protein  binding  is  low  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog,  and  human.  [ 14 C]Sitagliptin-related radioactivity is distributed widely throughout the body following intravenous (IV) administration to rats, but is cleared efficiently from all tissues. However, cecum, intestine, liver and kidneys contained still relatively high  concentrations  of  sitagliptin  related  material  after  24 hours.  Enterohepatic circulation can therefore not be ruled out. Sitagliptin was shown to cross the rat and rabbit placenta readily. The sitagliptin metabolites, which are present at low to trace levels in plasma, are formed by N-sulfation,  N-carbamoyl  glucuronidation,  hydroxylation  of  the  triazolopiperazine  ring,  and  by oxidative desaturation of the piperazine ring followed by cyclization via the primary amine. All the metabolites  detected  in  human  plasma  are  observed  in  rat  and  dog;  however,  not  all  observed metabolites are present in the same matrix as observed in humans. Due to the minor metabolism of sitagliptin,  consequences  of  the  differences  in  metabolism  between  human,  rat  and  dog  on  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed  PK  are  not  expected. In  vitro studies  indicated  that  CYP3A4  is  primarily  involved  in  the metabolism of sitagliptin, with a minor contribution of CYP2C8. In dogs and humans, sitagliptin is cleared primarily by renal excretion of parent drug, while in rats it is cleared by both renal and biliary excretion. Sitagliptin is shown to be a substrate of the mouse and human P-glycoprotein (Pgp), and the human renal organic anion transporter  hOAT3. Sitagliptin is  secreted  into  rat  milk  (milk-to-plasma ratio ~ 4). Sitagliptin has no inhibitor capacity for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at concentrations up to 100 µ M. Furthermore, sitagliptin is not an inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro . In vitro , sitagliptin  has  no  inhibitory  effect  on  the  MDR1  Pgp-mediated  transport  of  digoxin,  verapamil, ritonavir, and vinblastine. Sitagliptin weakly inhibited MDR1 Pgp-mediated transport of quinidine, but only at very high concentrations. Cyclosporin A (potent Pgp inhibitor) significantly inhibited MDR1 Pgp-mediated transport of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is a weak inhibitor of hOAT3-mediated cimetidine uptake; however not at clinically relevant concentrations. The effect of various commonly prescribed drugs (cimetidine, enalapril, enalaprilat, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, furosemide, gabapentin, ibuprofen,  indapamide,  probenecid  and  quinapril)  on  hOAT3-mediated  uptake  of  sitagliptin  is evaluated in vitro. For the major half of these drugs, the IC50 is higher than their maximum total or unbound concentration in plasma. Some of these drugs (probenecid, fenofibric acid, furosemide and ibuprofen)  have  plasma  Cmax  concentrations  of  free  and  bound  fraction  above  the  observed  IC50 levels. Sitagliptin is eliminated by renal and non-renal mechanisms.  Assuming  that tubular reabsorption of sitagliptin is minimal, approximately 50% of the total plasma clearance of sitagliptin is due  to  active  renal  secretion.  Therefore,  even  in  the  unlikely  event  that  active  renal  secretion  is completely inhibited; the change in plasma exposure of sitagliptin would be only approximately 2fold. Given the apparently wide therapeutic index of sitagliptin, clinically relevant increases in plasma concentrations would not be expected in the presence of hOAT3 inhibitors.

The pharmacokinetics of metformin in rats after oral and IV administration are dose proportional. Oral bioavailability in rats was 29 - 34%. In vitro studies indicate that transepithelial transfer of metformin in the intestine is at least partly by passive permeation.

After oral administration of [ 14 C]metformin to normal and diabetic mice, the highest concentrations of radioactivity  are  found in the  small  intestine, stomach,  colon,  salivary  gland,  kidney  and  liver. The mean binding value of metformin to rat plasma protein is 15%.  The equilibrium plasma-to-blood cells partition ratios of metformin in rat plasma are 1.37, 1.25, and 1.33 at initial blood concentrations of 1, 5, and 20 mg/mL, respectively.

Metformin is the major radioactive component in plasma and urine from mice, rats, dogs and humans dosed with [ 14 C]metformin. A metabolite, 1-methyl biguanide, is identified in rabbit plasma and urine. Studies with various inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes indicated that metformin is metabolized via CYP2C11, 2D1, and 3A1/2 in rats.

Metformin  is  excreted  primarily  in  urine  in  rats  and  dogs.  The  estimated  renal  clearance  value  of metformin is considerably faster than the reported glomerular filtration rate in rats, indicating that, like sitagliptin,  metformin  is  subject  to  active  renal  secretion  in  rat  renal  tubules.  However,  unlike sitagliptin, metformin has been shown to be a substrate of the cationic organic transporters hOCT1 and hOCT2, but not hOAT1, hOAT3 or hOCT2-A.

Possible PK interactions of sitagliptin and metformin with other drugs have been studied in previous submissions  or  are  known  from  clinical  experience.  Interactions  between  sitagliptin  and  metformin based on cytochrome P450 metabolism are not likely since neither substance is metabolised to a great extent.  Furthermore,  different  enzymes  are  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  these  substances  and sitagliptin is shown not to be an inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Interactions at the level of renal transporters are not likely either, since different transporters are involved. Toxicokinetic results  of  a  combination study in dogs also indicate that no relevant PK interactions occur between sitagliptin and metformin.

Pharmacokinetic interactions of sitagliptin/metformin in combination with a SU were not investigated non-clinically.  However,  clinically,  there  was  no  cause  for  concern  regarding  the  combination  of sitagliptin/metformin with glimepiride.

## Toxicology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Single dose toxicity

Single dose studies with sitagliptin were performed in mice and rats. The highest non-lethal dose in mice is 1000 mg/kg (122 times the human exposure based on AUC). In rats the highest non-lethal dose was 2000 mg/kg for females and 3000 mg/kg for males (271 and 182 times the human exposure based on AUC respectively).

The LD50 values for metformin in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs are 2400, 1770, 552, and 375 mg/kg, respectively.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Sitagliptin repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice (up to 93 days), rats (up to 184 days) and dogs (up to 365 days). The maximum non-lethal dose was 750 mg/kg/day for mice (approximately 80 times the human exposure based on AUC), 500 mg/kg/day for rats (48 times the human exposure based on AUC), and ≥ 50 mg/kg/day for dogs ( ≥ 22 times the human exposure based on AUC).

In both mice and rats renal toxicity is observed at systemic exposure values above 58 times the human exposure levels, while the no-effect level is found at 19 times the human exposure level. In mice it consisted of dilatation of the renal pelvis (associated with variable loss of papillary, medullary, and cortical  tissue)  and  increases  in  relative  kidney  weights.  In  rats,  renal  toxicity  consisted  of  renal tubular necrosis (accompanied by tubular degeneration and dilatation) and treatment related urinary changes  (consistent  with  renal  tubular  necrosis).  The  mortality  seen  in  rats  is  due  to  renal  tubular necrosis.  It  is  likely  that  renal  toxicity  is  specific  for  rodents,  due  to  the  very  high  and  rapid  renal elimination of sitagliptin in rodents. This is supported by the lack of any renal toxicity in dogs.

Liver toxicity  was  seen in  both  mice  and  rats  and consisted  of liver  weight increases,  centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, inflammation, degeneration, and necrosis (at higher doses) in the 14-week range-finding  study  at  doses ≥ 500  mg/kg/day;  and  cystic  degeneration  and  focal  hepatocellular alteration in the 106-week carcinogenicity study at 500 mg/kg/day. Even though the mechanism for sitagliptin-induced  liver  toxicity  is  not  completely  clear,  the  safety  margins  for  these  effects  are sufficient.  In  addition,  no  hepatotoxicity  is  found  in  dogs  treated  with  maximum-tolerated  doses  of sitagliptin for up to 1 year .

Sitagliptin  caused teeth  abnormalities  in  rats at  exposures  similar  to the  human  exposure,  based  on AUC.  These  effects  were  only  observed  on  the  continuously  growing  teeth  in  rats;  they  were  not observed  on  the  continuously  growing  teeth  in  mice.  Velmetia  is  not  indicated  for  use  in  children below 18 years of age thereby excluding patients with ongoing tooth development, indicating that in the current indication, these effects are of little relevance.

Other treatment-related findings in the rat were myocardial degeneration, mammary gland necrosis, uterine  atrophy,  tremors,  lymphoid  and  some  haematological  changes,  alopecia,  increased  organ weights (thyroid (F), adrenal, prostate) and decreased organ weights (pituitary gland (F) and spleen (M)). These findings are observed at doses equal to or above the LOAEL for liver and renal toxicity. The safety margins for these effects are sufficient.

Intermittent  tremors  of  a  transient  nature  are  observed  in  rats  receiving  high  doses  of  sitagliptin ( ≥ 1500 mg/kg/day). The NOEL for neurological signs in dogs is 10 mg/kg. In dogs, the safety margin for these effects is approximately 6 (based on AUC as well as on Cmax). This is rather low, however no signs of neural toxicity are observed in the clinical trials with sitagliptin at doses sufficiently above the maximum recommended clinical dose. The neurological findings in rats and dogs are not considered relevant for humans receiving therapeutic doses of sitagliptin. However, as a precautionary measure potential neurotoxicity is addressed in the Risk Management Plans of Januvia and Velmetia.

The clinical relevance of the muscle fibre degeneration found in dogs is limited. This is based on the severity of muscle degeneration found in dogs (slight degeneration of isolated fibres which was only observed microscopically), the relative low incidence of muscle degeneration in the two studies (2/8

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 1/8 dogs for 14-week and 27-week study, respectively), and the lack of adverse muscle findings for the high-dose in the 1-year dog study as well as in the phase 3 trials. However, in view of a safety margin of ≥ 6, this finding is monitored in the Risk Management Plans of Januvia and Velmetia.

Necrotic skin lesions in monkeys are reported by the FDA as potential risk of DPP-4 inhibitors. A 14week  repeated-dose  study  in  monkeys  (TT  #06-1005)  showed  a  no-effect  level  for  skin  lesions  of ≥ 100  mg/kg/day,  corresponding  with  a  22-28  times  higher  exposure  as  compared  to  the  maximum recommended dose in human (100 mg/day).

A study in which metformin was administered at 50 mg/kg/day to dogs showed increased mortality, increased serum lactate levels and emesis.

## Sitagliptin + metformin

The  applicant  performed  three  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  in  dogs  to  rule  out  unexpected toxicologic effects of the combination (two studies with the combination sitagliptin + metformin, and one study with metformin alone to establish the effects of metformin alone in the dog strain used). The dog was chosen as the most sensitive species since in rats very high doses of sitagliptin were required to produce toxicity. The dog proved also rather sensitive towards metformin; repeated application of 50  mg/kg/day  of  metformin,  alone  or  in  combination  with  different  doses  of  sitagliptin,  caused salivation, emesis, increased serum lactate and unscheduled deaths (probably due to lactic acidosis). In a  few  early-death  animals  in  the  combination  study  TT06-6000  (10 mg/kg  sitagliptin  +  50 mg/kg metformin or 50 mg/kg sitagliptin + 50 mg/kg metformin), vacuolation and/or neuronal necrosis was observed in  the  brain.  These  histological  findings  were  accompanied  by  severe  physical  signs  predeath and therefore are most likely signs of agony. Spontaneous deaths also occurred in study TT066018 (metformin 50 mg/kg/day alone) but in this study no histological examination was performed. The brain effects as observed in study TT06-6000 were most likely caused by metformin and not by the combination of metformin and sitagliptin, because it was shown that degenerative effects in the brain have also been observed in studies where dogs had been administered metformin alone. Also in these studies, these effects were observed at doses from 50 mg/kg/day. The combination studies with sitagliptin  and  metformin  in  dogs  thus  indicated  no  evidence  of  toxicokinetic  or  toxicologic interactions.

No  non-clinical  studies  were  performed  for  the  combination  of  sitagliptin/metformin  with  a  SU, however,  sitagliptin,  metformin  and  SU  have  different  toxicity  profiles,  and  therefore  interactions seem unlikely. Furthermore, clinically, no relevant concerns were discovered regarding the safety of the combination of sitagliptin/metformin with glimepiride.

## · Genotoxicity

Sitagliptin was not seen to be genotoxic in an in vitro assay on gene mutations in bacteria (Ames test), in an in vitro assay on gene mutations in mammalian cells (rat hepatocytes), in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay (Chinese hamster ovary cells) or in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test.

Metformin is not mutagenic or clastogenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, chromosomal aberration assay, cytogenetic assay, or in vivo micronucleus assay.

- Carcinogenicity

In a 2-year mouse study performed with sitagliptin no treatment-related increase in tumour incidence is observed. In a 2-year rat study, there is an increased incidence in hepatic tumours which is likely related  to  chronic  hepatic  toxicity.  The  safety  margin  for  these  tumours  is  19,  which  is  considered sufficient.

No increased tumour incidence is observed in a 2-year study in mice with metformin. No tumourigenic potential  is  observed  in  rats  except  for  an  increase  in  benign  stromal  uterine  polyps  in  females. Extensive clinical experience does not indicate an increased tumourigenic potential.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Sitagliptin did not affect male or female fertility in rats up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 100-fold the human exposure at 100 mg/day). In combined embryo-foetal/pre- and postnatal studies in rats, a slight  increased  incidence  of  foetal  rib  malformations  (absent,  hypoplastic,  and  wavy  ribs)  was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day as well as decreased body weight gain in the pups. The NOEL for this effect was 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 32-fold the human exposure at 100 mg/day).  An embryofoetal study in rabbits showed no developmental effects. Sitagliptin is excreted in rat milk.

Metformin did not affect fertility and is not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Metformin is excreted in rat milk.

The  FDC  of  sitagliptin/metformin  should  not  be  used  in  women  who  are  breast-feeding;  this  is reflected in the SPC.

- Local tolerance

Sitagliptin  was  not  seen  to  be  a  dermal  irritant  in  rabbits  and  in  an in  vitro human  epidermal  skin culture system. Sitagliptin is a mild ocular irritant in the in vitro bovine corneal opacity assay and a moderate ocular irritant in vivo in rabbits. Sitagliptin is not a dermal sensitizer in a local lymph node assay in mice.

No local tolerance studies were performed with metformin.

- Other toxicity studies

Immunotoxicity:  Inhibition  of  DPP-4  by  sitagliptin  does  not  seem  to  play  a  major  role  in  T-cell dependent immune responses. Animal data on the role of DPP-4 in T-cell immune response showed no consistent changes after inhibition/knock out of DPP-4. In vitro studies showed that the concentrations of  sitagliptin  needed  to  evoke  noticeable  effects  on  T-cells  are  sufficiently  far  above  the  maximal plasma concentration which is reached after a therapeutic dose of 100 mg in humans. In the repeateddose toxicity studies, there is no suggestion of an immunosuppressive effect of sitagliptin.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Environmental  risk  regarding  sitagliptin  has  been  evaluated  during  the  registration  procedure  of Januvia.  It  is  concluded  that  sitagliptin  is  neither  vPvB  nor  PBT  and  that  the  risk  to  the  aquatic environment is acceptable.

No  ERA  is  provided  for  metformin.  However,  metformin  is  a  well-established  substance,  and therefore submission of complete new studies is regarded not necessary.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical pharmacology programme consisted of 4 pharmaceutical/pharmacokinetic studies which served to bridge the FDC tablet to the clinical pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data for sitagliptin and metformin combination use presented in the original sitagliptin MAA.

Dose selection for the sitagliptin component of Velmetia was based upon dose-range finding studies (P010 and P014). Dose selection of the metformin component of Velmetia was based upon the usual prescribed doses of metformin in the treatment of patients with T2DM.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Initial  data supporting the efficacy of the combination of sitagliptin and metformin emerged from a Phase  II  study  (P015).  The  Phase  III  clinical  development  program  was  designed  to  evaluate  3 treatment modes:

- sitagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  to  ongoing  metformin  monotherapy  dosed  at ≥ 1500  mg/day (P015, P020, and P024)
- sitagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  to  the  ongoing  combination  of  metformin  and  a  sulfonylurea (P035, Stratum 2)
- initial treatment with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin (P036).

The  claimed  indication  and  approved  indication  are  very  similar;  for  details  on  the  indication  and posology see section 3.1 of this report.

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 January 2005 pertaining to the clinical development programme of the fixed dose combination.

Velmetia  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  below  18  years  of  age.  Limited  safety  data  is available  in  patients  &gt;  75  years  of  age;  therefore  Velmetia  should  be  used  with  caution  as  age increases. Further special populations such as patients with renal insufficiency and hepatic impairment have also been studied, leading to contraindications in both.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

In  support  of  the  current  MAA  for  the  proposed  FDC,  the  Applicant  submitted  a  single  dose  pilot study (P038), a single dose bioequivalence study (P048), a double blind cross-over study assessing incretin  levels  (P050),  and  a  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  (P095)  as  well  as  a  single  dose sitagliptin/metformin  interaction  study  (P012). The  latter  study  had  already  been  submitted  and evaluated during the initial MAA for sitagliptin and suggests the absence of relevant pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between sitagliptin and metformin. The submitted pharmacology studies are listed below, and a summary is presented in the introduction section 3.4.

Study PN012:  Sitagliptin (1000 mg) and metformin (50 mg) drug interaction study in patients; N=13

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study PN038:    Three way, two part, single dose biocomparison study with 2 probe formulations of sitagliptin/metformin 50/500 mg and 50/1000 mg FDC tablets and coadministration of corresponding doses of sitagliptin and metformin as individual tablets; N=24
- Study PN048:  Two  way,  two  part,  single  dose  bioequivalence  study  with  the  final  formulations sitagliptin/metformin 50/500 mg and 50/1000 mg FDC tablets and coadministration of corresponding doses of sitagliptin and metformin as individual tablets; N=48
- Study PN095: Two way, three part, single dose bioequivalence study with the final formulations of sitagliptin/metformin 50/500 mg, 50/850 and 50/1000 mg FDC  tablets and coadministration of corresponding doses of sitagliptin and metformin (Glucophage®) as individual tablets; N= 82
- Study PN050  Double  blind,  four  period  crossover  study  to  evaluate  effect  of  sitagliptin  and metformin alone or in combination on post-meal active GLP-1 concentrations; N=18

## · Absorption

Following oral administration of a 100 mg dose, maximal plasma concentrations of sitagliptin were reached within 1 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability (BA) of sitagliptin is high i.e. 87%. A highfat  meal had no effect on the rate or extent of absorption; therefore, sitagliptin can be administered with or without food.

After an oral dose of metformin, Tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. Absolute BA of a 500 mg or 850 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60 % in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30 %.

After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the PK of metformin absorption is non-linear.

At the usual metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within  24  to  48  hours  and  are  generally  less  than  1 µ g/ml.  In  controlled  clinical  trials,  maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 4 µ g/ml, even at maximum doses.

Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin. Following administration of  a  dose  of  850  mg,  a  40  %  lower  plasma  peak  concentration,  a  25  %  decrease  in  AUC  and  a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration were observed. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.

Demonstration  of  bioequivalence  (BE)  of  the  sitagliptin/metformin  FDC  tablets  and  their  active components  given  as  individual  tablets  is  important  to  extrapolate  the  efficacy  and  safety  results obtained  with  the  sitagliptin  and  metformin  co-administration  studies  to  the  FDC  (no  phase  II/III studies  have  been  performed  using  the  FDC)  and  to  ensure  that  T2DM  patients  already  taking metformin (and sitagliptin) can be safely and effectively switched to the FDC tablets.

These BE studies are also of prime importance as the applicant did not submit a full PK dossier with all  required  studies  but  instead  referred  to  the  results  of  the  individual  dossiers  of  sitagliptin  and metformin.

The rationale for not submitting specific pharmacology/pharmacokinetic study reports with regard to the PK properties of the FDC tablet was that at the time of the submission, information regarding the PK  properties  was  known  for  the  individual  components.  Since,  no  drug  interaction  between sitagliptin and metformin was identified in study P012 and as also no clinically meaningful food-effect on either sitagliptin or metformin absorption was identified, no additional PK studies with the FDC tablets were considered necessary.

The  submitted  BE  studies  P038  (exploratory)  and  P048  (pivotal)  demonstrated  bioequivalence between the higher (50/1000 mg/mg) or lower (50/500 mg/mg) dose strengths of the FDC and the respective  dose  strengths  of  the  components  given  as  individual  tablets.  The  90%  CI  of  the corresponding treatment differences for the AUC0-∞ and  C max of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  were  all within the prespecified bounds of (0.80, 1.25).

Study  P048  presented  several  shortcomings,  making  it  impossible  to  claim  bioequivalence  for  the individual  components  and  therefore  impossible  to  refer  to  the  corresponding  dossier.  The  issues identified were:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1)  The reference product for metformin used in both P048 and P038 is a generic product from the American/Canadian market, while, according to the ' NfG on the investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence', it  should  have  been  an  innovator  product  from  the  European  market.  Only  the sitagliptin tablets used in study P048 are valid as reference product, therefore reference could be made to the sitagliptin dossier only. Consequently, the CHMP requested a new BE study using the European innovator  product  (Glucophage).  Since  metformin  has  a  non-linear  saturation  kinetics  and  the sensitivity to detect differences, if present, is higher for lower doses, such a study was requested at minimum for the dose strength containing 500 mg metformin.

2) The use of a bracketing strategy for the intermediate dose strength of 50/850 mg/mg which includes BE  studies  for  the  higher  (50/1000  mg/mg)  and  lower  (50/500  mg/mg)  dose  strengths  and demonstration  of  similar  dissolution  profiles  of  the  3  dose  strengths  of  the  FDC.  In  principle,  this strategy  is  acceptable.  However,  the  submitted  comparative  dissolution  studies  either  lacked  the intermediate dose strength or were not performed with biobatch. Therefore, in accordance with the ' NfG on the investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence', the CHMP requested a dissolution study  comparing  dissolution  profiles  of  the  biobatches  of  all  3  dose  strengths  under  the  same conditions.

Furthermore, CHMP requested the submission of dissolution tests comparing metformin release for each  dose  strength  of  the  FDC  with  the  respective  dose  strengths  of  the  EU  reference  product Glucophage.

In  response  to  these  comments  results  from  a  new  BE  study  (P095)  were  submitted,  together  with results from additional dissolution studies. The reference product for metformin was Glucophage as requested. The results of study P095 clearly demonstrate that with respect to metformin all strengths of Velmetia are bioequivalent with Glucophage. The half-lives and tmax values were also comparable.

The comparative dissolution testing with the bio-batches used in the BE study P095 showed that the two Velmetia biobatches (50/500 mg and 50/1000 mg) as well as Velmetia 50/850 mg batches release metformin considerably faster in the media pH 1.2 and pH 4.5 than the Glucophage originator batches; and at pH 6.8 the Velmetia batches release metformin slightly faster than the Glucophage originator batches.

Oral BA of metformin in humans is 50-60% of an administered dose and it is categorized as a BCS Class III compound, i.e. fast dissolution and low permeability. In other words, for BA of metformin the speed of dissolution from the tablet formulation is not the critical step in the process. Therefore it is  concluded  that  the  faster  dissolution  performance  of  metformin  from  Velmetia  in  comparison  to Glucophage, is not critical and not unfavourable for the bioavailability performance of the product.

## · Distribution

Following  100  mg  IV  dose,  the  steady  state  volume  of  distribution  (Vd)  was  estimated  to  be approximately 198 liters, indicating that sitagliptin distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding is low (38 % bound) thus the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions by plasma protein binding  displacement  is  low.  The  equilibrium  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio  of  sitagliptin  is 1.21.

Plasma protein binding in metformin is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most  likely  represent  a  secondary  compartment  of  distribution.  The  mean  Vd  ranged  between  63276 L.

## · Elimination

For sitagliptin metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination. Following a [14C]-labelled oral dose, approximately  16%  of  the  radiolabelled  sitagliptin  was  recovered  as  metabolites. In  vitro studies suggested  that  the  primary  enzymes  responsible  for  the  metabolism  were  CYP3A4  and,  to  a  lesser extent CYP2C8. Since the metabolites were present at low concentrations in plasma relative to parent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compound,  sitagliptin,  and  not  its  metabolites,  was  considered  mainly  responsible  for  DPP-4 inhibitory activity.

Plasma  clearance  following  a  100  mg  IV  dose  of  sitagliptin  was  417  ml/min.  Renal  clearance  and plasma elimination half-life were similar after IV and oral dosing. The apparent terminal plasma halflife is approximately 10-12 hours. Renal excretion of unchanged sitagliptin is the primary mechanism of elimination. In patients and subjects with normal renal function (CrCl &gt;80 mL/min), approximately 75 to 80 % of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine with a renal clearance of approximately 350 mL/min. Since renal clearance exceeds the typical glomerular filtration rate in humans, it appears to involve active tubular secretion mechanisms. The results of in vitro studies indicted that sitagliptin is a substrate for hOAT3 and Pgp, but not a substrate of human organic cation transporter-2 (hOCT2), or hOAT1. As cyclosporine A did not affect the renal elimination of sitagliptin, Pgp appears not to be involved  in  the  renal  excretion.  The  role  of  hOAT3  and/or  other  transporters  in  the  active  renal secretion is unknown.

Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans. Renal clearance of metformin is &gt; 400 ml/min, indicating that it is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5  hours.  When  renal  function  is  impaired,  renal  clearance  is  decreased  in  proportion  to  that  of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No specific studies were conducted with regard to dose proportionality and time dependency with the FDC  tablet.  As  BE  between  the  FDC  tablet  and  co-administration  of  corresponding  doses  of  the individual  doses  was  demonstrated,  no  drug  interaction  between  sitagliptin  and  metformin  was identified and no clinically meaningful food-effect of either sitagliptin and metformin was identified; no additional PK studies were considered necessary.

## · Special populations

As metformin and sitagliptin are both excreted by the kidney, Velmetia should be used with caution as age increases. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic  acidosis,  particularly  in  the  elderly.  Limited  safety  data  on  sitagliptin  is  available  in  patients &gt; 75 years of age and care should be exercised.

Velmetia  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine clearance

&lt; 60 ml/min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SPC).

Velmetia is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on its safety and efficacy in this population.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

PK interactions between metformin and sitagliptin were investigated in a placebo-controlled, 3-period, cross-over study (P012) in 13 patients with T2DM on stable monotherapy with metformin. Metformin had no effect on the PK of sitagliptin or vice versa .

In the original Januvia dossier an interaction study of sitagliptin with glyburide was included in which no  interactions  were  identified.  The  applicant  also  provided  a  comprehensive  overview  on  possible interactions of  SU  drugs. In view  of these data it can be concluded  that the use of the sitagliptin/metformin combination tablet within a triple combination therapy with a SU is possible.

Sitagliptin and metformin are mainly excreted by the kidney and do not interact in clinical significant way with CYP450 co-enzymes. Also, protein binding of these components of Velmetia is low, and therefore any displacement from proteins will not relevantly influence their pharmacokinetics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No  reports  of  studies  pertinent  to  PK  using  human  biomaterial  were  conducted  in  support  of  this marketing  application.  At  the  time  of  submission,  information  regarding  the  protein  binding  and effects on CYP enzymes and/or transporters was previously known for the individual components of the FDC tablet. Because BE between the FDC tablet and coadministration of corresponding doses of the individual tablets was demonstrated and no drug interaction between sitagliptin and metformin was identified, such data were considered applicable to the FDC.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics of sitagliptin was studied in 9 previous trials, including 252 healthy volunteers and 58  T2DM  patients.  In  these  studies  the  effects  of  sitagliptin  on  DPP-4  activity,  incretins,  glucose, insulin,  C-peptide  and  glucagon  levels  were  investigated.  These  trials  were  included  in  the  initial MAA of Januvia. The PD of metformin is well-known (see metformin section below). Therefore no additional  studies  investigating  PD  of  sitagliptin  or  metformin per  se are  required  for  the  present MAA. One new study (P050) investigating the effect of concomitant administration of sitagliptin and metformin on post-meal plasma incretin hormone concentrations has been submitted with this MAA.

## · Mechanism of action

Sitagliptin  is  a  DPP-4  inhibitor.  Although  several  actions  potentially  contribute  to  the  glucoselowering  effect  of  DPP-4  inhibitors,  the  most  likely  mechanism  is  through  elevated  incretin concentrations  that  lead  to  enhancement  of  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion  and  a  reduction  in glucagon  release.  Increases  in  incretin  concentrations  occur  because  DPP-4  inhibition  reduces  the cleavage and inactivation of the active (intact) form of the incretin hormones, including GLP-1 and GIP.

Metformin  improves  glycaemic  control  in  patients  with  T2DM  by  lowering  both  basal  and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. These effects result from: 1) a decrease in hepatic glucose production,  2)  a  decrease  in  intestinal  absorption  of  glucose  and,  3)  an  improvement  in  insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacology

Single dose PD for sitagliptin was investigated in a total of 90 healthy male volunteers, healthy elderly male and female subjects, young female subjects, obese males and 18 Japanese subjects. Single dose PD in patients with mild to moderate T2DM was also investigated, including 58 drug naïve. Multiple dose  PD  was  investigated  in  a  total  of  162  healthy  male  volunteers,  middle-aged,  obese  male  and female subjects, and 60 healthy young male Japanese subjects.

In both normoglycaemic healthy subjects and patients with T2DM, sitagliptin inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity in a dose and concentration-dependent manner. Race, gender and age did not have meaningful effects on the relationship between sitagliptin plasma concentrations and DPP-4 activity. Compared to placebo, sitagliptin increased post-meal (in healthy subjects and T2DM patients) active GLP-1 levels by approximately 2-3-fold. Active GIP levels were similarly increased following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in patients with T2DM. Sitagliptin did not increase total GLP-1 or GIP plasma levels.

GLP-1 has been demonstrated to slow gastric emptying; it was thought that this effect might also be seen with sitagliptin; this relationship has not been confirmed.

## Secondary pharmacology

In a study performed in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension on stable treatment with one or more antihypertensive agents sitagliptin compared to placebo showed small but statistically significant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or nearly significant decreases in mean 24-hour blood pressure between both 100 mg b.i.d. and 50 mg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

In a thorough QTc study, following a dose of 800 mg, QTc interval was slightly increased, but not to a clinically significant extent. However, considering the data separately by gender, a borderline effect was seen in females at the high dose (800mg) (mean value 5.85 msec with an upper limit of the 95% CI of 9.96 (~10 msec), which is the threshold according to ICH guideline E14). However, sitagliptin was shown to inhibit HERG current at concentrations (IC50 117 µ M, worst case scenario) that were far beyond therapeutic free plasma levels. The safety margin calculated from non-clinical studies was 38,  which  was  considered  sufficient,  even  if  women  were  slightly  more  sensitive  to  an  effect  of sitagliptin on QTc. No change in QTc interval was measured after a single dose of 100 mg.

The  potential  effectiveness  of  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  is  based  on  several considerations:  1)  recent  data  demonstrate  that  metformin  increases  GLP-1  concentrations-hence potentially increasing the efficacy of a medication that inhibits GLP-1 metabolism; 2) differences in the primary glucose-lowering effects, with metformin predominantly lowering fasting plasma glucose and  sitagliptin  lowering  both  postprandial  and  fasting  plasma  glucose  concentrations;  and  3)  the complementary  mechanisms  of  action,  with  metformin  enhancing  insulin  sensitivity  and  lowering hepatic  glucose  production  and  sitagliptin  enhancing  insulin  release.  Thus,  co-administration  of sitagliptin and metformin may be a useful option in managing patients with T2DM.

The  newly  submitted  study  P050  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  four-period crossover  study  in  18  healthy  adult  subjects.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  explore  the mechanisms of action of sitagliptin and metformin on the incretin axis. The effects of administration of  sitagliptin  alone,  metformin  alone,  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  or  placebo  on incremental changes in post-meal incretin hormones (active and total glucagon-like peptide [GLP-1] and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide  [GIP])  and  glucose  concentrations  were  also determined. The primary endpoint was the 4-hour post-meal (meal consumed at 2 hours postdose; at the  approximate  Tmax  for  sitagliptin  and  metformin)  weighted  average  active  GLP-1  concentrations after  concomitant  administration  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  compared  with  administration  of sitagliptin alone.

Compared with placebo, both sitagliptin alone and metformin alone increased the 4-hour incremental weighted  average  active  GLP-1  concentrations  by  approximately  80  to  95%  (1.8-  to  1.95-times) whereas the increase for the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was approximately 310% (4.1times).  Metformin,  but  not  sitagliptin,  increased  active  and  total  GLP-1  concentrations  to  similar extents.  Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. The reduction in the postmeal  incremental  glucose  AUC0-4hr  after  concomitant  administration  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin compared  with  administration  of  either  sitagliptin  alone  or  metformin  alone  was  similar  in  these healthy subjects.  It  is  unclear  how  these  findings  relate  to  changes  in  glycaemic  control  in  patients with type 2 diabetes.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response studies

Initial  data  supporting  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  emerged  from Phase II study P015 that showed sitagliptin provided improvement in 24-hour glucose concentration profiles in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy.

Dose selection for the sitagliptin component of Velmetia was based upon dose-range finding studies P010 and P014. Results of these studies  showed that  sitagliptin  provided improvements  in  glucose control, as reflected by reductions across glycaemic endpoints examined (including HbA1c, FPG, and fructosamine). Of the doses examined, 100 mg per day, either given as 100 mg q.d. or 50 mg b.i.d., provided  maximum  glucose-lowering  effect;  there  was  no  meaningful  difference  in  efficacy  with sitagliptin 100 mg administered as 100 mg once-daily or as 50 mg twice-daily.

When determining  the  doses  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin  to  be  included  in  the  FDC  development program,  the  registered  doses  of  metformin  and  the  common  prescribing  practices  for  metformin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(twice daily dosing), as well as the tolerability and efficacy of metformin, were considered. For the FDC  a  twice-daily  dosing  regimen  compatible  with  the  twice  daily  dosing  regimen  of  immediate release  metformin  has  been  developed.  The  choice  of  the  dose  and  dose  frequency  of  the  50/850 mg/mg and 50/1000 mg/mg are acceptable.

The lowest proposed strength, i.e. 50mg/500mg, however was not considered acceptable. The minimal metformin dose assessed in studies P020 and P024 was 1500 mg per day; the efficacy of metformin in reducing  T2DM  complications  was  demonstrated  in  UKPDS  34,  in  which  a  great  majority  of  the patients were treated with metformin doses &gt;1700 mg per day. Although there might be a minority of patients who cannot tolerate metformin at doses higher than 1000 mg, it is unlikely that the FDC tablet offers a meaningful benefit compared to the administration of the separate components. In addition, the  low  dose  FDC  tablet  could  promote  initial  combination  therapy  which  is  not  approved  and  not covered by current diabetes treatment guidelines. Therefore, the approval of the 50/500 mg tablet is not recommended. The Applicant has withdrawn this strength.

## · Main studies

As well as two new studies P035 and P036; studies P020 and P024, previously submitted in the MAA for Januvia, were resubmitted in support of the present application. These studies are presented as an abbreviated version.

The final study  reports  of  study  P035  and  study  P036,  presenting  the  complete  54-week  data  were submitted by the Applicant with their Day120 response document.

Study P020: A multicenter, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin therapy.

This combination study suggested that sitagliptin was more effective than placebo in reducing HbA1c at 24 weeks.

Study P024: A multicenter, double-blind, randomised, active controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of MK-0431 compared with sulfonylurea therapy in patients with Type 2 Diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy.

The  assessment  of  the  CHMP  concluded  that  sitagliptin  100  mg  per  day  as  add-on  therapy  to metformin was shown to have a significant and clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control but noninferior  efficacy  compared  to  sulfonylureas  was  not  unequivocally  proven.  However,  results  were sufficient to approve the add-on indication.

Study P035 : A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin as add-on therapy in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin

This study was also submitted in support of a Type II Variation to support the use of sitagliptin in dual combination with a sulfonylurea (SU) or in triple combination with a SU and metformin which was approved on the 19 December 2007.

Study P036: A randomised, double-blind, factorial, parallel-group study in T2DM patients to assess the efficacy and safety of an initial combination therapy with sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. and metformin 500 mg b.i.d. or 1000 mg b.i.d. compared to either agent alone when diet and exercise did not provide adequate glycaemic control.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

## Main inclusion criteria

Adult patients with T2DM either on previous or no previous antihyperglycaemic medication (AHA) and  pre-defined  HbA1c  values  at  screening  and  at  the  end  of  the  wash-out/run-in  period  (7-10%  in study  P020,  6.5-10%  in  study  P024,  7.5-10.5%  in  study  P035,  7.5-11%  in  study  P036)  indicating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insufficient glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy of at least 1500 mg per day (studies P020, P024) or on SU monotherapy or on combination therapy of SU and metformin (study P035) or on diet and exercise alone (study P036) were eligible. Upper age limit for participation was 78 y in studies P020, P024 P036 and 75 y in study P035.

## Main exclusion criteria

- -Patient required insulin within the prior 8 weeks
- -Patients with contraindications or not tolerating the run-in or co-medication (if applicable)
- -Moderate to severe renal insufficiency, active hepatic disease or cirrhosis, chronic myopathy, progressive  neurological  or  neuromuscular  disorder,  major  haematological  disease,  poorly controlled hypertension, NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within the past 6 months

## Treatments

In all studies, patients had to discontinue any previously used AHAs that were not allowed to be used during the study. During the subsequent dose titration/stable dose run-in phase the desired baseline medication  (metformin  in  studies  P020,  P024  and  glimepiride  [+/-  metformin]  in  study  P035)  was introduced  and  uptitrated.  The  final  dose  achieved  during  the  run-in  phase  (at  least  1500  mg metformin and 4-8 mg glimepiride) had to be maintained during the double-blind treatment period. However, glimepiride could be down-titrated if necessary because of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia.

Subsequently, patients meeting pre-defined HbA1c criteria entered a 2-week single blind placebo runin phase, and if ≥ 75% compliant with study medication, were subsequently randomized to one of the treatment groups.

Concurrent lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications were expected to remain on a stable regimen during the run-in phase and the double-blind treatment period.

## Rescue therapy

To ensure that patients did not have prolonged periods of inadequate glycaemic control, open-label, sponsor-supplied rescue therapy was implemented in patients meeting pre-specified criteria for HbA1c and/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in studies P020, P035 and P036.

Patients on rescue medication continued the double-blind study medication.

Discontinuation criteria (regarding glycaemic control)

- -Hypoglycaemia (repeated) without a reasonable explanation
- -Patient meets glycaemic rescue criteria but is not eligible for rescue therapy (if applicable).
- -Hyperglycaemia (persistent) as measured by FPG or HbA1c (predefined limits depending on study duration) and despite completion of uptitration of rescue medication (if applicable).

The following figure provides a description of P035 study design. The study had a 24-week doubleblind  placebo-controlled  phase  (Phase  A)  followed  by  a  30-week  active  comparator  (pioglitazone) phase (Phase B).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study Design (Phase A)

SB PBO: SINGLE BLIND PLACEBO

Study P036 had a 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase A, and an ongoing 30-week, active-controlled Phase B. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 6 treatment groups (see figure below).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Phase A Study Design

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the combination and active comparator studies were:

P020 : In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin at a dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day: (1) After 24 weeks, to assess the effect of the addition of treatment with sitagliptin  compared  with  the  addition  of  placebo  on  HbA1c;  (2)  To  assess  the  safety  and  the tolerability of sitagliptin.

P024 : In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin at  a  dose  of ≥ 1500  mg/day:  (1)  After  52  weeks,  to  assess  the  effect  of  the  addition  of  sitagliptin compared  with  the  addition  of  glipizide  on  HbA1c (2)  To  assess  the  safety  and  the  tolerability  of sitagliptin compared with glipizide.

P035 : In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on glimepiride at a dose of ≥ 4 mg/day, alone or in combination with metformin at a dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day: (1) After 24 weeks, to assess the effect of the addition of treatment with sitagliptin compared with the addition of placebo on HbA1c; (2) To assess the safety and the tolerability of sitagliptin.

P036 : In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise: Primary: After 24 weeks: (1) To assess the effect of co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin compared  with  the  effect  of  metformin  monotherapy  on  HbA1c;  (2)  To  assess  the  effect  of  coadministration of sitagliptin  and  metformin  compared with the effect of sitagliptin  monotherapy on HbA1c;  (3)  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  co-administration  of  sitagliptin  and  metformin,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sitagliptin monotherapy, and metformin monotherapy, including the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e., abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint in all Phase III studies was change from baseline in HbA1c (at Week 24 in P020, P035, and P036 and at Week 52 in P024). Key secondary endpoints included FPG and PMG (postmeal glucose).

Additional glycaemic efficacy endpoints included fasting measures of β -cell function (HOMAβ and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio),  measures of insulin  resistance (HOMA-IR and QUICKI), and endpoints assessed using 9- or 10-point frequently sampled meal tolerance tests (MTT), including model-based analysis and the insulinogenic index.

## Sample size

In the superiority trials (P020, P035 and P036) sample size was calculated to have clearly over 90% power to detect a true difference of 0.5% in the mean change from baseline in HbA1c between any sitagliptin group and placebo for a two-tailed test at α =0.05. In trial P024, the non-inferiority margin was set at 0.3%.

## Randomisation

Allocation numbers were randomly assigned (in a blinded manner) to the possible treatment groups.

## Blinding (masking)

Investigator  site  personnel  and  patients  were  blinded  to  the  patient  treatment  assignment  until  all patients  had  completed  the  study.  Applicant  research  personnel  remained  blinded  to  the  individual patient  treatment  assignment  until  the  initial  24-week  (P020,  P035,  and  P036)  and  52-week  (P024) portions of studies were completed, the in-house review of the patient-level data was finished, and the data file frozen for analysis.

## Statistical methods

An ANCOVA model with treatment, baseline HbA1c and prior AHA therapy as covariates was used to compare the treatment groups in the continuous efficacy parameters focusing on change from baseline at study endpoint. Due to the large number of study centers and the small numbers of patients at each center, study center was not included as a factor in the analysis model. However, as local influences were  deemed  a  concern,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  additional  analyses  regarding  the consistency of the treatment effect, taking in to account that if the number of patients per centre is too small for such an analysis, grouping per region could be an acceptable alternative.

Hierarchical testing procedures were used in studies P020, P035 and P036.

To avoid the confounding influence of rescue therapy on efficacy comparisons, the efficacy analyses treated  data  as  missing  after  the  initiation  of  rescue  therapy.    The  primary  approach  to  handling missing  data  was  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  method.  As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  a maximum likelihood approach  for  repeated  measurements  was  used  as  the  secondary  approach  for handling missing data. Where appropriate, a time-to-rescue analysis was performed using the KaplanMeier estimator and the log-rank test.

The primary analysis in the superiority trials (P020, P035 and P036) was the all-patient-treated (APT) analysis, which included patients with a baseline measurement, consumption of at least one dose of double-blind study medication and the presence of a post-randomization measurement. In addition, a completer analysis was performed for the primary endpoint HbA1c and, if applicable, for FPG. No per protocol (PP) analysis excluding patients with major protocol violations was planned.

The  primary  analysis  in  the  non-inferiority  trial  P024  was  the  per  protocol  (PP)  population,  the secondary analysis the APT population.

An analysis of the proportion of individuals meeting the HbA1c goal of &lt;7.0% or &lt;6.5% at end of study was conducted using a logistic regression model which included terms for baseline HbA1c, prior antihyperglycemic therapy status, and treatment group.

No interim analyses were performed in the phase 3 trials.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

In P020 a total of 1464 patients were screened and 701 were randomized. The most common reasons for  patients  not  being  randomized  were  failure  to  meet  HbA1c  inclusion  criteria  (43.4%)  and  an elevated creatinine or decreased creatinine clearance (12.7%).

In P024 a total of 2141 patients were screened and 969 patients were excluded during screening. The most common reason for patients not being randomised was for patient not meeting HbA1c inclusion criteria based at Visit 1 or Visit 3 (34.3%).

In  study P035 a  total  of  1098  patients  were  screened,  441  of  whom  were  randomized.  The  most common reason  for  patients  not  being  randomised  was  HbA1c  outside  inclusion  criteria  at  Visit  1 (39.8%)  or  at  Visit  3  (18.7%).  Of  note,  the  final  number  of  patients  randomized  into  the  study exceeded the protocol-specified target number of patients (n=360).

The  percentage  of  patients  completing  Phase  A  was  similar  in  the  sitagliptin  (83.3%)  and  placebo (81.7%)  groups.  However,  among  sitagliptin  treated  patients,  more  patients  on  glimepiride  and metformin  (stratum  2)  completed  Phase  A  (87.9  %)  compared  to  patients  on  glimepiride  alone (stratum 1; 78.3%).

Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was more frequent in the placebo than the sitagliptin group.

In P036 a  total  of  3544  patients  were  screened  and  1091  were  randomized.  Another  117  patients entered the open-label cohort. The most common reasons for patients being excluded from the study were failure to meet HbA1c inclusion criteria (52.6%) and an elevated serum creatinine or decreased creatinine clearance (10.3%).

The overall disposition of patients who entered the study through Week 24 is shown in the diagram below. Amongst the randomized patients, the overall discontinuation rate was highest in the placebo group (27.8%), followed by the sitagliptin monotherapy group (20.7%), and was lowest in the 'high dose' combination sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. / metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. group (10%).

The discontinuation rate due to lack of efficacy was highest in the placebo group (6.8%), followed by the  metformin  500  mg  b.i.d.  group  (2.7%)  and  was  lowest  in  the  'high  dose'  and  'low  dose' combination therapy groups (1.1 and 1.05%, respectively).

Recruitment

The periods of recruitment for the phase 3 pivotal trials were the following:

- o P020 13-Jul-2004 through 20-Jul-2005
- o P024 26-Oct-2004 to 14-May-2005
- o P035 27-Apr-2005 through 9-Jan-2007
- o P036 01-Apr-2005 to 01-Mar-2007

## Conduct of the study

There were no study amendments in P020, P024, P035 or P036 that would likely affect the results of the study.

## Baseline data

Baseline characteristics in study P020 and P024 were generally balanced across the treatment groups.

In Study P035 , baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups in the entire cohort, and also in each stratum. However, patients in stratum 2 (on dual combination therapy with  glimepiride  and  metformin)  had  slightly  lower  baseline  HbA1c  values,  a  longer  duration  of T2DM, and were more likely to be on combination therapy at screening compared with patients in stratum  1  (on  glimepiride  monotherapy).  The  proportion  of  patients  on  previous  AHA  therapy  was very similar among sitagliptin and placebo-treated patients.

In Study  P036 the Randomized  Cohort ,  mean  age  (range)  was  53.5  y  (20-78),  BMI  32.1  kg/m 2 (18.0-59.7),  HbA1c  8.8%  (6.3-11.9),    FPG  200  mg/dL  (95-373),  and  mean  duration  of  diabetes  4.5 years (0-35); 49.4% of patients were male, 51.7% were White and 27.2% Hispanic. 49.6% of patients were taking AHAs at screening. With the exceptions of a slight difference in the proportion of male

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  (lowest  42.3%,  highest  55.3%)  there  were  no  relevant  baseline  differences  between treatment groups.

Compared to patients in the Randomized Cohort, patients in the Open-label Cohort exhibited generally  poorer  baseline  glycaemic  control  (mean  HbA1c  11.2%),  a  longer  mean  duration  of T2DM (6.1 y), and were more likely to be taking  AHAs at screening  (62.4%)  and  also  had a larger proportion of Hispanics (46.2%) and a lower proportion of Whites (37.6%).

## Numbers analysed

For study P035, in all treatment groups, at least 95% of patients were included in the primary APT analysis. The number of patients included in the secondary completers' analysis was markedly lower, being lowest in the placebo group (65.8%), largely due to the requirement for rescue therapy. Compliance rate was similar between the sitagliptin and placebo groups (98.5% vs. 98.6%). Only a small number of randomized patients (approx. 1.5%) were assessed as having potentially important protocol violations, which was considered unlikely to meaningfully alter the study's conclusion.

For study P036, in all treatment groups, more than 96% of patients were included in the primary APT analysis. The number of patients included in the secondary completers' analysis was markedly lower, being lowest in the placebo group (50.6%) and in the sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. group (63.1%), being largely  due  to  the  requirement  for  rescue  therapy.  Compliance  with  study  drug  was  &gt; 97%  in  all treatment  groups.  Only  23  of  the  randomized  patients  (2.1%)  were  assessed  as  having  potentially important  protocol  violations,  which  was  considered  unlikely  to  meaningfully  alter  the  study's conclusion. One patient was prematurely unblinded due to a SAE (ketoacidosis).

## Outcomes and estimation

The main study results (Phase A) for study P020 were the following:

## Glycaemic control

The addition of 100 mg q.d. sitagliptin to metformin was superior to placebo in lowering HbA1c (see table  below).  The  completers  analysis  confirmed  this  conclusion,  although  the  placebo  adjusted treatment effect was  smaller, which  was  explained by the removal  of a larger number  of rescued/discontinued patients (with a poorer HbA1c) from the placebo group than the sitagliptin group.

The results of the primary endpoint were supported by secondary glycaemic parameters such as FPG, proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7% or &lt;6.5%, glucose-lowering effect after administration of a standard meal challenge or proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy. Initiation of rescue therapy was substantially later in the sitagliptin treatment group compared to the placebo group.

In this study sitagliptin add-on at a dose of 100 mg q.d. provided statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in glycaemic control compared to placebo add-on in patients with T2DM not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sufficiently controlled on metformin alone. This superiority was reflected in all glycaemic parameters evaluated. The study was powered to detect a true between-group difference of 0.5% in HbA1c.

The main study results for study P024 were the following:

## Glycaemic control

The addition of 100 mg q.d. sitagliptin was non-inferior to glipizide in lowering HbA1c at the end of the 52-week treatment period (see table below). The APT analysis showed similar results.

The results of the primary endpoint were supported by secondary glycaemic parameters such as FPG, proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7%  or &lt;6.5% and glucose-lowering effect after administration of a standard meal challenge.

In this study more patients in the sitagliptin arm discontinued due to lack of efficacy as compared to glipizide  treated  patients  (86  [15%]  vs  58  [10%]).  Sitagliptin  patients  discontinued  primarily  at  the beginning of the study, while glipizide patients discontinued at the end. If the glipizide dose could have been increased beyond the initial titration phase, better results might have been obtained with glipizide.  There  was  a  difference  between  the  APT  and  PP  results,  but  the  difference  was  not substantial,  as  would  have  been  expected  if  early  discontinuing  patients  were  to  be  meaningfully impact the study results.

Similar  results  were  obtained  for  FPG  data.  Proportions  of  patients  reaching  target  HbA1c were consistent with HbA1c data.

At Week 52, a modest, statistically significant (p&lt;0.001), decrease from baseline in body weight of 1.5 kg  was  observed  in  the  sitagliptin  treatment  group,  while  the  glipizide  treatment  group  had  a modest, statistically significant (p&lt;0.001), increase of 1.1 kg from baseline in body weight, resulting in a significant between-group difference of -2.5 kg (p&lt;0.001).

Although the Applicant claimed non-inferiority, the CHMP concluded that sitagliptin 100 mg per day as  add-on  therapy  to  metformin  was  shown  to  have  a  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  on glycaemic control but non-inferior efficacy compared to SU was not unequivocally proven. However, results were sufficient to approve the add-on indication.

In study P035 a significant reduction in HbA1c was obtained in patients when sitagliptin was added to glimepiride  and  metformin,  while  the  addition  of  placebo  had  no  effect.  After 24  weeks the  mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

change from baseline was -0.59% (95% CI -0.74, -0.44) for sitagliptin versus +0.30% (95% CI 0.14, 0.45)  for  placebo.  The  mean  between  group  difference  was  -0.89%  (-1.10,  -0.68)  in  favour  of sitagliptin. In the sitagliptin group, a nadir in HbA1c reduction from baseline was observed at Week 12, with a rise observed from Week 12 to Week 24; a similar rise was observed in the placebo group.

In  this  study,  a  total  of  160  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  group  and  122  patients  in  the  placebo  group, respectively, had completed Phase A and continued in Phase B. A similar proportion of these patients, i.e. 57% and 56% in the sitagliptin and pioglitazone group, respectively, completed Phase B. Overall; the most common reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy. Due to the study design (switching patients from placebo to pioglitazone but maintaining patients on sitagliptin on unchanged medication) and the small remaining sample size, possible conclusions from this follow-up study are very limited.

The  results  show  that,  after  54  weeks,  sitagliptin  continued  to  provide  limited  but  clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c in the entire study population, when added to ongoing therapy with glimepiride alone (Stratum 1) or glimepiride and metformin (Stratum 2).

In  study P036 co-administration  treatment  resulted  in  larger  decreases  in  HbA1c  than  sitagliptin monotherapy  and  metformin  monotherapy  (see  table  below,  analysis  of  change  from  baseline  in HbA1c(%)  at  W eek  24 all-patients-treated  population).  The  Applicant  does  not  claim  a  first-line

treatment.  This  study  does  not  demonstrate  that  starting  with  combination  treatment  is  superior  to sequential treatment.

Results of patients reaching their goal HbA1c, data on FPG and other secondary parameters were in line with HbA1c results.

In  this  study,  only  1  to  6  patients  of  each  randomised  group  completed  Phase  A  and  did  not  enter Phase B. Among patients treated with active drug in both treatment phases (A and B), the proportion of patients completing both phases was highest in the co-administration groups (77-78%), followed by the metformin 1000 mg BID group (75%) and was lowest in the sitagliptin 100 mg QD (68%) and metformin 500 mg BID (69%) groups. In line with this finding, discontinuation due to lack of efficacy occurred more often in the latter monotherapy groups than in the high-dose metformin monotherapy or the co-administration groups.

The main 54-week efficacy results of study P036 are presented in the table below.

HbA1c and FPG reductions from baseline at week 54 were significantly and clinically relevantly higher in the co-administration groups compared to the respective monotherapy groups confirming the benefit of  adding  sitagliptin  to  a  metformin  regimen  in  terms  of  glycaemic  control.  Small  and  similar increases in HbA1c  after Week  30  were  observed  for  all treatment groups  (except for the placebo/metformin group). Maintenance of the FPG effect was observed for the co-administration and metformin  monotherapy  groups,  with  the  FPG  profile  remaining  relatively  flat  during  Phase  B  for these groups, whereas the sitagliptin monotherapy group showed a slight but continuous increase in FPG after week 18. Numerically, HbA1c and FPG reductions from baseline at week 54 were lowest in the sitagliptin  monotherapy  group.  In  the  secondary completers  analysis,  however,  HbA1c  reduction was  slightly  higher  in  the  sitagliptin  100  mg  (-1.4%)  than  the  metformin  500  mg  BID  (-1.2%) monotherapy  group.  Overall,  given  as  monotherapy,  sitagliptin  100  mg  QD  appears  to  have  a antihyperglycaemic potency similar to that of metformin 500 mg BID. The Applicant has not applied for monotherapy use of sitagliptin.

Taken together, the previously submitted studies P015, P020 and P024 as well as the new studies P035 and P036 support the already approved use of sitagliptin in combination with metformin. The newly submitted 54-week  results on studies P036  and P036  show  a continued clinically relevant improvement of glycaemic control when sitagliptin is added to a SU agent and/or metformin.

Additional analyses, requested by the CHMP, revealed that in both studies P035 and P036 there is strong  indication  that  the  effects  in  Europe  are  systematically  smaller  than  in  other  regions  of  the world.  However,  the  Applicant  has  made  it  plausible  that  these  differences  are  due  to  a  spuriously large estimate for one treatment group (sitagliptin 100mg), which affected all comparisons involving that group. This is considered acceptable.

Data on another DPP-4 inhibitor suggest that, when given in combination with a SU, a daily dose of 100 mg is no more effective than a 50 mg dose.  The Applicant was requested to discuss whether the same is true for sitagliptin. The Applicant does not expect that the dose-response will be meaningfully different when sitagliptin is added to SU. Although both SU agents and sitagliptin raise insulin levels,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  mechanisms  by  which  this  occurs  are  distinct.    This  answer  is  not  completely  satisfying,  as  a different mechanism of action does not necessarily mean that the effects are additive. Nevertheless, tolerability of the 100 mg dose is good, and therefore this dose is acceptable.

## Ancillary analyses

In study P035 a notable difference was observed between the two strata in HbA1c -lowering effect by baseline HbA1c category. In stratum 2, stepwise and greater placebo-subtracted HbA1c lowering was observed from lower to higher baseline HbA1c categories: -0.55% in patients with baseline HbA1c of &lt; 8% to -1.34% in  patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9%. In contrast, in stratum 1 no discernable trend in placebo-subtracted HbA1c -lowering was observed with higher baseline HbA1c categories.

For  treatment  effects  on  HbA1c  by  other  baseline  characteristics,  the  responses  were  generally consistent across subgroups in the entire cohort and in the two strata, although in stratum 2, there were few patients who were treatment naive or who were on AHA monotherapy.

In  general,  in  study  P036,  the  treatment  effects  were  consistent  and  demonstrated  effective  HbA 1c lowering for the co-administration and monotherapy treatments in all subgroups defined by baseline demographic  and  anthropometric  factors,  and  disease  history.  The  treatment  effect  was  generally higher in patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels compared to those with lower HbA1c levels. On the other hand, the HbA1c -lowering effects of the co-administration regimens were higher than those of the single components for both HbA1c subgroups.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No clinical studies were performed in special populations.

## Clinical safety

The  safety  assessment  during  the  initial  MAA  of  sitagliptin  led  to  the  conclusion  that  sitagliptin treatment  is  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  in  infections  and  infestations,  gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and nervous system AEs and that event rate was increased for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. These AEs had been included in the SPC, and in the RMP of sitagliptin.

The  second  component  of  Velmetia,  metformin,  has  a  well-established  safety  profile  that  includes several common events (primarily gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea or diarrhoea) and a rare event (lactic acidosis) occurring in predisposed patients (particularly those with renal insufficiency).

The previously submitted safety data on the sitagliptin/metformin combination therapy showed that, compared to metformin monotherapy, the combination therapy was associated with an increase in the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) somnolence, nausea, upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, blood glucose decreased, anorexia and weight decreased.

Since there is no meaningful PK interaction between sitagliptin and metformin, as seen in Study P012, the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  co-administered  metformin  and  sitagliptin  is  expected  to  be similar to those of the individual agents.

## · Patient exposure

Overall,  1685  patients  were  exposed  to  sitagliptin  and  metformin  in  Phase  II  and  Phase III combination studies, of which 116 received metformin plus glimepiride.

The  'safety  summary'  for  this  MAA  contains  the  previously  submitted  studies  (P015,  P020,  and P024) and the new studies P035 and P036, and an additional study (P053) which was completed after submission of the original marketing application. The tabulated safety summary includes the following categories:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- metformin + sitagliptin,
- metformin + SU + sitagliptin,
- metformin + placebo,
- metformin + SU (with or without additional placebo).

The Applicant has also provided other updated safety comparisons:

- Comparison I: metformin plus sitagliptin-exposed vs. metformin plus sitagliptin non-exposed patients
- Comparison  II:  metformin  plus  sitagliptin  vs.  metformin  plus  placebo  (add-on  and  initial therapy) - a subpopulation of comparison I only including studies with parallel 'metformin + sitagliptin' and 'metformin + placebo' treatment arms.

The treatment groups compared within Comparisons I and II were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, duration of diabetes, secondary diagnoses, baseline HbA1c and duration of exposure. For the  tabulated  safety  summary  no  major  differences  were  present  with  regard  to  mean  age,  gender distribution  and  BMI.  However,  mean  baseline  HbA1c  and  FPG  were  highest  in  the  metformin  + placebo group (8.6% and 190 mg/dL, respectively) and lowest in the metformin + SU group (7.7% and 165 mg/dL, respectively). Based on the data (number of patients and patient years), the mean duration of  exposure  was  calculated  at  0.84  y,  0.61  y,  0.85  y  and  0.77  y  for  the  4  groups  (metformin  + sitagliptin,  metformin  +  placebo,  metformin  +  SU  +  sitagliptin,  metformin  +  SU),  respectively.  As expected, mean duration of diabetes was highest in the triple combination group (9.3 y) and lowest in the  metformin  +  placebo  group  (5.6  y).  Because  of  imbalances  in  baseline  characteristics  between treatment  groups,  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  However,  possible  conclusions  from Comparison I are also limited due to the fact that  populations with very different treatment regimens are compared (patients on dual or triple combination therapy with metformin + sitagliptin (+ SU) are compared  to  patients  on  either  metformin  monotherapy  or  dual  or  triple  combination  therapy  of metformin + SU (+pioglitazone).

- Adverse events

The results from Comparison I (metformin plus sitagliptin-exposed vs. metformin plus sitagliptin nonexposed  patients)  suggest  that  the  combination  therapy  metformin  +  sitagliptin  has  an  acceptable safety profile compared to other antidiabetic drug regimens including metformin but not sitagliptin. The  safety  assessment  during  the  initial  MAA  of  sitagliptin  led  to  the  conclusion  that  sitagliptin treatment is associated with an increased incidence in:

- infections and infestations (including nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections)
- gastrointestinal disorders (including nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and flatulence)

and may be associated with:

- musculoskeletal disorders (including myalgia, myopathy and muscle weakness)
- skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (including urticaria).
- neurotoxicity and

These AEs had been included in the SPC and/or in the RMP of sitagliptin. The new safety summary (Comparison I) does not suggest such increased risks, which is reassuring, but it should be kept in mind that the populations and their antidiabetic regimens are different in the current analysis (focus on metformin  +  sitagliptin  combination  therapy  in  comparison  to  other  treatment  options)  than  in  the previous analysis. The observed slight decrease in haemoglobin (Hb) during sitagliptin treatment has been identified previously but is not considered clinically relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  results  from Comparison  II  suggest  a  favourable  safety  profile  of  the  combination  therapy metformin + sitagliptin. The  previously  submitted  safety  data  on  sitagliptin/metformin  combination therapy showed that, compared to metformin monotherapy, the combination therapy was associated with an increase in the adverse drug reactions:

- somnolence
- upper abdominal pain
- nausea
- blood glucose decreased
- diarrhoea
- anorexia and weight decreased.

However,  according  to  the  newly  submitted  updated  safety  summary,  such  associations  cannot  be confirmed;  particularly  hypoglycaemia  and  GI  AEs  appear  not  to  be  increased  when  sitagliptin  is added  to  metformin.  The  observed  slight  decrease  in  Hb  during  sitagliptin  treatment  has  been identified  previously  but  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Whether  the  observed  differences  in discontinuation  due  to  pre-defined  kidney  criteria  are  due  to  differences  in  adherence  to  these discontinuation criteria cannot be clarified. The effect of sitagliptin on the remaining kidney function was  previously  assessed  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  renal  failure  (P028).  From previously submitted studies there is no indication that sitagliptin has a deleterious effect on kidney function.  Events  in  the  SOC  'skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders'  occurred  at  an  increased frequency when sitagliptin was added to metformin. Because skin lesions have been identified as a potential safety concern, monitoring of such events are already included in the risk management plan.

The  results  from  the  tabulated  safety  summary  suggest  an  acceptable  safety  profile  for  the  triple combination therapy of metformin + SU + sitagliptin compared to the dual combination metformin + SU.  The  only  trial  (P035)  that  has  directly  compared  these  treatment  regimens  found  small  but significantly increased incidences in the AEs of:

- gastroenteritis
- arthralgia
- pneumonia
- osteoarthritis
- pain in extremity
- headache and
- dizziness
- hypoaesthesia

and a markedly increased incidence (16.4 vs. 0.9%) in hypoglycaemia with the triple combination. In the new comparison, which is acknowledged to have relevant limitations, some AEs such as infections and  headache  are  also  found  at  an  increased  rate.  On  the  other  hand,  hypoglycaemia  occurred  at  a lower  rate  which  clearly  contrasts  previous  findings.  This  difference  may  be  explained  by  the relevantly lower baseline HbA1c in the dual therapy vs. the triple therapy group in the tabulated safety summary.

The  dual  combination  therapy  with  metformin  +  sitagliptin  was  associated  with  a  markedly  lower frequency  of  hypoglycaemia  than  the  combination  metformin  +  SU.  This  is  not  unexpected  since sitagliptin  itself  does  not  lead  to  hypoglycaemia.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the,  on  average, lower baseline HbA1c levels in patients on metformin + SU may have added to the large difference in hypoglycaemia rates. Overall, this tabulated safety summary does not elicit new safety concerns.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In  addition to the above comparisons, the new safety summary also presents an update on reported deaths that occurred until the cut-off date of 30-September-2007. Until then, a total of 26 deaths (2 reported  prior  to  randomization)  had  been  reported  in  studies  of  sitagliptin  in  combination  with metformin. Of the 24 post-randomization deaths, 9 occurred in the sitagliptin group and 15 in a nonsitagliptin group. Causes of death reported for more than 1 patient included:

- carcinomas (3 on glipizide, 1 on metformin)
- sudden cardiac death (1 on glipizide, 1 on placebo)
- myocardial infarctions (3 on glipizide)
- accidental death (3 on sitagliptin, bicycle accident, fall/drowning and electrocution while mowing lawn)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- suicide (1 on pioglitazone, 1 on glipizide).

No death was considered by the investigator to be drug-related.

The observation that the hypoglycaemia rate is increased when sitagliptin is added to a SU agent was addressed  by  the  Applicant.  It  is  accepted  that  a  similar  observation  of  increased  hypoglycaemia incidence  is  made  when  other  AHA  agents  that  themselves  are  not  associated  with  hypoglycaemia (e.g.,  metformin  or  PPAR γ agents)  are  used  in  combination  with  a  SU  agent.    In  addition,  this increased hypoglycaemia incidence and rate may partly be due to the improved glycaemic control in sitagliptin compared to placebo treated patients. Most events were mild, i.e. did not require medical or non-medical  assistance  and  no  hypoglycaemic  event  of  marked  severity,  as  defined  in  the  studies, occurred which is reassuring. The increased incidence of hypoglycaemia is adequately addressed in section 4.8 of the proposed SPC.

There was a concern that the limited efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with glimepiride could be due to the combination-induced hypoglycaemia that led to a reduction in the SU dose and thus to a decrease in efficacy. In other words, the combination may not have reached/sustained its full potency due  to  dose-limiting  side  effects.  The  Applicant  answered  that  down-titration  occurred  in  only approximately 2% of patients, and ranged from day 14 to day 99. Thus, down-titration of glimepiride due to hypoglycaemia was not commonly required. This is consistent with the observation that the hypoglycaemia events in the sitagliptin group were generally neither recurrent nor severe. Hypoglycaemia  with  concomitant  SU  use  will  be  further  evaluated  in  a  3-4  year  clinical  trial committed to during the initial MA procedure of sitagliptin.

In  agreement  with  previous  findings  from  the  sitagliptin  development  program,  there  was  no discernable increase in the incidence of death or overall or specific non-fatal SAEs when sitagliptin was added to metformin or to a dual combination therapy of metformin and a SU agent. In addition, the overall rates of discontinuation due to clinical or laboratory AEs were low and similar between sitagliptin  and  placebo  or  SU  treated  patients.  There  were  no  clear  treatment  differences  for discontinuations  due  to  specific  AEs  except  for  hypoglycaemia,  which  occurred  only  in  glipizidetreated patients in Study P024.

## · Laboratory findings

Laboratory data from the new studies P035 and P036 are also in line with findings from previously submitted sitagliptin/metformin combination studies.

Taken together, sitagliptin/ metformin dual combination therapy compared to metformin monotherapy was associated with small increases in uric acid and white blood cell count, WBC (ANC), and with small decreases in AP and possibly in ALT, AST, Hb and bilirubin.

Sitagliptin/metformin/SU  triple  combination  therapy  compared  to  metformin/SU  dual  combination therapy (P035) was associated with small increases in WBC (ANC) but not uric acid, and with small decreases in ALT, AST, AP and Hb.

Of note, neither of these changes is considered clinically relevant. In addition, there are indications that  the  observed  changes  in  these  parameters  may  be  largely  due  to  the  glycaemic  effects  of antihyperglycaemic medications rather than a direct effect of the study drugs.

At the therapeutic dose of 100 mg per day, sitagliptin either alone or in combination with metformin does not appear to have a relevant effect on blood pressure or the conduction system of the heart.

## · Safety in special populations

No subgroup analyses of safety were performed for patients taking the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.  However, subgroup analyses by age, gender and race for the previously submitted overall Pooled Phase II/III Studies were presented. No clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of specific AEs by age, gender or race were observed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Metformin is contraindicated and sitagliptin is currently not recommended in patients with moderate to  severe  renal  failure.  Metformin  but  not  sitagliptin  is  licensed  for  use  in  paediatric  patients  with T2DM. Therefore, no data can be expected for the fixed combination sitagliptin/metformin in these populations.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall, the rates of discontinuation due to a clinical or laboratory AE were low and similar between sitagliptin and placebo or SU treated patients. There were few AEs that led to discontinuation in more than  one  patient,  i.e.  gastrointestinal  AEs,  hypoglycaemia,  urticaria,  increased  blood  creatinine,  or decreased creatinine clearance.  There were no clear treatment differences for discontinuations due to specific AEs except for hypoglycaemia: all 6 cases occurred in a glipizide group.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The pharmacology of sitagliptin  and  metformin  has  been investigated  for  each  drug  separately.  No primary or secondary pharmacology studies of the combination were conducted, which was found to be  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  Specific  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  not  performed  either, however,  ECG  recording  were  performed  during  the  repeated-dose  toxicology  studies  of  the combination,  not revealing  any  treatment-related  effects.  Overall,  the  general  pharmacology  studies corroborate  the  information  previously  available  for  the  individual  components  and  support  the combined use.

From  the  pharmacokinetic  standpoint,  specific  studies  on  the  combination  were  not  performed. Interaction studies for the triple combination with a sulphonylurea were not considered necessary as clinically no relevant concerns were  discovered  regarding the safety of the combination  of sitagliptin/metformin with glimepiride.

The combination studies with sitagliptin and metformin in dogs indicated no evidence of toxicokinetic or toxicologic interactions. No non-clinical studies were performed for the combination of sitagliptin / metformin  with  a  sulphonylurea,  however,  sitagliptin,  metformin  and  sulphonylurea  have  different toxicity  profiles,  and  therefore  interactions  do  not  seem  likely.  Furthermore,  clinically,  no  relevant concerns  were  discovered  regarding  the  safety  of  the  combination  of  sitagliptin/metformin  with glimepiride.

## Efficacy

Demonstration  of  bioequivalence  (BE)  of  the  sitagliptin/metformin  FDC  tablets  and  its  active components  given  as  individual  tablets  is  important  to  extrapolate  the  efficacy  and  safety  results obtained  with  the  sitagliptin  and  metformin  co-administration  studies  to  the  FDC  (no  phase  II/II studies  have  been  performed  using  the  FDC)  and  to  ensure  that  T2DM  patients  already  taking metformin (and sitagliptin) can be safely and effectively switched to the FDC tablets.

Demonstration of BE is also of prime importance as the applicant did not submit a full PK dossier with all  required  studies  but  instead  referred  to  the  results  of  the  individual  dossiers  of  sitagliptin  and metformin.

The  Applicant  submitted  two  BE  studies,  particularly  study  P048  and  study  P095.  Study  P095 established  bioequivalence  between  the  sitagliptin  component  of  Velmetia  and  sitagliptin  given  as individual  tablet.  Bioequivalence  study  P095,  performed  with  the  European  reference  product Glucophage  for  metformin  was  submitted  later  upon  CHMP  request  together  with  additional dissolution  studies.  The  results  of  this  study  clearly  demonstrate  that  with  respect  to  metformin  all strengths  of  Velmetia  are  bioequivalent  with  Glucophage.  The  half-lives  and  t max values  were  also comparable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The previously submitted studies P020 and P024 as well as the new studies P035 and P036 support the already  approved  uses  of  sitagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  and  triple  combination  of sitagliptin + metformin + SU.

The  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of  sitagliptin  added  to  the  regimen  of  patients  with inadequate  glycaemic  control  on  metformin  monotherapy  (as  observed  in  P020  and  P024)  was numerically  smaller  than  the  effect  of  sitagliptin  on  glycaemic  control  in  patients  insufficiently controlled on the combination of SU and metformin (P035).  This effect was also numerically larger than  that  observed  with  the  addition  of  sitagliptin  in  patients  insufficiently  controlled  on  SU monotherapy. The combination therapy of sitagliptin with a SU is already approved, hence, the triple therapy  of  sitagliptin,  metformin  and  a  SU,  applied  for  in  the  current  application  for  the  FDC,  is considered acceptable based on the presented efficacy data.

Although the current dose recommendation for sitagliptin is 100 mg taken as a single daily dose (QD), the  previous  study  P014  (submitted  with  the  initial  MAA  for  sitagliptin)  showed  that  efficacy  and safety of a daily dose of 100 mg is similar when given either as a single dose or divided into two daily doses. Therefore, the content of 50 mg sitagliptin in the proposed FDC tablets resulting in a 50 mg twice daily (BID) dosing is acceptable.

The  lowest  proposed  strength,  i.e.  50mg/500mg,  was  not  considered  acceptable.  The  minimal metformin dose assessed in studies P020 and P024 was 1500 mg per day; the efficacy of metformin in reducing  T2DM  complications  was  demonstrated  in  UKPDS  34,  in  which  a  great  majority  of  the patients were treated with metformin doses &gt;1700 mg per day. Although there might be a minority of patients who cannot tolerate metformin at doses higher than 1000 mg, it is unlikely that the FDC tablet offers a meaningful benefit compared to the administration of the separate components. In addition, the  low  dose  FDC  tablet  could  promote  initial  combination  therapy  which  is  not  approved  and  not covered by current diabetes treatment guidelines. Therefore, the approval of the 50/500 mg tablet is not recommended and the Applicant has withdrawn the application for this strength.

## Safety

Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that,  based  on  the  submitted  data,  sitagliptin  in  combination  with metformin and/or SU agent has an acceptable safety profile. Based on previous safety assessment it was concluded that sitagliptin treatment is associated with an increased incidence in infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and nervous system AEs. Event rate was increased for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. These AEs have been included in the SPC and the RMP.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

The results from the readability testing were submitted at the time of the response package at Day 121. The test included sufficient questions about the critical sections and the results were satisfactory, i.e. 90% of the participants were able to find the information and of those 90% were able to adequately express the information in their own words.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The submitted Phase II/III studies, the previously submitted studies P015, P020 and P024 as well as the new studies P035 and P036, support the use of sitagliptin in combination with metformin, either as dual  combination  therapy  or  as  triple  combination  therapy  with  a  sulfonylurea  agent  (both  already approved for sitagliptin). The results also suggest that the glucose-lowering potential of sitagliptin per se is lower than that of high-dose metformin but nevertheless clinically moderate and relevant.

Given the observation that the efficacy of sitagliptin appears optimal in combination with metformin, the lack  of relevant  PK interactions of these two drugs,  and  the fact that combination  therapy  with metformin  (add-on  to  metformin)  is  already  approved,  the  development  of  a  FDC  combination  is acceptable. The FDC tablets may improve compliance due to the reduced daily tablet load in patients with T2DM usually taking a variety of medicinal products.

Although the current dose recommendation for sitagliptin is 100 mg taken as a single daily dose, the previous study P014 (submitted with the initial MAA for sitagliptin) showed that efficacy and safety of a daily dose of 100 mg is similar when given either as a single dose or divided into two daily doses. Therefore, the content of 50 mg sitagliptin in the proposed FDC tablets resulting in a 50 mg twice daily dosing is acceptable.

Metformin  causes  GI  side  effects  such  as  nausea,  diarrhoea  and  abdominal  pain  in  a  substantial number  of  patients.  Consequently,  the  tolerated  maximum  daily  dose  varies  among  patients. Therefore, the proposed dose strengths of Velmetia including 50/850 (mg/mg) and 50/1000 (mg/mg) of sitagliptin/metformin, respectively, are reasonable and acceptable.

The  results  of  the  pivotal  bioequivalence  studies  (P048  and  P095)  clearly  demonstrate  that,  with respect to the sitagliptin and metformin component, all three strengths of Velmetia are bioequivalent with Januvia and Glucophage, respectively.

## Risks

When  combining  sitagliptin  with  metformin  and/or  SU,  the  only  remarkable  issue  was  that  the incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased compared to placebo when sitagliptin was added to a SU. No such increase was seen with the combination of sitagliptin with metformin. However, none of the hypoglycaemia episodes met criteria for marked severity or required medical attention, and no patients were  discontinued  due  to  hypoglycaemia.  The  updated  safety  summaries  do  not  elicit  new  safety concerns.

## Balance

The overall risk benefit ratio of Velmetia 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000mg is considered positive. The proposed indications are considered acceptable.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Velmetia in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated  dose  of  metformin  alone  or  those  already  being  treated  with  the  combination  of sitagliptin and metformin; or in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin  and  a  sulphonylurea,  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the marketing authorisation.
