## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, PTC Therapeutics International Limited  submitted  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  on  29  September  2023  an  application  for  a variation.

| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II                 | I and IIIB              |

In 2016 the conditional marketing authorisation was renewed with the obligation to perform a second efficacy study, i.e., study PTC124-GD-041-DMD (study 041). In 2018 the indication was extended to include  nmDMD  patients  aged  2-5  years  of  age.  In  2019  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  nonambulatory  patients  was  rejected.  Data  of  the  SOB  study  041  was  assessed  as  part  of  variation EMEA/H/C/002720/II/0069. Further results were assessed during the annual renewal EMEA/H/C/002720/R/071  in  which  a  re-assessment  of  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Translarna  was performed,  taking  into  account  the  totality  of  the  data.  Negative  opinions  were  concluded  for  both variation II/069 and annual renewal R/071 in September 2023. Following the re-examination of the annual renewal R/071 requested by the MAH, the CHMP recommended in January 2024 to not renew the conditional marketing authorisation for Translarna.

The following changes were proposed: I and IIIB Update  of  sections  4.2,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  change  posology  information  in paediatric  population,  to  update  the  summary  of  safety  profile  and  to  update  efficacy,  safety  and pharmacokinetic information on paediatric population based on the final results from study PTC124-GD048-DMD 'A Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety and PK of ataluren in patients with nmDMD aged ≥6 months to &lt;2 years old' (MEA -018). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to introduce editorial changes to the PI. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance In  the  current  variation  the  MAH  proposes  amendments  to  the  SmPC  to  inform  physicians  on  the use/posology in patients aged ≥6 months to &lt;2 years of age , outside the currently authorised use of the medicinal product, i.e. patients aged 2 years and older. Translarna (ataluren) exerts its efficacy through enabling ribosomal read through when a premature stop codon is generated in the mRNA by nonsense mutations in the dystrophin DNA. Translarna is administered orally every day with a recommended dose of 10 mg/kg body weight in the morning, 10 mg/kg body weight at midday, and 20 mg/kg body weight in the evening (for a total daily dose of 40 mg/kg body weight). Translarna obtained conditional approval in 2014 for ' the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 5 years and older  (see  section  5.1).  The  presence  of  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  dystrophin  gene  should  be determined by genetic testing (see section 4.4) ' . Medicinal product no longer authorised

In support of the proposed updates of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC the MAH has submitted

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data of an open label study in 6 nmDMD subjects aged≥6 months to &lt;2 years of age , who were followed for at least 24 weeks. The study included PK assessment and tolerability/ safety assessment.

Blood samples for PK assessments were drawn using the volumetric absorptive micro-sampling method at baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 24 (Visit 5; end of treatment/early termination). The samples were drawn immediately pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post-dose following both the morning and midday doses and immediately predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 (before the next day morning dose) hours post-dose following the evening dose.

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

The PK data was compared to data from nmDMD patients age 2-5 years of age (study 030) and to patients &gt;5years of age (Study 004). The safety analysis following 24 weeks of treatment did not show unexpected findings. The results were in line with the known effects of ataluren and with frequent occurring childhood illness as was also seen in the children aged 2-5 years of age. Six patients ranging from to with a mean age of 14 months (range 7 months; 23months), however, is considered too limited a sample to allow for a meaningful conclusion. The proposed changes to SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 are supported by the data submitted. However, in view of the CHMP opinion for the annual renewal EMEA/H/C/002720/R/071 adopted on 24 January  2024  to  not  renew  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Translarna,  as  a  favourable  benefit-risk balance has not been confirmed in the treatment of ambulant patients with nmDMD aged 2 years or older,  no  changes  to  the  marketing  authorisation  can  be  recommended.  The  European  Commission decision on the non-renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation is awaited. 3. Recommendations Based on the review of data submitted in this application, concerning the following change: Variation requested C.I.4 The CHMP is of the opinion that the requested update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to change posology information in paediatric population, to update the summary of safety profile and to update pharmacokinetic information on paediatric population based on the final results from study PTC124-GD-048-DMD  'A  Phase  2,  multiple-dose,  open-label  study  evaluating  the  safety  and  PK  of ataluren in patients with nmDMD aged ≥6 months to &lt;2 years old' (as well as the subsequent updates to  the  Package  Leaflet  and  the  additional  editorial  changes  to  the  PI)  are  supported  by  the  data submitted.

## 5. Introduction

The MAH conducted a clinical study in children with nmDMD between 6 months and 2 years of age (study 048), as part of the PIP requirements. The number of subjects for this age group (n=6) was agreed upon in the PIP. Updates of the study, i.e. recruitment, enrolment etc, has been presented in the annual PSUR updates.

<!-- image -->

The original protocol, dated 14 April 2020, was amended on 29 April 2021 (version 2.0), 01 July 2021 (version 3.0) and 06 May 2022 (version 4.0). The most significant changes to the study protocol were implemented in Version 2.0 and included the following: · The duration of treatment was changed from '52 weeks' to '24 weeks' and the end of treatment (EOT) timepoint was updated to occur at Week 24 instead of Week 52 following discussion and agreement with the EMA PDCO on PIP RfM#11 (EMEA-000115-PIP01-07-M11) · Removal of the efficacy endpoint (change in motor development) · Removal of the exploratory endpoint 'abnormalities of physical findings, clinical laboratory tests, or electrocardiograms (ECGs)' since this information is captured as part of the primary endpoint · The exploratory objective of 'to assess changes from baseline in creatine kinase (CK) levels after 24 weeks of ataluren treatment' and the exploratory endpoint of 'change from baseline in CK levels' were added · Updates were made to the volume and process by which blood PK samples are collected In addition, blood/plasma partition sampling was added in Version 3.0 and urine protein: urine creatinine ratio (spot) was added to the list of clinical laboratory assessments in Version 4.0. The MAH indicates that no extension of the indication for patients with nmDMD ≥ 6 months to &lt;2 years of age is sought. Instead, it is proposed to update the SmPC based on the data from study 048. More specifically the following updates are proposed (strike trough indicates text removed, bold underlined is newly added) Medicinal product no longer authorised

6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects Study 048 was designed as a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ataluren in 6 male children with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) ≥ 6 months to &lt;2 years of age . Subjects received 3 times daily for 24 weeks orally administered ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg (morning, midday, and evening dose, respectively). 6.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted Blood  samples  for  the  measurement  of  ataluren  levels  and  PK  assessments  were  drawn  using  the volumetric absorptive microsampling method at baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 24 (Visit 5;  end  of  treatment/early  termination)  for  evaluation  using  a  bioanalytical  method  (Module  2.7.1). Samples were drawn immediately predose and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours postdose following both the morning and midday doses and immediately predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 (before the next day morning dose) hours postdose following the evening dose. In addition, blood sampling via venous draw was conducted at Visits 2, 3, and 5 for the assessment of blood/plasma partitioning. All 6 participants enrolled were included in the PK analysis. 6.2.

The MAH has merged data from two clinical  studies,  while  the  data  should  be  presented  separately.  Study  030  had  greater  numbers  of subjects included and an extrapolation was considered possible. For the current study in nmDMD subjects between 6 months and 2 years of age the data are rather limited (n=6). Moreover, the statement ' age adjusted  dosing  is  not  require d'  should  be  removed  for  patients  aged six  months  to  2  years.  The proposed text is a dose recommendation and 1) Section 5.2 is not the appropriate place for a dose recommendation this should be done in SmPC section 4.2 the posology, and more important 2) a dose recommendation should not be included if the population is not included in the indication. For the study description of study 048, the number of subjects should be included with the mean age and  the  range  (minimum  age,  and  upper  age)  to  provide  context  to  the  treating  physician  on  the available data. 7. Clinical Safety aspects Study 048 also assessed the safety and tolerability of ataluren exposure in 6 male subjects with nmDMD aged ≥ 6 months to &lt;2 years of age treated 3 times daily for 24 weeks with orally administered ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg (morning, midday, and evening dose, respectively). All 6 participants completed the 24-week treatment period and rolled over to the long-term open-label safety study for follow-up of at least 52 weeks from the date of first administration of ataluren. 7.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted The 6 participants received ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg (morning, midday, and evening dose, respectively) for durations of 162, 163, 169, 169, 169, and 174 days. 7.2. Results Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 5 (83.3%) participants (Table 3). A total of 18 TEAEs were reported in 5 participants overall (Listing 16.2.7.1). A  total  of  2  (33.3%)  participants  experienced  TEAEs  that  were  mild  in  severity,  and  3  (50.0%) participants experienced TEAEs that were moderate in severity. There were no TEAEs classified as severe (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3 or higher). Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were no TEAEs during the study that were considered possibly or probably related to the study drug. There were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation or death.

7.2.2. Analysis of Adverse Events A total of 3 (50.0%) participants experienced TEAEs that were moderate in severity. One participant experienced a TEAE of otitis media, 1 participant experienced TEAEs of urticaria and decreased appetite, and 1 participant  experienced  TEAEs  of  teething,  skin  plaque,  eczema,  body  tinea,  and  enterovirus infection (Listing 16.2.7.1). All other TEAEs were mild. There were no TEAEs classified as CTCAE Grade 3 or higher. All TEAEs were transient and had resolved with the exception of teething, eczema, and body tinea in 1 participant (Listing 16.2.7.1). There were no TEAEs during the study that were considered possibly or probably related to the study drug, and there were no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation or death (Table 14.3.1.1). No participants had dose-limiting toxicities. There were no deaths, serious TEAEs, or other significant AEs in this study (PTC124-GD-048-DMD CSR, Table 14.3.1.1 and Listing 16.2.7.1). 7.2.3. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  trends  in  clinical  laboratory  values  during  the  study  related  to chemistry  parameters,  haematology  parameters,  and  urinalysis  parameters.  There  were  no  TEAEs associated with any clinical laboratory value. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline value for creatine kinase was 24901.5 (10069.12) U/L (n=6). The mean (SD) change from baseline at Week 4 (n=4), Week 12 (n=5), and Week 24 (n=6) was -4358.5 (10283.15), -6946.6 (7363.86), and -1537.8 (11057.99) U/L, respectively.

## 7.3. Discussion

The safety analysis following 24 weeks of treatment did not reveal unexpected findings. The results were in line with the known effects of ataluren and with frequent occurring childhood illness as was also seen in the children aged 2-5 years of age. However, 6 patients ranging from 7 months to 23 months with a mean age of 14 months is considered too limited to  allow  the  conclusions  drawn  by  the  MAH.  The proposed changes to section 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 are therefore not agreed. The SmPC should adequately present the limited data to inform treating physicians. See section 9 for further details.

The wording as proposed by the MAH may be perceived by the reader that efficacy data is available for the nmDMD patients aged ≥ 6 months to <2 years of age efficacy. Furthermore, as no specific efficacy or pharmacodynamic outcomes are included, no additional information for section 5.1 relevant for prescribers is provided. A study description in 4.8 and 5.2 may be acceptable, provided these are done as indicated. The removal of the PIP obligation is agreed.

The finally proposed changes to SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 included in the above table are supported by the data submitted and could have been agreed. However, in view of the CHMP opinion for the annual renewal EMEA/H/C/002720/R/071 adopted on 24 January 2024 to not renew the marketing authorisation of Translarna, as a favourable benefit-risk balance has not been confirmed in the treatment of ambulant patients with nmDMD aged 2 years or older, no changes to the marketing authorisation can be recommended.

10. Assessment  of  the  responses  to  the  2 nd   request  for supplementary information 10.1. Major objections None. 10.2. Other concerns Clinical aspects Question 1 The  proposed  changes  are  not  agreed.  Data  from  6  patients  is  too  limited  to  allow  for  meaningful information for the prescribers. The current SmPC text is sufficient. An update to section 4.8 and 5.2 may be acceptable, provided the amendments are made as indicated by the Rapporteur. Summary of the MAH's response Text has been proposed according to the Agency's proposal. Assessment of the MAH's response As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated (see below). The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. The proposed updates are not agreed. See below for Rapporteurs comment on each section. The MAH has generally amended the SmPC as indicated by the Rapporteur. However, the age is indicated as years, while months is more appropriate for this age range. This should be corrected. Conclusion Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance Medicinal product no longer authorised
