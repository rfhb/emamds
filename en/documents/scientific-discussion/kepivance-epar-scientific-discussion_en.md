## 1. Introduction

## Oral mucositis

Oral mucositis is a significant problem in patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Estimates of oral mucositis incidence among cancer therapy patients range from 40% of those receiving standard chemotherapy  to  76%  of  bone  marrow  transplant  patients  [1].  Virtually,  all  patients  who  receive radiotherapy to the head and neck area develop oral complications. Cancer therapy-induced mucositis occurs  when  radiation  or  chemotherapy  destroys  rapidly  proliferating  cells  such  as  those lining  the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract. In the setting of high-dose myelotoxic therapy, mucositis is a frequent,  extremely  painful  and  debilitating  complication  [2].  Mucositis  can  arise  along  the  entire gastrointestinal tract and can be associated with significant morbidity, including: pain, specifically in the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus (esophagitis), requiring opioid analgesia; difficulty or inability to  swallow,  because  of  ulcerations  in  the  oral  cavity,  pharynx,  and  esophagus,  leading  to  a compromised  nutritional  status  necessitating  parenteral  feeding  and  hydration;  infection  due  to  the breakdown  of  the  epithelial  barrier  and  exacerbated  by  accompanying  neutropenia  (when  present); difficulty or inability to speak; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which may require intravenous (i.v.) rehydration and may predispose the patient to severe electrolyte and acid-base disorders; gastrointestinal bleeding due to ulceration at any site of the gastrointestinal tract, but typically in the esophagus or stomach. These manifestations diminish the quality of life of patients with cancer and can  interfere  with  management  of  the  primary  disease,  e.g.,  requiring  dose  reductions  or  treatment delays [3]. The effect of mucositis on length of hospital stay, admissions for fluid support or treatment of  infection,  and  alteration  of  optimum  anticancer  treatment  have  significant  clinical  and  economic consequences [4]. Normally, cells of the mouth undergo rapid renewal over a 7- to 14-day cycle. Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy  interfere  with  cellular  mitosis  and  reduce  the  regenerative  ability  of  the  oral  mucosa. Typical sequelae of cytotoxic agents include epithelial hyperplasia, collagen and glandular degeneration, and epithelial dysplasia [5]. Direct stomatotoxicity usually is seen 5 to 7 days after the administration  of  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy.  In  non  myelosuppressed patients,  oral  lesions  heal within 2 to 3 weeks [6]. The pathophysiology of mucositis has been described as a complex biologic process that occurs in four phases: from day 0 to 5 of therapy (1) an inflammatory or vascular phase, during which cytokines are released from the epithelial tissue and submucosal vascularity is increased and (2) an  epithelial phase,  during  which atrophy and ulceration of the  epithelial occurs, then  from days 6 to 12 of therapy (3) an ulcerative or bacteriologic phase, the most complex and symptomatic phase,  which  usually  coincides  with the patient's period of  maximum  neutropenia, and  finally  from day  12  to  16, (4) a healing  phase,  which  consist  of  renewal  in epithelial  proliferation  and differentiation, with normalization of the patient's peripheral white blood cell count and reestablishment of the local microbial flora [7]. The underlying  pathophysiology  of  oral  mucositis  is  essentially  the  same  regardless  of  the  type  of insult that  causes it [8], but the severity and duration of the mucositis is conditioned by the type of insult  (e.g.,  alkylating  agents,  including  busulfan,  antimetabolites,  mitotic  inhibitor  etc.),  intensity (high-dose cytotoxic therapy, standard-dose chemotherapy), and duration (multi-cycle chemotherapy versus fractionated  radiotherapy  for  HNC  treatment).  Indirect  factors  include  myelosuppression, immunosuppression, reduced secretory IgA and infections [9]. Many different grading systems exist (such  as  that  proposed by the National Cancer  Institute [10]), allowing the  assessment  of  mucositis severity and the construction of a treatment plan. Grading systems are mostly based on two or more clinical parameters, including erythema, pain, and problems with eating. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Erythema is  normally the  first  manifestation  of  mucositis and starts about 5  days  after initiation of chemotherapy and may be followed by oedema and ulceration. Severe mucositis is usually defined as grade 3 and 4 according to the WHO classification where grade 3 signifies ulcers requiring liquid diet. The  effective  prevention  of  mucositis  requires  a  comprehensive  patient  examination  to  identify potentially complicating oral disease before the cancer therapy begins [11].

## Prevention and treatment of mucositis

Currently  no approved  treatments  are  available  to  prevent  oral  mucositis  induced  by  chemotherapy and/or  radiotherapy  [12-14].  Interventions  are  primarily  supportive  and  are  aimed  at  palliating symptoms such as pain (from topical anesthetics and coating agents to opioid analgesics), addressing inability to eat and drink (parenteral feeding and hydration), reducing local trauma (dental care), and decreasing the risk of secondary infection (prophylactic antibiotics). Although  benzydamine hydrochloride (a topically-applied agent with anti-inflammatory, anesthetic, and antimicrobial properties)  has recently  been  recommended by the  Multinational  Association  of Supportive Care in Cancer  (MASCC)  for  the  prevention  of  radiation-induced  oral  mucositis  in  patients  with  HNC receiving moderate-dose radiotherapy (&lt; 50 Gy), benzydamine hydrochloride is not approved for the prevention  of  radiation-induced  oral  mucositis,  and  it  has  not  shown  efficacy  in  other  settings.  A number of other experimental approaches to preventing  oral  mucositis have been studied, including topical  and  systemic  granulocyte  or  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factors  (G-CSF  or GM-CSF),  laser  and  cryotherapies,  and  radioprotectants  such  as  amifostine.  To  date,  all  of  these approaches have failed to conclusively demonstrate any benefit in reducing oral mucositis.

Treatment breaks and dose reduction are often used to manage severe oral mucositis in the settings of fractionated radiation therapy (with or without concomitant chemotherapy) and multicycle chemotherapy.  Although  the  value  of  maintaining  dose  intensity  remains  somewhat  controversial, increased relative  dose-intensity  has been shown to be of benefit in specific settings (e.g., adjuvant treatment  of  breast  cancer)  and  an  association  between  maintaining  standard  doses  and  improved survival has been demonstrated for some cancers. In the setting of high-dose myelotoxic therapy, oral mucositis  is  unlikely  to  result  in  treatment  breaks  or  dose  reductions  since  the  cytotoxic  therapy  is consolidated  in  a  short  but  intense  time  frame  and  since  oral  mucositis  generally  occurs  only  after completion  of  therapy.  However,  although  efficacy  is  the  primary  consideration  in  choosing  a therapeutic regimen for an individual patient, toxicities (including oral mucositis) may also influence the choice of treatment regimens, which could impact on disease outcome. About the product Palifermin (also referred to during the development as rHuKGF ∆ 23, rHuKGFd23, Palifermin Amgen or  Kepivance),  is  a  purified  recombinant  truncated  form  of  human  keratinocyte  growth  factor (rHuKGF). Keratinocyte  growth  factor  (KGF),  first  described  in  1989  as  a  growth  factor  that  stimulates  the proliferation  of  mouse  keratinocytes,  is  a  member  of  the  fibroblast  growth  factor  (FGF)  family (specifically, FGF-7) [15, 16]. Endogenous KGF is synthesized and released by fibroblasts and other mesenchymal  cells,  and  is  the  ligand  for  the  KGFR.  Keratinocyte  growth  factor  exhibits  strict specificity of action for epithelial cells because its receptor (KGFR) is expressed almost exclusively by  these  cells.  Expression  of  KGFR  has  been  demonstrated  in  a  wide  variety  of  tissues,  including upper  and  lower  gastrointestinal  tract,  lung,  urogenital  tissues,  skin,  mammary  gland,  kidney,  and cornea [15-17]. Keratinocyte  growth  factor  is  widely  expressed  by  mesenchymal  cells of  tissues  in which  KGFR  is  expressed  by  epithelial cells,  consistent  with  a  paradigm  of  KGF-mediated, mesenchymal-epithelial, paracrine interactions. A general role for KGF in the organism's response to tissue injury is suggested by findings of increased KGF mRNA levels within human dermal wounds and in the intestines of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [18, 19]. These observations suggest that increased KGF production is a physiological response to injury of epithelial tissue. Palifermin is being developed to reduce the severity and duration of oral mucositis and related clinical sequelae  and  improve  patient  functioning  in  patients  with  hematologic  malignancies  who  receive myeloablative therapy (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). These treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in controlling disease in patients with hematologic malignancies and therefore are frequently used in this patient population. Conditioning  regimens  may  consist  of  high-dose  chemotherapy  alone  or  with total  body  irradiation (TBI). Depending upon the disease, various chemotherapy regimens are used, including etoposide and cyclophosphamide, BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), CBV (cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide) and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide).

Trypticase peptone and glycerol of animal origin were used in the preparation of the Master Cell Bank (MCB)  in  February  1995.  These  materials  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  TSE  Note  for Guidance [20] referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC [21]. When the Working Cell Bank (WCB) was created, no trypticase peptone was used, and the glycerol used was from a non-animal derived source.

Kepivance is presented as a white lyophilised powder for solution for injection, in a single use type I glass  vial,  closed  with  a  silicone  stopper.  Each  vial  contains  6.25  mg  of  palifermin.  The  medicinal product will be reconstituted prior to administration with 1.2 ml sterile water for injection, to yield a 5 mg/ml solution. Table 1: Composition of the medicinal product Active Substance Palifermin,  which is a  recombinant Human Keratinocyte Growth Factor is produced in Escherichia coli ( E.coli ).   Palifermin is  a  nonglycosylated, monomeric protein of 140 amino acids. Compared to the endogenous human keratinocyte growth factor (HuKGF) of 163 amino acids, it is truncated by 23 amino acids at the N terminus. Palifermin is reported to have a comparable in vitro and in vivo activity to endogenous HuKGF. Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls Fermentation Palifermin  is  produced  intracellularly  (i.e.  not  secreted)  in  a  soluble  active  form.  The  production fermentation  is  terminated  and  then  the  harvesting  procedure  starts.  The  cells  are  concentrated  and lysed. Cell debris is then removed. The process conditions were considered defined in sufficient detail. Purification Several chromatography steps are employed in purification of palifermin to remove or reduce the level of  host cell-derived proteins, nucleic acids and endotoxins and palifermin-related variants. After the first chromatography step, palifermin undergoes an oxidation step, for formation of one disulfide link.

## Development Genetics

Palifermin is expressed by an E. coli host cell system carrying a plasmid vector genetically modified to direct the production of palifermin. The entire coding sequence was chemically synthesized using optimal E. coli codons. The production strain was cultured to establish the Master Cell Bank (MCB).

Cell Bank System and Testing A two-tiered cell bank is used, which ensures the production capacity for the life of the product. The MCB has been laid down and a WCB has been prepared. The procedures for production of the cell banks were considered acceptably described. Cell bank characterisation The MCB and WCB have been characterised, according to ICH guidelines, for identity, safety  and stability.  The  cell  bank  specifications  and  test  results  are  presented.  The  characterization  was acceptable and the analytical methods were satisfactorily described. Genetic stability Acceptable stability has been shown for the MCB and WCB respectively. Controls of Critical Steps and Intermediates For critical parameters, i.e. those suitable for decision to accept or reject a batch, limits have been set. The acceptance limits will be re-evaluated and potentially updated when a larger data set is available. Process Validation and/or Evaluation The validation studies that have been carried out were satisfactory. Process  validation  was  performed  with  four  commercial  scale  batches,  derived  from  corresponding fermentation batches. Manufacturing Process development During development of the manufacturing process, different process development stages in different manufacturing  sites have  been  documented.  The  applicant  has  provided data  to  demonstrate comparability of commercial and clinical trial batches. Characterisation Palifermin has been characterised using physico-chemical and biological assays. Impurities Host  cell-related  impurities,  such  as  DNA,  host  cell  proteins  and  endotoxins  are  controlled  via  the purification process during manufacture. Process-related impurities are removed during the concentration/diafiltration step. The expression system and reagents used are not considered to raise concerns as regards adventitious agents. The bioburden control was found acceptable. Control of Active Substance All  of  the  non-pharmacopeial  methods  used  for  testing  of  the  active  substance  against  the  defined specification  have  been  validated  to  evaluate  their  reproducibility,  linearity,  sensitivity,  precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness and ruggedness, generally in accordance with the ICH Q2A and Q2B guidance, where ICH standard criteria were not met an alternative approach was used. Validation was made, in addition for QC analysis of active substance, by using the sample compositions relevant for the specified IPC analyses. Batch data was reviewed for 7 clinical batches, and for 7 commercial scale batches. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Active substance specifications were established based on historical data (including clinical trial lots), assay variability, and active substance shelf-life. Justifications were presented for each test attribute. The active substance will be stored and transported in containers conforming to Ph.Eur requirements.

Chemical  resistance  and  extractable  testing  has  been  performed  in  accordance  with  Ph.Eur  test methods to  ensure  that  any  potential  leaching  of  components  from  the  container  closure  is  within

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acceptable limits as  defined by relevant pharmacopoeial and/or industry standards. Integrity  studies have been performed to confirm the quality of fit between the bottle and the closure.

## Stability

Based on the real time stability data a shelf life for the active substance has been accepted.

Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development The manufacturing process for the final product consists of a dilution of the active substance to the desired concentration followed by sterile filtration and filling into vials.  The manufacturing process for the final product has been validated and is controlled by in process controls and product release specifications.    The  quality  of  the  finished  product  is  ensured  by  analyses  of  the  product  by  a combination of physico-chemical and biological methords. During development of the manufacturing process, different process development stages in different manufacturing  sites  have  been  documented.    The  applicant  has  provided  data  to  demonstrate comparability of commercial and clinical trial batches. Process  validation  has  been  made  for  the  commercial  scale  production.  The  validation  program evaluated the following aspects of the process: Media fill, Manufacturing process, Mixing, Hold time, Fill weight, Lyophilizer cycle, Filter, Cleaning, sanitization and sterilization, Inspection, Sub-visible particle determination and Transportation. Conventional excipients are used and material specifications are in place. Control of Medicinal Product For  most  analytical  methods,  reference  is  made  to  the  method  validation  presented  in  the  Active substance section. Remaining  non-pharmacopeial  methods used  for testing of the  medicinal product have been validated essentially in accordance with the relevant guidance provided in ICH guidance. Batch analysis data were presented for 20 batches of medicinal product manufactured at both clinical and  commercial  scale,  the  latter  including  four  consecutive  medicinal  product  lots  manufactured  at Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions (BPS), which were used to validate the commercial  scale manufacturing process. The glass (Type I) vial and stopper (chlorobutyl) comply with relevant Ph.Eur monographs.  Studies to monitor physicochemical aspects  of the  elastomeric stopper,  extraction  characteristics  of the  rubber closure  and  functional  suitability  indicate  that  the  container  system  has  no  adverse  impact  on medicinal  product.  The  USP  biological  reactivity  test  for  elastomeric  materials  was also  performed successfully. Stability of the product The medicinal product stability program was provided. All commercial-scale batches were stable when stored at 2- 8 ° C for 15 months. Clinical trial batches were stable when stored at 2- 8 ° C for 60 and 48 months, respectively. The stability data provided support the applicant's proposed shelf life as mentioned in the SPC. The results of studies after reconstitution confirm, as also shown in the pharmaceutical development, that  the  stability  of  the  reconstituted  medicinal  product  directly  correlates  with  temperature.  The recommended storage conditions for the reconstituted medicinal product is 2 ° to 8 ° C. The duration of storage  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  as  the  medicinal  product  formulation  does  not  contain  a preservative. The  results  indicate  that  the  medicinal  product  is  photolabile  both  when  lyophilized  and  when reconstituted, with significant decreases in main peak percentages when evaluated by SE-, CE-, and RP-HPLC. The lyophilized medicinal product should therefore be stored at 2 ° to 8 ° C and protected from light. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The medicinal product stability protocol for palifermin stored at 2 ° to 8'C will continue for up to 48 months. In addition, the sponsor proposes to perform stability testing on a minimum of 1 commercial lot of medicinal product per year, except for the event that no product is produced during a given year

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The  main  structural  difference  between  palifermin  and  the  endogenous  protein  is  that  the  first  23 N-terminal amino acids, including two cysteine residues, have been deleted (designated 'delta N23'). In  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies,  different  truncated  forms  of  rHuKGF  were  used,  and  for these studies the term 'rHuKGF' refers to any of these forms. Safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies were performed with the delta N23 form. In these studies, evaluated lots were representative of, or identical to, the clinical formulations.

Safety  pharmacology  studies,  and  with  a  few  exceptions,  toxicology  studies  were  performed  in accordance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  regulations.  Non-GLP  toxicology  studies  were some  non-pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  range-finding  embryo-foetal  toxicity  studies,  and studies addressing the  effect  of palifermin  on the  growth  of  human tumours in athymic  nude  mice. Most toxicokinetics studies were stated to be GLP compliant. Pharmacology The non-clinical pharmacology program was designed to evaluate the use of rHuKGF in the treatment of epithelial/mucosal tissue injury induced by radio- and/or chemotherapy. Non-clinical pharmacology studies with rHuKGF were conducted in a variety of species including the mouse, rat, and monkey, with the majority being conducted in mice. Doses used in the pharmacology studies ranged from 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. The primary route of administration was subcutaneous. Physical chemistry Palifermin has demonstrated mitogenic activity commensurate with native KGF [22]. The importance (related to mitogenic activity) of KGF N-terminal amino acid residues 15 to 27 has been specifically assessed  [23].  The  bioactivity  of  the  KGF  truncation  mutants  lacking  amino  acid  residues  1-15 through  1-24  was  comparable  to  that  of  full  length  KGF.  The  KGF  protein  structure,  including glycosylation and other post-translational modifications has been described in the literature [24, 25]. /square4 Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo) Primary  pharmacodynamics  studies  evaluated  epithelial  protection  by  exogenously  administered rHuKGF.  A  total  of  16  non-clinical  studies  of  direct  relevance  for  the  proposed  indication  were submitted. The animal models used in these studies included rat models of acute and chronic salivary gland toxicity (xerostomia) induced by radiation, murine models of oral mucosal toxicity induced by radiation or combination chemotherapy/radiation and mouse and non human primate models of lethal irradiation and transplantation with bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells (mice only). The affinity  of  rHuKGF  for  mouse  and  human  KGFR  has  been  reported  in  the literature  [26,  27]. rHuKGF showed affinity of 200 pM for human KGFR and 25 to 400 pM for the mouse (determined by Scatchard analysis). The primary pharmacodynamics studies demonstrated that in radiation-induced xerostomia models in rats,  administration  of  rHuKGF  preserved  salivary  secretion.  The  various  studies  showed  rHuKGF increased salivary gland weight, increased salivary protein and amylase secretion, improved lag time for  salivary  flow  and  increased  salivary  flow  rate.  The  histological  lesions  induced  by  the  radiation were also largely ablated by the administration of rHuKGF. In  murine  mucositis  models,  the  parameters  investigated  included  epithelial  thickness  of  tongue, buccal  mucosa,  oesophagus, duodenum, jejunum and  ileum as well as  crypt number and  weight. In these  models,  administration  of  rHuKGF  ameliorated  the  effects  on  the  digestive  tract  induced  by radiation and / or chemotherapy. In addition, BrdU-labeling data demonstrated that rHuKGF promoted the  proliferation  of  the  entire  gastrointestinal  epithelium,  including  the  oral  mucosa.  The  effects  of rHuKGF on chemotherapy-induced weight loss and mortality were also investigated. In some studies, administration of rHuKGF reduced weight loss and in some cases increased survival. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the primary pharmacodynamic studies, the subcutaneous route was generally used (as opposed to the clinical, i.v., route) and the schedules varied. However, in general, pre-treatment with rHuKGF, or pre-  and  post-radiation/chemotherapy  treatment  with  rHuKGF  appeared  to  be  the  more  effective schedules, although the benefit of post-treatment administration was not clearly demonstrated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The kinetics of epithelial cell proliferation after the administration of a single s.c. dose of palifermin has been studied in mice. Administration of palifermin significantly enhanced the BrdU incorporation (a  measure  of  S-phase)  in  the  mucosa  of  the  mouse tongue,  esophagus  and  jejunum  24  hours  after treatment.  At  48  hours,  BrdU  incorporation  in  the  mucosa  of  the  tongue  and  esophagous  was decreased  to  levels  that  were  significantly  below  control  and  gradually  recovered  to  control  levels within  4  to  5  days.  In  the  jejunum,  BrdU  incorporation  to  about  the  same  levels  as  in  control  was observed at 48 hours.

Mice pre-treated with rHuKGF (5 mg/kg/day s.c. on days -3, -2 and -1) before methotrexate (single i.v. dose  of 150 mg or 300 mg) and total body irradiation (6 GY) improved survival and weight loss nadirs  compared  with  saline-treated  controls.  Mice  pre-treated  with  rHuKGF  (5  mg/kg/day  s.c.  on days -3, -2 and -1) before radiation (5 GY) and cyclophosphamide (200 or 400 mg/kg) administration lost  less  weight  than  animals  that  did  not  receive  rHuKGF.  Mice  were pre-treated with rHuKGF (5 mg/kg/day s.c. on days -2, -1 and 0) before irradiation (12 GY) on day 1 and BMT on day 2. Posttreatment rHuKGF was administered on days 3, 4 and 5, and rHuGCSF (200 µ g/kg/day) for 7 days beginning on day 3. Pre-treatment with rHuKGF generally improved survival compared with controls (saline-treated),  in  which  mortality  was  high.  In  a  dextran  sodium  sulphate  (DSS)  model  of inflammatory bowel disease in mice, rHuKGF was administered S.C. at 1 or 3 mg/kg every second day  from  either  day  0  or  day  4.  Both  doses  improved  survival,  decreased  body  weight  loss  and diarrhoea, with the higher dose appearing to improve symptoms more than the lower dose. In another model of IBD, the immunologic transfer murine model, colitis-like disease was induced in SCID mice by injection of semi-syngeneic CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells isolated from donor mice. Treatment with rHuKGF (i.p.) or  saline  began  when  they  had  lost  10%  of  their  body  weight.  Disease  progression, weight  loss  and  mortality  were similar  in  both  groups,  but  differences were  seen  at  necropsy, with large  intestines  appearing  more  normal  on  gross  examination  and  less  inflamed  on  microscopic examination in the rHuKGF-treated group. rHuKGF treated mice had larger livers and smaller small

In a second study, cell proliferation was followed after 3 consecutive injections of palifermin given 24 hours apart. The peak of cell proliferation after 1, 2, or 3 injections of palifermin always happened 24 hours after the first injection; 48 hours after a single injection or after the last injection of a series of 2 or 3 administrations of palifermin, there was a consistent drop in cell proliferation to a level that was significantly below the homeostatic level of cell proliferation seen in the epithelium of control mice. /square4 Secondary pharmacodynamics A series of studies were conducted to investigate the additional effects of rHuKGF in animal models of  disease  and  injury.  In  a  model  of  chemotherapy-induced  diarrhoea,  rats  were  administered irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-111) at a single i.p. dose of 300 mg/kg. This dose had previously been determined to induce diarrhoea in rats without significant mortality. Administration of rHuKGF (30 mg/kg i.v.) 3 days before CPT-111 decreased the severity of the CPT-111-induced diarrhoea as well as the mean daily diarrhoea incidence. There was no significant decrease in mortality or in weight gain or loss.  A  similar  study  showed that  early pre-treatment (days -4, -3, -2)  with rHuKGF (5  mg/kg s.c.) decreased the rate of mortality and hastened recovery of weight in mice treated with CPT-111 for 4 days (days 0-4) at 200 mg/kg i.p. Similar effects were not seen in mice dosed with CPT-111 at 250 mg/kg  i.p.  A  single  high  dose  of  rHuKGF  (30  mg/kg)  given  s.c.  on  day  -1  prior  to  CPT-111 administration reduced rat mortality, decreased the severity of diarrhoea, and postponed the onset of diarrhoea by two days. Pre-treatment of mice for three days (-3 to -1) with 5 mg/kg rHuKGF s.c. prior to  radiation  (12  GY)  and  subsequent  post-treatment  with  rHuKGF  and  recombinant  Murine Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (rMuGCSF) on days 2 to 6 had no effect on survival or body weight in  comparison  with the irradiated  and saline-treated  control. However in another study, pretreatment  of  mice  with  rHuKGF  (5  mg/kg  s.c.)  on  days  -3  to  -1  prior  to  irradiation  (12  GY)  and autologous  bone  marrow  transplantation  (BMT)  increased  the  number  of  surviving  crypts  in  the duodenum,  jejunum  and  ileum,  and  increased  the  weight  of  the  duodenum  and  jejunum  when compared with saline-treated controls. In a similar study investigating the effects of pre-treatment with rHuKGF (5 mg/kg s.c. on days -2 to 0)  on  survival  and  body  weight  in  mice  receiving  radiation  (either  11,  12  or  13  GY)  and  BMT, rHuKGF did not prevent weight loss, and improved survival only in mice receiving 13GY.

intestines  compared  with  control  mice,  and  had  lower  blood  levels  of  segmented  neutrophils (increased  segmented  neutrophils,  increased  white  blood  cell  count,  decreased  blood  protein  and decreased cholesterol are associated with disease progression in this model). There was also increased proliferation of the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus in the rHuKGF treated animals.

Safety pharmacology A  safety  pharmacology  study  (960  100)  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  effect  of  palifermin  on general  behaviour,  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  autonomic  nervous  system  and  smooth  muscle, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems. Mice, rats and Rhesus monkeys were used,  with  rHuKGFd23  administered  intravenously  at  doses  of  0.5,  5.0  and  50  mg/kg.  Guinea  pig ileum was tested in vitro , at concentrations of 5 x10 -5 g/ml, 5 x 10 -6 g/ml and 5 x 10 -7 g/ml. Effects on general behaviours In a modified Irwin test in mice [28], rHuKGFd23 had no effect on general behaviour. CNS effects Central nervous system tests included effects on locomotor activity, thiopental-induced sleep, acetic acid-induced writhing and convulsions in mice and body temperature in rats. In  mice,  rHuKGFd23  had  no  effect  on  locomotor  activity,  the  latency  or  duration  of  thiopentalinduced sleep or on acetic acid-induced writhing. Furthermore, the same doses had no effect on the incidence of tonic convulsions or mortality following a maximal electroshock, or on the time to onset of tonic convulsions, duration of the tonic convulsions, or time until death in mice treated with 150 mg/kg of pentylenetetrazol. It also had no effect on the incidence of clonic convulsions, and did not induce tonic convulsions in mice treated with a sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (50 mg/kg). In rats, rHuKGFd23 had no effect on body temperature. Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle effects Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle effects were investigated in isolated guinea pig ileum. Recombinant  HuKGFd23  had  no  effect  on  spontaneous  movement  of  the  isolated  ileum,  and  no effects on contractions induced by acetylcholine, barium chloride or histamine. Respiratory and cardiovascular effects Respiratory and cardiovascular effects were investigated in anaesthetised rhesus monkeys. Recombinant HuKGFd23 had no effect on respiratory rate, diastolic or systolic blood pressure, heart rate, femoral artery blood flow or the elecrocardiogram. Gastrointestinal effects Recombinant HuKGFd23 had no effect on the transit of a charcoal meal in mice. Renal effects Renal effects were investigated in saline-loaded rats. At all doses, there was a statistically significant decrease  in  the  concentration  of  sodium  excreted.  In  the  5  and  50  mg/kg  groups,  there  was  also  a reduction in the concentration of chloride excreted. At the high dose (50 mg/kg), the concentration of potassium excreted was also decreased. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions Two studies (IH-95-KGF-002 / R2003172 and R2003173) addressed the potential interaction between rHuKGF and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).

The first study investigated the potential interactions between rHuKGF pre-treatment (50 mg/kg s.c. on  days  -2,  -1  and  0)  with  5-FU  administration  and  subsequent  s.c.  administration  of  recombinant murine granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rMuG-CSF) in male BDF1 mice.

The decreased body weights and reduction in mean platelet counts induced by 5-FU (whether or not it was followed by rMuG-CSF administration) were diminished by rHuKGF pre-treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  histopathological  examination,  the  mucosal  caeco-colic  damage  induced  by  5-FU  was  not  as severe as was expected from previous studies, and appeared to be aggravated in some animals by the administration of rMuG-CSF. Pre-treatment with rHuKGF decreased the incidence and severity of this damage. Recombinant HuKGF had minimal or no effect on the bone marrow lesions induced by 5-FU. The second study investigated the effect of rHuKGF and/or rHuG-CSF on the clinical course of the response  of rhesus  macaques  exposed to 12 GY single  dose total body irradiation with and without bone marrow autografts. Monkeys received either vehicle or rHuKGF (100 or 300 µ g/kg/day) on days -3, -2 and -1, or rHuKGF at 300 µ g/kg/day on days -3, -2, -1, 3, 4 and 5. An additional group received pre-  and  post-irradiation  rHuKGF and rHuG-CSF  (10 µ g/kg/day)  starting  on  day  1  until  neutrophil counts were above 3000/ µ l.  In  all  the  rHuKGF-treated  groups, recovery of platelets was accelerated and serum cholesterol was significantly lower. Neutrophil recovery in the group that received rHuGCSF was accelerated. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the other parameters assessed,  including  clinical  observations,  in  life  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry,  and  histology. The rHuKGF-treated groups tended to have a reduced incidence of diarrhoea.

There  was  negligible  placental  transfer  of  palifermin  following  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  1000 µ g/kg  to pregnant  rats,  on  day  19  of  gestation.  One  fetal  serum  sample  at  30  minutes  post-dose  had  a concentration of 0.269 ng/ml, whilst all other fetal serum samples and all amniotic fluid samples were less than the lower LOQ of 0.250 ng/ml (study 970138). There was no evidence of placental transfer of palifermin following a single i.v. dose of 500 µ g/kg to pregnant rabbits, on day 18 of gestation. All fetal serum and amniotic fluid samples were below the LOQ of 0.20 ng/ml (study 970021). No plasma protein binding studies have been conducted.

Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of palifermin has been characterized after single-dose intravenous (i.v.) and/or subcutaneous  (s.c.)  administrations,  and  during  multiple-dose  administrations  to  rats  (i.v  and  s.c.), monkeys (i.v. and s.c.), and mice (i.v.). The pharmacokinetic parameters of palifermin after a single intravenous dose are summarized in Table 7. Methods of analysis An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the measurement of rHuKGF in serum. Validation reports were provided  for the assays in rhesus  monkey, rabbit and human serum. Acceptable data were provided for the assays in rat serum. Absorption-Bioavailability Exposure  to  palifermin  increased  approximately  dose-proportionally  in  rats  (dose  range  of  10 to 3000 µ g/kg; study KGF.114), monkeys (dose range of 30 to 300 µ g/kg; study SBI 950345AM) and mice (dose range of 0.5 to 25 mg/kg; study 101827) after single i.v. administration of palifermin. No accumulation of palifermin was observed in monkeys receiving 7 consecutive daily i.v. doses of 30 or 300 µ g/kg/day or in mice after 3 consecutive daily i.v. doses of 0.5 and 4 mg/kg. Distribution The average volumes of distribution of palifermin in rats, monkeys and mice following a single i.v. dose  were  45,  1050  and  5400  ml/kg,  respectively.  In  mice  and  monkeys,  distribution  exceeds  the plasma volume. Tissue distribution of palifermin was examined after a single i.v. dose of 300 µ g/kg 125 I-rHuKGF to rats (study MPI 529-028).  At 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose, the highest percentages of total radioactivity were found in the liver, skin, carcass, kidney, small intestine, and blood. At 8 hours post-dose, total radioactivity was distributed mainly in skin (22 %), carcass (11%), thyroid (7%) and stomach (6%). At  24  hours  post-dose,  only  skin  (7%),  thyroid  (9%),  and  carcass  (3%)  had  appreciable  levels  of radioactivity. The i.v. administration of 300 µ g/kg 125 I-rHuKGF to rats, in a study comparing the presence of total and acid precipitable radioactivity in serum (study  KGF.165), showed that already  at 8  hours postdose, more than 80% of serum radioactivity was not acid-precipitable, representing free iodide and/or breakdown fragments of palifermin.

## Metabolism

Two  studies  (KGF.265  and  100478)  were  conducted  in  rats  to  evaluate  the  first-pass  hepatic elimination of palifermin. In both studies, palifermin was administered to a group of 4 rats via a  3hour infusion either into the hepatic portal vein or into the femoral vein. Blood samples were collected during the first 9 or 7 hours respectively, after the start of the infusion.

Similar values were obtained when infusion occurred via the femoral or hepatic portal vein for time to peak concentration (2.98 and 3.02 hours respectively) and terminal  half-life (0.547 and 0.549 hours respectively). In study KGF.265, there was a 20% to 30% reduction in Cmax and AUC0-9 in animals infused via the hepatic portal vein compared with the femoral vein. However there was inter-animal variation in the femoral vein group, and the study was stopped in the hepatic portal vein group due to excessive bleeding, making difficult the interpretation of the results. In study 100478, similar Cmax and AUC0-7 values were obtained for the two groups. In vitro metabolism studies have not been conducted. Excretion Average clearance (CL) values were approximately 56, 420, and 2500 ml/hr/kg in rats, monkeys, and mice, respectively. The mean terminal half-life was about 3 hours in rhesus monkeys after single and 7 consecutive daily i.v. administrations of 30 or 300 µ g/kg (study SBA 950345AM). In mice, the terminal half-life values were about 1, 33, 17, and 16 hours after the single doses of 0.5, 4, 15 and 25 mg/kg, respectively. Given that there was no accumulation on repeated dosing and that most of the exposure occurred in the first 8 hours post-dose, the effective half-life of palifermin in mice was considered to be closer to the mean residence time (MRT) of 2-3 hours (the MRT values were 1.68, 3.08, 2.10, and 1.84 hours for the 0.5, 4, 15 and 25 mg/kg dose groups, respectively). The  total  radioactivity  excreted  over  24  hours  in  urine  (including  bladder  contents)  and  faeces (including intestinal contents) of rats was approximately 31% and 2%, respectively, after a single i.v. dose of 300 µ g/kg 125 I-rHuKGF (study MPI 529-028). About  11%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  was  recovered  in  the  urine  as  acid-precipitable radioactivity (composed of intact or smaller acid-precipitable fragments of palifermin) over 24 hours. In bilaterally nephrectomised rats (study KGF.104), exposure to palifermin (AUC) increased about 2fold compared with sham-operated controls. Studies to examine the excretion of palifermin in milk have not been conducted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No mortality  was  observed  at  doses  up  to  30  mg/kg  (i.v.  or  s.c.)  in  rats  or  up  to  50  mg/kg  i.v.  in monkeys. These doses were 500- and 833-times, respectively, the clinical dose (based on mg/kg). The major  finding  in  rats  was  an  enlarged  thymus  (30  mg/kg).  In  monkeys,  reversible  facial  and  skin reddening  were  observed  ( ≥ 10  mg/kg).

Toxicology Palifermin  was  evaluated  single-dose  and  repeat-dose  in  rats  and  Rhesus  monkeys.  In  repeat-dose studies rats were treated up to 28 days, monkeys were treated up to 28 days and within two cycles of three days. Reproductive and developmental studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Other toxicity studies  included  the  assessment  of  genotoxicity,  antigenicity,  hemolysis  and  the  evaluation  of  the potential of palifermin to enhance the growth of epithelial-derived human tumor cells expressing the KGFR in several in vitro and in vivo studies. All  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  with  rHuKGF ∆ 23,  the  same  molecule  used  in  all  clinical studies and intended for marketing. Exposure multiples mentioned are based on systemic exposure observed in hematological transplant patients (n = 23; studies 960189 and 20010182). In these patients, i.v. treatment with 60 µ g/kg/day for 3  consecutive  days  was  associated  with  a  mean  maximal  concentration  of  638.7 ng/ml  and  a  mean AUC of 48.03 ng.h/ml observed after the third dose of palifermin (for these patients, day 3 t ranged from 12 to 24 hours).

In  the  7-day  rat  study  (100148,  WIL-120072),  the  microscopic  changes  in  the  liver  and  pancreas consisted of cytoplasmic basophilia of hepatocytes, hyperplasia in bile duct epithelial cells and ductal hyperplasia in the pancreas. There was no evidence of pancreatitis or pancreatic necrosis that could explain the increases in serum lipase and amylase. In  female  mice,  receiving  i.v.  rHuKGF  once  weekly  for  6  weeks  (study  101623),  the  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was 25 mg/kg/injection. In male and female mice, receiving i.v. rHuKGF on 3 consecutive  days/week  for  6  weeks  (study  100929),  the  MTD  was  5  mg/kg/injection.  Increased stomach  weight  and/or  histological  findings  of  hyperplasia  and  hyperkeratosis  of  the  stomach  were observed. The  28-day  repeated  dose  s.c.  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  (T-95-KGF-001,  MO15-95)  and monkeys (SBL 39-26). Doses were 0, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 µ g/kg/day, with a 28-day recovery period and 0, 1, 10, 30, 100 and 300 µ g/kg/day, respectively. Findings were similar to those observed in the i.v.  studies.  In  the  rat  study,  reversible  dilation  of  the  glandular  mucosal  crypts  was  seen  at  30 µ g/kg/day, so a no observable effect level (NOEL) was not established. In monkeys, the NOEL was 30 µ g/kg/day. Two preliminary studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys using the i.v. (study SBL 39-27-10) or s.c. (study SBL 39-26-10) routes. Doses were 30, 300 and 1000 µ g/kg/day. Reddening of the skin of the face and lower belly including scrotum, acanthosis/hyperkeratosis and were observed. Toxicokinetics An overview of toxicokinetic data from several non-clinical studies was provided. Toxicokinetics data from the pivotal 28-day i.v. repeat-dose toxicity study in rats were not provided.

## Genotoxicity

Although  the  standard  battery  of  genotoxicity  studies  was  not  required  for  palifermin,  since  the development of palifermin was initiated before ICH S6 [29] guideline, palifermin was evaluated in the core  battery  of  mutagenicity  studies  (conducted  in  accordance  with  ICH  S2A  [30]  and  S2B  [31]). Palifermin was negative in in vitro bacterial and  mammalian mutagenicity assays, negative in the in vitro chromosome  aberration  assay,  and  negative  in  the in  vivo mouse  bone  marrow  micronucleus assay.

To evaluate the potential of palifermin to enhance the growth of KGFR-expressing tumors, a series of in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted in accordance with ICH S6 [29]. In vitro cell proliferation studies were used to determine a number of human tumour cell lines from various tumour types that were relatively  sensitive  to  rHuKGF-induced  proliferation.  These  rHuKGF-sensitive  cell  lines  were squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu and Detroit-562 [head and neck cancers]), lung (EKVX), colon (HT29),  prostate  (DU  145  and  22Rv1),  breast  (UISO-BCA-1)  and  were  selected  for  use  in in  vivo xenograft studies.

Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. However, a number of in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to investigate the potential of palifermin to enhance the growth of KGFR-expressing human tumour cells (see other toxicity studies). Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity (with toxicokinetics) In a segment I reproductive toxicity study in rats (25/sex/group), palifermin administered i.v. at doses of  100  to  1000 µ g/kg/day  (study  T-095-KGF-015,  1902-012),  two  weeks  prior  to  mating  and throughout  cohabitation  in  male,  and  1  week  prior  to  mating  and  to  gestational  day  7  in  female, resulted  in  adverse  effects  in  male  and/or  female  reproductive  performance,  offspring  numbers  and viability,  for  doses  higher  than  100 µ g/kg/day.  In  pregnant  rats  (study  970138,  100101),  Cmax  and AUC increased with increasing dose on gestation days 6 and 19 after daily i.v. administrations of 50, 100, 300 and 1000 µ g/kg of palifermin. In  an  embryo-fetal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats  (25/group),  palifermin  administered  i.v.  at doses of 100 to 1000 µ g/kg/day (study 970132, WIL-120056) resulted in mammary gland hyperplasia at all doses, with decreased fetal weight and increased post-implantation loss at the high dose. In  rabbits,  i.v.  administration  at  doses  of  5  to  150 µ g/kg/day  (study  101728,  529-048)  resulted  in increased post-implantation loss, reduced litter size, and reduced fetal body weights at the high dose. In both species, maternal effects were seen at doses producing embryo-fetal toxicity. Toxicokinetics were evaluable and accumulation was seen. In this study, C0 and AUC increased with increasing dose on gestation day 6 and 18 and higher exposure was observed on day 18 compared to day 6 for the 60 and 150 µ g/kg/day dose groups. In pregnant rabbits (study 970021, 97105), antibodies were detected in all drug-treated groups (single i.v. administration at doses of 15 to 500 µ g/kg/day) as early as gestation day 12, with most animals positive by gestation day 18.  The incidence of antibody formation was similar across palifermin dose groups. Studies to assess the prenatal and postnatal toxicity of palifermin have not been conducted. Studies to assess the toxicity of palifermin in offspring (juvenile animals) were not conducted either. Local tolerance A local tolerance study (T-95-KGF-014) was performed in rabbits following administration via i.v., i.m. and s.c. routes. Minimal to mild haemorrhage and cellular infiltration of mainly mononuclear cells and/or  oedema  were  observed  at  48  hours  post-dose,  following  i.v.  or  i.m.  injection.  All  signs  of irritation resolved by 14 days following treatment. Other toxicity studies Haemolytic potential of palifermin was investigated in four in vitro studies using rat, rhesus monkey and/or human blood with formulated rHuKGF and rHuKGF placebo. The formulations tested were not haemolytic in human blood, although they were in rat and rhesus monkey blood. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effects of i.v. treatment with rHuKGF on 3 consecutive days, each week, for 3 to 6 weeks were evaluated in an athymic mouse tumour xenograft model. Based on the results of an i.v. dose rangefinding study in nude mice, doses of 150, 500, 1500, and 4000 µ g/kg/injection were selected for the xenograft studies.

In contrast, rHuKGF did not increase the growth rate of the other 6 tumour types selected from the in vitro studies (Detroit-562, EKVX, HT-29, DU 145, 22Rv1 or UISO-BCA-1 xenografts). The NOEL for  these  cell  lines  (4000 µ g/kg/day)  was  associated  with  an  AUC0-24  (study  101827)  that  was approximately 31 times the clinical AUC0-t. Hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis of the stomach and/or increased stomach weight provided evidence of the pharmacological activity of rHuKGF and therefore of systemic exposure to the drug in these xenograft studies. rHuKGF's effects on clonal growth and expansion of 35 human solid tumor cell lines (including head and neck, lung, stomach, colorectal, breast, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell, kidney, prostate, and  osteosarcoma  cell  lines)  and  22  human  lymphoma  or  leukaemia  cell  lines  (including  nonHodgkin's, Hodgkin's, and myeloma cell lines) has been described in the literature [32]. The growth of 30 of the solid tumours was not significantly modulated by rHuKGF at 0.1 to 100 ng/ml.  Colony growth  of  5  of  the  solid  tumour  cell  lines  (2  lung,  1  stomach,  1  colorectal,  and  1  breast)  was significantly stimulated by rHuKGF by up to 2-fold.  Clonal growth of the 22 human tumour cell lines derived from leukaemias or lymphomas was not influenced by rHuKGF. Several non-responding solid tumour cell lines showed expression of KGFR. In  addition,  the  potential  of  palifermin  to  protect  tumour  cells  against  the  cytotoxic  effects  of chemotherapy or radiation was evaluated in a xenograft model in nude mice and the results published. To  investigate  the  potential  interaction  between  palifermin  treatment  and  5-FU  chemotherapy  with regard  to  tumour  response,  athymic  mice  were  inoculated  with  HT-29  or  FaDu  (human  colon  or human squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, expressing the KGFR) tumour cells [33]. The ability of 5-FU to inhibit tumour growth was not affected by palifermin. The potential effects of palifermin on the in vivo survival and proliferation of radiation-treated tumour cells were studied in two murine mouse models [19]. Female athymic mice were used as recipients for human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts expressing the KGFR (FaDu, Detroit 562, and A431), and female Balb/c mice were used as recipients for mouse melanoma B16 tumors that do not express the receptor  for  KGF.  Mice  were  treated  with  a  dose  of  palifermin  (1000 µ g/kg/day)  that  had  been previously shown to protect intestinal stem cells in vivo . Palifermin neither stimulated the growth of, nor  changed  the  radiation  sensitivity  of  the  KGFR-expressing  human  tumour  xenografts  or  the KGFR-negative mouse melanoma grafts. Antigenicity Passive or active immunisation with palifermin produced an expected anaphylactic response in guinea pigs,  while  a  weak  response  was observed in one rat  passively sensitised  with  mouse sera (actively sensitised with palifermin in presence of adjuvant). Studies  to  assess  dependence,  metabolites  or  impurities  toxicity, as  well  as  immunotoxicity  studies have not been conducted. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment was provided. Patients would be expected to metabolise palifermin fully and excretion of intact, biologically active protein was considered to be negligible. Breakdown products  are  also  not  considered  to  remain  in  the  environment  for  any  length  of  time  given  their susceptibility  to  degradation  by  many  environmental  microflora.  For  these  reasons,  exposure  to concentrations of palifermin in the environment is not expected to pose an environmental concern. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment with rHuKGF at doses of 1500 and 4000 µ g/kg/day significantly increased the growth rate of FaDu xenografts. The NOEL dose of 500 µ g/kg/day for the FaDu xenograft study was associated with an AUC0-24 (study 101827) that was approximately 4.3 times the clinical AUC0-t.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Non-clinical reports and bibliographic references, a  comprehensive  factual synopsis of  findings and the  implications  for  the  safe  use  of  palifermin  have  been  provided  following  agreed  Common Technical Document recommendations [34].

Pharmacodynamics Palifermin is a truncated form of the endogenous human KGF, produced in E. coli . The truncated nonglycosylated protein was demonstrated to be comparable to the endogenous protein in terms of activity at the  KGFR. Epithelial protection by exogenously administered rHuKGF has been demonstrated in appropriate  animal  models  of  gastrointestinal  injury  induced  by  radiation  or  chemotherapy,  oral mucosal  toxicity  induced  by  radiation  or  chemoradiotherapy,  and  acute  and  chronic  salivary  gland toxicity  (xerostomia)  induced  by  radiation.  However,  when  palifermin  treatment  was  delayed  until radiation-induced ulcers were manifest, the duration of ulceration was  slightly prolonged  in palifermin-treated  mice  compared  with  mice  that  received  placebo  [35].  A  lack  of  protection  was observed when palifermin was given on the same day as the cytotoxic insult. From a theoretical point of  view,  it  is  conceivable  that  growth  factor  activation  of  epithelial  cells  at  a  time  point  close  to  a cytotoxic  insult  would  actually  increase  the  number  of  cells  being  affected  by  cytotoxicity,  thus worsening the mucositis (see clinical study 980231). Different schedules  have been investigated and  generally, pre- and pre-post radiation/chemotherapy treatment with rHuKGF appeared to be more successful than post-injury administration. However, it was not clear how the schedules or doses for investigation were chosen and the route of administration was generally  subcutaneous  rather  than  the  intended  clinical  i.v.  route.  Although  data  suggested  a positive effect of palifermin treatment after irradiation, there was no non-clinical evidence for the prepost  treatment  protocol being  superior  to  the  pre-only  treatment  protocol.  The  issue  was  discussed further,  and  was  considered  resolved  from  the  non-clinical  perspective.  The  non-clinical  data  were used as a guide for the schedule and timing of doses in the clinical studies. In order to investigate whether the administration of palifermin prior to the administration of S-phase specific  drugs,  such  as  ara-C,  might  increase  the  toxicity  of  these  drugs  as  regards  KGF  receptor positive  normal  tissues,  the  kinetics  of  epithelial  cell  proliferation  has  been  studied  in  mice,  using BrdU incorporation as a measure of S-phase . Such measurements could not be performed in humans, as  the  data  available  on  the  kinetics  of  epithelial  cell  proliferation  in  humans  after  palifermin administration  were  limited  to  Ki67  staining,  which  is  not  specific  to  S-phase.  BrdU-labeling  data demonstrate proliferation of the entire gastrointestinal epithelium, including the oral mucosa. The data provided in mice showed that dosing with chemotherapy agents within 24 hours after a single injection of palifermin could be deleterious because it would affect the cells in S-phase. However, dosing within 24 hours after a series of 3 injections of palifermin given over a 3-day period would not be deleterious because  it  occurred  past  the  peak  of  S-phase  cell  proliferation  induced  by  palifermin  on  epithelial cells.  As  a  consequence, a warning  has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC to recommend that palifermin  is  not  administered  within 24  hours before,  during  infusion  of,  or  within  24  hours  after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Secondary pharmacodynamics studies investigated other animal models to demonstrate that palifermin has activity in ameliorating epithelial damage in a wider range of conditions. Pharmacological effects of  palifermin  were  evident  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  of  mice  and  rats  receiving  radiation  therapy and/or chemotherapeutic agents. In some studies, survival was improved, as well as the preservation of the  intestinal  epithelial  morphology.  Dextran  sodium  sulfate  (DSS)  and  CD45RB  models  of inflammatory bowel disease demonstrated palifermin had a positive effect in ameliorating symptoms and histological lesions.

Safety pharmacology studies have investigated the effects of rHuKGF on general behaviour, the CNS, autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems. Recombinant HuKGF administered i.v. at doses of 0.5, 5.0 and 50  mg/kg to  mice,  rats  or Rhesus monkeys had no effect on any of these systems. Renal effects were not considered clinically relevant due to the absence  of  a  clear  dose response and the  absence  of significant changes in total urinary excretion of electrolytes. In vitro, concentrations of 5 x10 -5 g/ml, 5  x 10 -6 g/ml and 5 x 10 -7 g/ml had no effect on spontaneous or induced contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum.

In  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies,  in  which  mice  were  treated  with  5-FU  or  rhesus monkeys were irradiated and then transplanted with bone marrow, rHuKGF pre-treatment reduced the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effects of 5-FU in mice relative to controls either with or without GCSF, and in rhesus monkeys, the neutrophil recovery in groups that received GCSF was accelerated. GCSF is likely to be used in the indicated patient population. These finding showed that rHuKGF  did not adversely affect haematological recovery and the absence of negative interactions between rHuKGF and rHuGCSF. No other in vivo drug interaction studies have been conducted.

Pharmacokinetics The increase in  exposure  of palifermin was  approximately  dose-proportional  following  a single i.v. dose in mice, rats and monkeys. Average clearance (CL) values were approximately 56, 420, and 2500 ml/hr/kg in rats, monkeys, and mice, respectively, and the effective half-life (t1/2) ranged  from approximately 1 to 4 hours in the 3 species. Large volumes of distribution were observed in mice (5400 ml/kg) and monkeys (1050 ml/kg) after i.v administration, indicating extravascular distribution of palifermin. This was also the case in humans, where the Vss was about 2000 ml/kg in healthy volunteers. A lower volume of distribution was  observed  in  rats  (45  ml/kg)  compared  with  other  toxicology  species  and  humans.  However, pharmacology and toxicology studies in rat showed evidence for a pharmacological response with a clear dose response pattern. There were no signs of toxicity events not related to the pharmacology of palifermin (see Toxicology). Palifermin did not accumulate after 3 consecutive daily doses to mice and 7 consecutive daily doses to rhesus monkeys in pharmacokinetic studies, nor in 3-day and 11-day (intermittent) toxicology studies conducted in monkeys, nor in an embryo/fetal developmental toxicology study in rats. Accumulation is  not  expected  as  the  half-life  of  palifermin  was  relatively  short  in  the  animal  species  (see Toxicokinetics), but increased exposure after multiple dosing was observed  in some  of  the toxicological studies. This observation coincided with the presence of anti-palifermin antibodies. In  rats  following  i.v.  administration  of 125 I-rHuKGF,  liver,  skin,  carcass,  kidney,  small  intestines, blood, stomach, and thyroid contained the highest percentage of total radioactivity. Placental  transfer  of  rHuKGF  in  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits  was  negligible,  with  fetal  serum  and amniotic  fluid  levels  below  the  limit  of  quantification  of  the  assays.  This  suggested  that  only negligible amounts of rHuKGF crossed the placenta. No studies have been conducted to examine the excretion of palifermin in milk. The SPC states that palifermin should not be administered to women who are breast-feeding (see SPC, section 4.6). Plasma protein binding studies have not been conducted. As KGF is a heparin binding protein, which also interacts with heparin sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) that are present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, rHuKGF could also interact with heparin and HSPG. However, as heparin did not interfere  with  the  ELISA  for rHuKGF in  human serum, the  absence  of protein binding studies  was considered  acceptable.  A  statement  was  included  in  the  SPC  to  ensure  that  i.v.  lines  that  are maintained  with  heparin  are  rinsed  with  sodium  chloride  solution  prior  to  and  after  palifermin administration, since palifermin has been shown to bind to heparin in vitro (see discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics and SPC, section 6.2: Incompatibilities). The absence of conventional  metabolism studies  was  considered acceptable  for such  compounds as they would be expected to be broken down into small peptides and amino acids. Comparison of total radioactivity, acid-precipitable radioactivity and rHuKGF concentrations suggest that  palifermin  undergoes  substantial  metabolism,  particularly  after  subcutaneous  administration (possibly pre-systemically at the injection site). Exposure in rats was similar  whether rHuKGF  was administered via the  femoral  or  hepatic  veins  so  the  hepatic  route  was  not  considered  as  a  major pathway of elimination in rats. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Palifermin was predominantly eliminated via the renal route in rats, as shown in the distribution and excretion  studies  conducted  with 125 I-rHuKGF.  This  was  supported  by  the  increased  exposure  to palifermin seen in bilaterally nephrectomised rats, as well as the low hepatic extraction. Other organs may  participate  in  the  elimination  of  palifermin  through  its  binding  to  the  KGF  receptor  and internalisation/breakdown within epithelial cells.

Pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  studies  have  not  been  conducted.  Some  of  the  non-clinical pharmacology studies have involved administration of chemotherapeutic agents as well as rHuKGF to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

model  the  clinical  situation,  but  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  data  can  only  be  obtained clinically.

Given the documentation and justifications provided, the  non-clinical pharmacokinetic requirements were considered fulfilled.

Toxicology Toxicology studies were conducted in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and monkeys. The two species selected for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, rats and monkeys, were deemed appropriate for investigating the non-clinical safety of palifermin as they were responsive to the biological actions of rHuKGF, i.e. widespread epithelial proliferation was seen in both species.  Adequate presentation of the  results  and  conclusions  have  been  provided,  in  agreement  with  applicable  requirements  and guidelines [21, 36, 37]. Safety margins  were  calculated  based  on  the  highest  intended  clinical  dose  of  60 µ g/kg/day administered i.v. daily for 3 consecutive days.  However, in most of the toxicology studies, a NOEL could not be identified due to the pharmacological effects of palifermin being observed in all treated groups. In single-dose toxicity studies, no mortality was observed in rats at doses up to 30 000 µ g/kg (i.v  or  s.c)  or  in  rhesus  monkeys  at  doses  up  to  50  000 µ g/kg  (i.v).  Based  on  administered  dose (mg/kg), these doses are 500- and 833-times the clinical doses of 60 µg/kg/day, respectively. In the 28-day i.v. monkey study, a NOEL was established (1 µg/kg/day), but systemic exposure at this dose could not be calculated as rHuKGF levels were generally lower than the limit of quantification in the samples taken. At the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL of 100 µg/kg/day), at which there was no overt toxicity or irreversible changes in the 28-day monkey i.v. study, the systemic exposure was 8 times the clinical exposure. In the 11-day intermittent i.v. monkey study, exposure at 500 µg/kg/day (at which there was no overt toxicity) was 15 times the clinical exposure. Generally the effects observed in the repeated-dose studies were attributable to the pharmacological activity  of  rHuKGF  and  were  reversible.  These  effects  of  KGF,  which  include  the  epithelial proliferation  of  skin,  GI  tract,  mammary  gland  ducts,  bladder  urothelium  and  pancreatic  ducts  and hepatocyte proliferation in the liver have also been reported in published literature. The thymic gland lymphoid depletion and/or involution seen in rats and monkeys, and increases in the number and size of  thyroid  particles  seen  in  rats  were  discussed.  The  thyroid  changes  in  rats  were  not  reversible. Thymic involution may have been stress-related and was reversible. Reports in the literature suggest that  rHuKGF  preserves  normal  thymopoiesis  and  thymic  microenvironments  during  experimental graft-versus-host  disease  in  mice  [38]  and  plays  a  role  in  the  development  and  function  of  thymic epithelium [39]. The thymus was enlarged and increased in weight in the acute rat i.v. and s.c. studies at  a  rHuKGF  dose  of  30  000 µ g/kg.  KGF  has  been  shown  to  contribute  to  the  growth  of  artificial human thyroid tissues in vitro [40]. The cornea expresses the KGFR, but no ophthalmic effects were seen in the toxicology studies either on ophthalmological examination or on histopathological evaluations of the eye in rats or monkeys. From toxicokinetic evaluations, dose-related increases in exposure have been shown in pregnant rats and rabbits. Accumulation of palifermin has been observed on gestational day 18 in the mid- and highdose groups in rabbits. Antibodies against rHuKGF were detected in the rat (28-day s.c.), monkey (28day  i.v.)  and  pregnant  rabbit  (single  i.v.  administration).  These  observations  suggest  that  the antibodies reduced clearance, sustaining rHuKGF concentrations in the body. The range and type of genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for small molecules are not applicable to  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals,  and  therefore,  these  were  not  deemed  necessary  for  this assessment, in agreement with applicable guidelines [29].  However,  the standard battery of genotoxicity tests [30, 31] have been conducted. As expected, rHuKGF was negative in these studies. Given  the intended patient population and  the short-term clinical treatment regimen, rodent carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  deemed  appropriate  [29],  and  therefore,  were  not  conducted  with palifermin. The absence of long-term carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The potential  of  rHuKGF  to  enhance  the  growth  of  KGFR-expressing  tumours was  investigated  In accordance  with  ICH  S6.  Solid  tumours  of  epithelial  origin  may  express  the  KGFR,  therefore, administration  of pharmacological doses  of  rHuKGF for the treatment  of  mucositis in patients  with solid  tumours  could  theoretically  produce  adverse  tumour  outcomes  (enhanced  growth  and/or protection from cytotoxic therapies). Haematological malignancies, the indication for this application, do  not  express  the  KGFR  and  rHuKGF  would  not  be  expected  to  have  any  such  effect  on  them.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  and/or  radiotherapy  for  haematological  or  solid malignancies  have  been  shown  to  develop  secondary  tumours  as  a  result  of  the  cytotoxic  therapy, which may be haematological (typically associated with chemotherapy) or solid (typically associated with radiotherapy), despite the nature of the original tumour. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies was performed to address these  concerns. Recombinant HuKGF increased the proliferation of some cancer cells in vitro that expressed KGFR, but did not enhance proliferation of cell lines derived from haematological malignancies that do not express the KGFR. Seven human tumour cell lines that were sensitive to rHuKGF-induced proliferation (including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, lung, colon, prostate and breast) were investigated in xenograft models in athymic nude mice. Five of these seven cell lines had been shown previously to express KGFR mRNA. It is assumed that the other two cell  lines  also  expressed  mRNA  but  that  the  analytical  methods  employed  were  not  sufficiently sensitive to detect it.

Intermittent  treatment  (3  consecutive  days/week  for  4  to  6  weeks)  with  rHuKGF  had  no  effect  on tumour growth in six of the seven xenograft models in athymic nude mice, although it increased the growth rate of the other (FaDu, squamous cell carcinoma) tumour type. Therefore in vitro proliferation does not necessarily correspond with in vivo proliferation in this model. There are two references in the published literature that have investigated the potential of rHuKGF to alter  the  sensitivity  of  tumour  cells  to  chemotherapy  (5-FU)  or  radiotherapy  (fractionated  radiation) [19, 33]. Under the conditions of these studies, rHuKGF neither stimulated the growth of, nor changed the sensitivity of the KGFR-expressing human tumour cells xenografts to radiation or chemotherapy. Given the results with the FaDu xenograft, a hypothetical risk of tumour stimulation in patients with tumours  expressing  the  KGFR  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Human  haematological  malignancies  do  not express the KGFR. However as patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy/radiation therapy have an increased risk of secondary malignancies (either haematological or solid in origin), the theoretical potential of rHuKGF to enhance the growth of secondary solid tumours needs to be considered (see SPC  section  5.3).  The  possibility  of  expression  of  KGFR  on  haematological  tumours,  or  their induction  by  pathological  situations  has  been  discussed.  Although  complete  reassurance  is  not possible, the available evidence suggests that KGFR is not present on 22 haematological tumour cell lines. Pathological situations such as inflammation would be unlikely to induce KGFR in cells that do not  normally  express  them.  This  will  be  investigated in  vitro ,  post-authorisation  by  incubating haematopoietic cell lines with a panel of inflammatory cytokines and analysing KGFR expression at different time points. In  a  fertility/general  reproductive  toxicity  study  conducted  in  rats  (100,  300,  or  1000 µ g/kg/day), mating and fertility were unaffected at 100 µ g/kg/day.  At higher doses ( ≥ 300 µ g/kg/day), palifermin treatment was associated  with adverse effects  on  male and/or  female reproductive performance and offspring numbers and viability. However, these effects were not selective, as clinical signs of toxicity were also observed in all groups (e.g. clinical observations and/or body weight effects).  The 300 and 1000 µ g/kg/day  doses  were  associated  with  AUC  values  that  were  approximately  9.7  and  27  time, respectively,  the  clinical  AUC0-t.  The  NOAEL  (100 µ g/kg/day)  for  mating/fertility  effects  was associated with an AUC that was approximately 2.5 times the clinical AUC0-t. In  i.v.  embryo/fetal  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits,  palifermin  treatment  was associated  with  developmental  toxicity  (increased  post-implantation  loss,  reduced  litter  size,  and/or reduced fetal weight) at doses of 1000 and 150 µ g/kg/day, respectively. These doses were associated with  systemic  exposures  (based  on  AUC)  that  were  greater  than  or  equal  to  15  time  (based  on extrapolated AUC)  and  4.2  times,  respectively,  the  anticipated  clinical  exposure.  Because  the developmental effects in these studies were seen only concomitantly with maternal effects, rHUKGF did not appear to be a selective developmental toxicant in rats. No adverse developmental effects were observed  in  rats  and  rabbits  at  doses  of  up  to  300  and  60 µ g  /kg/day,  respectively.  These  NOAEL doses were associated with systemic exposures (based on AUC) up to 9.7 and 2.1 times, respectively, the  anticipated  clinical  exposure.  Peri-  and  postnatal  development  has  not  been  studied.  Adequate information  and  warnings  are  provided  in  the  SPC  (Section  4.6  and  5.3).

A local tolerance study was performed in rabbits via the i.v., i.m. and s.c. routes. Signs of irritation were observed at 48 hours post-dose following i.v. or i.m. injection. These signs were typical of those

following injection of recombinant protein, and reversed 14 days after treatment. It is recommended, in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC,  that  palifermin  is  not  administered  subcutaneously  due  to  poor  local tolerability.

The haemolytic potential of various formulations of rHuKGF was investigated and generally appeared non-haemolytic in human blood but haemolytic in animal blood.

Palifermin  treatment  should  be  supervised  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  use  of  anticancer therapies  (see  section  4.2  of  the  SPC).  The  recommended  dose  of  palifermin  is  60 µ g/kg/day, administered as an intravenous bolus injection for three consecutive days before and three consecutive days  after  myelotoxic therapy  for  a total  of six  doses. The  first  three  doses  should  be  administered prior  to  myelotoxic therapy,  with the third dose 24 to 48 hours before  myelotoxic therapy. The last three  doses  should  be  administered  post  myelotoxic  therapy;  the  first  of  these  doses  should  be

Antigenicity studies are considered of little value for protein products as they are generally positive and  not  considered  predictive  of  antibody  formation  in  humans  (ICH  S6).  However,  as  the development of palifermin was initiated prior to availability of the ICH S6 guideline, an antigenicity study was performed in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.  The expected anaphylactic response was seen in guinea  pigs,  while  a  weak  response  was  observed  in  one rat  passively  sensitized  with  mouse  sera (actively sensitized with palifermin in the presence of adjuvant). Palifermin was considered unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects Introduction Based on the information provided, all trials were conducted according to the principles of GCP. One  pivotal  phase  III  and  one  phase  II  randomized,  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled studies  were performed in patients  with  hematologic malignancies  undergoing  fractionated TBI and high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant (PBPC) support. A total of 375 patients,  receiving  60 µ g/kg  of  palifermin  for  3  consecutive  days  before  conditioning  and  3 consecutive  days  after  PBSCT,  were  enrolled  (see  table  8).  Supportive  studies  included  a  phase  I, open-label, uncontrolled, single-center, pharmacokinetic study. This was performed in 13 patients with hematologic malignancies, receiving the same myelotoxic therapy and the same dose and schedule of palifermin.  Two  other  studies  were  performed  in  patients  receiving  fractionated  radiotherapy  with concomitant chemotherapy or cyclic chemotherapy treatment for solid tumors.

administered after, but on the same  day  of  haematopoietic stem  cell infusion  and at least  four  days after the most recent palifermin administration (see SPC section 4.2).

A  paediatric  development  programme  was  at  an  early  stage  at  the  time  of  the  application  with  a protocol being planned. No further information was included in the application.

Pharmacology /square4 Analytical methods In  all  of  the  studies  mentioned  above,  pharmacokinetic  assessments  were  conducted  using  frequent serial  sampling.  A  validated  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  was  used  to  quantify palifermin concentrations in human serum. /square4 Pharmacokinetics Six studies,  investigating  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  palifermin  were  conducted  in  healthy volunteers  (studies  950170,  960136,  970136,  970276,  970290  and  20010192)  and  2 studies  were conducted in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving high-dose cytotoxic therapy followed by PBPCT (studies 20010182 and 960189). /square4 Absorption - Bioavailability Palifermin is intended for intravenous administration, and absorption studies are not relevant. The site and scale of manufacture for the active substance and medicinal product has been changed during  development  (see  3.2  Quality  aspects).  The  proposed  commercial  material  was  considered comparable to the clinical material and therefore, additional non-clinical or clinical studies were not considered necessary. /square4 Distribution The distribution of palifermin has been investigated after a single i.v. dose of 60 µg/kg/day to healthy volunteers  (study  20010192)  and  to  patients  with  hematologic  malignancies  (study  960189  and 20010182). Palifermin had a volume of distribution of about 2 l/kg in healthy volunteers and 4-5 l/kg in patients. After administration, plasma concentrations rapidly declined during the first 30 minutes. A slight increase or plateau in concentrations was then observed at approximately 1 to 4 hours post-dose, followed by a terminal decline phase. The plasma  concentration  time  profile  was  in  several  studies  modelled  using  a  three-compartment model with a lag time for the redistribution from compartment 3 to the central compartment (plasma). The redistribution lag-time was estimated between 3 and 5 hours. Plasma protein binding of palifermin has not been studied. /square4 Elimination After  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  60  µg/kg  to  healthy  volunteers  (study  20010192)  and  patients  with hematologic  malignancies  (studies  960189  and  20010182),  palifermin  clearance  was  about  500 ml/h/kg in healthy volunteers and 2-3-fold higher in patients. Terminal half-life was about 4 to 5 hours in both healthy volunteers and patients. In vitro studies to assess the metabolism of palifermin have not been performed. Non-clinical studies revealed low hepatic extraction of palifermin. /square4 Dose proportionality and time dependency Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers Medicinal product no longer authorised

A phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, single  center study (study 950170)  evaluated  the  safety,  tolerability,  PK/PD  of  single  and  multiple  s.c.  doses  of  palifermin administered  to  healthy  volunteers.  Because  of  the  number  of  subjects  who  reported  injection-site

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reactions, the study was closed early after the completion of 3 of the 7 planned single-dose cohorts (1.0, 10, and 30 µ g/kg/day) and 2 of the 7 planned multiple-dose cohorts (1.0 and 10 µ g/kg/day).

A  randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (study 960136) evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK/PD of palifermin administered i.v. to healthy volunteers. Palifermin was administered in sequentially enrolling dose cohorts of 0.2, 1.0, 5.0, 10, and 20 µg/kg/day either as a single bolus i.v. injection or as a daily bolus i.v. injection for 3 consecutive days. In the single-dose cohorts, subjects were to be  randomized in  a 3:1 ratio to  receive palifermin  or placebo  on study  day 1.  All subjects received  a  buccal  mucosal  biopsy  at  baseline  and  at  46  to  50  hours  after  administration  of investigational product (day 3). In the multiple-dose cohorts, subjects were to be randomized in a 6:2 ratio to receive palifermin or placebo on day 1, 2, and 3. All subjects received a buccal mucosal biopsy at baseline and at 18 to 24 hours after the last administration of investigational product (day 4). Sixty-one subjects  were  enrolled (15 placebo, 46 palifermin).  Most subjects  were  white (70%), and

Serum palifermin  concentrations  declined rapidly  within the first 30  minutes after administration at both dose levels. This decline was followed by an increase or plateau in concentration between 1.5and 4-hours postdose. A consistent decline in concentration was observed beyond 6-hours postdose. Palifermin exhibited an approximately dose-proportional increase in AUC in the dose range of 20 to 40 µg/kg/day, and did not accumulate after 3 daily doses. An average of approximately 98% of the exposure,  as  measured  by  AUC,  occurred  in  the  first  24  hours  postdose.  The  mean  t‰,z   was approximately 3.5 hours  for both  dose  cohorts  on day  1. A longer t‰,z was  observed  on  day 3 after injection of the 40-µg/kg dose. The average range of values for mean residence time ranged from 2.6 to  4.7  hours  for  both  cohorts  on  the  2  assessment  days,  suggesting  that  the  effective  half-life  of palifermin was in this range of values.

most were men (57%); subjects were 18 to 45 years of age. The full pharmacokinetic profiles could not be characterised for subjects who received 0.2-, 1.0-, and 5.0µ g/kg  palifermin  because  many  of  the  concentration  values  were  below  the  detection  limit. Palifermin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics after single i.v. administration of 10 and 20 µ g/kg. No accumulation of palifermin was observed after 3 consecutive daily administrations of 10 and 20 µ g/kg. Half-life values of 3 to 5 hours were estimated at the 20µ g/kg dose. Mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) values were greater than total body water), indicating extravascular distribution of palifermin [41]. Between-subject variability (CV%) was 14% for clearance and 60% for Vss after a single i.v. administration of 20µ g/kg palifermin. A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  (AMJ-9701),  in  which  sequentially  enrolled dose cohorts of healthy volunteers received a single i.v. dose of 5, 10, or 20 µg/kg of palifermin or placebo, assessed the tolerability and PK of palifermin. Eight subjects were to be enrolled into each of the 3 cohorts and were randomized in a 6:2 ratio to receive injection  of palifermin or placebo, respectively. Japanese  men  were  enrolled (6 placebo, 18 palifermin) and completed the study. Subjects were 20 to 35 years of age. Serum palifermin  concentrations  declined rapidly  within the  first 30 minutes after administration  of palifermin  at  all  dose  levels.  This  decline  was  followed  by  an  increase  or  plateau  in  concentration between 1.5 to 6 hours post-dose. After 6 hours, a consistent decline in concentration was observed. Exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner between the 5- and 20µ g/kg dose cohorts. The half-life values associated with the terminal phase (t‰,z) ranged from 2.40 to 4.67 hours. Mean Vss values were greater than total body water. The CV% ranged from 19% to 26% for clearance and from 35% to 44% for Vss after a single administration of 10 and 20 µ g/kg doses. A  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation  study  (970276) evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK/PD of palifermin administered i.v. to healthy subjects. Palifermin was  administered  in  sequentially  enrolling  dose  cohorts  of  20  and  40µg/kg,  once  daily  for  3 consecutive days. Dose escalations were to begin no earlier than day 21 of the previous lower dose cohort. Nine subjects were planned for each cohort and were to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive palifermin or placebo (6 palifermin, 3 placebo). Eighteen subjects were enrolled and 17 completed the study. Most subjects were white (78%), and 50% of subjects were men; subjects were 18 to 63 years of age. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Similar mean CL values were observed between the dose groups. Mean Vss values were greater than total body water. The CV% ranged from 28% to 33% for CL and from 34% to 37% for Vss after the first administration of palifermin.

A randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  (20010192)  evaluated  the  safety,  tolerability, PK and PD of escalating single doses of palifermin administered i.v. to healthy subjects. Palifermin was administered in sequentially enrolling dose cohorts of 60, 120, 160, 210, and 250 µg/kg. Subjects were  randomized  in  a  4:1:4:1  ratio  to  receive  palifermin  and  buccal  mucosal  biopsy  at  48  hours, palifermin and biopsy at 72 hours, placebo and biopsy at 48 hours, or placebo and biopsy at 72 hours. Seventy-nine subjects received placebo or palifermin (16 placebo, 63 palifermin). Most subjects were white  (76%),  and  most  were  men  (96%);  subjects  were  18  to  53  years  of  age.  Serum  palifermin concentrations declined rapidly within the first 30 minutes after i.v. administration of palifermin at all dose levels. This decline was followed by an increase or plateau in concentration between 1.5 and 4 hours postdose. After 6 hours postdose, a consistent decline in concentration was observed over the remainder of the sampling time. Serum concentrations of palifermin increased with increased dose. On average, exposure to palifermin increased approximately 3-fold for the 4-fold increase in dose administered (60 µ g/kg to 250 µ g/kg). Mean CL and Vss values (CV% [25%-36%] and [46%-69%], respectively) did not vary substantially over the examined dose range, indicating approximately linear pharmacokinetics. On average, most (&gt; 95%)  of  the  AUC0-∞ occurred  in  the  first  24  hours  postdose.  Mean  t‰,z   values  ranged  from approximately 4 to 6 hours across the dose levels evaluated. The CV% ranged from 25% to 36% for CL and from 46% to 69% for Vss. Pharmacokinetics in patients Part A of an open-label, single-center study (20010182) characterised the PK profile of 60 µg/kg/day palifermin administered i.v. for 3 consecutive days before TBI/high-dose chemotherapy conditioning treatment (study days -11, -10, and -9) and for 3 consecutive days after PBPC transplantation (study days 0, 1, and 2). The conditioning therapy consisted of fractionated TBI for a total dose of 12 Gy in 8 fractions  over  4  days,  followed  by  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide. Filgrastim (5 mg/kg/day) was administered daily from day 0 after PBPC transplantation  until absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  recovery  was  achieved  (ANC  &gt;  1.0  x 109/l for 3 consecutive days, ANC &gt; 10.0 x 109/l for 1 day, or day 21, whichever occurred first). Palifermin  concentrations  declined  rapidly  (a  98%  decrease  on  average)  in  the  first  30-minutes postdose on all assessment days. After this rapid decline, a slight increase or plateau in concentrations occurred  at  approximately  1-  to  4-hours  postdose,  followed  by  a  terminal  decline  phase.  No accumulation  of  palifermin,  as  measured  by  AUC  from  time  zero  to  24  hours  after  administration (AUC0-24), was observed upon 3 consecutive daily doses of 60 µ g/kg (Table 9). Mean AUC0-t values were  comparable  between  doses  1  and  3  (last  dose  before  chemo-  and  radiotherapy)  and  between doses 1  and 4 (first dose after  chemo- and  radiotherapy). The  mean  AUC0-t value after  dose 6  was approximately  40%  to  46%  lower,  on  average, than  that after  dose  3  (last  dose  before  chemo-  and radiotherapy) and dose 4 (first dose after chemo-radiotherapy), respectively.

Notes: clearance and Vss were reported only after the first dose administration during the 3-day multiple dosing regimen. A  phase  I/II  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose-escalation  study  (960189)  was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of palifermin in patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous PBPC transplantation (PBSCT). Patients received from 5- to 80µ g/kg/day palifermin or placebo for 3 days before high-dose chemotherapy,  or  for  3  days  before  and  3  days  after  high-dose  chemotherapy  as  a  conditioning regimen for PBSCT. The pharmacokinetic properties  of  palifermin  were  characterized  after  the  first  (day  -11)  and  third (day -9) doses for the cohort who received 60µ g/kg/day for 3 days before and for 3 days after highdose chemotherapy. Nineteen subjects were enrolled into this cohort (4 placebo, 15 palifermin). Most subjects were white (95%), and most were men (73%); subjects were 22 to 67 years of age. Most  of  the exposure  to palifermin  occurred within  the first 12to 24-hours  postdose.  No accumulation of palifermin  was  observed  during the  multiple-dosing regimen;  mean AUC0-t values were similar (&lt; 20% change) after the first and third dose. Mean t‰,z  was approximately 4 hours, and was similar to MRT. The CV% was 47% for CL, 62% for Vss, and 50% for AUC0-t after the first dose. Special populations Impaired renal function An open-label, single-dose study (20030142) was conducted to assess the PK of palifermin after i.v. administration  in  subjects  with  various degrees  of  renal  function.  Subjects were  selected  for participation based upon level of renal function. Groups were established as follows: - Group 1 (normal renal function, creatinine clearance [CLcr] &gt; 80 ml/min) - Group 2 (mild chronic kidney disease, CLcr: 50 to 80 ml/min) - Group 3 (moderate chronic kidney disease, CLcr: 30 to 49 ml/min) - Group 4 (severe chronic kidney disease, CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min) - Group 5 (subjects with end-stage renal disease, receiving hemodialysis) All subjects received a single i.v. dose of 90 µ g/kg on day 1. Thirty-one subjects, from 20 to 77 years old, were enrolled and received palifermin. The majority were men (81%), white (94%). The difference in mean clearance for groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 relative to group 1 was less than 25% (mean [SD] CL values were 495 [119], 387 [118], 318 [39], 365 [119] and 406 [98] ml/hr/kg, respectively), with one subject excluded from group 4 due to substantially different PK parameter values.

## Impaired liver function

Studies assessing the pharmacokinetic profile of palifermin in patients with hepatic impaired function have not been performed.

Effect of demographic variables The  effect  of  gender,  race,  weight  and  age  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  palifermin  was  examined graphically  using  a  combined  dataset  from  studies  performed  in  healthy  volunteers,  and  a  second combined dataset from studies performed in patients with hematologic malignancies.  In addition, an analysis  of  the  effect  of  race  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  palifermin  was  conducted  using  a  dataset from the healthy volunteer studies combined with data from study 970136 (Japan). CL  and  Vss  were  similar  between  male  and  female,  or  between  Caucasian,  Black  and  Hispanic populations.  The overall mean  (SD)  CL  values for men  and women  were  588  (244) and 653 (248) ml/hr/kg, respectively.  Mean (SD) Vss values  for  men and women  were 1959 (1086) and 2016 (1332) ml/kg,  respectively.  The  mean  CL  was  approximately  50%  higher  in  Asian  subjects (953 ml/hr/kg) compared with White subjects (629 ml/hr/kg). Weight did not affect the pharmacokinetics of palifermin. No PK data were available in children, nor in patients above the age of 70. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies Specific drug interaction studies between palifermin and other drugs have not been performed. Discussion on pharmacokinetics Data  from  five  randomised,  double-blind  and  placebo-controlled  studies  have  been  provided  from healthy volunteers. However these included mostly young, white men and were thus not representative of the patient population, particularly in terms of age. The dose and schedule of palifermin evaluated in the target population were chosen for consistency with the pivotal phase III study. Palifermin  exhibited  linear  pharmacokinetics  in  the  dose  range  of  10 µ g  to  250 µ g.  Palifermin  has  a large volume of distribution (approximately 2 l/kg in healthy volunteers and 4-5 l/Kg in patients) and the  distribution  was  rapid.  The  Vss  was  greater  than  the  total  body  water  implying  extravascular distribution after i.v.  administration. After i.v. administration, plasma  concentrations rapidly decline during  the  first  30  minutes.  After  this  rapid  decline,  a  slight  increase  or  plateau  in  concentrations occurred at approximately 1-4 hours post-dose, followed by a terminal decline phase. This transient increase in concentration might have been related to redistribution of palifermin out of the tissues. The average  terminal  half  life was  similar  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  haematalogical malignancies (approximately  4.5 hours) and  no accumulation  of palifermin occurred after 3 consecutive  doses in both groups (20 and 40 µ g/kg in healthy  volunteers and 60 µ g/kg in patients). Nevertheless,  inter-subject  variability  of  approximately  69%  was  observed  in  CL  and  Vss  in  both healthy volunteers and patients. Palifermin clearance was about 500 ml/h/kg in healthy volunteers and 2-3-fold  higher in patients (mean  clearance  of about  1300 ml/h/kg). Given the size of the  molecule (140 amino acids, 16.3 kD), filtration in the kidney with subsequent catabolism in the renal cells may contribute  to  the  elimination.  Time  dependency  in  the  pharmacokinetics  was  observed  with,  on average, a 40% to 46% lower AUC after dose 6 than that after dose 3 (last dose before chemo- and radiotherapy) and dose 4 (first dose after chemo-radiotherapy), respectively. The higher CL and Vss observed  in  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  and  the  lower  AUC  of  palifermin  observed after  repeated  dosing  with  cytotoxic  agents  have  been  discussed.  Internalization  of  the  KGF/KGF receptor (KGFR) complex has been demonstrated in vitro in cell systems expressing the KGF receptor [42,  43].  Therefore,  clearance of  palifermin  may  be  mediated  by  receptor  internalization  and subsequent  intracellular  breakdown.  If  patients  had  a  higher  level  of  KGF  receptor  (as  occurs  with injury [44]), they could exhibit higher clearance of palifermin. In particular, if exposure to TBI and chemotherapy resulted in an increased expression of the receptor, this could lead to a higher clearance and thus reduced  exposure in patients as compared to healthy  volunteers. This suggested that interand intra-patients differences in KGF receptor density might be an important factor in PK variability Medicinal product no longer authorised

of palifermin. The main pharmacokinetics properties have been described appropriately in section 5.2 of  the  SPC.  The  full  results  from  the  ongoing  single  dose  study  20010182 Part B will be provided upon completion, post authorisation.

European PK Guidelines recommend to assess the absence of interaction between two drugs indicated to be used in association [45]. Nevertheless, in vitro studies to assess the metabolism of palifermin and specific  drug  interaction  studies  between  palifermin  and  other  drugs  have  not  been  performed.  The applicant has justified this by stating that pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal products (small molecules) commonly administered in the patient population are not anticipated since the metabolism and  elimination  mechanisms  differ  and  are  not  considered  to  impact  on  each  other.  Moreover,  in controlled studies, no apparent difference was observed in neutrophil recovery between placebo and palifermin in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy who routinely received granulocyte colonystimulating  factor (G-CSF) after PBSCT. However, keratinocyte  growth  factor is  a  heparin binding protein; it also interacts with heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which are present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. Palifermin, being a truncated version of KGF, is likely to interact with heparin and HSPG. To date there are no in  vitro (or in  vivo )  data  on  the  effect  of  KGF  binding  to heparin on the biological activity of heparin itself e.g. binding to Antithrombin III. Oncology patients are at increased risk of developing thromboembolism, which involves anticoagulation treatment with unfractionated  or  low-molecular  weight  heparin  and  progression  to  oral  anticoagulant  therapies.  In patients  with  hematologic  malignancies  undergoing  high  dose  cytotoxic  therapy  followed  by  PBSC support, the systemic use of heparin is extremely unlikely due to the patient thrombocytopenic status. However, heparin is generally used to maintain the central line open; therefore if heparin is used to maintain an i.v. line, saline should be used to rinse the line prior to and after palifermin administration. This information is adequately addressed in section 6.2 of the SPC. Moreover, section 4.5 of the SPC includes information that in vitro data suggest that palifermin binds to heparin. To date, the clinical relevance  is  unclear  (see  SPC,  section  4.5). In  vitro and in  vivo studies  in  healthy  volunteers  to evaluate the drug-drug interaction of palifermin with heparin are planned and results will be assessed post-authorisation. Due  to  injection-site  reactions  observed  in  a  phase  I  study  in  which  palifermin  was  administered subcutaneously, section 4.2 of the SPC  states that palifermin should not be administered subcutaneously  due  to  poor  local  tolerability.  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  palifermin  has  been evaluated  in  subjects  with  various  degrees  of  renal  function.  Mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 ml/min) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of palifermin. In patients with  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  &lt;30  ml/min),  clearance  was  decreased  by  22% (n=5). In patients with end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis) palifermin clearance was decreased by 10% (n= 6). These figures have been included in section 5.2 of the SPC. From these results, it has been considered that dose adjustment in patients with renal impairement was not necessary (see SPC, section 4.2). The pharmacokinetic profile of palifermin has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. This information is adequately mentioned in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC. Neither weight nor gender had a notable effect on the PK of palifermin. Age did not significantly alter the clearance of palifermin although the limited  numbers of  elderly patients preclude  definitive  conclusions. The  effect of race could not be assessed due to a majority of White subjects included in the studies. The PK profile in paediatric population and in elderly (age above 70 years) has not been assessed. This information has been adequately included in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of palifermin have been adequately investigated and reported, in agreement with applicable guidelines and requirements [21, 46].

Ki67 is a nuclear antigen strictly associated with cell proliferation. Because the Ki67 protein is present during all active phase of the cell cycle but absent during the resting phase, it is used as a marker of proliferation in human cells [47]. The measurement of epithelial cell proliferation (as assessed by Ki67 staining)  in  the  buccal  mucosa  before  and  after  palifermin  administration  is  a  useful  marker  for palifermin's biologic activity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ki67 staining was defined as the primary measure for epithelial cell proliferation, and a 200% (3-fold) or greater increase in Ki67 staining was defined as the cut off value for biologic response. The use of this  threshold  for  biologic  response  was  based  on  non-clinical  data  (see  non-clinical  primary pharmacodynamics),  which  demonstrated  that,  at  doses  known  to  prevent  oral  mucositis  in  animal models, the increase in Ki67 staining in the buccal mucosa at 48 hours after palifermin administration was at least 3 times greater than at baseline.

Epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemical staining in healthy subjects. The pharmacodynamic response increased with dose of palifermin and, at total doses of 120 µg/kg and higher, at least 50% of the subjects met the criterion for biologic activity. Although an average halflife of 4.9 hours was observed in healthy volunteers, a pharmacologic effect was observed at 48-hours post-dose,  with a smaller  effect  observed 72-hours post-dose. At 48 hours after  dosing,  most of the quantifiable palifermin concentration values were less than twice the lower limit of quantification of the assay, indicating that the pharmacologic effect persisted after active drug levels have dissipated.

Mitotic  figure  counting,  another  mean  of  assessing  cellular  proliferation,  involves  counting  the number of mitotic cells in a tissue section to determine degree of proliferation as part of the ScarffBloom-Richardson  classification  [48].  Mitotic  figure  counts  were  used  as  secondary  marker  of biologic  activity.  A  response  of  &gt;150%  was  considered  to  be  a  strong  indicator  of  epithelial proliferation. In study 960136 (see clinical pharmacokinetics), the pharmacodynamic assessments of buccal mucosal epithelial proliferation, as measured by Ki67 staining and mitotic figure counts were based on buccal mucosal biopsies performed at baseline and at day 3 for single-dose cohorts, and baseline and day 4 for multiple-dose cohorts. When  palifermin  was  administered  as  a  single  injection  (doses  0.2  -  20µg/kg),  notable  epithelial proliferative activity  was  not  observed  at the  doses and time points tested.  At  multiple  doses  of 20 µ g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days, 1 subject met the criterion for epithelial proliferation. In study 970276 (see clinical pharmacokinetics), the pharmacodynamic assessments of buccal mucosal and  forearm  epithelial  proliferation  and  thickness,  as  measured  by  Ki67  staining  and  mitotic  figure counts, were based on biopsies performed pre-dose and 24 hours after the last treatment. In  the  buccal  mucosa,  increased  response  with  increased  dose  was  observed  in  the  Ki67-staining analyses. At 72-hours after the first dose (24-hours after the final dose), 3 of 6 subjects who received 40-µg/kg/day palifermin for 3 consecutive days met the predefined criterion for epithelial proliferation. In study 20010192 (see clinical pharmacokinetics), pharmacodynamic assessments of buccal mucosal epithelial proliferation and epithelial thickness were based on buccal mucosal biopsies performed predose and 48 or 72 hours post-dose. In  the  buccal  mucosa,  increased  response  with  increased  dose  was  observed  in  the  Ki67-staining analyses.  At 48 hours after  dose administration, 11 of 12 subjects  who  received 160-, 210-  or 250µ g/kg  palifermin  met  the  predefined  criterion  for  epithelial  proliferation.  At  72-hours  after  dose administration, a lesser dose-response relationship was observed. In the 210- to 250µ g/kg cohorts, 5 of 8 subjects had a 100% to 199% increase in Ki67 staining. Immunogenicity Subjects were monitored throughout the palifermin clinical development program for the development of anti-palifermin antibodies and to characterise any positive results. A total of 964 patients (321 placebo; 643 palifermin) were tested for anti-palifermin antibodies using an ECL-based MSD assay.  Of the 964 subjects tested by the ECL-based MSD assay, only 12 (2%) palifermin treated patients and 5 (2%) placebo treated patients tested positive and were all below the quantitation  limit  for  anti-palifermin  antibodies.  None  of  these  patients  showed  any  neutralizing activity in the bioassay. Development of anti-palifermin antibodies was not observed.

For  biologics,  persistence  of  effect  (or  a  delayed  effect)  relative  to  drug  concentrations  is  not unexpected.

Based on the longer PD effect of palifermin compared with the PK, the PD endpoints appeared more relevant to consider for dosing frequency than the PK endpoint. In the multiple dose study, 72-hours after  the  first  dose  (24-hours  after  the  final  dose),  3  of  6  subjects  who  received  40-µg/kg/day palifermin for 3 consecutive days met the predefined criterion for epithelial proliferation (see section 5.1,  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  the  SPC).  However,  in  the  dose  escalation  study  in  healthy volunteers, using the dose of 60 µg/kg, PD response was observed only in 1/8 subjects compared with 2/4 who responded to a dose of 120 µg/kg and 4/4 subjects responded to doses of 210 and 250 µg/kg at  48  hours.  No  data  with  multiple  doses  were  available  for  60  µg/kg  at  similar  time  points,  to critically assess PD response of the proposed dosage.

Eligible patients were randomized to receive placebo or 60 µg/kg/day of palifermin for 3 consecutive days,  starting  3  days  before  the  conditioning  regimen  (TBI  plus  high-dose  chemotherapy),  and  3 additional daily  doses post PBPC infusion on  day 0 (day  of PBPC infusion), day 1, and  day 2 (see figure 1).

No long-term immunogenicity data were available (beyond 2-3 months) to determine the safety of the product. Immunogenicity will be addressed and data provided for assessment by the CHMP through periodic safety update reports (see list of post-authorisation follow-up measures). For the assessment of pharmacodynamic interactions with myeloablative chemo-radiotherapy, S-phase specific cytotoxic drugs such as ara-C and other growth factors (or inhibitors), see clinical safety. Clinical efficacy Dose response studies Palifermin has been used to reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of oral mucositis and relevant clinical sequelae at a dose of 60 µ g/kg for 3 consecutive days before conditioning treatment and for 3 consecutive days after PBPC infusion (referred to as pre-post dosing). These  dose  and  regimen  were  initially  selected  based  on  the  tolerability  observed  in  the  phase I/II, dose-escalation study 960189 in patients (see Pharmacokinetic). The phase II study 980231(see main studies) further evaluated these dose and regimen, as well as a regimen that excluded dosing after PBPC infusion (pre dosing only). Results from this study showed that  palifermin  at  the  dose  of  60 µ g/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  and  provided  efficacy  regardless  of whether  pre  or  pre-post  dosing  was  used. However,  because  the  outcomes  for  most  of  the  efficacy endpoints were numerically better with pre-post dosing than with pre dosing, pre-post administration was chosen for use in the pivotal phase III study 20000162 (see main studies). Main studies Study 20000162 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup trial, examining the safety and the efficacy of palifermin compared with placebo in patients with hematologic malignancies who were receiving myeloablative conditioning treatment with autologous PBPC transplantation [49]. Patients and methods Study participants - eligibility criteria Patients who  were scheduled to  undergo TBI plus high-dose  chemotherapy  followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  for  the  treatment  of  the  following  hematologic  malignancies:  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute myelogenous leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic myelogenous  leukaemia,  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  or  multiple  myeloma  were  assessed  for eligibility.  Eligibility  requirements  included  Karnofsky  performance  score  (KPS) ≥ 70%,  age ≥ 18 years, minimum of 1.5 x 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg cryopreserved for infusion.

The investigational products consisted of either 6.25-mg single-dose vials of lyophilized palifermin for reconstitution with 1.2 ml water for injection using a dose of 60 µg/kg/day by i.v. bolus injection or placebo, presented in vials containing all the ingredients of lyophilized powder except for palifermin, reconstituted  with  1.2  ml  sterile  water  for  injection.  Dose  reduction  of  the  investigational  product could be made on days 0, 1, or 2 only if, by study day 0, a patient's weight had decreased by 10% or more from baseline. No dose escalations were permitted.

The conditioning therapy consisted of TBI for a total dose of 12 Gy in 6, 8, or 10 fractions over 3 or 4 days,  followed  by  high-dose  chemotherapy  (etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide).  Etoposide  was administered at the dose of 60 mg/kg  as a single i.v. infusion over 4 hours on day 4. Cyclophosphamide was administered at a total dose of 100 mg/kg given in 1 dose over 1 hour on day 2.  Patients  were  to  receive  hydratation  at  the  rate  of  3.0  l/m 2 /day  beginning  4  hours  before  and continuing 24 hours after cyclophosphamide. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation for 24 hours and/or treatment with mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulphonate sodium) was to be considered [50]. Patients received autologus PBPCs collected after mobilization by either cytokines or chemotherapy with or without cytokines. Filgrastim  (5  µg/kg/day)  was  administered  from  day  0  after  transplant  until  neutrophil  recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 1.0 x 10 9 /l for 3 consecutive days or &gt; 10 x 10 9 /l for 1 day, or day 21, whichever occurred first). Figure 1 - Study schema for study 20000162 Abbreviations:  Treatment  group  A:    K  =  palifermin;  Treatment  group  B:    P  =  placebo;  TBI  =  fractionated  total  body irradiation; VP-16 = etoposide; Cy = cyclophosphamide ; Conditioning Regimen: TBI / etoposide (VP-16) / cyclophosphamide (Cy); G = Filgrastim. Objectives / Endpoints The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of palifermin in reducing the duration of  severe  oral  mucositis  (World  Health  Organisation  [WHO]  grade  3  or  4)  in  patients  with haematological malignancies who were undergoing PBPC transplantation after fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) and high dose chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the duration of severe oral mucositis calculated as the total number of days a  patient  experienced  grade  3  or  4  oral  mucositis  determined  using  the  WHO  toxicity  scale  'Oral Toxicity'.  Mean  duration  of  severe  oral  mucositis  for  each  treatment  group  was  calculated  as  the average  duration  for  all  patients  in  that  treatment  group.  If  a  patient  did  not  experience  any  WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis, the duration of severe oral mucositis was assigned 0 days. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The secondary objectives were to evaluate:

- patient's daily assessment of mouth and throat soreness (patient-reported outcome [PRO]),

- use of parenteral or transdermal opioid analgesics (in mg morphine equivalents),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- incidence of grade 4 oral mucositis determined using the WHO scale,
- duration (days) of grade 2, 3, and 4 oral mucositis determined using the WHO scale,
- duration of oral mucositis determined by Western Consortium of Cancer Nursing Research (WCCNR) scale, descriptor lesions grades 2 and 3, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale grades 3 and 4,

- the safety of palifermin. The WHO oral mucositis scale provides the following definitions: Grade 1 = soreness and erythema; Grade 2 = erythema, ulcers, patients  can swallow solid  diet; Grade 3 =  ulcers, extensive erythema, patients cannot swallow solid diet; Grade 4 = mucositis to the extent that alimentation is not possible Sample size The  null-hypothesis  for  study  was  that  palifermin  and  placebo  recipients  will  experience  the  same duration (in days) of severe oral mucositis. The alternative hypothesis was that the duration of severe oral mucositis in the two treatment groups would be different. The sample size was based on detecting a 3-day difference in the duration of severe oral mucositis (WHO grade 3 or 4) between the palifermin and  placebo  groups.  The  estimated  common  standard  deviation  obtained  from  the  phase  II  study 980231 was 6.6 days. Based on these assumptions, the two sample independent t-test with 90% power and  5%  significant  level  (2-sided)  yields  approximately  105  patients  per  group  for  a  total  of  210 patients. The primary analysis method, though different from the t-test approach, was not expected to have lower power since the stratified analysis was expected to be more efficient. Randomization Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, palifermin or placebo (allocation ratio 1:1). Treatment assignment was blinded for the duration of the study. The type of randomization was a stratified permuted-block design randomization based on two factors: study center (approximately 15 centres in North  America) and type  of  hematologic  malignancy (NHL, Hodgkin's  disease,  multiple myeloma, or any acute or chronic leukaemia). Blinding (masking) This  study  was  a  double-blind  trial.  Sealed  emergency  unblinding  envelopes  were  provided.  A patient's  treatment  assignment  was  only  to  be  unblinded  when  knowledge  of  the  treatment  was essential  for  the  future  medical  management  of  the  patient.  Unblinding  for  any  other  reason  was considered a protocol deviation. Palifermin administration may cause transient elevations in serum amylase and lipase in about 1 of 5 patients. These analyses were therefore performed by a central laboratory that was to reveal results to the  study  centre,  only  upon  request  by  the  investigator,  in  the  event  of  a  clinical  emergency,  and otherwise not before study completion. Approximately 1  of  4  patients  who received  palifermin  experienced  oral  and  skin-related  toxicities that peaked at 36 hours after the last injection and usually resolved within 3 days from onset. These events could in theory bias the investigators. Sensitivity analyses were therefore conducted censoring patients with these events. Statistical methods The primary  efficacy  analysis  set  was  the  modified  intent-to-treat  (mITT)  analysis  set,  which  was defined as all randomized patients  who received  at least 1 dose  of investigational product and  who were analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment. The per-protocol efficacy analysis set included all patients who complied with the study protocol with respect to the entry criteria, treatment procedures, and guidelines. The statistical analysis on the primary endpoint, duration of severe mucositis (WHO grade 3 or 4), was based on the generalised Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method. A 95% confidence interval on the treatment difference was also provided. The primary efficacy analysis was adjusted by study center or both  study  center  and  type  of  haematological  malignancy.  Centers  with  less  than  6  patients  were pooled into 1 center and formed a single stratum. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Resolution of severe oral mucositis was defined as the first time oral mucositis was decreased to WHO grade 2 or less after the last reading of a WHO grade 3 or 4. For patients who died or withdrew from the study, resolution of severe mucositis was defined as 2 consecutive assessments of WHO grade 2 or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

less after the last reading of a WHO grade 3 or 4; the resolution date was the first of the 2 consecutive days with WHO grade 2 or less.

Three  PRO  endpoints  were  defined.  Two  were  from  the  'Oral  Mucositis  Daily  Questionnaire' (OMDQ): 1/ mouth and throat soreness and 2/ daily activities related to  mouth and throat soreness. The third endpoint was the physical well-being domain from the 'Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy' (FACT-G) quality of life questionnaire.

Results Participant flow and numbers analysed Study  20000162  screened  245  patients.  A  total  of  214  patients  (107  each  randomized  to  receive placebo or palifermin) were enrolled from 13 centers (United States). Of the 214 subjects who were randomized, 1 patient randomized to receive placebo and 1 patient randomized to receive palifermin did not receive investigational product. The remaining 212 patients (106 from each treatment group) received  investigational  product  and  formed  the  evaluation  subsets  for  efficacy  (mITT)  and  safety results.  The  mITT  population  was  defined  as  those  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of investigational product. In the placebo group, 103  patients completed  the study (3 patients discontinued) and 104 in the palifermin group (2 patients discontinued). The highest-enrolling center enrolled 40 patients (19%). The  percentage  of  patients  with  at  least  1  important  protocol  deviation  was  25%  (26/106)  in  the palifermin  group and 32% (34/106) in the placebo  group. However, the  mean  number  of important protocol deviations was similar for both groups. Recruitment The first patient was  enrolled  on 23 March 2001 and the last end-of-study  visit was on 23 October 2002. Conduct of study The original protocol of this study was amended once. Amendment 1 allowed a third oral mucositis assessment  tool  (RTOG  scale)  to  be  implemented  and  the  establishment  of  the  Safety  Monitoring Committee. In addition, this amendment extended the time window for screening patients from 21 to 42 days for some evaluations and added steroid rinses as a proscribed therapy. Baseline data Demographic  and  disease  baseline  characteristics  are  shown  in  Table  10.  The  proportions  of  men enrolled  (n = 131)  were  higher  than  the  proportions  of  women  (n = 81).  Most  patients  had  been diagnosed  with  Non-Hodgkins  Lymphoma  (65%  of  the  placebo  group  and  68%  of  the  palifermin group). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Efficacy results For  the  mITT  population,  the  mean  (SD)  duration  of  WHO  grade  3  or  4  oral  mucositis  in  the palifermin  group  was  64%  lower  than  in  the  placebo  group  (3.7  [4.1]  days versus 10.4  [6.2]  days, respectively). The reduction was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) and was reproducible across study centers,  underlying  disease,  and  number  of  radiotherapy  fractions  used  in  the  TBI  conditioning regimen. The Lachenbruch's 2-part model was performed as a sensitivity  analysis  [51],  to  consider  both  the incidence of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis and the duration for those patients who developed this toxicity. Palifermin reduced both the duration (44% decrease in mean duration of severe oral mucositis in the  palifermin group [5.9 days] compared with the placebo group [10.6 days], p &lt; 0.001) and the incidence  of  severe  oral  mucositis  (63%  patients  in  the  palifermin  group vs .  98%  patients  in  the placebo group, p &lt; 0.001). Results  of  the  per-protocol  efficacy  analysis  set  were  similar  to  the  results  obtained  for  the  mITT population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  secondary  assessment  of  mouth  and  throat  soreness  showed  a  lower  score  (indicating  less soreness) in the palifermin group versus the placebo group, with a reduction of 38% of the mean (SD) AUC,  or  a  reduction  in  mean  daily  AUC  score  of  0.49  (mean  [SD]  AUC  was  32.6  [20.8]  in  the palifermin group versus 52.5 [22.4] in the placebo group, p &lt; 0.001).

The  median  cumulative  dose  of  opioid  analgesic  used  for  oral  mucositis  was  211.6  mg  in  the palifermin group compared with 534.9 mg in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of opioid use  was 78% for the palifermin group and 97% for the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001). The  mean (SD) cumulative dose of opioid analgesics for patients with pain caused by mucositis was 893.4 (1934.7) mg in the palifermin group and 1179.9 (1715.4) mg in the placebo group.

The mean (SD) duration of WHO grade 4 oral mucositis for the mITT population was 3.9 (5.1) days for  the  placebo  group and 0.7 (1.7) days  for the palifermin group. The  median (min,  max)  duration was 2.0 (0, 37.0) days for the placebo group and 0 (0, 9.0) days for the palifermin group. The incidence of WHO grade 4 oral mucositis was 62% of patients in the placebo group and 20% of patients in the palifermin group (p &lt; 0.001). The mean (SD) duration of WHO grade 4 oral mucositis for these patients was 6.2 (5.2) days for the placebo group and 3.3 (2.3) days for the palifermin group. The median (min, max) duration was 6.0 (1.0, 37.0) days for the placebo group and 2.0 (1.0, 9.0) for the palifermin group. The mean (SD) duration of WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 oral mucositis was statistically significantly shorter for patients in the palifermin group compared with the placebo group (mean (SD) was 15.7 (7.8) vs . 8.4 (5.8), p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Positive correlations were seen between the severe oral mucositis duration using the WHO scale and that  using  the  RTOG  scale  (Spearman  correlation,  r  =  0.72)  and  between  the  severe  oral  mucositis duration using the WHO scale and that using the WCCNR scale (Spearman correlation, r = 0.71). The results of both scales were consistent with the WHO scale. A summary of efficacy results for study 20000162 is shown in table 11. Ancillary analyses Hematology variables were recorded between study day 5 and 21, and maximum daily temperatures were recorded between study day 8 and 21. Since all patients received myeloablative therapy, virtually all patients (104 [98%] placebo, 106 [100%] palifermin) experienced severe neutropenia, defined as ANC &lt; 500 x 10 6 /l. Febrile  neutropenia, defined in the protocol as an ANC of &lt; 500 x 10 6 /l  with  a concurrent temperature of at least 38.5 o C, was experienced by 97 (92%) patients who received placebo and 79 (75%) patients who received palifermin (p &lt; 0.001). Twenty-five  percent  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  15%  of  patients  in  the  palifermin  group reported at least 1 incidence of a bloodborne infection. For both febrile neutropenia and infections, the time to haemopoietic recovery was similar between groups. The total number of days of parenteral feeding for the mITT population was 761 days for the placebo group and 459 days for the palifermin group. Forty-three percent of patients in the placebo group and 11% of patients in the palifermin group needed parenteral feeding as a result of the severity of their oral mucositis. The total number of days of parenteral feeding for these patients was 569 days for the placebo group and 158 days for the palifermin group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Patients and methods

## Study participants - eligibility criteria

Patients who  were scheduled to  undergo TBI plus high-dose  chemotherapy  followed by autologous PBPC transplantation  for  the  treatment  of  the  following  hematologic  malignancies:  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,  Hodgkin's  disease,  acute  myelogenous  leukaemia,  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  or multiple myeloma were assessed for eligibility.

Eligibility  requirements  included  Karnofsky  performance  score  (KPS) ≥ 70%,  age  range  12  to  65 years, minimum of 1.5x10 6 CD34 + cells/kg cryopreserved, ANC &gt; 1x10 9 /l, platelet count &gt; 100x10 9 /l (for  patients  scheduled  to  start  the  conditioning  regimen  soon  after  apheresis,  a  platelet  count  &lt; 100x10 9 /l but &gt; 50x10 9 /l was acceptable). Treatments Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment regimens in which they received 7 doses of investigational product (60 µg/kg/day of palifermin or placebo): -  'pre-post'  dosing  of  palifermin:  palifermin  was  administered  for  3  consecutive  days  before  the conditioning regimen began (fractionated TBI and high-dose chemotherapy), and on the day of the last TBI fraction immediately after administration of the last radiation fraction, and for 3 consecutive days beginning immediately after PBPC infusion. -  'pre' dosing  of  palifermin:  palifermin  was  administered  for  3  consecutive  days  before  the conditioning regimen began, and on the day of the last TBI fraction immediately after administration of the last radiation fraction, and placebo administered for 3 consecutive days beginning immediately after PBPC infusion. - placebo was administered for 3 consecutive days before the conditioning regimen began, and on the day of the last TBI fraction immediately after administration of the last radiation fraction, and for 3 consecutive days beginning immediately after PBPC infusion. Further to an amendment to the protocol, the dose of investigational product administered on the day of the last TBI fraction was eliminated, which resulted in a 6-dose treatment schedule (see figure 2). This  amendment  was  based  on  a  review  of  animal  data  and  on  concerns  of  eliminating  benefit  or worsening of mucosal injury when the time period between palifermin and chemotherapy administration was shorter than 24 hours. For administration of investigational products, conditioning therapy, autologus PBPCs and filgrastim, see study 20000162. Cyclophosphamide was administered as a single dose of 75 or 100 mg/kg infused i.v. over 1 hour on day 2. Patients received hydratation as described in study 20000162.

Abbreviations: K = palifermin; P = placebo; Treatment group A:  palifermin pre; Treatment group B:  palifermin pre-post; Treatment  group  C:    placebo;  TBI  =  fractionated  total  body  irradiation;  VP-16  =  etoposide;  Cy  =  cyclophosphamide ; Conditioning Regimen:  TBI / etoposide (VP-16) / cyclophosphamide (Cy); G = Filgrastim. Objectives / Endpoints The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of palifermin on oral mucositis induced by myeloablative radiation (TBI) and high-dose chemotherapy  in patients with hematologic malignancies. The primary endpoint was the duration (days) of grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis (severe oral mucositis) measured by the WHO toxicity scale. The secondary objectives were to evaluate: - the incidence of severe oral mucositis, - the oral mucositis area under the curve (AUC) for all severity grades, - the AUC of t.d. or i.v. opioid analgesic use (actual daily doses converted to equianalgesic units), - the PRO assessment for palifermin, specifically the domain of mouth and throat soreness, -  the  incidence  and  duration  of  grade  2,  3,  or  4  diarrhea,  as  determined  using  the  revised  National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI CTC) scale, - the duration (days) of febrile neutropenia defined as ANC &lt; 1.0 x109/L, fever 38.5°C, -  the  duration  (days)  of  treatment  with  i.v.  antifungals  or  i.v.  antibiotics  for  febrile  neutropenia  or documented infections (microbiologically or clinically) caused by bacteria or fungi, -  the  incidence  of  intestinal  absorption  and  permeability  abnormalities  expressed  as  the  ratio  of differential sugar probes, such as lactulose to mannitol excreted in the urine (for subjects at specific centers only), - the safety of palifermin. Sample size The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  a  hypothesis  test  on  the  primary  endpoint  between  a palifermin  group  and  the  placebo  group.  This  test  was  expected  to  have  a  80%  power  to  detect  a desired treatment effect with a 5% Type I error rate. Average of 10 days of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis with a standard  deviation  of  approximately 7.5 days, were  expected in this population. A 50% reduction in duration of severe oral mucositis was assumed to be clinically meaningful. Based on a 2-sample independent t-test, a sample size of 37 patients per treatment group was calculated for the study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Randomization

The  randomization  was  stratified  by  center.  Centers  with  different  conditioning  regimens  were considered as different centers. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the three arms within  each  stratum.  Patients  randomisation  information  was  supplied  by  an  interactive  voice response system vendor to Amgen after the database is locked.

Blinding (masking) See study 20000162. Statistical methods The protocol defined a mITT population as the analysis set for the primary endpoint. This population included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  investigational  product.  Evaluations  were conducted  using  two  analysis  sets:  patients  randomised  under  the  original  protocol  to  the  7-dose schedule and patients randomised under the amended protocol to the 6-dose schedule. If a patient did not  experience  any  WHO  grade  3  or  4  oral  mucositis,  the  duration  of  severe  oral  mucositis  was assigned  0  days.  The  mean  duration  of  severe  oral  mucositis  was  the  average  duration  across  all patients in each treatment group. All  statistical  tests  were  2-sided  at  the  0.05  significance  intervals.  Point  estimates  of  interest  were accompanied by 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. The primary endpoint, duration of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis was based on the generalised Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method stratified by  study  center.  Centers  with  less  than  6  patients  were  pooled  into  1  center  and  formed  a  single stratum. For patients who completed the study, resolution of severe oral mucositis was defined as 1 assessment of WHO grade 2 or less oral mucositis after the last assessment of a WHO grade 3 or 4. For patients who  died  or  withdrew  from  the  study  before  the  end-of-study  visit,  oral  mucositis  was  only  to  be considered resolved if the patients had 2 consecutive assessments of WHO grade 2 or less after the last assessment of a WHO grade 3 or 4. Patients without resolution of WHO grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis were given the mean duration of severe oral mucositis among patients who experienced at least the same duration of severe oral mucositis as the patients whose oral mucositis was not resolved. Missing daily oral mucositis assessments with adjacent values were imputed with the worse of the 2 adjacent values. As a worst-case sensitivity analysis, the analysis was repeated with the missing data in the palfermin group being replaced by the worst adjacent value, and the missing data in the placebo group replaced by the best of the adjacent values. An  interim  analysis  was  to  be  performed  after  one-half  of  the  patients  were  enrolled  and  had completed the study. This planned interim analysis was performed for 55 patients randomized to the amended, 6-dose schedule, and was conducted at an alpha level of 0.001. Dissemination of the results of the planned interim analysis was limited to Amgen senior management (including members of the internal Safety Committee) and those members of the palifermin team not directly involved in study conduct and management. Members of the internal Safety Committee were unblinded at the interim but were blinded to new data collected after the interim analysis. The results of the planned interim analysis  suggested  no  safety  concerns  with  the  6-dose  schedule  and  presented  no  reasons  to discontinue the study. Results Participant flow and numbers analysed A total of 169 patients (52 placebo, 117 palifermin) were randomized at 12 centers  (North America). Six patients (1 placebo, 5 palifermin) never received investigational product. Of the 163 patients who received investigational product, 34 were randomized under the original protocol to receive 7 doses of investigational product (11 placebo, 12 palifermin pre, 11 palifermin pre-post) and 129 patients were randomized under the amended protocol to receive 6 doses of investigational product (40 placebo, 43 palifermin pre, 46 palifermin pre-post).

Patients who had enrolled shortly before the decision to change the schedule was made, but had not yet received the extra dose were treated under the 6-dose schedule. For the purpose of analysis, such patients were considered to have been randomised to the 6-dose schedule. Analyses of efficacy and safety were performed separately for the 7-dose schedule (data not shown) and the 6-dose schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the 6-dose schedule, the total number of patients with at least one important protocol deviation was lower in the placebo (22 [55%] of 40 patients) and palifermin pre groups (25 [58%] of 43 patients) compared with the palifermin pre-post group (32 [70%] of 46 patients). However, the mean number of important deviations was similar in all 3 groups.

## Efficacy results

For  the  mITT  population,  the  mean  (SD)  duration  of  WHO  grade  3  or  4  oral  mucositis  in  the palifermin pre group was decreased by 39.5% compared with the placebo group (5.2 [6.1] days versus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

8.6  [8.2]  days);  the  reduction  was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.003).  The  mean  (SD)  duration  of WHO  grade  3  or  4  oral  mucositis  in  the  palifermin  pre-post  group  (4.7  [5.7]  days)  was  also statistically significantly reduced (45.3%) relative to the placebo group (p = 0.004).

The Lachenbruch's 2-part model considered the incidence of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis and the duration for those patients who developed this toxicity. Statistically significant improvements for both parameters were observed using this model, for both palifermin treatment groups compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0219 palifermin pre, 0.0297 palifermin pre-post).

Results related to the 7-dose scheduled are not shown (see discussion on clinical efficacy). The secondary assessment of severity and incidence of oral mucositis showed statistically significant difference in the percentages of patients with grade-4 mucositis (14 [33%] patients in the palifermin pre-  group  and  12  [26%]  patients  in  the  palifermin  pre-post  group,  experienced  grade  4  mucositis versus 20 [50%] patients in the placebo group, p = 0.029 and 0.025, respectively). The differences in incidence  were  not  statistically  significant  for  patients  who  developed  WHO  Grade  2,  3,  or  4 mucositis. The improvement in  mouth and throat soreness  among  patients  receiving  palifermin  translated  into improvements in  all  related  daily  activities  were  assessed.  The  mean  AUC  limitation  score  for  the overall study period was reduced (function was improved) in the all-palifermin group relative to the placebo  group  by  a  range  of  17%  (sleeping)  to  27%  (talking).  Improvements  were  statistically significant for drinking (23%; p = 0.005) and eating (24%; p = 0.022). Similar percentages of subjects in the placebo and palifermin groups experienced NCI CTC grade 3 or 4 diarrhea during the study (30% placebo, 26% palifermin pre, 24% palifermin pre-post). Fewer  patients  in  each  of  the  palifermin  groups  (16%  palifermin  pre,  20%  palifermin  pre-post) received i.v. antifungal  medications  during the study  than in the placebo  group (30%). For patients who received i.v. antifungals, the  mean (SD)  duration of  use was shorter in the palifermin pre-post group (5.3 [3.8] days) and longer in the palifermin pre- group (10.7 [8.2] days) than in the placebo group  (6.5  [2.7]  days).  Approximately  the  same  percentages  of  patients  in  placebo  and  palifermin groups received i.v. antibiotics during the study (93% placebo, 88% palifermin pre, 89% palifermin pre-post). The mean (SD) duration of use of i.v. antibiotics was similar for all treatment groups (11.1 [6.2] days placebo, 11.1 [6.1] palifermin pre, 11.3 [6.0] days palifermin pre-post).

## Supportive studies

In study 20010182 (Part A), 13 patients were enrolled and received palifermin (see pharmacokinetics). All patients  had WHO  grade 2, 3, or 4  oral  mucositis during the study.   Seven (54%) patients  had grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis and 3 (23%) patients had grade 4 oral mucositis.  The mean (SD) duration of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis was 3.6 (4.6) days for all patients and was 6.7 (4.3) days for those who experienced it.  The mean (SD) duration of WHO grade 4 oral mucositis was 0.7 (1.4) days for all subjects and was 3.0 (1.0) days for those who experienced it.

In  the  phase  II  study,  the  results  obtained  form  the  35  patients  randomised  to  receive  7  doses  of palifermin  did  not suggest any improved  efficacy  for palifermin  compared to placebo, and in  many analyses the trend favoured the placebo group. Further to an amendment to the protocol, the dose of investigational product administered on the day of the last TBI fraction was eliminated, which resulted in  a  6-dose  treatment  schedule.  This  amendment  was  based  on  a  review  of  animal  data  and  on concerns  of  eliminating  benefit  or  worsening  of  mucosal  injury  when  the  time  period  between palifermin and chemotherapy administration was shorter than 24 hours. An appropriate warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC.

A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study (950225, Part B) was aimed to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of palifermin, in 64 patients with colorectal carcinoma treated with 5Fluorouracil  and  leucovorin,  on  amelioration  of  chemotherapy-induced  oral  mucositis  and  diarrhea, when administered at a dose of 40 µg/kg i.v. for 3 consecutive days before each of the 2 cycles of 5FU/leucovorin chemotherapy. No patients in either treatment groups had a grade 4 oral mucositis. The greatest difference between the two groups was in the proportions of patients with grade 2 or 3 oral mucositis, which was lower in patients who received palifermin than in patients who received placebo during  cycle  1  (29%  palifermin,  61%  placebo)  and  cycle  2  (11%  palifermin,  47%  placebo)  of chemotherapy. A phase II study (990119) was performed to evaluate the effect of palifermin on the duration of grade 2  or  higher  of  oral  mucositis  (phase  A)  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  head  and  neck  cancer receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy with standard or hyperfractionated radiation therapy. This was a randomized study (2:1, palifermin:placebo) with stratification  on tumor type and schedule  of radiation. A phase I/II study (970149) of escalating doses was aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of i.v.  administration  of  palifermin  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  chemoradiotherapy  for  head  and neck cancer. Discussion on clinical efficacy The indication was supported by one pivotal phase III and one phase II study. In the phase III pivotal study, assessing a pre-post 6-dose regimen of palifermin, the statistically significant reduction seen in the  mean  duration  of  WHO  grade  3 and 4  oral  mucositis,  the  primary  endpoint,  was  supported  by statistically significant reductions in duration of oral mucositis as assessed by all other oral mucositis rating  scales  used.  These  included the Radiation Therapy  Oncology  Group  (RTOG)  acute  radiation morbidity  scoring  criteria  for  mucous  membranes  and  the  Western  Consortium  of  Cancer  Nursing Research  (WCCNR)  oral  mucositis  staging  system,  which  measures  only  the  anatomical  changes associated with oral mucositis. The use of more than one scale to measure the efficacy endpoint has shown consistency in the measurement of the primary endpoint. To assess the impact of oral mucositis on  functioning  as  reported  by  the  patient,  a  patient-reported  outcomes  daily  questionnaire  (oral mucositis  daily  questionnaire  [OMDQ]),  investigating  mouth  and throat  soreness  and  its  impact  on daily  functional  activities  (sleeping,  swallowing,  eating,  drinking,  and  talking)  was  used.  However, validation  activities  for  the  OMDQ  used  in  the  phase  II  and  III  studies  were  not  totally  completed prospectively  and  were  carried  out  retrospectively.  Nevertheless,  the  correlation  between  assessorbased  measures  of  improvement  in  oral  mucositis  (assessments  by  medical  professionals  using  the WHO scale) and subjective measures (PRO assessments by patients) was high, as demonstrated by comparing daily WHO scores and daily PRO scores across all patients.

The  analysis  of  data  from  patients  randomised  to  receive  6  doses  of  palifermin  showed  that  the duration of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis, the primary efficacy endpoint, was numerically reduced in  patients  who  received  palifermin,  either  pre-  or  pre-post  treatment,  compared  with  patients  who received placebo. This result was reproducible across study centers, underlying hematologic disease, and  number  of  radiotherapy  fractions  used  in  the  conditioning  regimen.  The  differences  seen  were robust  to  the  problems  of  missing  efficacy  observations,  even  using  the  worst-case  imputation techniques which penalised the active groups compared to placebo. While the incidence of grade 3 and 4  oral  mucositis  was  reduced  in  both  palifermin  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  the differences  were  not  statistically  significant.  Diarrhoea  being  commonly  related  to  the  conditioning regimen used in these studies, the incidence  and duration  of  diarrhoea  was assessed as a secondary endpoint considering the potential of palifermin to reduce  chemotherapy-induced  diarrhoea in mice. However no clinically or statistically significant differences were observed between the placebo and palifermin groups for these endpoints.

Although the study was not designed to statistically compare efficacy endpoints between the 2 groups receiving  palifermin  ( i.e. palifermin  preversus pre-post),  the  outcomes  for  most  of  the  efficacy endpoints  (including  the  primary  endpoint)  were  not  significantly  better  in  the  palifermin  pre-post group than the palifermin pre- group. No clinical or non-clinical evidence for the pre-post protocol to be  superior  to  the  pre-only  protocol  has  been  provided.  Dosing  with  growth  factors  after  highly mutagenic  chemo-radiotherapy  may  salvage  otherwise  dying  cells  with  chromosomal  injuries,  and caution  must  be  exercised  if  this  is  not  clearly  needed,  especially  as  no  long  term  safety  data  are available (see clinical safety discussion and SPC section 4.4). Therefore, the applicant has agreed to provide, post-authorisation, prospective clinical trial data to confirm the efficacy of palifermin relative to  placebo  when  given  either  pre-high  dose  chemotherapy  only versus pre-  and  post-high  dose chemotherapy dosage schedules, by determining the incidence  of  oral  mucositis (WHO  grades 2, 3 and 4). The  observation  that  the  greatest  benefit  is  observed  in  patients  who  receive  chemo-radiotherapy giving  a  high  incidence  of  mucositis,  as  opposed  to  those  receiving  chemotherapy  alone  was confirmed  in  a  small  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose-escalation  study  (990750) conducted  in  patients  with  hematologic  malignancies  undergoing  high-dose  chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was significantly reduced in the palifermin group compared with the placebo group in both the phase II and phase III studies, suggesting that preserving integrity of the mucosal barrier may  help to reduce the incidence of systemic infections during profound myelosuppression. Palifermin anti-mucositis activity in patients with colorectal cancer has been observed. In two clinical studies conducted  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  HNC  receiving  fractionated  radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, efficacy of palifermin has not been demonstrated. Clinical safety Patient exposure The palifermin clinical program consists of 17 studies conducted between 1995 and 2003, in the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. A total  of 1168 patients were treated, i.e. received  at least 1 dose  of  investigational product (382 with placebo and 786 with palifermin). Six pools of  data have been analysed for the integrated analysis of safety (see table 14). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Safety results of 6 studies in healthy volunteers (n = 210) have been also analysed. No pooling of these studies  for  safety  has  been  done.  Adverse  events  (AE),  deaths,  serious  adverse  events,  and  other significant  safety  parameters are  presented  for  the  primary  safety  pool  (pool  B,  which  included  all patients who received at least 1 dose  of investigational product in  myelotoxic therapy studies). The primary safety pool included patients receiving a total of 3, 6, or 7 per-protocol doses. The  median number  of  doses  in  both  treatment  groups  was  6.  The  median  average  daily  dose  by  weight  was 60 µg/kg/day in  each treatment  group. Patients  were  enrolled  from 31 study  centers. The 4 highestenrolling  centers  enrolled  40%  of  the  patients.  Equivalent  proportions  of  patients  (3%)  in  both treatment groups discontinued the study prematurely. Death was the cause of early discontinuation for 3  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  patient  in  the  palifermin  group.  Five  (1%)  patients  in  the palifermin group, versus none  the  placebo group,  discontinued  due  to  withdrawn  consent  or administrative/investigator decision. Adverse events AE are presented by the time of their first occurrence relative to the administration of chemotherapy. The pre-chemotherapy period was defined as beginning at the initiation of investigational product to the day before the initiation of chemotherapy (day - 11 to day - 4), and the post-chemotherapy period was defined as beginning on the day of the initiation of chemotherapy to the end of study (from day- 3 to day 28). AE in the primary safety pool are summarized in table 15. The incidence of AE was lower in the pre-chemotherapy period (79% placebo, 84% palifermin) than in the post-chemotherapy period (100% of patients in both groups). AE related to treatment were more frequent in the palifermin group both pre- and post-chemotherapy. Few treatment-related adverse events were serious (1% placebo, 2% palifermin). Very few patients in either group (1% placebo, 2%  palifermin) discontinued investigational product due to adverse events. Medicinal product no longer authorised

a Up to 30 days after the last dose of investigational product. Adverse  events that  occurred ≥ 5% more  often  in  palifermin  than  placebo  overall  were  rash,  fever, pruritus, erythema, edema, mouth/tongue thickness or discolouration, pain, arthralgia, and granulocytopenia (table 16). Table 16.  AE occurring with ≥ 5% higher incidence in palifermin than placebo (primary safety pool) a Mouth/tongue thickness or discoloration included the preferred terms of lesion oral, tongue discoloration and tongue disorder. b Rash included the preferred terms of rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular and rash purpuric. c Taste altered included the preferred terms of taste loss and taste perversion. The overall incidence of severe adverse events was similar in the two treatment groups in the primary safety  pool  (35%  placebo,  39%  palifermin). The  most  common  of  these  events  among  patients receiving palifermin were nausea (placebo 10%, palifermin 11%), anorexia (placebo 7%, palifermin 4%), and vomiting (placebo 7%, palifermin 7%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

AE considered to be related to investigational product occurred at a greater incidence in the palifermin group (56%) than the placebo group (29%). The incidence in the palifermin group was similar in the pre-chemotherapy (38%) and post-chemotherapy (39%) periods. The most common treatment-related events  in  the  palifermin  group  were  rash  (23% versus 10%  in  the  placebo  group),  erythema  (18%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

versus 4% in the placebo group) and mouth/tongue thickness or discoloration (13% versus 3% in the placebo group), see details in table 17.

Table 17.  Adverse reactions occurring with ≥ 5% higher incidence with palifermin than placebo

Nervous system disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders General disorders and administration site conditions The  AE  assessed  as  potentially  associated  with  palifermin  and  likely  related  to  its  pharmacologic activity were oral epithelium, skin, and visual related-AE, pancreatitis and AE related to filgrastim. A higher  proportion  of  the  patients  in  the  palifermin  group  had  oral-related  adverse  events  compared with patients in the placebo group during the first dosing period (14% placebo, 29% palifermin), and proportions  were  similar  for  both  groups  during  the  second  dosing  period  (18%  placebo,  19% palifermin). The median time to onset of oral events in the first treatment period was about 5 days in the palifermin group and the duration was about 5 days. Corresponding figures for the second period was 8 and 4 days, respectively. Seven patients discontinued palifermin treatment ( versus 1 patient in the placebo group) due to skin AE (2 cases of oedema, 2 cases of erythema, 1 case of flushing, 1 case of pruritus, 1 case of rash, 2 cases of maculopapular rash). Median time to onset during the first period was  4  days  in  the  palifermin  ( versus 7  days  for  placebo)  with  a  similar  median  duration  of  3  and 4 days  in  the  placebo  and  palifermin  groups,  respectively.  In  the  second  dosing  period,  the  median time to onset of skin-related adverse events in the 2 groups was similar (8 days for the placebo group and 7 days for the palifermin group), with a similar median duration of 5 and 6 days in the placebo and palifermin groups, respectively. Because  of the presence  of the KGFR on the  eye lens [53] and the documented  increased  risk  of  cataracts  associated  with  TBI  [54,  55],  two studies  (20000162, 20010182) included slit-lamp eye examinations performed by ophthalmologists at baseline and during a follow-up visit between days 28 and 60, in addition to the reporting of visual-related AE from the primary  safety  pool.  More  patients  in  the  palifermin  group  reported  eye  irritation  (4  [1%]  patients versus 1 [&lt; 1%] patient in the placebo group). Abnormal, essentially blurred, vision was reported by 13 (3%) patients versus 7 (3%) in the palifermin and the placebo groups, respectively. Additional data from  studies  20010182  and  20030142  did  not  show  evidence  of  an  increase  in  lens  opacities  in patients treated with palifermin. Clinical manifestations potentially associated with pancreatitis were reported with similar frequencies in the placebo and the palifermin groups. Dose limiting toxicity In study 960189 (see clinical pharmacokinetics), a total of 264 patients were enrolled and 262 patients received the investigational product (85 placebo, 177 palifermin). Eight  patients  had  adverse  events  that  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  dose-limiting  toxicities (any  non-hematological  adverse  event  of WHO  [or  CTC  for  diarrhea]  grade ≥ 3  considered  by  the investigator  to  be  possibly,  probably,  or  definitely  related  to  palifermin).  One  patient,  each  in  the placebo,  the  20µ g/kg/day  palifermin  pre-post,  and  the  60µ g/kg/day  palifermin  pre-  groups,  and 5(36%) patients in the 80µ g/kg/day palifermin pre-post group, met the protocol-defined stopping rule (dose escalation was to be stopped if more than 4 of 12 [33%] subjects had a dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] at the  same  dose  and  dosing  schedule).  The  60µ g/kg/day  palifermin  pre-post  dose/schedule was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose (see table 18). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 18- Summary of dose limiting toxicities by Cohort

*R = Repeat; ** Patients in cohorts 1 to 10 use BEAM in chemotherapy regimen, and patients in cohort 11 use. BEAM or BuMel. Serious adverse events and deaths The incidence of deaths on study was 3 (1%) in the placebo group and 2 (0%) in the palifermin group. Reported causes of death included veno-occlusive disease (VOD), sepsis, pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency. Deaths were not considered to be related to study treatment. With respect to VOD, the KGF receptor is not known to be expressed in hepatic sinusoidal endothelia. The  overall  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  was  the  same  (20%)  in  both  treatment  groups. Three serious  events  occurred  in  more  than  1%  of  patients  receiving  palifermin:  fever  (7  [3%] placebo, 19 [5%] palifermin); sepsis (2 [1%] placebo, 7 [2%] palifermin); and hypotension (4  [2%] placebo, 7 [2%] palifermin). Laboratory findings In the primary safety pool, granulocytopenia was reported as an adverse event in a higher percentage of  patients  who  received  palifermin  (13%)  compared  with  patients  who  received  placebo  (7%). However a statistically significant reduction in febrile neutropenia was observed in the pivotal trial in the  palifermin  treated  patients  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients.  An  increased  incidence  of granulocytopenia  in  both  studies  990119  and  970149  (fractionated  chemoradiotherapy  setting  in patients with advanced head and neck cancer) was observed among patients receiving palifermin. However the proportion of patients who experienced clinically significant infections was the same in the placebo and palifermin treated groups (11%). In the hematologic malignancy setting, the analysis of  individual  patients'  ANC  time  trajectories  did  not  identify  any  differences  between  treatment groups, and  ANC recovery curves were super-imposable. Time-trajectory  plots  for  ANC  values  for patients who  did  and  did not  have  granulocytopenia  were similar between the two treatment  groups and between the patients with or without reported granulocytopenia. In the primary safety pool, only 14 patients (5 in the placebo group, 9 in the palifermin group) were ≥ 65 years old, only one patient from  the  palifermin  group  experienced  granulocytopenia.  In  the  fractionated  chemoradiotherapy studies, 2/10 (22%) patients in the placebo group and 8/10 (62%) patients in the palifermin group who were ≥ 65 years had granulocytopenia reported as an AE. In the multicycle chemotherapy setting, 9/36 (25%) patients in the placebo group and 11/39 (28%) patients in the palifermin group who were ≥ 65 years had granulocytopenia reported as an AE.

In  the  primary  safety  pool,  54%  (101/186)  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  62%  (184/298)  of patients  in  the  palifermin  group  had  grade  increases  from  study  baseline in  serum  amylase  values. More  patients  in  the  palifermin  group  (17%)  had  grade  4 increases  from  baseline  compared  with patients in the placebo group (11%). Mean (50.72 IU/l placebo, 53.12 IU/l palifermin) baseline serum amylase  values  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  Mean  (291.77  IU/l  placebo,  434.95  IU/l palifermin) peak values were higher in patients who received palifermin compared with patients who received placebo. Three patients (1 placebo and 2 palifermin) had serum amylase values greater than 4500 IU/l on study day -5. In these patients, the baseline values were within normal range and the endof-study  values  were  lower  than  baseline.  Clinical  sequelae,  i.e.  abdominal  and/or  back  pain, potentially associated with  elevated amylase levels  occurred in 1 of these 3 patients. A patient  who

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received  60 µ g/kg  palifermin  pre-post  had transient  mild  back pain.  This  patient  had  no  reports  of acute pancreatitis. Increased amylase levels were found to be predominantly of salivary gland origin. In the placebo group, 23% (39/170) of patients and 28% (76/274) of patients in the palifermin group had  grade  increases  from  study  baseline  in  serum  lipase  values.  Mean  baseline  lipase  values  were higher in patients who received palifermin (59.87 IU/l) compared with patients who received placebo (43.08 IU/l). Overall, mean values increased, and peak values were observed in both treatment groups on  the  study  day-6  evaluation,  by  the  day  0  (PBSCT)  evaluation,  mean  values  decreased  to  below baseline values for palifermin and were similar between treatment groups. By approximately day 28 after PBSCT, in patients who received placebo, mean values increased from day 0 and were slightly increased  from  the  baseline  values.  In  patients  who  received  palifermin,  mean  values  had  also increased from day 0, but were slightly decreased from the baseline values. One patient (not one of the 2 patients previously described with very high amylase levels) who received 60 µ g/kg palifermin prepost had a serum lipase values of 1980 U/l (baseline), 8350 U/l (day -4 [peak value]), 266 U/l (day 4), and  92  U/l  (day 41)  and  experienced  abdominal  pain,  potentially  associated  with  elevated  lipase levels. The patient had no reports of acute pancreatitis.

In the hematology transplant setting, follow-up data of 23.1 months (range 0.2 to 83.8 months) for the placebo  group  and  23.8 months  (range  0.8  to  81.6  months)  for  the  palifermin  group,  showed  that overall survival,  disease  progression,  progression-free  survival,  and  the  incidences  of  second malignancies  remained  similar  between  palifermin  and  placebo  groups,  and  were  in  the  range expected  for this patient population. The  overall Kaplan-Meier survival  curves remained similar  for both  groups.  A  divergence  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  progression-free  survival,  with  more progressions  occurring  on  the  palifermin  arm,  was  observed  beyond  the  18-month  timepoint.  The overall proportion of patients whose disease has progressed was 32% of patients receiving placebo and 37%  of  patients  who  received  palifermin.  However  a  non-parametric  log  rank  analysis  has  been conducted on the overall survival and progression-free survival data, which did not show statistically significant differences between palifermin and placebo treated groups at this point in time during the follow  up. From the  currently available  data, a difference in progression  free survival  could  not be

Study 960189 included thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], T3 [triiodothyroxine], and T4 [thyroxine]) at baseline and approximately 30 days and then 60 to 100 days after  transplantation.  A  total  of  59  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  138 patients  in  the  palifermin group had pre-study and post-transplant data for TSH. More women were included in the palifermin group  (42%)  compared  with  placebo  (21%).  No  significant  differences  in  either  baseline,  posttransplant  or  follow-up  TSH  values  were  observed  between  both  groups.  In  the  pivotal  study (20000162), the incidence of reported thyroid related adverse event was low and similar between the two groups. With regard to immunogenicity, see clinical pharmacodynamics. Long term safety Long-term safety information has been provided  from study 990123 (long-term  follow-up study  for patients  enrolled  in  studies  conducted  in  the  fractionated  chemoradiotherapy  setting,  i.e.  studies 970149  and  990119),  study  950226  (long-term  follow-up  study  for  patients  enrolled  in  studies conducted in the multicycle chemo setting, i.e. studies 950225 and 950275) and study 960226 (longterm follow-up study for patients enrolled in studies conducted in the hematology transplant setting, i.e. studies 960189, 980231, 20000162, and 20010182). In  the  multicycle  chemotherapy  setting  data  are  available  from  follow-up  of  145  subjects  who participated  in  the  parent  study  (950225),  48  of  whom  subsequently  participated  in  an  open-label extension (Study 950275).  The median duration of follow up was 13.4 months (12.6 months for the prior  placebo  group,  14.3  months  for  the  prior  palifermin  group).  Kaplan-Meier  curves  for  overall survival, time to disease progression, and progression-free survival were superimposable between the prior placebo and prior palifermin groups. In the fractionated chemoradiotherapy setting, the median follow-up time was 38.6 months (range 1.2 to 64.3 months) for the placebo group and 19.5 months (range 0.4 to 71.3 months) for the palifermin group.  The  disease  progression rates  were  higher  for  the  palifermin  treated  patients  compared  with placebo  (27% versus 13%,  respectively).  The  observed  death  rates  were  (24%  placebo,  27% palifermin). Medicinal product no longer authorised

ruled  out.  The  overall  proportion  of  patients  with  second  malignancies  remained  the  same  (6%)  in both treatment groups.

## Safety in special populations

Within  the  primary  safety  pool,  2%  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  (5/241  placebo,  9/409 palifermin)  were ≥ 65 years  old.    Although  differences  were  seen  in  incidences  of  some  AEs,  no conclusive evidence suggested that the AE profile was different in patients ≥ 65 years old who received palifermin compared with patients &lt;65 years old. A total of 86% of patients in the placebo group and 82% of patients in the palifermin group were Caucasian. Percentages of patients of other races were as follows: black  (7% placebo, 8% palifermin), Hispanic (5% placebo, 7% palifermin), and  other  (2% placebo,  3%  palifermin).  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (68%)  were  men compared with patients in the palifermin group (59%). No differences in the types or incidences of AE were observed between the groups of different races, or between the placebo and palifermin groups for men or women. Safety data from the use of palifermin in paediatric patients  or in pregnant women have not been provided. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions No safety  data related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions have been reported. Since an increased risk of bacterial infections has been associated with more severe oral mucositis in several studies [56, 57], the use of myelopoietic growth factors was standardized in the palifermin program conducted  in  the  high  dose  cytotoxic  therapy.  Filgrastim  administration  was  mandated  from  day  0 onward after PBSC infusion, daily until neutrophil recovery. The median number of days of filgrastim exposure in the integrated safety set (241 placebo, 409 palifermin) was 12.0 days in the placebo group and 11.0 in the palifermin group. A potential interaction between filgrastim and palifermin has been discussed (see discussion on clinical safety). Post marketing experience No post marketing experience data have been available. Risk management plan Post  marketing  surveillance  will  be  monitored  through  collection  and  analysis  of  spontaneous  AE reports, with special attention to malignancies (relapse of pre-existing malignancies and development of new malignancies). Moreover,  650  patients  who  received  investigational  product  (including  339  patients  who  received palifermin) in  the  studies  conducted  in the  haematological  malignancies  setting  have  been  enrolled into  the  long  term  follow  up  study  960226  and  will  be  followed  until  death  or  loss  to  follow  up. Patients will be followed for survival, tumor progression and secondary malignancies. The sample size has been calculated, assuming the background rate for secondary malignancies is 2% per year [58-62], to  observe  approximately  23  and  39  secondary  malignancies  with  5-year  and  10-year  follow-up, respectively (the 95% CI for the annual incidence of secondary malignancies is 1.6% with 5 years and 1.2% with 10 years of follow-up). Long term safety data will be reported annually, until 2015.  The available Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) databases will be used to identify cases of suspected secondary malignancies and cancer relapse. Discussion on clinical safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because of the distribution of KGF receptors on epithelial tissues, some adverse effects, in particular skin  and  oral  adverse  events,  possibly  related  to  palifermin's  pharmacologic  action  on  KGFRexpressing  tissues,  were  observed.  These  skin  (e.g.,  rash,  pruritus,  erythema,  and  oedema)  and  oral (e.g.,  mouth/tongue  discoloration  or  thickness,  and  taste  disorders)  adverse  events,  were  reversible, usually mild in severity, and infrequently led to discontinuation of dosing.  The median time to onset was  6  days  after  the  first  of  3  consecutive  daily  doses,  with  a  median  duration  of  5  days.  The association  of  these  events  with  palifermin  treatment  was  more  apparent  before  administration  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cytotoxic  therapy.  However,  after  cytotoxic  therapy,  a  high  level  of  background  toxicities  has complicated accurate interpretation of the data.

Other than oral and skin related adverse events, the overall short term safety profile of palifermin in the  myelotoxic  therapy  clinical  trial  population  was  similar  to  that  of  placebo.  Deaths  and  serious adverse events occurred in a similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups and were typical of those commonly affecting this patient population.

Safety and efficacy of palifermin has not been evaluated in the elderly (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC). Due to the small number of patients ≥ 65 years old, no conclusive evidence suggested that the AE profile  was different in patients ≥ 65  years  old  who received palifermin  compared  with patients &lt;65 years old. No differences in the types or incidences of AE were observed between the groups of different races, or between men and women. Safety and efficacy of palifermin has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC). Safety data from the use of palifermin in paediatric patients or in pregnant women have not been provided. Palifermin should not be used in children or adolescents until further data become available, and the use during pregnancy is

Analysis  of  hematology  laboratory  values  over  time  showed  a  similar  pattern  of  post-transplant hematopoietic recovery, indicating that palifermin did not interfere with hematopoietic reconstitution, and the proportions of patients receiving transfusions were similar in the two treatment groups. Increase  in  amylase  and  lipase  was  observed  consistently  across  all  patient  groups  with  wide variations and high levels, although overt signs of pancreatitis were not associated consistently with these increases and no case of pancreatitis was reported (see SPC, section 4.8). Since the reasons for excess reporting of granulocytopenia in the palifermin group versus the placebo group, which were not supported  by  daily  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  measurements,  are  unknown,  together  with inconsistencies in adverse events reporting procedures between different clinical settings, granulocytopenia will be kept under review post-marketing . Higher incidence of granulocytopenia was observed in patients receiving palifermin with age ≥ 65 years. However, due to the small number of patients, results for the rate of granulocytopenia in these age subsets were inconclusive. The occurrence of visual adverse events after palifermin administration is of theoretical concern since KGF receptors have been shown to be present on the lens of the eye, i.e., the cornea and crystalline lens.  Based  on  the  available  data,  the  risk  associated  with  the  administration  of  palifermin  and  the development  of  cataracts  or  worsening  of  pre-existing  cataracts,  was  low.  Visual  adverse  events identified through post-marketing surveillance  will be included in periodic safety  update reports. A warning has been included in the SPC (see section 4.4) as regard to the absence of knowledge on the long term effects on the lens of the eye. Pre-clinical studies have indicated irreversible thyroid changes in rat (studies T95-KGF-001 and T95KGF-002). Justification for not testing thyroid function was based on the probability that the effects seen in rat thyroid may be an indirect result of the pharmacological effects of palifermin on rat liver and the absence of similar findings in the monkey studies. In addition a Phase I clinical study did not suggest  significant  evidence  of  thyroid  toxicity  and  the  incidence  of  thyroid  related  adverse  events reported form the pivotal trial was low and similar between the two treatment groups . The justification provided was considered acceptable and the CHMP concluded that palifermin did not have an effect on thyroid function in humans at the doses and schedule tested. No  safety  data  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other  interactions  have  been  reported.  The potential  interaction  between  filgrastim  and  palifermin  has  been  discussed.  The  applicant  has presented  several arguments  to  support the  absence  of  risk  of  interaction:  Biologically,  G-CSF and KGF  bind  to  different  receptors  expressed  by  different  cells  and  tissues.  In  addition,  in in  vitro experiments, palifermin had no effect on G-CSF induced CFUs (data not provided), and in the clinical trials  conducted  in  the  hematologic  settings,  the  kinetics  of  ANC  recovery  were  similar  between treatment  groups,  indicating  that  palifermin  did  not  affect  filgrastim  activity.  Morover,  the  antimucositis activity of palifermin, observed in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving multicycle  chemotherapy,  where  filgrastim  administration  was  low  (approximately  15%),  supported  the lack  of  interaction  of  filgrastim  with  palifermin  activity  on  oral  mucosa  protection  from  cytotoxic insults.  Even  if  a  potential  interaction  with  filgrastim  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out,  the  risk  for palifermin to interact with other medicinal products was considered low and appropriate information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

not recommended unless clearly necessary (see SPC, sections 4.2 and 4.6, respectively). As it is not known whether palifermin is excreted in human milk, it should not be administered to women who are breast-feeding  (see  SPC,  section  4.6).  No  studies  on  the  effects  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use machines have been performed (see SPC, section 4.7). The SPC contraindicates the use of palifermin in patients with hypersensitivity to palifermin or to any of the excipients of the medicinal product, or to Escherichia coli -derived proteins (see sections 4.3).

There were no major concerns arising from the results of the non-clinical toxicological studies. The findings were generally evidence of the pharmacological activity of rHuKGF, and mostly reversible. Safety margins could not always be calculated, partly because pharmacological effects occurred at all doses, or because rHuKGF was not measurable at the NOEL. Margins that could be calculated, based on NOAELs, were low but acceptable.

The  maximum amount  of palifermin that  can  be  safely  administered  in  a  single  dose  has  not  been determined.  A dose of 250 µg/kg has been administered intravenously to 8 healthy volunteers without serious adverse effects (see SPC section 4.9). To date, no significant effect of palifermin on long-term disease outcomes in this patient population has  been  observed.  However,  the  long-term  safety  of  palifermin  has  not  been  fully  evaluated  with respect to overall survival, progression free survival and secondary malignancies and the safety of the product  has  not  been  established  in  patients  with  KGF  receptors  expressing  non-haematological malignancies (see SPC, section 4.4). Secondary malignancies after ionising radiation and antineoplastic  drugs  usually  show  a  peak  between  5-10  years  and  long-term  follow-up  is  essential since  in  the  haematology  transplant  indications,  development  of  non-haematological,  secondary tumours are a major concern. Although there were no major concerns regarding immunogenicity, there were however, no data beyond 3 months. Annual safety data updates on the ongoing long-term followup studies 960226 and 990123 will be provided to the CHMP. Moreover, the Center for International Blood  and  Marrow  Transplant  Research  (CIBMTR)  databases  will  be  used  to  identify  cases  of suspected secondary malignancies and cancer relapse. The proposed risk management plan, including the use of the CIBMTR, has been considered satisfactory. 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment Quality During development of the manufacturing process, different process development stages in different manufacturing sites have been documented.  The applicant has provided adequate data to demonstrate comparability of commercial and clinical trial batches. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Palifermin is a human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli .  KGF is a protein that targets  epithelial  cells by binding to specific  cell-surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, and upregulation of cytoprotective mechanisms (eg, induction of antioxidant enzymes).  Palifermin differs from endogenous human KGF in that the first 23 N-terminal amino acids have been deleted to improve protein stability. Epithelial protection by exogenously administered rHuKGF has been demonstrated in animal models of  gastrointestinal  injury  induced  by  radiation  or  chemotherapy,  oral  mucosal  toxicity  induced  by radiation or chemoradiotherapy, and acute and chronic salivary gland toxicity (xerostomia) induced by radiation. In addition, murine and non-human primate models of lethal irradiation and transplantation with bone marrow were studied. These models were appropriate for the intended clinical indication. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated approximately dose proportional increases in systemic exposure following single i.v. administration to rats, monkeys and mice. The effective half-life (t1/2) ranged  from  approximately 1 to 4 hours in these species. Elimination of palifermin-related  material occurs  mainly  by  the  renal  route  and  exposure  doubled  in  bilaterally-nephrectomised  rats.  Similar increases in exposure may also occur in renally-impaired patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Efficacy

A  phase  III,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial,  has  shown  that,  in patients with hematologic malignancies (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,  Hodgkin's disease, acute myelogenous  leukaemia,  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia,  chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic  leukaemia  or multiple  myeloma)  who  received  TBI  plus  high-dose  chemotherapy followed  by  autologous  PBPC  transplantation,  the  mean  (SD)  duration  of  WHO  grade  3  or  4  oral mucositis in the palifermin group (3.7 [4.1] days) was 64% lower than in the placebo group (10.4 [6.2] days)  for  the  mITT  population.  The  reduction  was  statistically  significant  (p  &lt;  0.001)  and  was reproducible across study  centers, underlying  disease, and  number  of radiotherapy  fractions  used in the  TBI  conditioning  regimen.  The  secondary  assessment  of  mouth  and  throat  soreness  showed  a lower  score  (indicating  less  soreness)  in  the  palifermin  group versus the  placebo  group,  with  a reduction of 38% of the mean (SD) AUC. The incidence of WHO grade 4 oral mucositis was 62% of patients in the placebo group and 20%  of patients in the palifermin group (p &lt; 0.001). The  median cumulative  dose  of  opioid  analgesic  used  for  oral  mucositis  was  211.6  mg  in  the palifermin  group compared with 534.9 mg in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of opioid use was 78% for the palifermin group and 97% for the placebo group (p &lt; 0.001).

For regimens used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies that are not associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis, no evidence has been provided to confirm that the risk of treatment is still outweighed by the benefit when the symptoms experienced by the patient are much milder than those seen in the pivotal trial. Safety Overall,  the  safety  results  analysed  showed  that  palifermin  was  well tolerated.  Adverse  events  that occurred ≥ 5% more often in palifermin than placebo were rash, fever, pruritus, erythema, edema, oral lesion, pain, and granulocytopenia. These adverse events were reversible, usually mild in severity, and infrequently led to  discontinuation  of  dosing. Skin (e.g., rash, pruritus,  erythema, and  oedema) and oral (e.g., mouth/tongue  discoloration or thickness,  and taste disorders)  adverse events  were considered  possibly  related  to  the  pharmacologic  action  of  palifermin  on  KGFR-expressing  tissues. However,  these  adverse  effects  have  been  consistently  notable  among  all  oncology  patient  groups including haematological,  head  and  neck  and colorectal  malignancies, despite  differences in  dosage and treatment schedules. The association of these events with palifermin treatment was more apparent before  administration of cytotoxic  therapy.  However,  after  cytotoxic  therapy,  a  high  level  of background toxicities has complicated accurate interpretation of the data. In all settings studied, palifermin was associated with transient, asymptomatic elevations of amylase (62%  of  patients  receiving  palifermin versus 54%  receiving  placebo)  and  lipase  (27%  of  patients receiving  palifermin versus 23%  receiving  placebo).  Clinical  signs  of  overt  pancreatitis  were  not associated  with  these  increases.  In  the  fractionated  chemoradiotherapy  setting  in  patients  with advanced head and neck cancer, grade 3 decreases in ANC occurred in a higher proportion of patients in  the  palifermin  group  (22%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (2%).  The  potential  occurrence  of  visual adverse events after palifermin administration is of theoretical concern since KGF receptors have been shown to be present on the lens of the eye. Based on the available data, the risk associated with the administration of palifermin and the development of cataracts or worsening of pre-existing cataracts was low. The  long-term  safety  of  palifermin  has  not  been  fully  evaluated  with  respect  to  overall  survival, progression  free  survival  and  secondary  malignancies,  and  the  safety  of  the  product  has  not  been established  in  patients  with  KGF  receptors  expressing  non-haematological  malignancies.  Annual safety  data  updates  on  the  ongoing  long-term  follow-up  studies  will  be  provided  to  the  CHMP. Moreover, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) databases, which are  part  of  the  risk  management  plan,  will  be  used  to  identify  cases  of  suspected  secondary malignancies and cancer relapse.

## Benefit/risk assessment

The indication was supported by one pivotal phase III and one phase II study. Based on the results of the clinical studies described in this application, the efficacy of palifermin has been demonstrated for the  prevention  and  treatment  of  mucositis  following  TBI  and  myeloablative  chemotherapy.  In  the pivotal phase III study, assessing a pre-post 6-dose regimen of palifermin, the statistically significant reduction seen in the median duration of WHO grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis (9 days in the placebo group versus 3  days  in  the  palifermin  group),  the  primary  endpoint,  was  supported  by  statistically significant reductions in duration of oral mucositis as assessed by other validated oral mucositis rating scales.  Consistent  results  were  observed  in  terms  of  secondary  endpoints,  i.e.,  the  incidence,  the severity of oral mucositis and the requirements for opioid analgesia.

The  incidence  and  severity  of  oral  mucositis  varies  significantly  across  different  conditioning regimens, ranging from approximately 20% incidence of grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis observed with the BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, Ara-C, and melphalan) regimen to approximately 50% incidence reported with melphalan-based regimens [52], and up to approximately 95% incidence for TBI-based regimens. The  choice  of  the  myelotoxic  regimen  used  in  the  pivotal  trial  (TBI  followed  by  high-dose chemotherapy), a standard treatment regimen used in North America, associated with a high rate of grade 3/4 oral mucositis, is not used as routinely in Europe, where less mucotoxic chemotherapy-only regimens (such as BEAM) are usually administered. Nevertheless, some chemotherapy-only regimens do give rise to a comparatively high incidence of mucositis. Thus, the question of appropriateness of results  extrapolation  from  TBI-based  regimens  to  other  chemotherapy-based  conditioning  regimens has  been  debated.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  observed  in  patients  undergoing myeloablative regimens could not be extrapolated to less mucotoxic regimens. However, concerning non-TBI regimens, given that the underlying pathophysiology of oral mucositis is  essentially  the  same  regardless  of  the  type  of  chemo-radiotherapy  regimen  that  caused  it,  it  was considered that the clinical benefit seen in the phase III study could be extrapolated to myeloablative chemotherapy  conditioning  regimens  associated  with  high  incidence  of  severe  oral  mucositis. Furthermore,  considering the limited  clinical data in the  allogeneic transplant setting and the safety concerns  in  allogeneic  transplants  as  regards  the  development  of  graft versus host  disease,  the indication  has  been  restricted  to  patients  with  haematological  malignancies receiving  myeloablative therapy requiring autologous haemopoietic stem cell support (see SPC section 4.1). In  terms  of  safety,  palifermin  was  in  general  well  tolerated.  The  most  frequent  adverse  events,  i.e. gastrointestinal disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, were consistent with the pharmacologic action  on  KGFR-expressing  tissues.  To  date,  no  significant  effect  of  palifermin  on long-term  disease  outcomes  in  this  patient  population  has  been  observed.  However,  the  long-term safety  of  palifermin  has  not  been  fully  evaluated  with  respect  to  overall  survival,  progression  free survival and secondary malignancies and the safety of the product has not been established in patients with KGF receptors expressing non-haematological malignancies. Overall,  the  benefit/risk  profile  for  palifermin  is  considered  favourable  to  decrease  the  incidence, duration  and  severity  of  oral  mucositis  in  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  receiving myeloablative therapy associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous haemopoietic stem cell support. Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Kepivance (palifermin) indicated to decrease the incidence, the duration  and  severity  of  oral  mucositis  in  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  receiving myeloablative therapy associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous haemopoietic stem cell support was favourable.
