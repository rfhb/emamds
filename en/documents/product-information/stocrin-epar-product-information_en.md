## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

STOCRIN 30 mg/mL oral solution

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each mL contains 30 mg of efavirenz.

Excipients with known effect Each mL contains 1 mg of benzoic acid (E210). Each mL contains up to 0.816 mg of benzyl alcohol (E1519).

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Oral solution

Colourless to slightly yellow clear liquid.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

STOCRIN oral solution is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 years of age and older, who are unable to swallow the film-coated tablets.

STOCRIN has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients with CD4 counts &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 , or after f ailure of  protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. Although cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present insufficient data on the ef f icacy of  subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of regimens containing STOCRIN.

For a summary of clinical and pharmacodynamic information, see section 5.1.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

Posology

Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5).

Efavirenz oral solution may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).

In order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is recommended during the first two to four weeks of therapy and in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.8).

## Adults

The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 24 mL orally, once daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dose adjustment

If  ef avirenz is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the ef avirenz dose must be reduced by 50 %, i.e., to 300 mg once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be restored (see section 4.5).

If  ef avirenz is coadministered with rif ampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5).

## Children and adolescents (3 to 17 years)

The recommended dose of efavirenz oral solution in combination with a PI and/or NRTIs for patients between 3 and 17 years of age is described in Table 1. Ef avirenz f ilm-coated tablets must only be administered to children who are able to reliably swallow tablets.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1 % of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of  3 years or weighing less than 13 kg have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2).

Co-administration with terf enadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (f or example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5).

Patients with:

-         a f amily history of  sudden death or of congenital prolongation of  the QTc interval on electrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval.
-         a history of  symptomatic cardiac arrythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with congestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction.
-         severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g., hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.

Patients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval (proarrhythmic). These drugs include:

- -antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III,
- -neuroleptics, antidepressive agents,
- -certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antif ungal agents,
- -certain non-sedating antihistamines (terf enadine, astemizole),
- -cisapride,
- -flecainide,
- -certain antimalarials,
- -methadone.

Co-administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected significant decreases in elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). This effect is due to an induction of CYP3A4 or P-gp by efavirenz and is expected to result in the loss of virologic response of elbasvir/grazoprevir.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Efavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a f ailing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when ef avirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration the potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1).

Co-administration of efavirenz with a f ixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil, is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with rif ampicin).

Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect. Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with ef avirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5).

When prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should ref er to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics.

If  any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected intolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of all antiretroviral medicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon resolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of antiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential f or selection of resistant virus.

## Rash

Mild-to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of  rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

has been reported in less than 1 % of  patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of  erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1 %. Efavirenz must be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever. If  therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting therapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8).

Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited (see section 4.8). Ef avirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a lif e-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI.

## Psychiatric symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a prior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of  these serious psychiatric adverse reactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. There have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of  ef avirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).

## Nervous system symptoms

Symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed that if  they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not predictive of subsequent onset of  any of the less f requent psychiatric symptoms.

Late-onset neurotoxicity, including ataxia and encephalopathy (impaired consciousness, confusion, psychomotor slowing, psychosis, delirium), may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy. Some events of late-onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms, which are associated with increased efavirenz levels despite standard dosing of STOCRIN. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated promptly to assess the possibility that these events may be related to ef avirenz use, and whether discontinuation of STOCRIN is warranted.

## Seizures

Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with efavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures.

## Hepatic events

A few of the post-marketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identif iable risk f actors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors.

## QTc Prolongation

QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of ef avirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consider alternatives to efavirenz f or co-administration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of  Torsade de Pointes.

## Immune Reactivation Syndrome

In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the f irst f ew weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inf lammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Weight and metabolic parameters

An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if  they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Special populations

## Liver disease

Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to determine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution must be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see section 4.2).

The safety and efficacy of efavirenz has not been established in patients with signif icant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with pre-existing liver dysf unction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased f requency of  liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benef it of continued therapy with ef avirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of signif icant liver toxicity. In such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8).

In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver enzymes is also recommended. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please ref er also to the relevant product inf ormation f or these medicinal products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal insufficiency

The pharmacokinetics of ef avirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insuff iciency; however, less than 1 % of an ef avirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of  renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in patients with severe renal f ailure and close safety monitoring is recommended in this population.

## Elderly patients

Insufficient numbers of older patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether they respond dif f erently than younger patients.

## Paediatric population

Efavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 years of age or who weigh less than 13 kg. Evidence exists indicating that ef avirenz may have altered pharmacokinetics in very young children. For this reason, ef avirenz oral solution should not be given to children less than 3 years of age.

Rash was reported in 26 of 57 children (46 %) treated with efavirenz during a 48-week period and was severe in three patients. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered.

## Benzyl alcohol (E1519)

Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In vitro ef avirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Ef avirenz may be an inducer of  CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net ef f ect of  co-administration with substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2).

Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or food (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity.

Compounds or herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John's wort) which induce these enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St.  John's wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Co-administration of efavirenz with metamizole, which is an inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz with potential decrease in clinical ef f icacy. Theref ore, caution is advised when metamizole and ef avirenz are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or drug levels should be monitored as appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## QT Prolonging Drugs

Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval and Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of  classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of  the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antif ungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics (terf enadine, astemizole), cisapride, f lecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3).

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## Contraindications of concomitant use

Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, lif e-threatening events (see section 4.3).

Efavirenz must not be administered with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected significant decreases in elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins and which are expected to result in the loss of virologic response of elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5).

## St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )

Co-administration of efavirenz and St. John's wort or herbal preparations containing St. John's wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of ef avirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John's wort due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John's wort. If  a patient is already taking St. John's wort, stop St. John's wort, check viral levels and if  possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John's wort and the dose of ef avirenz may need adjusting. The inducing effect of St. John's wort may persist for at least 2 weeks af ter cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).

## Praziquantel

Concomitant use with praziquantel is not recommended due to significant decrease in plasma concentrations of praziquantel, with risk of treatment f ailure due to increased hepatic metabolism by efavirenz. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of praziquantel could be considered.

## Other interactions

Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as '↑', decrease as '↓', no change as '↔', and once every 8 or 12 hours as 'q8h' or 'q12h'). If available, 90 % or 95 % confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.

| Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and other anticonvulsants that are substrates of CYP450 isoenzymes | Interaction not studied. There is a potential for reduction or increase in the plasma concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital and other anticonvulsants that are substrates ofCYP450 isoenzymes when co-administered with efavirenz.                            | When efavirenz is co-administered with an anticonvulsant that is a substrate ofCYP450 isoenzymes, periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant levels should be conducted.                      |

Other interactions: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is recommended in such cases.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males and females

Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-lif e of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is recommended.

## Pregnancy

Efavirenz should not be used during pregnancy, unless the patient's clinical condition requires such treatment. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of efavirenz (see section 5.3).

There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-containing f ixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with a f ixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil. A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the denominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development (at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy.

As of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-ef avirenz-containing regimens, as well as those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births.

Malformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

Efavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of  ef avirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the inf ant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ef avirenz. It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

The effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that achieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given recommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid), and did not af f ect sperm or of fspring of treated male rats (doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given efavirenz was not affected.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Efavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be instructed that if  they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety prof ile

Efavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5 % of patients were rash (11.6 %), dizziness (8.5 %), nausea (8.0 %), headache (5.7 %) and fatigue (5.5 %). The most notable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms (see section 4.4). Nervous system symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the f irst 2 - 4 weeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric adverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and seizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz.

The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received ef avirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not associated with any new safety concerns.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions of moderate or greater severity with at least possible relationship to treatment regimen (based on investigator attribution) reported in clinical trials of ef avirenz at the recommended dose in combination therapy (n = 1,008) are listed below. Also listed in italics are adverse reactions observed post-marketing in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens. Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10);  uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000, &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Information regarding post-marketing surveillance

‡ These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance; however, the frequencies were determined using data from 16 clinical trials (n=3,969).

‡‡ These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance but not reported as drug-related events f or ef avirenz-treated patients in 16 clinical trials. The f requency category of \"rare\" was defined per A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (rev. 2, Sept 2009) on the basis of  an estimated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 0 events given the number of patients treated with efavirenz in these clinical trials (n=3,969).

## Rash

In clinical studies, 26 % of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared with 17 % of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18 % of patients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1 % of patients treated with efavirenz, and 1.7 % discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1 %.

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is restarted.

Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Reported rates of  recurrent rash f ollowing a switch f rom nevirapine to ef avirenz therapy, primarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18 %, comparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.)

## Psychiatric symptoms

Serious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials the f requency of specif ic serious psychiatric events were:

|                              | Efavirenz regimen (n=1,008)   | Control regimen (n=635)   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| - severe depression          | 1.6%                          | 0.6%                      |
| - suicidal ideation          | 0.6%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - non-fatal suicide attempts | 0.4%                          | 0%                        |
| - aggressive behaviour       | 0.4%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - paranoid reactions         | 0.4%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - manic reactions            | 0.1%                          | 0%                        |

Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse reactions with frequencies of each of the above events ranging from 0.3 % for manic reactions to 2.0 % for both severe depression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of  death by suicide, delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia.

## Nervous system symptoms

In clinical controlled trials, f requently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to: dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19 % (severe 2.0 %) of patients compared to 9 % (severe 1 %) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2 % of patients treated with ef avirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms.

Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the f irst 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of  uninf ected volunteers, a representative nervous system

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

symptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased ef avirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of therapy and in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or splitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit.

Analysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.

Ataxia and encephalopathy associated with high levels of  ef avirenz, occurring months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy have been reported post-marketing (see section 4.4).

## Hepatic failure

A few of the post-marketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterised by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.

## Immune Reactivation Syndrome

In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

## Osteonecrosis

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Laboratory test abnormalities

Liver enzymes: Elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3 % of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8 % after longterm treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens (5 % after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4 % of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5 - 2 % of patients treated with control regimens (7 % of efavirenz-treated patients and 3 % of  control-treated patients af ter long-term treatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. In the long-term study (006), 1 % of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or biliary system disorders.

Amylase: In the clinical trial subset of  1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were seen in 10 % of patients treated with efavirenz and 6 % of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical signif icance of  asymptomatic increases in serum amylase is unknown.

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

Undesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of  adult patients. Rash was reported more frequently in children (in a clinical study including 57 children who received efavirenz during a 48-week period, rash was reported in 46 %) and was more often of higher grade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 5.3 % of children). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered. Although nervous system symptoms are difficult f or young children to report, they appear to be less f requent in children and were generally mild. In the study of 57 children, 3.5 % of patients experienced nervous system symptoms of moderate intensity, predominantly dizziness. No child had severe symptoms or had to discontinue because of nervous system symptoms. Diarrhoea occurred in six of nineteen (32 %) children, aged 3 - 8 years, who took efavirenz oral solution in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.

## Other special populations

## Liver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients

In the long-term data set f rom study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening f or hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected patients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13 % of efavirenz treated patients and in 7 % of  controls, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20 % and 7 % respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3 % of those treated with efavirenz and 2 % in the control arm discontinued because of liver disorders (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions.

Treatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of  the patient's clinical status. Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for overdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove signif icant quantities of it f rom blood.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. ATC code: J05A G03

## Mechanism of action

Efavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and does not signif icantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases ( /uniF061 , /uniF062 , /uniF067 or /uniF064 ).

## Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of ef avirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo controlled, f ixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz concentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in subjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days (see section 4.5).

## Antiviral activity

The free concentration of ef avirenz required f or 90 to 95 % inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures.

## Resistance

The potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions 48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to that observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-f old resistance). Greater than 100-fold loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing K103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT.

K103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who experienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with indinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90 % of patients receiving efavirenz with virological f ailure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The pattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to ef avirenz was independent of the other antiviral medicinal products used in combination with efavirenz.

## Cross-resistance

Cross resistance profiles f or ef avirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-resistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N substitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of  RT was not cross-resistant to efavirenz.

Viral isolates recovered f rom PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed evidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen isolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and delavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates tested remained sensitive to ef avirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and delavirdine.

The potential f or cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the dif ferent enzyme targets involved. The potential f or cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the different binding sites on the target and mechanism of action.

## Clinical eff icacy

Efavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely with CD4 counts &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 , or in PI or NNRTI-experienced patients. Clinical experience in controlled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients over 24 weeks. In these studies the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir was 1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without efavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs given every 12 hours were used in each of these studies.

Study 006, a randomised, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be ef avirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 341 cells/mm 3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/mL. Efficacy results for study 006 on a subset of 614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 3. In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early f or any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/mL at the missing time points.

Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV +IDV, 196 patients with EFV + ZDV + 3TC and 127 patients with IDV + ZDV + 3TC, respectively), suggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL, HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

Efficacy results for studies ACTG 364 and 020 are f ound in Table 4. Study ACTG 364 enrolled 196 patients who had been treated with NRTIs but not with PIs or NNRTIs. Study 020 enrolled 327 patients who had been treated with NRTIs but not with PIs or NNRTIs. Physicians were allowed to change their patient's NRTI regimen upon entry into the study. Responder rates were highest in patients who switched NRTIs.

Paediatric population: ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs. The starting dose of efavirenz was the equivalent of a 600 mg dose (adjusted from calculated body size based on weight). The response rate, based on the NC = F analysis of the percentage of patients with plasma HIV-RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 60 % (95 %, C.I. 47, 72), and 53 % (C.I. 40, 66) based on percentage of patients with plasma HIV-RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL. The mean CD4 cell counts were increased by 63 /uniF0B1 34.5 cells/mm 3 f rom baseline. The durability of  the response was similar to that seen in adult patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 /uniF06D M were attained by 5 hours following single oral doses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and AUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting diminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not change following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days.

In HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady state Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 /uniF06D M (29 %) [mean ± S.D. (% C.V.)], steady state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 /uniF06D M (57 %), and AUC was 184 ± 73 /uniF06D M·h (40 %).

## Effect of f ood

The AUC and Cmax of a single 240 mg dose of efavirenz oral solution in uninfected adult volunteers was increased by 30 % and 43 % respectively, when given with a high-fat meal, relative to fasted conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75 %) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at least one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19 % (mean 0.69 %) of  the corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-protein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma.

## Biotransformation

Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for ef avirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations well above those achieved clinically.

Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, the potential for an increased frequency and severity of  efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be excluded.

Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple doses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation (22 - 42 % lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see below). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 substrate) are reduced in the presence of  ef avirenz (see section 4.5, table 2).

Although in vitro data suggest that ef avirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been contradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when coadministered with efavirenz in vivo . The net effect of  co-administration is not clear.

## Elimination

Efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-lif e of at least 52 hours af ter single doses and 40 - 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34 % of a radiolabelled dose of  ef avirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1 % of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz.

## Hepatic impairment

In a single-dose study, half-lif e was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. A multipledose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insuf ficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics.

## Gender, race, elderly

Although limited data suggest that f emales as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

In 17 paediatric patients receiving an investigational oral solution similar to the commercial formulation adjusted on the basis of body size to be equivalent to an adult 600 mg capsule dose, the steady-state Cmax was 11.8 /uniF06D M, steady state Cmin was 5.2 /uniF06D M, and AUC was 188 /uniF06D M·h. In the subset of 6 children aged 3 - 5 who were compliant with their drug regimen, the mean AUC was 147 /uniF06D M·h, which was 23 % lower than expected. Therefore, the dosage recommendation provided in Table 1 incorporates a higher dose of efavirenz oral solution for these younger children.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Efavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.

Efavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microphthalmia was observed in another f oetus, and clef t palate was observed in a third f oetus. No malf ormations were observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits.

Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given ef avirenz f or ≥ 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Carcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour f ormation and the potential relevance for humans are not known.

Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benef it of  ef avirenz outweighs the potential carcinogenic risk to humans.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

STOCRIN is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 years of age and older.

STOCRIN has not been adequately studied in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely in patients with CD4 counts &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 , or after f ailure of  protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. Although cross-resistance of efavirenz with PIs has not been documented, there are at present insufficient data on the ef f icacy of  subsequent use of PI based combination therapy after failure of regimens containing STOCRIN.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For a summary of clinical and pharmacodynamic information, see section 5.1.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

## Posology

Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.5).

In order to improve the tolerability of nervous system adverse reactions, bedtime dosing is recommended (see section 4.8).

## Adults

The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with or without a PI (see section 4.5) is 600 mg orally, once daily.

## Dose adjustment

If  ef avirenz is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the ef avirenz dose must be reduced by 50 %, i.e., to 300 mg once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dose of efavirenz should be restored (see section 4.5).

If  ef avirenz is coadministered with rif ampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg/day may be considered (see section 4.5).

## Children and adolescents (3 to 17 years)

The recommended dose of efavirenz in combination with a PI and/or NRTIs for patients between 3 and 17 years of  age is described in Table 1. Ef avirenz tablets must only be administered to children who are able to reliably swallow tablets.

/uniF02A Efavirenz 50 mg, 200 mg and 600 mg film-coated tablets are available.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1 % of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with mild liver disease may be treated with their normally recommended dose of efavirenz. Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of efavirenz in children below the age of  3 years or weighing less than 13 kg have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

It is recommended that STOCRIN be taken on an empty stomach. The increased efavirenz concentrations observed following administration of STOCRIN with food may lead to an increase in frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (see section 5.2).

Co-administration with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (f or example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions [f or example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).

Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of  ef avirenz (see section 4.5).

Patients with:

-         a f amily history of  sudden death or of  congenital prolongation of  the QTc interval on electrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval.
-         a history of  symptomatic cardiac arrythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with congestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction.
-         severe disturbances of  electrolyte balance e.g., hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.

Patients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval (proarrhythmic). These drugs include:

- -antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III,
- -neuroleptics, antidepressive agents,
- -certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, f luoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antif ungal agents,
- -certain non-sedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole),
- -cisapride,
- -flecainide,
- -certain antimalarials,
- -methadone.

Co-administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected signif icant decreases in elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). This effect is due to an induction of CYP3A4 or P-gp by efavirenz and is expected to result in the loss of virologic response of elbasvir/grazoprevir.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Efavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV or added on as a sole agent to a f ailing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agent(s) to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration the potential for viral cross-resistance (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of efavirenz with a fixed combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil, is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (for example, with rif ampicin).

Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic ef f ect. Co-administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5).

When prescribing medicinal products concomitantly with efavirenz, physicians should ref er to the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics.

If any antiretroviral medicinal product in a combination regimen is interrupted because of suspected intolerance, serious consideration should be given to simultaneous discontinuation of  all antiretroviral medicinal products. The antiretroviral medicinal products should be restarted at the same time upon resolution of the intolerance symptoms. Intermittent monotherapy and sequential reintroduction of antiretroviral agents is not advisable because of the increased potential f or selection of  resistant virus.

## Rash

Mild-to-moderate rash has been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz and usually resolves with continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration has been reported in less than 1 % of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1 %. Efavirenz must be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever. If therapy with efavirenz is discontinued, consideration should also be given to interrupting therapy with other antiretroviral agents to avoid development of resistant virus (see section 4.8).

Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited (see section 4.8). Ef avirenz is not recommended for patients who have had a lif e-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking another NNRTI.

## Psychiatric symptoms

Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with ef avirenz. Patients with a prior history of  psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse reactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. There have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).

## Nervous system symptoms

Symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming are frequently reported adverse reactions in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the f irst one or two days of therapy and generally resolve af ter the f irst 2 - 4 weeks. Patients should be informed that if  they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not predictive of subsequent onset of any of  the less f requent psychiatric symptoms.

Late-onset neurotoxicity, including ataxia and encephalopathy (impaired consciousness, confusion, psychomotor slowing, psychosis, delirium), may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy. Some events of late-onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with CYP2B6 genetic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

polymorphisms, which are associated with increased efavirenz levels despite standard dosing of STOCRIN. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated promptly to assess the possibility that these events may be related to ef avirenz use, and whether discontinuation of STOCRIN is warranted.

## Seizures

Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of  known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of  plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with efavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures.

## Hepatic events

A few of the post-marketing reports of hepatic f ailure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identif iable risk f actors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysf unction or other risk f actors.

## QTc Prolongation

QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).

Consider alternatives to efavirenz f or co-administration with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes or when to be administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.

## Effect of f ood

The administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may lead to an increase in the f requency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime.

## Immune Reactivation Syndrome

In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inf lammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of  CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inf lammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Weight and metabolic parameters

An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment ef f ect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if  they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Special populations

## Liver disease

Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2) and not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of insufficient data to determine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with chronic liver disease, caution must be exercised in administering efavirenz to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored carefully for dose-related adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see section 4.2).

The safety and ef f icacy of  ef avirenz has not been established in patients with signif icant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at increased risk for severe and potentially f atal hepatic adverse reactions. Patients with pre-existing liver dysf unction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If  there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of  serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benef it of continued therapy with efavirenz needs to be weighed against the potential risks of  signif icant liver toxicity. In such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8).

In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver enzymes is also recommended. In case of  concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.

## Renal insufficiency

The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insuf f iciency; however, less than 1 % of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2). There is no experience in patients with severe renal f ailure and close saf ety monitoring is recommended in this population.

## Elderly patients

Insufficient numbers of older patients have been evaluated in clinical studies to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.

## Paediatric population

Efavirenz has not been evaluated in children below 3 years of age or who weigh less than 13 kg. Therefore, efavirenz should not be given to children less than 3 years of  age.

Rash was reported in 26 of 57 children (46 %) treated with efavirenz during a 48-week period and was severe in three patients. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with efavirenz in children may be considered.

## Lactose

Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. Individuals with these conditions may take efavirenz oral solution, which is free f rom lactose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium

These medicinal products contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per f ilm-coated tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium f ree'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In vitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net ef f ect of  co-administration with substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2).

Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, ritonavir) or food (for example, grapefruit juice), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity.

Compounds or herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John's wort) which induce these enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St.  John's wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Co-administration of efavirenz with metamizole, which is an inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz with potential decrease in clinical ef f icacy. Theref ore, caution is advised when metamizole and efavirenz are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or drug levels should be monitored as appropriate.

## QT Prolonging Drugs

Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval and Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of  the f ollowing classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antif ungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics (terf enadine, astemizole), cisapride, f lecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3).

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## Contraindications of concomitant use

Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (f or example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, lif e-threatening events (see section 4.3).

Efavirenz must not be administered with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected significant decreases in elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations caused by induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins and which are expected to result in the loss of virologic response of elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )

Co-administration of ef avirenz and St. John's wort or herbal preparations containing St. John's wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John's wort due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John's wort. If  a patient is already taking St. John's wort, stop St. John's wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John's wort and the dose of efavirenz may need adjusting. The inducing eff ect of  St. John's wort may persist f or at least 2 weeks af ter cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).

## Praziquantel

Concomitant use with praziquantel is not recommended due to significant decrease in plasma concentrations of praziquantel, with risk of treatment f ailure due to increased hepatic metabolism by efavirenz. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of praziquantel could be considered.

## Other interactions

Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as '↑', decrease as '↓', no change as '↔', and once every 8 or 12 hours as 'q8h' or 'q12h'). If available, 90 % or 95 % confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. Studies were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.

Other interactions: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is recommended in such cases.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males and females

Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5). Because of the long half-lif e of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of efavirenz is recommended.

## Pregnancy

Efavirenz should not be used during pregnancy, unless the patient's clinical condition requires such treatment. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of efavirenz (see section 5.3).

There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any efavirenz-containing f ixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 prospective and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been reported with a f ixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil. A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and the denominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal development (at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 904 pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live births. One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other birth defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-ef avirenz-containing regimens, as well as those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births.

Malformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

Efavirenz has been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of  ef avirenz in newborns/infants. Risk to the inf ant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ef avirenz. It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

The effect of efavirenz on male and female fertility in rats has only been evaluated at doses that achieved systemic drug exposures equivalent to or below those achieved in humans given recommended doses of efavirenz. In these studies, efavirenz did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats (doses up to 100 mg/kg/bid), and did not af f ect sperm or of fspring of treated male rats (doses up to 200 mg/bid). The reproductive performance of offspring born to female rats given efavirenz was not affected.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Efavirenz may cause dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or somnolence. Patients should be instructed that if  they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety prof ile

Efavirenz has been studied in over 9,000 patients. In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5 % of patients were rash (11.6 %), dizziness (8.5 %), nausea (8.0 %), headache (5.7 %) and fatigue (5.5 %). The most notable adverse reactions associated with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. Nervous system symptoms usually begin soon after therapy onset and generally resolve after the first 2 - 4 weeks. Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; psychiatric adverse reactions including severe depression, death by suicide, and psychosis like behaviour; and seizures have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. The administration of ef avirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.4).

The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks). Long-term use of efavirenz in this study was not associated with any new safety concerns.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Information regarding post-marketing surveillance

‡ These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance; however, the frequencies were determined using data from 16 clinical trials (n=3,969).

‡‡ These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance but not reported as drug-related events f or ef avirenz-treated patients in 16 clinical trials. The f requency category of \"rare\" was defined per A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (rev. 2, Sept 2009) on the basis of  an estimated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for 0 events given the number of patients treated with efavirenz in these clinical trials (n=3,969).

## Rash

In clinical studies, 26 % of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz experienced skin rash compared with 17 % of patients treated in control groups. Skin rash was considered treatment related in 18 % of patients treated with efavirenz. Severe rash occurred in less than 1 % of patients treated with efavirenz, and 1.7 % discontinued therapy because of rash. The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1 %.

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is restarted.

Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Reported rates of  recurrent rash following a switch f rom nevirapine to efavirenz therapy, primarily based on retrospective cohort data from published literature, range from 13 to 18 %, comparable to the rate observed in patients treated with efavirenz in clinical studies. (See section 4.4.)

## Psychiatric symptoms

Serious psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with ef avirenz. In controlled trials the f requency of specif ic serious psychiatric events were:

|                              | Efavirenz regimen (n=1,008)   | Control regimen (n=635)   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| - severe depression          | 1.6%                          | 0.6%                      |
| - suicidal ideation          | 0.6%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - non-fatal suicide attempts | 0.4%                          | 0%                        |
| - aggressive behaviour       | 0.4%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - paranoid reactions         | 0.4%                          | 0.3%                      |
| - manic reactions            | 0.1%                          | 0%                        |

Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse reactions with frequencies of each of the above events ranging f rom 0.3 % for manic reactions to 2.0 % for both severe depression and suicidal ideation. There have also been post-marketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, psychosis-like behaviour and catatonia.

## Nervous system symptoms

In clinical controlled trials, f requently reported adverse reactions included, but were not limited to: dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. Nervous system symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19 % (severe 2.0 %) of patients compared to 9 % (severe 1 %) of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2 % of patients treated with ef avirenz discontinued therapy due to such symptoms.

Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the f irst 2 - 4 weeks. In a study of  uninf ected volunteers, a representative nervous system symptom had a median time to onset of 1 hour post-dose and a median duration of 3 hours. Nervous system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased ef avirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms and can be recommended during the first weeks of  therapy and in patients who continue to experience these symptoms (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or splitting the daily dose has not been shown to provide benefit.

Analysis of long-term data showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.

Ataxia and encephalopathy associated with high levels of  ef avirenz, occurring months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy have been reported post-marketing (see section 4.4).

## Hepatic failure

A few of the post-marketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterised by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.

## Immune Reactivation Syndrome

In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of  treatment (see section 4.4).

## Osteonecrosis

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Laboratory test abnormalities

Liver enzymes: Elevations of AST and ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3 % of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8 % after long-term treatment in study 006). Similar elevations were seen in patients treated with control regimens (5 % after long-term treatment). Elevations of GGT to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4 % of all patients treated with 600 mg of  ef avirenz and 1.5 - 2 % of  patients treated with control regimens (7 % of efavirenz-treated patients and 3 % of control-treated patients af ter long-term treatment). Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction. In the long-term study (006), 1 % of patients in each treatment arm discontinued because of liver or biliary system disorders.

Amylase: In the clinical trial subset of 1,008 patients, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of  normal were seen in 10 % of patients treated with efavirenz and 6 % of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical signif icance of asymptomatic increases in serum amylase is unknown.

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

Undesirable effects in children were generally similar to those of  adult patients. Rash was reported more frequently in children (in a clinical study including 57 children who received efavirenz during a 48-week period, rash was reported in 46 %) and was more often of higher grade than in adults (severe rash was reported in 5.3 % of children). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines prior to initiating therapy with ef avirenz in children may be considered. Although nervous system symptoms are difficult f or young children to report, they appear to be less f requent in children and were generally mild. In the study of 57 children, 3.5 % of  patients experienced nervous system symptoms of moderate intensity, predominantly dizziness. No child had severe symptoms or had to discontinue because of nervous system symptoms.

## Other special populations

## Liver enzymes in hepatitis B or C co-infected patients

In the long-term data set f rom study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surf ace antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among co-infected patients in study 006, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13 % of efavirenz treated patients and in 7 % of controls, and elevations in ALT to greater than f ive times ULN developed in 20 % and 7 % respectively. Among co-infected patients, 3 % of those treated with efavirenz and 2 % in the control arm discontinued because of liver disorders (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment of overdose with efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. Administration of  activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for overdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove signif icant quantities of it f rom blood.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. ATC code: J05A G03

## Mechanism of action

Efavirenz is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and does not signif icantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases ( /uniF061 , /uniF062 , /uniF067 or /uniF064 ).

## Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo controlled, f ixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax observed in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz concentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in subjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days (see section 4.5).

## Antiviral activity

The free concentration of ef avirenz required f or 90 to 95 % inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/monocyte cultures.

## Resistance

The potency of efavirenz in cell culture against viral variants with amino acid substitutions at positions 48, 108, 179, 181 or 236 in RT or variants with amino acid substitutions in the protease was similar to that observed against wild type viral strains. The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-f old resistance). Greater than 100-f old loss of susceptibility was observed against HIV variants expressing K103N in addition to other amino acid substitutions in RT.

K103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who experienced a signif icant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of ef avirenz in combination with indinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This mutation was observed in 90 % of patients receiving efavirenz with virological f ailure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The pattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated with resistance to efavirenz was independent of the other antiviral medicinal products used in combination with efavirenz.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cross-resistance

Cross resistance profiles f or ef avirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in cell culture demonstrated that the K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. Two of three delavirdine-resistant clinical isolates examined were cross-resistant to efavirenz and contained the K103N substitution. A third isolate which carried a substitution at position 236 of  RT was not cross-resistant to ef avirenz.

Viral isolates recovered f rom PBMCs of patients enrolled in efavirenz clinical studies who showed evidence of treatment failure (viral load rebound) were assessed for susceptibility to NNRTIs. Thirteen isolates previously characterised as efavirenz-resistant were also resistant to nevirapine and delavirdine. Five of these NNRTI-resistant isolates were found to have K103N or a valine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 108 (V108I) in RT. Three of the efavirenz treatment failure isolates tested remained sensitive to ef avirenz in cell culture and were also sensitive to nevirapine and delavirdine.

The potential f or cross resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the dif ferent enzyme targets involved. The potential f or cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of  the dif f erent binding sites on the target and mechanism of action.

## Clinical eff icacy

Efavirenz has not been studied in controlled studies in patients with advanced HIV disease, namely with CD4 counts &lt; 50 cells/mm 3 , or in PI or NNRTI experienced patients. Clinical experience in controlled studies with combinations including didanosine or zalcitabine is limited.

Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients. Study 020 showed similar activity in NRTI-experienced patients over 24 weeks. In these studies the dose of efavirenz was 600 mg once daily; the dose of indinavir was 1,000 mg every 8 hours when used with efavirenz and 800 mg every 8 hours when used without efavirenz. The dose of nelfinavir was 750 mg given three times a day. The standard doses of NRTIs given every 12 hours were used in each of these studies.

Study 006, a randomised, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be ef avirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 341 cells/mm 3 and the mean baseline HIV-RNA level was 60,250 copies/mL. Efficacy results for study 006 on a subset of  614 patients who had been enrolled for at least 48 weeks are found in Table 3. In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early f or any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/mL at the missing time points.

Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV +IDV, 196 patients with EFV + ZDV + 3TC and 127 patients with IDV + ZDV + 3TC, respectively), suggest durability of  response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL, HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

Efficacy results for studies ACTG 364 and 020 are found in Table 4. Study ACTG 364 enrolled 196 patients who had been treated with NRTIs but not with PIs or NNRTIs. Study 020 enrolled 327 patients who had been treated with NRTIs but not with PIs or NNRTIs. Physicians were allowed to change their patient's NRTI regimen upon entry into the study. Responder rates were highest in patients who switched NRTIs.

Paediatric population: ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs. The starting dose of ef avirenz was the equivalent of a 600 mg dose (adjusted from calculated body size based on weight). The response rate, based on the NC = F analysis of the percentage of patients with plasma HIV-RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at 48 weeks was 60 % (95 %, C.I. 47, 72), and 53 % (C.I. 40, 66) based on percentage of patients with plasma HIV-RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL. The mean CD4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cell counts were increased by 63 /uniF0B1 34.5 cells/mm 3 f rom baseline. The durability of the response was similar to that seen in adult patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Peak efavirenz plasma concentrations of 1.6 - 9.1 /uniF06D M were attained by 5 hours following single oral doses of 100 mg to 1,600 mg administered to uninfected volunteers. Dose related increases in Cmax and AUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases were less than proportional suggesting diminished absorption at higher doses. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not change following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days.

In HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg daily doses. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady state Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 /uniF06D M (29 %) [mean ± S.D. (% C.V.)], steady state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 /uniF06D M (57 %), and AUC was 184 ± 73 /uniF06D M·h (40 %).

## Effect of f ood

The AUC and Cmax of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz film-coated tablets in uninfected volunteers was increased by 28 % (90 % CI: 22 - 33 %) and 79 % (90 % CI:58 - 102 %), respectively, when given with a high fat meal relative to when given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).

## Distribution

Efavirenz is highly bound (approximately 99.5 - 99.75 %) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at least one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19 % (mean 0.69 %) of  the corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is approximately 3-fold higher than the non-protein-bound (free) fraction of efavirenz in plasma.

## Biotransformation

Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for ef avirenz metabolism and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations well above those achieved clinically.

Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with the homozygous G516T genetic variant of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, the potential for an increased frequency and severity of  efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be excluded.

Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple doses of 200 - 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation (22 - 42 % lower) and a shorter terminal half-life compared with single dose administration (see below). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 substrate) are reduced in the presence of  ef avirenz (see section 4.5, table 2).

Although in vitro data suggest that ef avirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been contradictory reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when coadministered with efavirenz in vivo . The net effect of  co-administration is not clear.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-lif e of at least 52 hours af ter single doses and 40 - 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 - 34 % of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1 % of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz.

## Hepatic impairment

In a single-dose study, half-lif e was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. A multiple-dose study showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) compared with controls. There were insufficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics.

## Gender, race, elderly

Although limited data suggest that f emales as well as Asian and Pacif ic Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly.

## Paediatric population

In 49 paediatric patients receiving the equivalent of  a 600 mg dose of  ef avirenz (dose adjusted from calculated body size based on weight), steady state Cmax was 14.1 /uniF06D M, steady state Cmin was 5.6 /uniF06D M, and AUC was 216 /uniF06D M·h. The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in paediatric patients were similar to adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Efavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.

Efavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, microphthalmia was observed in another foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. No malformations were observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits.

Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given ef avirenz f or ≥ 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Carcinogenicity studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for humans are not known.

Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. While the carcinogenic potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benef it of  ef avirenz outweighs the potential carcinogenic risk to humans.

## 1. What Stocrin is and what it is used for

Stocrin, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inf ection by reducing the amount of  the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 years of  age and older.

Your doctor has prescribed Stocrin for you because you have HIV infection. Stocrin taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Stocrin

## Do not take Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 if you are allergic to ef avirenz or any of  the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
- /uniF0B7 if you have severe liver disease.
- /uniF0B7 if you have a heart condition, such as changes in the rhythm or rate of the heart beat, a slow heart beat, or severe heart disease.
- /uniF0B7 if  any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due to a heart problem or was born with heart problems.
- /uniF0B7 if  your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of  electrolytes such as potassium or magnesium in your blood.
- /uniF0B7 if you are currently taking any of the following medicines (see also 'Other medicines and Stocrin'):
- -astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergy symptoms)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -bepridil (used to treat heart disease)
- -cisapride (used to treat heartburn)
- -ergot alkaloids (f or example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) (used to treat migraine and cluster headaches)
- -midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep)
- -pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental conditions)
- -St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) (a herbal remedy used f or depression and anxiety)
- -flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat)
- -certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole)
- -triazole antifungal agents
- -certain antimalarial treatments
- -methadone (used to treat opiate addiction)
- -elbasvir/grazoprevir

If you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these medicines with Stocrin could create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening side-ef f ects or stop Stocrin from working properly.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to you doctor before taking Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 Stocrin must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If  Stocrin is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time.
- /uniF0B7 This medicine is not a cure f or HIV inf ection and you may continue to develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.
- /uniF0B7 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stocrin.
- /uniF0B7 Tell your doctor:
- -if you have a history of mental illness , including depression, or of  substance or alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects ).
- -if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if  you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not af f ected while taking Stocrin. Your doctor may give you a dif ferent anticonvulsant.
- -if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis . Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher risk f or severe and potentially lif e-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take Stocrin (see section 2, Do not take Stocrin ).
- -if  you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation of the QT interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /uniF0B7 Once you start taking Stocrin, look out for:

- -signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or abnormal dreaming. These side ef f ects may start in the f irst 1 or 2 days of treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks.
- -signs of confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear). These side eff ects may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. If  you notice any symptoms, please inf orm your doctor.
- -any signs of skin rash. If  you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop taking Stocrin and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with Stocrin.
- -any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inf lammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to f ight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines f or the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

- -bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If  you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

Stocrin is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years or weighing less than 13 kg because it has not been adequately studied in these patients.

## Other medicines and Stocrin

You must not take Stocrin with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Stocrin, at the start of  Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. John's wort) which can cause serious interactions.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stocrin may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of Stocrin or other medicines in your blood may be af fected. This may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:

- /uniF0A7 Other medicines used for HIV infection :
- -protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted atazanavir, saquinavir or fosamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors.
- -maraviroc
- -the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir should not be taken with Stocrin unless recommended by your doctor since it contains ef avirenz, the active ingredient of Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of  Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):
- -voriconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and voriconazole may increase the amount of Stocrin in your blood. If you take these two medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of ef avirenz must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first.
- -itraconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood.
- -posaconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat malaria:
- -artemether/lumefantrine: Stocrin may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.
- -atovaquone/proguanil: Stocrin may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital. Stocrin can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine may make Stocrin less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a dif f erent anticonvulsant.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. Stocrin can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed.
- /uniF0A7 Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an alternative treatment.
- /uniF0A7 Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of sertraline.
- /uniF0A7 Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may need to change your dose of bupropion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0A7 Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking Stocrin, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker.
- /uniF0A7 Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking Stocrin, your doctor will closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose.
- /uniF0A7 Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-f eeding and f ertility). Stocrin may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking Stocrin while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been established that the Stocrin therapy caused the contraceptive to f ail.
- /uniF0A7 Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of  the blood): your doctor may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.
- /uniF0A7 Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation).
- /uniF0A7 Medicines that impact heart rhythm:
- -Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as f lecainide or metoprolol.
- -Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine.
- -Antibiotics , including the f ollowing types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole.
- /uniF0A7 Metamizole (a medicine used to treat pain and fever).
- /uniF0A7 Praziquantel (a medicine used to treat parasitic worm inf ections).

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Stocrin and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant bef ore starting treatment with Stocrin.

If you could get pregnant while receiving Stocrin, you need to use a reliable f orm of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood for a time af ter therapy is stopped. Theref ore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Stocrin.

Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If  you are pregnant, you should take Stocrin only if  you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice bef ore taking any medicine.

Serious birth def ects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during pregnancy. If you have taken Stocrin or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of  your child.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

If  you are breast-f eeding, or thinking about breast-f eeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to take Stocrin

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will give you instructions f or proper dosing.

- /uniF0B7 The dose for adults is 24 mL once daily.
- /uniF0B7 The dose for Stocrin may need to be increased or decreased if you are also taking certain medicines (see Other medicines and Stocrin).
- /uniF0B7 Stocrin oral solution may be taken with or without food.

The dose of Stocrin oral solution in mg is not the same as f or Stocrin f ilm-coated tablets.

- /uniF0B7 Stocrin must be taken every day.
- /uniF0B7 Stocrin should never be used alone to treat HIV. Stocrin must always be taken in combination with other anti-HIV medicines.

The dose of Stocrin oral solution must be measured using the oral syringe supplied in the carton.

- /uniF0B7 On first use, the bottle adapter must be f itted into the neck of  the bottle. To do this, remove the child-resistant cap and the f oil seal. The bottle adapter, which is already f ixed to the nozzle of  the syringe, can then be f itted into the neck of  the bottle and pressed f irmly down.
- /uniF0B7 Separate the syringe f rom the adapter. The adapter should now fit closely to the neck so that the cap can be replaced without removing it.
- /uniF0B7 With the bottle upright, f it the tip of  the syringe into the bottle adapter.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0B7 Turn the bottle upside down with the syringe still in place. Hold the bottle and the syringe firmly in one hand and with the other hand pull back the plunger slightly beyond the mark for the dose required. If  air bubbles appear in the syringe, keep the bottle upside down and slowly push in the plunger and pull it back again. Repeat until there are no bubbles in the syringe.
- /uniF0B7 To measure the dose accurately, keep the bottle upside down and push the plunger in slowly until the top of the black ring (the edge nearest the syringe tip) lines up with the dose. Turn the bottle the right way up and remove the syringe. Wipe the adapter and replace the cap tightly over it.
- /uniF0B7 Before giving the dose of the oral solution make sure that the patient is sitting or standing upright. Put the tip of the syringe just inside the mouth, pointing it towards the cheek. Press the plunger slowly to allow time for the medicine to be swallowed. Rapid squirting into the mouth may cause choking.

<!-- image -->

After use, soak the syringe in warm soapy water f or at least a minute. Draw the warm soapy water into the syringe until f ull and then empty completely. Repeat at least three times. Remove the plunger rod from the barrel and thoroughly rinse both parts with warm running water. If parts of the syringe are not clean, repeat the cleaning instructions. Allow the parts to dry completely prior to reassembly. Do not put the syringe in a dishwasher.

## Use in children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 The dose for children weighing 40 kg or more is 24 mL once daily.
- /uniF0B7 The dose for children weighing less than 40 kg is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily as shown below:

| 32.5 to < 40     | -                                            | 17                                           |
| /uniF0B3 40      | -                                            | 24                                           |

## If you take more Stocrin than you should

If you take too much Stocrin contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you forget to take Stocrin

Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose , take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## If you stop taking Stocrin

When your Stocrin supply starts to run low, get more f rom your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped f or even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat.

If  you have any further questions on the use of  this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side ef f ects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV inf ection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of  the unwanted ef f ects are caused by Stocrin or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease itself .

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and lif e style, and in the case of  blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test f or these changes.

The most notable unwanted eff ects reported with Stocrin in combination with other anti-HIV medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

You should consult your doctor if  you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most cases of  rash disappear without any change to your treatment with Stocrin. Rash was more common in children than in adults treated with Stocrin.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is f irst started, but generally decrease in the f irst f ew weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms of ten occurred during the f irst 1-3 hours after taking a dose. If  you are af f ected your doctor may suggest that you take Stocrin at bedtime. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur more of ten in those who have a history of  mental illness. In addition, some nervous system symptoms (e.g., conf usion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [f alse belief s] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning Stocrin therapy. Always notify your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms or any side ef fects while taking Stocrin.

Diarrhoea occurred in children who took Stocrin oral solution and nelfinavir in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.

## 1. What Stocrin is and what it is used for

Stocrin, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inf ection by reducing the amount of the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 years of  age and older.

Your doctor has prescribed Stocrin for you because you have HIV infection. Stocrin taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Stocrin

## Do not take Stocrin

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to you doctor before taking Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 Stocrin must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If  Stocrin is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time.
- /uniF0B7 This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.
- /uniF0B7 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stocrin.
- /uniF0B7 Tell your doctor:
- -if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects ).
- -if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if  you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not af f ected while taking Stocrin. Your doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant.
- -if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher risk for severe and potentially lif e-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take Stocrin (see section 2, Do not take Stocrin ).
- -if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation of the QT interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /uniF0B7 Once you start taking Stocrin, look out for:

- -signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or abnormal dreaming. These side ef f ects may start in the f irst 1 or 2 days of treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks.
- -signs of confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear). These side eff ects may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. If  you notice any symptoms, please inf orm your doctor.
- -any signs of skin rash. If  you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop taking Stocrin and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with Stocrin.
- -any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to f ight inf ections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic inf ections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines f or the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of  treatment. If  you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

- -bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stif f ness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

Stocrin is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years or weighing less than 13 kg because it has not been adequately studied in these patients.

## Other medicines and Stocrin

You must not take Stocrin with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Stocrin, at the start of  Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. John's wort) which can cause serious interactions.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

Stocrin may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of Stocrin or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:

## /uniF0A7 Other medicines used for HIV infection :

- -protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted atazanavir, saquinavir or f osamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors.
- -maraviroc
- -the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenof ovir should not be taken with Stocrin unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the active ingredient of  Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of Stocrin.

## /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):

- -voriconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and voriconazole may increase the amount of Stocrin in your blood. If you take these two medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of ef avirenz must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first.
- -itraconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood.
- -posaconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood.

## /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat malaria:

- -artemether/lumefantrine: Stocrin may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.
- -atovaquone/proguanil: Stocrin may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital. Stocrin can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine may make Stocrin less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a dif f erent anticonvulsant.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. Stocrin can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of  your statin, if needed.
- /uniF0A7 Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an alternative treatment.
- /uniF0A7 Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of sertraline.
- /uniF0A7 Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may need to change your dose of bupropion.
- /uniF0A7 Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking Stocrin, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0A7 Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking Stocrin, your doctor will closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose.
- /uniF0A7 Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-f eeding and f ertility). Stocrin may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking Stocrin while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been established that the Stocrin therapy caused the contraceptive to f ail.
- /uniF0A7 Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of  the blood): your doctor may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.
- /uniF0A7 Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation).
- /uniF0A7 Medicines that impact heart rhythm:
- -Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as f lecainide or metoprolol.

## Stocrin with food and drink

Taking Stocrin on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefruit juice should be avoided when taking Stocrin.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Stocrin and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant bef ore starting treatment with Stocrin.

If you could get pregnant while receiving Stocrin, you need to use a reliable form of  barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Ef avirenz may remain in your blood for a time af ter therapy is stopped. Theref ore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Stocrin.

Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If  you are pregnant, you should take Stocrin only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.

Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during pregnancy. If you have taken Stocrin or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

If  you are breast-f eeding, or thinking about breast-f eeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

If  you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of  the unwanted eff ects are caused by Stocrin or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease itself .

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and lif e style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

The most notable unwanted eff ects reported with Stocrin in combination with other anti-HIV medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with Stocrin. Rash was more common in children than in adults treated with Stocrin.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is f irst started, but generally decrease in the f irst f ew weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours after taking a dose. If  you are af f ected your doctor may suggest that you take Stocrin at bedtime and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur more often in those who have a history of mental illness. In addition, some nervous system symptoms (e.g., confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [f alse beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. Always notify your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking Stocrin.

## 1. What Stocrin is and what it is used for

Stocrin, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inf ection by reducing the amount of the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 years of  age and older.

Your doctor has prescribed Stocrin for you because you have HIV infection. Stocrin taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection

## 2. What you need to know before you take Stocrin

## Do not take Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 if you are allergic to ef avirenz or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
- /uniF0B7 if you have severe liver disease.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to you doctor bef ore taking Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 Stocrin must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If  Stocrin is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time.
- /uniF0B7 This medicine is not a cure for HIV inf ection and you may continue to develop inf ections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.
- /uniF0B7 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stocrin.
- /uniF0B7 Tell your doctor:
- -if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of  substance or alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects ).
- -if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if  you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not aff ected while taking Stocrin. Your doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant.
- -if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take Stocrin (see section 2, Do not take Stocrin ).
- -if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation of the QT interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /uniF0B7 Once you start taking Stocrin, look out for:

- -signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks.
- -signs of confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear). These side eff ects may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. If  you notice any symptoms, please inf orm your doctor.
- -any signs of skin rash. If  you see any signs of  a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop taking Stocrin and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with Stocrin.
- -any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of  opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to f ight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic inf ections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If  you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

- -bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stif f ness, aches and pains (especially of  the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

Stocrin is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years or weighing less than 13 kg because it has not been adequately studied in these patients

## Other medicines and Stocrin

You must not take Stocrin with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Stocrin, at the start of  Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. John's wort) which can cause serious interactions.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stocrin may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of Stocrin or other medicines in your blood may be af fected. This may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:

- /uniF0A7 Other medicines used for HIV infection :
- -protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted atazanavir, saquinavir or f osamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors.
- -maraviroc
- -the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenof ovir should not be taken with Stocrin unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the active ingredient of Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):
- -voriconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and voriconazole may increase the amount of Stocrin in your blood. If you take these two medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of efavirenz must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first.
- -itraconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood.
- -posaconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood.

## /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat malaria:

- -artemether/lumefantrine: Stocrin may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.
- -atovaquone/proguanil: Stocrin may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital. Stocrin can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine may make Stocrin less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a dif f erent anticonvulsant.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. Stocrin can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed.
- /uniF0A7 Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an alternative treatment.
- /uniF0A7 Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of sertraline.
- /uniF0A7 Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may need to change your dose of bupropion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0A7 Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking Stocrin, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker.
- /uniF0A7 Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking Stocrin, your doctor will closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose.
- /uniF0A7 Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-f eeding and f ertility). Stocrin may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking Stocrin while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been established that the Stocrin therapy caused the contraceptive to fail.
- /uniF0A7 Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of  the blood): your doctor may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.
- /uniF0A7 Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation).
- /uniF0A7 Medicines that impact heart rhythm:
- -Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as f lecainide or metoprolol.
- -Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine.
- -Antibiotics , including the f ollowing types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole.
- /uniF0A7 Metamizole (a medicine used to treat pain and fever).
- /uniF0A7 Praziquantel (a medicine used to treat parasitic worm inf ections).

## Stocrin with food and drink

Taking Stocrin on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefruit juice should be avoided when taking Stocrin

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Stocrin and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with Stocrin.

If you could get pregnant while receiving Stocrin, you need to use a reliable f orm of  barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Ef avirenz may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Theref ore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Stocrin.

Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If  you are pregnant, you should take Stocrin only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice bef ore taking any medicine.

Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of  women treated with efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during pregnancy. If you have taken Stocrin or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If  you are breast-f eeding, or thinking about breast-f eeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

If  you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted eff ects are caused by Stocrin or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease itself .

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and lif e style, and in the case of  blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

The most notable unwanted effects reported with Stocrin in combination with other anti-HIV medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with Stocrin. Rash was more common in children than in adults treated with Stocrin.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is first started, but generally decrease in the first f ew weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours after taking a dose. If  you are aff ected your doctor may suggest that you take Stocrin at bedtime and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur more often in those who have a history of mental illness. In addition, some nervous system symptoms (e.g., confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [f alse beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning Stocrin therapy. Always notify your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms or any side eff ects while taking Stocrin.

## 1. What Stocrin is and what it is used for

Stocrin, which contains the active substance efavirenz, belongs to a class of antiretroviral medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It is an antiretroviral medicine that fights human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inf ection by reducing the amount of the virus in blood. It is used by adults, adolescents and children 3 years of  age and older.

Your doctor has prescribed Stocrin for you because you have HIV infection. Stocrin taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines reduces the amount of the virus in the blood. This will strengthen your immune system and reduce the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Stocrin

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to you doctor before taking Stocrin

- /uniF0B7 Stocrin must be taken with other medicines that act against the HIV virus. If  Stocrin is started because your current treatment has not prevented the virus from multiplying, another medicine you have not taken before must be started at the same time.
- /uniF0B7 This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection and you may continue to develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease.
- /uniF0B7 You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Stocrin.
- /uniF0B7 Tell your doctor:
- -if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects ).
- -if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if  you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not aff ected while taking Stocrin. Your doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant.
- -if you have a history of liver disease, including active chronic hepatitis. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral agents have a higher risk for severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have severe liver disease, do not take Stocrin (see section 2, Do not take Stocrin ).
- -if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation of the QT interval.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /uniF0B7 Once you start taking Stocrin, look out for:

- -signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks.
- -signs of confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear). These side ef f ects may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. If  you notice any symptoms, please inf orm your doctor.
- -any signs of skin rash. If  you see any signs of  a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop taking Stocrin and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at a higher risk of getting a rash with Stocrin.
- -any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic inf ections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines f or the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of  treatment. If  you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

- -bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If  you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

Stocrin is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years or weighing less than 13 kg because it has not been adequately studied in these patients

## Other medicines and Stocrin

You must not take Stocrin with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Stocrin, at the start of  Section 2. They include some common medicines and a herbal remedy (St. John's wort) which can cause serious interactions.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Stocrin may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of Stocrin or other medicines in your blood may be af fected. This may stop the medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following:

- /uniF0A7 Other medicines used for HIV infection:
- -protease inhibitors: darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, ritonavir boosted atazanavir, saquinavir or f osamprenavir/saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors.
- -maraviroc
- -the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenof ovir should not be taken with Stocrin unless recommended by your doctor since it contains efavirenz, the active ingredient of Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat bacterial infections , including tuberculosis and AIDS-related mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose of Stocrin.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals):
- -voriconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of voriconazole in your blood and voriconazole may increase the amount of Stocrin in your blood. If you take these two medicines together, the dose of voriconazole must be increased and the dose of ef avirenz must be reduced. You must check with your doctor first.
- -itraconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood.
- -posaconazole. Stocrin may reduce the amount of posaconazole in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat malaria:
- -artemether/lumefantrine: Stocrin may reduce the amount of artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.
- -atovaquone/proguanil: Stocrin may reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil in your blood.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital. Stocrin can reduce or increase the amount of anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine may make Stocrin less likely to work. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a different anticonvulsant.
- /uniF0A7 Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. Stocrin can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed.
- /uniF0A7 Methadone (a medicine used to treat opiate addiction): your doctor may recommend an alternative treatment.
- /uniF0A7 Sertraline (a medicine used to treat depression): your doctor may need to change your dose of sertraline.
- /uniF0A7 Bupropion (a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking): your doctor may need to change your dose of bupropion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0A7 Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers which are medicines typically used for high blood pressure or heart problems): when you start taking Stocrin, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker.
- /uniF0A7 Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus (medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection): when you start or stop taking Stocrin, your doctor will closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose.
- /uniF0A7 Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): you must also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy, breast-f eeding and f ertility). Stocrin may make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking Stocrin while using a contraceptive implant, although it has not been established that the Stocrin therapy caused the contraceptive to f ail.
- /uniF0A7 Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of  the blood): your doctor may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol.
- /uniF0A7 Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation).
- /uniF0A7 Medicines that impact heart rhythm:
- -Medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems such as f lecainide or metoprolol.
- -Medicines used to treat depression such as imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine.
- -Antibiotics , including the f ollowing types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole.
- /uniF0A7 Metamizole (a medicine used to treat pain and fever).
- /uniF0A7 Praziquantel (a medicine used to treat parasitic worm inf ections).

## Stocrin with food and drink

Taking Stocrin on an empty stomach may reduce the undesirable effects. Grapefruit juice should be avoided when taking Stocrin.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Stocrin and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant bef ore starting treatment with Stocrin.

If you could get pregnant while receiving Stocrin, you need to use a reliable f orm of  barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection). Efavirenz may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Theref ore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Stocrin.

Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If  you are pregnant, you should take Stocrin only if  you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice bef ore taking any medicine.

Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with efavirenz or a combination medicine containing efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir during pregnancy. If you have taken Stocrin or the combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If  you are breast-f eeding, or thinking about breast-f eeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

## If you take more Stocrin than you should

If you take too much Stocrin contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the medicine container with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken.

## If you forget to take Stocrin

Try not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose , take the next dose as soon as possible, but do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you stop taking Stocrin

When your Stocrin supply starts to run low , get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat.

If  you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of  the unwanted eff ects are caused by Stocrin or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease itself .

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and lif e style, and in the case of  blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

The most notable unwanted effects reported with Stocrin in combination with other anti-HIV medicines are skin rash and nervous system symptoms.

You should consult your doctor if you have a rash, since some rashes may be serious; however, most cases of rash disappear without any change to your treatment with Stocrin. Rash was more common in children than in adults treated with Stocrin.

The nervous system symptoms tend to occur when treatment is f irst started, but generally decrease in the first f ew weeks. In one study, nervous system symptoms often occurred during the first 1-3 hours after taking a dose. If  you are af f ected your doctor may suggest that you take Stocrin at bedtime and on an empty stomach. Some patients have more serious symptoms that may affect mood or the ability to think clearly. Some patients have actually committed suicide. These problems tend to occur more often in those who have a history of mental illness. In addition, some nervous system symptoms (e.g., confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [f alse beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years af ter beginning Stocrin therapy. Always notify your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms or any side effects while taking Stocrin.
