## 1. Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) afflicts an estimated 6% of the adult population in Western society. Three  key  defects  underlie  the  pathogenesis  of  the  disease:  insulin  resistance,  reduced  insulin secretion,  and  hepatic  glucose  overproduction.  Limitations  of  current  therapies  include  a  range  of safety and tolerability issues, limited extent and/or durability of efficacy, and inconvenience in dosing. The most common  adverse events associated with current agents are hypoglycaemia (with sulfonylureas, meglitinides, insulin), weight gain (with sulfonylureas, meglitinides, insulin, thiazolidinediones  [TZDs]),  and  gastrointestinal  intolerance  (with  metformin,  alpha-glucosidase inhibitors).  Thus,  the  sitagliptin  development  program  was  based  upon  the  need  for  new  medical therapies that have distinct mechanisms of action and that offer an improved safety and tolerability profile with good efficacy and durability.

This is a complete stand-alone application.

The  originally  proposed  indication  was  'For  treatment  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin or a PPAR γ agonist (e.g. thiazolidinedione) when diet and exercise, plus the single agent do not provide adequate glycaemic control'. The approved indication is 'Januvia is indicated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, Januvia is indicated in combination with the PPAR γ agonist  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  the  PPAR γ agonist  alone  do  not  provide  adequate glycaemic control.' The dose is 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. The dosage of metformin or PPAR γ agonist should be maintained, and Januvia administered concomitantly.

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Januvia  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  25  mg,  50  mg  and  100  mg  of  Sitagliptin  (as monohydrate Phosphate salt) as active substance. The other ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate, croscamellose sodium, magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All  information  regarding  the  choice  of  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  are  sufficiently justified.

Sitagliptin tablets were developed in four tablet strengths (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg).

The  main  aim  of  the  applicant  was  to  develop  a  formulation  that  would  rapidly  release  the  active substance, that would behave as much as possible as an oral solution upon dosing and would provide a consistent bioavailability. In this context, the excipients have been chosen not only to achieve these aims  but  also  to  ensure  the  chemical  stability.  A  direct  compression  manufacturing  process  was selected  based  on  its  inherent  simplicity  and  demonstrated  ability  to  produce  high  quality  tablets reproducibly.

Results of formulation and process development studies demonstrate that the tablet formulation and the manufacturing process are robust and under control.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing  processes  such  as  blending,  lubrication,  direct  compression  and  film-coating  unit operations. Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. It was demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

The results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  finished  product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues, which do not have any  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  letter  of undertaking and committed to resolve these as follow up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

To support the clinical evaluation of sitagliptin an extensive number of non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted prior to and in parallel with the clinical program. These studies included a battery of both in  vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, acute and repeated dose oral studies, rodent carcinogenicity studies, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies

All  pivotal  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  consistent  with  ICH  Non-clinical  Testing Guidelines and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. In addition, also non-GLP  studies  were  conducted  (in-vitro  and  early  in-vivo  pharmacodynamics,  and  early  dosefinding studies). These non-GLP studies were not considered to compromise the scientific integrity or affect the experimental results.

Scientific advice concerning non-clinical studies was not sought.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

The primary glucose-lowering property and effects on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plasma levels of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition by sitagliptin (as the main basis for its efficacy for the indication  T2DM)  have  been  shown.  In  order  to  see  the  effects  on  the  plasma  levels  of  glucose-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), insulin and glucagon the Applicant described the effects of des-fluoro-sitagliptin, a closely related analogue (comparable in vitro potency, selectivity and in vivo efficacy),  showing  improved  glucose  tolerance  and  increased  plasma  GLP-1  levels  in  animals.  In addition,  the  analogue  also  increased  plasma  insulin  levels,  accompanied  by  decreased  plasma glucagon levels (in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice); however, no preclinical data was included on plasma GIP levels. Though not considered outstanding, a proper assessment of this issue was not possible due to the lack of relevant pharmacological data on this analogue.

DPP-4 tissue distribution (RNA expression) was mainly high in blood T lymphocyte, kidney, salivary glands,  prostate,  placenta  and  intestinal  tissue;  the  latter  is  consistent  with  its  regulation  of  incretin hormone action. In rhesus monkeys and mice, DPP-4 RNA expression was high in intestinal tissues. Tissue distributions of DPP-8/9 were very broad. Therefore tissue distribution of DPP-4 appears to be quite specific and high in the intestinal tissues in humans and animals.

With respect to the pharmacology of the metabolites of sitagliptin, M1, M2, and M5 were shown to be ~300-, 1000-, and 1000-fold less active, respectively, than sitagliptin as DPP-4 inhibitors (IC50 values of ~5, &gt;20, and &gt;20 µM, respectively, versus 18 nM for sitagliptin). The DPP-4 activity of M3, M4, and M6 was not determined. Sitagliptin is a very selective DPP-4 substrate over DPP-8/9 (main targets causing severe toxicity if inhibited). Synthetic M5 metabolite has a low binding affinity (IC50 &gt;100 µM) for DPP-8/9. The human plasma levels of metabolite M6 are low (&lt; 5% in plasma and bile) and will, therefore, not meaningful impact on the pharmacodynamic (PD) actions of sitagliptin.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Although  inhibition  of  DPP-4  activity  enhances  incretin  action  in  diabetic  patients,  DPP-4  exhibits catalytic activity against a broad number of peptide substrates. In general, most cell surface peptidases such as DPP-4 cleave a number of substrates in vitro ; their endogenous substrate specificity, however, is harder to establish. In order to evaluate the potential secondary pharmacological effects of DPP-4 inhibition  by  sitagliptin,  the  Applicant  discussed  the  biological  importance  of  in  vivo  DPP-4 substrates, based on the following two criteria:

- 1 Elevated  substrate  levels  are  observed in  vivo after  DPP-4  inhibition  or  in  DPP-4-deficient mice (simply establishing that the peptide or protein is a substrate in rodents) and
- 2 Substrate stabilization must  have  biological effects (cleavage results in activation or inactivation).

Based on these criteria, the only DPP-4 substrates are GLP-1 and GIP.

Other peptides that are cleaved in vitro by DPP-4 are glucagon family peptides (GHRH, IGF-1 and GLP-2), neuropeptides (substance P/bradykinin: no effects) and chemokines (e.g., SDF-1 α :  cleavage after in vitro DPP-4 inhibition). It should be noted that in vitro cleavage of given peptide by DPP-4 does not always translate to in vivo regulation to its bioactivity by the enzyme. Conclusive studies to determine whether these in vitro substrates are regulated by DPP-4 in vivo have not occurred largely owing to the lack of suitable assays for measurement of endogenous levels of these proteins/peptides and their putative products. Therefore, even though in vitro experiments show a wide variety of DPP-4 substrates, the biological relevance in vivo remains uncertain .

As  part  of  its  secondary  pharmacology,  the  selectivity  of  sitagliptin  was  assessed  in  a  number  of assays,  including  several  proline-specific  enzymes,  proteases,  ion  channels  and  5-HT2  receptors. Sitagliptin appeared to have little affinity for these biomolecules (generally &gt;100 µM). Only a weak affinity to some ion channels and 5-HT2 receptors was demonstrated. Considering safety pharmacology  data,  together with the safe clinical use of  5-HT2  receptor antagonists, these observations are not considered to be a major concern for sitagliptin in T2DM. However, in order to elucidate  whether  other  receptors  have  (high)  affinity  for  sitagliptin  the  Applicant  provided  an overview of the potential binding of sitagliptin to an extensive battery of molecular targets. Based on its low potency (IC50 value &gt;10 µM) it has been shown that sitagliptin does not interact with receptors other than certain 5-HT2 receptors, as specified earlier. Due to the high Cmax value that was achieved in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

safety  pharmacology  studies  (~50  µM)  it  is  not  possible  to  ascertain  that  the  observed  minor cardiovascular effects are not due to activities at one or more of these receptors.

- Safety pharmacology programme

DPP-4 activity: Except for some minor cardiovascular effects (blood pressure and heart rate), major effects were not observed with sitagliptin in other important systems. The observed sitagliptin-induced hypotension may be explained by its affinity/potency to other biomolecules (e.g., receptors). It was described that a selective DPP-4 inhibitor had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation (immune system), and would not produce meaningful delayed gastric emptying in humans; while no data was available to suggest that altered DPP-4 activity in vivo would have any effect on tumour formation and metastasis.

DPP-8/9 activity: No endogenous substrates have been identified, and thus the specific functions of these enzymes are unknown. Highly selective inhibitors of DPP8/9 attenuate T cell activation in vitro , and produce profound toxicity in preclinical species, including thrombocytopenia, anaemia, splenomegaly, and mortality in rats, gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs, and edema of the skin in nonhuman primates. As sitagliptin has an IC50 of ~ 50 µ M or greater for DPP-8 and DPP-9, no inhibition of these enzymes is anticipated at exposures required for glucose lowering in humans.

Fibroblast  activation  protein  (FAP)  and  Prolyl  endopeptidase  (PEP,  prolyl  oligopeptidase,  POP) activity: As sitagliptin has an IC50 of &gt; 100 µ M or greater for FAP and PEP, no inhibition of these enzymes is anticipated at exposures required for glucose lowering in humans.

DPP-6/10 activity: DPP-6 and DPP-10 are homologues of DPP-4 that lack a catalytic serine residue and  are  therefore  inactive  as  peptidases.  Both  proteins  appear  to  modulate  cellular  trafficking, membrane targeting, and functional properties of neuronal Kv4-mediated A-type potassium channels. Though is not known whether sitagliptin can bind to the hydrolase domain of DPP-6/10, such binding even if it occurred would not be expected to influence potassium channel function.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No experiments were performed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Single dose studies were carried out with a solution of the phosphate salt of sitagliptin in saline for both intravenous (IV) and oral (gavage) administration. For the placental transfer and milk excretion studies,  the  phosphate salt was formulated in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose containing 5 mM HCl. Most metabolism, excretion, and tissue distribution studies were carried out with [ 14 C]sitagliptin.

Plasma concentrations of sitagliptin (molecular weight of free base = 407.32) were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS assay that had a lower limit of quantification of 1.0 and 5.0 ng/mL (2.46 and 12.3 nM) in rat and dog plasma, respectively. The validated assay demonstrated good linearity and reproducibility for sitagliptin in the concentration range of 1.0 to 10,000 ng/mL in rat plasma, and 5.0 to 20,000 ng/mL in dog plasma. The within and between run assay precision were 11% or less for both rat  and  dog  quality  control  (QC)  samples,  except  at the  limit  of  quantification  where  precision  was better than 14%. Total radioactivity in tissues, blood, plasma, urine, bile, and faeces was determined by  liquid  scintillation  counting,  with  or  without  prior  combustion.  Metabolite  identification  was accomplished  by  LC-MS  and  by  comparison  with  authentic  synthetic  standards  (M1, N -sulfate conjugate only). Two of the metabolites (M2 and M5) were purified from dog urine and identified by NMR analysis and hydrogen-deuterium exchange.

The  results  of  the  non-clinical  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  studies indicated  that  sitagliptin  was  rapidly  absorbed  and  was  a  moderate  to  high  clearance  drug,  with  a relatively short plasma half-life.

Absorption: In rats, following single IV administration of sitagliptin at doses of 0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg in males  and  2  mg/kg  in  females,  plasma  concentrations  of  parent  drug  declined  in  a  time  dependent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

manner, with the pharmacokinetic parameters adequately described by non-compartmental analysis of the  sitagliptin  plasma  concentration  versus  time  data.  The  mean  sitagliptin  plasma  clearance  (CLp) was ~40 to 48 mL/min/kg at the three doses in males and 67 mL/min/kg in females; blood clearance was  estimated  to  be  approximately  the  same  as  plasma  clearance  (blood-to-plasma  ratio  was approximately unity). The mean values for the steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss) and terminal half-life  (t1/2)  were  ~7  to  9  L/kg  and  ~2  hr,  respectively,  in  both  males  and  females.  The  renal clearance of unbound drug was calculated to be ~34 mL/min/kg, by dividing the mean total plasma clearance (~45 mL/min/kg) by the fraction unbound in plasma (0.67), and multiplying by the fraction of dose excreted unchanged into urine (~0.5). This value exceeded the glomerular filtration rate (~5 mL/min/kg in rats), implying that sitagliptin was subject to active renal elimination in rats.

The  dose  dependence  of  the  oral pharmacokinetics  of  sitagliptin was  evaluated  after single administration of four dose levels in male rats (2, 20, 60, and 180 mg/kg) and 2 dose levels in female rats (2 and 180 mg/kg). The data indicated that over the dose range studied, absorption of sitagliptin was not  saturable,  while  elimination  may  have  decreased  somewhat  with  dose,  as  indicated  by  the ~181- and 159-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) observed in male and female rats, respectively, between 2 and 180 mg/kg. Oral bioavailability at 2 mg/kg was 59% and 82% in male and female rats, respectively.

Sitagliptin plasma concentration-time data was collected in the dog following IV administration at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg. Mean CLp, Vdss, and t1/2 values were ~9 mL/min/kg, 3 L/kg, and 4 hr, respectively. Blood clearance was estimated to be approximately the same as plasma clearance (blood-to-plasma ratio was approximately unity).

Dose-dependent oral pharmacokinetics was evaluated after single administration at four dose levels (0.4,  1.6,  10,  and  30  mg/kg).  Plasma  AUC  increased  proportionately  with  dose,  indicating  that absorption  and  elimination  of  sitagliptin  were  not  saturable  over  the  dose  range  studied.  The  oral bioavailability was 89% at 0.4 mg/kg and 97% at 1.6 mg/kg.

Distribution: Sitagliptin was orally bioavailable, and exhibited fairly linear oral pharmacokinetics in rat and dog.

In rats, [ 14 C]sitagliptin-related radioactivity was distributed widely throughout the body following IV administration,  but  was  cleared  efficiently  from  all  tissues.  However,  caecum,  intestine,  liver  and kidneys  contained  relatively  high  concentrations  of  sitagliptin  related  material  even  after  24hr. Enterohepatic circulation can therefore not be ruled out.

Sitagliptin was seen to cross the rat and rabbit placenta readily.

Sitagliptin was shown to be a substrate of the mouse and human P-glycoprotein (Pgp), and the human renal organic anion transporter hOAT3. In the in  vitro interaction  studies  via  Pgp  transport  (studies PK012  and  PK017),  cyclosporine  A  (potent  inhibitor  of  Pgp)  was  used  as  a  positive  control.  A concentration of 10 µ M cyclosporine A strongly inhibited basolateral to apical transport of sitagliptin in LLC-MDR1 cells. This suggested that drug interactions via Pgp were possible.

The  potential  of  sitagliptin  to  cause  drug  interactions  with  hOAT1  and  hOAT3  substrates  was evaluated in vitro . At concentrations of 0.1 to 500 µM, sitagliptin had no inhibitory effect on hOAT1mediated  uptake  of  cidofovir,  while  probenecid,  a  known  inhibitor  of  organic  anion  transporters, showed potent inhibition with an IC50 of 3.9 ± 0.9 µM. Sitagliptin was a weak inhibitor of hOAT3mediated cimetidine  uptake  with  an  IC50  value  of  160  ±  17  µM,  whereas  probenecid  significantly inhibited  hOAT3-mediated  transport  of  cimetidine  with  an  IC50  of  3.1  ±  1.2  µM.  Since  the  IC50 values of sitagliptin for hOAT1 (&gt;500 µM) and hOAT3 (160 µM) are so much higher than its plasma concentrations,  Cmax  ~1  µM  at  100  mg,  it  is  unlikely  that  it  will  cause  clinically  meaningful interactions with substrates of these transporters.

The  effect  of  various  commonly  prescribed  drugs  (cimetidine,  enalapril,  enalaprilat,  fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, furosemide, gabapentin, ibuprofen, indapamide, probenecid and quinapril) on hOAT3mediated  uptake  of  sitagliptin  (2  µM)  was  evaluated in  vitro using  cell  lines  over-expressing  this transporter. The concentration of sitagliptin in these experiments was much lower than its Km value of 162 µM in order to maximize the inhibitory effects. The Applicant stated that with the exception of probenecid,  the  IC50  values  of  all  drugs  tested  were  much  higher  than  their  maximum  total  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

unbound concentration in plasma. However, besides probenecid also fenofibric acid, furosemide and ibuprofen had plasma Cmax concentrations of free and bound fraction above the observed IC50 levels. Sitagliptin is  eliminated by renal and non-renal mechanisms. Assuming that tubular reabsorption of sitagliptin is minimal, approximately 50% of the total plasma clearance of sitagliptin is due to active renal  secretion.  Therefore,  even  in  the  unlikely  event  that  active  renal  secretion  is  completely inhibited; the change in plasma exposure of sitagliptin would be only approximately 2-fold. Given the apparently wide therapeutic index of sitagliptin, clinically relevant increases in plasma concentrations would  not  be  expected  in  the  presence  of  OAT3  inhibitors.  Concomitant  administration  of  OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo .

Metabolism: In  vitro assays  indicated  that  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations,  sitagliptin  did  not inhibit  cytochrome  P450s  or  Pgp,  nor  did  it  induce  human  CYP3A4.  The  sitagliptin  metabolites, which  were  present  at  low  to  trace  levels  in  plasma,  were  formed  by  N-sulfation,  N-carbamoyl glucuronidation,  hydroxylation  of  the  triazolopiperazine  ring,  and  by  oxidative  desaturation  of  the piperazine ring followed by cyclization via the primary amine. All the metabolites detected in human plasma were observed in rat and dog, however, not all observed metabolites were present in the same matrix as observed in humans. Due to the minor metabolism of this compound, consequences of the differences  in  metabolism  between  human,  rat  and  dog  on  the  observed  pharmacokinetics  are  not expected.  The  observed in  vitro metabolism  was  in  agreement  with  the in  vivo metabolism.  Only metabolite M1 was not observed in vitro .

Excretion: In vitro plasma protein binding was low in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human. Sitagliptin was excreted primarily unchanged in human, rat and dog. In dogs and humans, sitagliptin was cleared primarily  by  renal  excretion  of  parent  drug,  while  in  rats  it  was  cleared  by  both  renal  and  biliary excretion. Approximately 5 to 16% of a radiolabeled dose was recovered as phase I and II metabolites in  the  excreta.  Furthermore,  sitagliptin  observed  in  bile  from  dogs  was  significantly  lower  than  in human faeces and rat bile. Sitagliptin was secreted into rat milk; this is mentioned in section 5.3 of the SPC. As it is unknown if sitagliptin is excreted into human breast milk, it should not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.6. of SPC).

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single dose studies with sitagliptin were performed in mice and rats. The highest non-lethal dose in mice was 1000mg/kg (122 times the human exposure based on AUC). In rats the highest non-lethal dose was 2000mg/kg for females and 3000 mg/kg for males (271 and 182 times the human exposure based on AUC respectively).

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice (up to 93 days), rats (up to 184 days) and dogs (up to 365 days). The maximum non-lethal dose was 750 mg/kg/day for mice (approximately 80 times the human exposure based on AUC), 500 mg/kg/day for rats (48 times the human exposure based on AUC), and ≥ 50 mg/kg/day for dogs ( ≥ 22 times the human exposure based on AUC). In rats mortality was higher in males than females, while in mice it was higher in females.

In  both  mice  and  rats  renal  toxicity  was  observed  at  systemic  exposure  values  above  58  times  the human exposure levels, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. In mice it consisted of dilatation of the renal pelvis (associated with variable loss of papillary, medullary, and cortical tissue) and increases in relative kidney weights.

In  rats,  renal  toxicity  consisted  of  renal  tubular  necrosis  (accompanied  by  tubular  degeneration  and dilatation) and treatment related urinary changes (consistent with renal tubular necrosis). The mortality seen in rats was due to renal tubular necrosis.

The  molecular  mechanism  of  the  renal  toxicity  is  very  likely  related  to  the  extremely  high  urinary concentrations  resulting  from  rapid  renal  elimination  of  the  drug  in  rodents.  Since  sitagliptin  is virtually completely absorbed following an oral dose in rodents, the initial body burden of the drug is likely to be more directly related to the dosage on a mg/kg body weight basis than on a plasma AUC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

basis. This would result in more than 2 orders of magnitude greater exposure in these animal studies compared to humans based on dosage (500 versus 2 mg/kg/day). Given the very high renal elimination rate  of  the  drug,  in  part  due  to  its  active  transport  into  the  kidney,  the  resulting  renal  exposures  in rodents  compared  to  humans  is  also  correspondingly  greater  than  predicted  based  on  plasma  AUC margins. The histological changes indicate a relatively non-specific cytotoxicity associated with these very high exposures. The specificity of the renal toxicity for rodents exposed to very high doses is also supported by the lack of any renal toxicity in dogs and rhesus monkeys (though no toxicology studies with rhesus monkeys were present in the Original Marketing Application, thus a safety margin for this species cannot be determined) treated within exposure margins of 26- to 28-fold compared to patients. In view of the much lower clinical exposures and body burden of the drug in humans at the clinical dose and the lack of any biochemical changes indicative of renal toxicity in patients, these high dose findings in rodents are not considered clinically relevant.

Liver toxicity  was  seen  in  both  mice  and  rats  and  consisted  of  liver  weight  increases,  centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, inflammation, degeneration, and necrosis (at higher doses) in the 14-week range-finding  study  at  doses ≥ 500  mg/kg/day;  and  cystic  degeneration  and  focal  hepatocellular alteration in the 106-week carcinogenicity study at 500 mg/kg/day. This was observed in male mice, and  in  male  and  female  rats.  Even  though  the  mechanism  for  sitagliptin-induced  renal  and  liver toxicity is not completely clear, the safety margins for these effects are sufficient.

In addition, no hepatotoxicity was found in dogs treated with maximum-tolerated doses of sitagliptin for up to 1 year and no signal for hepatotoxicity has been found in clinical trials conducted at twice the maximum-recommended clinical dose .

In rats sitagliptin caused upper incisor teeth abnormalities (broken and grossly thickened incisor teeth due to ameloblast and odontoblast degeneration), with a NOAEL of &lt; 20 mg/kg/day. At 20mg/kg/day, exposure in rat is similar to the human exposure, based on AUC. Therefore no safety margin exists for teeth  abnormalities.  These  effects  were  only  observed  on  the  continuously  growing  teeth.  After revision  of  this  data  it  was  concluded  that  the  broken  teeth  in  the  low-dose  rat  study  were  not treatment-related. This implies that the NOEL for broken or missing teeth is 500 mg/kg/day for longterm treatment, which corresponds to an acceptable safety margin. No NOEL can be established for discoloured  incisor  teeth  after  long-term  treatment.  However,  discoloration  was  only  observed  in incisor teeth of rats, and no discoloration was observed in mice (2-year, max 500mg/kg, safety margin of  57),  and  dogs  (1-year,  50mg/kg,  safety  margin  25)  after  long-term  treatment.  The  intended indication of the current application is T2DM or adult onset diabetes, thereby excluding patients with ongoing  tooth  development.  Therefore  it  is  agreed  that  the  discoloured  incisor  teeth  in  rats  can  be considered of little relevance for the intended patient population.

Other treatment-related findings in the rat were myocardial degeneration, mammary gland necrosis, uterine  atrophy,  tremors,  lymphoid  and  some  haematological  changes,  alopecia,  increased  organ weights (thyroid (F), adrenal, prostate) and decreased organ weights (pituitary gland (F) and spleen (M)). These findings were observed at doses equal to or above the LOAEL for liver and renal toxicity. The safety margins for these effects are sufficient.

Intermittent  tremors  of  a  transient  nature  were  observed  in  rats  receiving  high  doses  of  sitagliptin ( ≥ 1500  mg/kg/day).  The  NOEL  for  neurological  signs  in  dogs  was  10  mg/kg.  Examples  of  these neurological  signs  were  open-mouth  breathing,  salivation,  white  foamy  emesis,  ataxia,  trembling, decreased  activity,  and/or  hunched  posture.  The  occurrence  of  these  signs  may  be  concentration dependent rather than exposure dependent. In dogs, the safety margin for these effects is approximately 6 (based on AUC as well as on Cmax). This is rather low, however no signs of neural toxicity were observed in the clinical trials with sitagliptin at doses sufficiently above the maximum recommended clinical dose. The neurological findings in rats and dogs are not considered relevant for humans  receiving  therapeutic  doses  of  sitagliptin.  However,  as  a  precautionary  measure  potential neurotoxicity is addressed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The clinical relevance of the muscle fibre degeneration found in dogs is limited. This is based on the severity of muscle degeneration found in dogs, the relative low incidence of muscle degeneration in the  two  studies  (2/8  and  1/8  dogs  for  14-week  and  27-week  study,  respectively),  and  the  lack  of adverse muscle findings in the phase 3 trials. However, in view of a safety margin of ≥ 6, this finding will be monitored in the Risk Management Plan.

In all species and at most doses tested, sitagliptin caused salivation. This effect was transient, started shortly after dosing, and lasted for several hours. This observation was not considered relevant for the human situation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the preclinical program on necrotic skin lesions in monkeys, the 14-week repeated dose study with the selective DPP-8/9 inhibitor L-000233357 has not been finished yet. The Applicant committed that the report of this study will be provided as soon as it is completed.

## · Genotoxicity

Sitagliptin  showed  no  genotoxic  effects  in in  vitro or in  vivo assays  on  mutagenicity  (Ames  test), direct DNA damage (in vitro test in primary rat hepatocytes), or clastogenicity ( in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, in vivo mouse micronucleus test).

## · Carcinogenicity

The  carcinogenic  potential  of  sitagliptin  was  determined  in  mice  and  rats.  In  the  two-year  mouse carcinogenicity study, there were no treatment-related increases in tumor incidence in any organ at all tested doses (50, 125, 250, 500 mg/kg/day). Treatment-related non-neoplastic changes were seen in both sexes and included centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy at 500 mg/kg/day and hydronephrosis at ≥ 250 mg/kg/day. At 500 mg/kg/day, there was a slight, but not significant decrease in survival due to an increased incidence of hydronephrosis. Based on these findings, the NOEL for induction of neoplasia was &gt;500 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for non-neoplastic changes 125 mg/kg/day in male and female mice.

In  the  two-year  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  there  was  a  treatment-related  increase  in  hepatic  tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) at systemic exposure levels 58-times the human exposure levels. There were no other treatment-related or statistically significant increases in tumor incidence in any other organ.  Since  hepatotoxicity  (cystic  degeneration,  basophily  and  eosinophily  in  absence  of  necrosis) has  been  shown to  correlate  with  induction  of  hepatic  neoplasia  in  rats,  this  increased  incidence  of hepatic tumors in rats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high  safety  margin  (19-fold  at  this  no-effect  level),  these  neoplastic  changes  are  not  considered relevant for the situation in humans. The historical controls in which 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose in deionized  water  was  used  as  vehicle  indicated  that  in  males  the  occurrence  of  hepatic  carcinomas tended to be higher (3.2%) than in females (0.7%). The two control groups of the rat carcinogenicity study showed hepatic carcinomas in about 0-2% of females and in 2-6% of the males. Thereby these controls fell within the same range as the historical controls

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Sitagliptin did not affect male or female fertility in rats at the limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. In the F0 females,  a  reduction  in  body  weight  and  food  consumption  was  seen  at ≥ 250  mg/kg/day.  No treatment-related  effects  on  placental  morphology  were  observed  up  to  the  highest  dose  of  1000 mg/kg/day. Sitagliptin was shown to cross the placental barrier with fetal exposure values 45 to 80% those in the dam and was also concentrated in milk about 4-fold compared to plasma. In the F1 pups, there were no external or visceral abnormalities and no fetal or postnatal developmental effects at ≤ 250 mg/kg/day; a reduction in body weight was seen at 500 mg/kg/day and a slight increase in the incidence of rib anomalies (absent, hypoplastic, and wavy ribs) relative to control was found at 1000 mg/kg/day.  From  these  findings  it  is  concluded  that  in  rats  the  NOEL  for  maternal  toxicity  is  125 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for developmental toxicity 250 mg/kg/day. The safety margin at the NOEL for developmental toxicity is approximately 29, based on AUC values relative to the AUC in patients at the MRD. This margin is large enough to ensure the safety of sitagliptin for human reproduction. In rabbits, maternal toxicity was seen at 500 mg/kg/day (decreased food consumption, no faeces). This resulted  in  early  termination  of  this  group,  precluding  fetal  examination.  There  were  no  treatmentrelated  effects  on  placental  morphology  and  no  developmental  toxicity  was  found  at  the  maximum evaluable dose of 125 mg/kg/day. At this dose, the AUC0-24 h was 189 µM·hr, resulting in a safety margin of about 22-fold relative to the AUC in patients at the MRD. It was concluded that this margin was large enough to ensure the safety of sitagliptin for human reproduction.

## · Local tolerance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Local  tolerability  of  sitagliptin  was  assessed  as  part  of  the  oral  toxicity  studies  described  in  the repeated-dose toxicity studies. Sitagliptin was not considered a dermal sensitizer based on an in vivo study  in  mice  (local  lymph  node  assay)  or  a  dermal  irritant  based  on  two in  vivo dermal  irritation studies in rabbits, and on an in vitro study with human epidermal cells.

## Immunotoxicity

Inhibition  DPP-4  by  sitagliptin  does  not  seems  to  play  a  major  role  in  T  cell  dependent  immune responses. Animal data on the role of DPP-4 in T cell immune response showed no consistent changes after  inhibition/knock  out  of  DPP-4. In  vitro studies  showed  that  the  concentrations  of  sitagliptin needed  to  evoke  noticeable  effects  on  T  cells  are  sufficiently  far  above  the  maximal  plasma concentration, which is reached after a therapeutic dose of 100 mg in humans. In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, there was no suggestion of an immunosuppressive effect of sitagliptin, and there was no evidence of allergenicity in the local lymph node assay in mice (section on local tolerance).

## Phototoxicity

Since  sitagliptin  has  only  a  single  absorption  peak  at  268  nM  with  no  detectable  absorption  in  the sunlight region of the electromagnetic energy spectrum (290 to 700 nM), no phototoxicity testing was performed with this drug.

## Impurities

The specifications for the S-enantiomer of sitagliptin (regarded as an impurity since the synthesis is highly stereo-selective) are higher ( ≤ 0.5%) than the content in the batches used for the toxicity studies. Therefore  the  S-enantiomer  may  not  be  regarded  as  fully  qualified  (see  also  quality  part  of  this Assessment  report).  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  exposure  towards  both  enantiomers  of sitagliptin in the toxicology studies was much higher than under human therapeutic conditions even if the relative concentration of the S-enantiomer in the toxicologically tested batches was lower than in later batches.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Neither an assessment of the terrestrial compartment nor an assessment of bioaccumulation is needed. Sitagliptin phosphate  is not a vPvB  substance,  meaning  it is not very persistent and very bioaccumulative,  nor  PBT  (persistent  and  bioaccumulative  and  toxic),  since  the  criterion  for bioaccumulation is not fulfilled.

An  acute  ecotoxicity  dataset  on  sitagliptin  phosphate  was  reported.  Given  the  therapeutic  class  of sitagliptin phosphate, acute tests on lethal endpoints (mortality, immobility) are considered irrelevant. The 21-day Daphnia reproduction study (OECD 211) and 33-day fish early life stage study (OECD 210) indicated a no-observable-effect concentration (NOEC) of 9.8 mg/L for Daphnia magna and a NOEC of 9.2 mg/L for Pimephales promelas in the fish early life stage study.

The risk of the use of sitagliptin to the aquatic environment is acceptable.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Clinical  efficacy  was  studied  in  4  Phase  II  and  5  Phase  III  studies.  Overall,  3884  patients  were randomised into the sitagliptin Phase II (1477 patients) and Phase III studies (2407 patients) In the Phase II studies, 1116 patients were treated with sitagliptin (5mg to 100 mg per day); in the Phase III studies, 1538 patients were treated with sitagliptin (100 mg q.d. or 200 mg q.d) and an additional 65 patients with T2DM and chronic renal insufficiency were treated with doses adjusted for decreased renal function.

The applicant modified the initially proposed indication to: 'Januvia is indicated in patients with type 2  diabetes  mellitus  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and exercise plus metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, Januvia is indicated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in combination with the PPAR γ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPAR γ agonist alone do not provide  adequate  glycaemic  control..'  which  was  granted  by  the  CHMP.  The  dose  of  Januvia  is 100 mg once daily. The dosage of metformin or PPAR γ agonist should be maintained, and sitagliptin administered concomitantly.

Both  in  January  2004  and  June  2004  the  Applicant  received  Scientific  Advice  on  the  clinical development programme intended to provide data to support the originally  proposed  indication,  on study design issues, on dosing in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and on toxicopharmacological and clinical development. The company followed this scientific advice.

Sitagliptin was studied in patients with renal insufficiency. However in the case of moderate or severe renal  insufficiency  (creatinine  clearance  &lt; 50  ml/min)  the  clinical  experience  was  considered  too limited and therefore, the use of the product in these patients is currently not recommended.

Sitagliptin  was  also  studied  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  insufficiency  in  which  dose adjustment is not necessary; but not in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.

Limited  safety  data  was  available  in  patients ≥ 75 years  of  age  and  care  should  be  exercised  when treating these patients.

No studies with sitagliptin were performed in the paediatric population, therefore the use of sitagliptin is not recommended in children below 18 years of age; this is addressed as a post authorisation follow up measure.

An overview of the relevant clinical studies contributing to efficacy profile of sitagliptin can be found in the Clinical Efficacy Section (see Table 1).

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant.

The  Applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Twenty-seven studies including four studies in T2DM were conducted in the Clinical Pharmacology program to characterize the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sitagliptin.

Absorption Following  oral  administration  of  a  100  mg  dose,  maximal  plasma  concentrations  of sitagliptin were reached within 1 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is high i.e. 87%. A  high-fat  meal  had  no  effect  on  the  rate  or  extent  of  absorption;  therefore,  sitagliptin  can  be administered with or without food.

Distribution Following 100 mg IV dose, the steady state volume of distribution was estimated to be approximately 198 liters, indicating that sitagliptin distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding is low (38% bound) thus the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions by plasma protein binding  displacement  is  low.  The  equilibrium  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio  of  sitagliptin  is 1.21.

Metabolism Generally, metabolism is a minor pathway of elimination. Following a [ 14 C]-labeled oral dose, approximately 16% of the radiolabeled sitagliptin was recovered as metabolites. In vitro studies suggested  that  the  primary  enzymes  responsible  for  the  metabolism  were  CYP3A4  and,  to  a  lesser extent CYP2C8. Since the metabolites were present at low concentrations in plasma relative to parent compound,  sitagliptin,  and  not  its  metabolites,  was  considered  mainly  responsible  for  DPP-4 inhibitory activity.

Elimination Plasma  clearance  following  100  mg  IV  dose  was  417  ml/min.  Renal  clearance  and plasma elimination half-life were similar after IV and oral dosing. The apparent terminal plasma halflife is approximately 10-12 hours. Renal excretion of unchanged sitagliptin is the primary mechanism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of elimination. In patients and subjects with normal renal function (CrCl &gt;80 mL/min), approximately 75 to 80 % of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine with a renal clearance of approximately 350 mL/min. Since renal clearance exceeds the typical glomerular filtration rate in humans, it appears to involve active tubular secretion mechanisms. The results of in vitro studies indicted that sitagliptin is a substrate for the human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT3) and Pgp, but not a substrate of human organic  cation  transporter-2  (hOCT2),  or  hOAT1.  As  cyclosporine  A  did  not  affect  the  renal elimination of sitagliptin, Pgp appears not to be involved in the renal excretion. The role of hOAT3 and/or other transporters in the active renal secretion is unknown.

Dose  and  time  dependency Following  oral  (5-600  mg)  and  IV  (25-100  mg)  doses,  the  AUC  of sitagliptin increased dose-proportionally, indicating that the plasma clearance and the bioavailability are  independent  of  the  dose  administered.  Cmax  increased  in  a  modestly  greater  way  than  doseproportional. This may be due to saturation of Pgp in the enterocytes at high sitagliptin concentrations resulting in faster absorption and higher Cmax. Sitagliptin did not accumulate with once daily doses; the AUC0-24hr accumulation ratio for 100-mg daily oral doses was estimated to be approximately 1.10.

Type 2 Diabetes Patients with T2DM had similar pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin compared to healthy subjects.

Special populations Effect of gender, weight, age (elderly), race, renal and hepatic insufficiency on pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were investigated adequately in phase I studies.

Gender. Phase I composite analysis showed a slightly higher exposure in females compared to males: the geometric mean ratios (female N=79, male N=193) and corresponding 90% were 1.11 (1.07, 1.15) for sitagliptin AUC0-∞ and 1.34 (1.26, 1.42) for Cmax. These slight differences were not clinically meaningful.

Weight . In a phase I study, sitagliptin AUC0-∞ was modestly lower, while Cmax was similar for young male  obese  subjects  as  compared  to  the  young  male  non-obese  subjects.  The  AUC0-∞ and  Cmax geometric mean ratio (GMR) values (obese male/non-obese male) with corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.77 (0.69, 0.86) and 0.91 (0.73, 1.14), respectively. No dose adjustment based on weight is necessary.

Age. Elderly subjects (65-75 years) had higher plasma sitagliptin concentrations as compared to the young (&lt;45 years). Pooled across genders, the AUC0-∞ and Cmax GMR values (Elderly/ Young) with corresponding 90% CIs were 1.31 (1.19, 1.43) and 1.23 (1.04, 1.46), respectively. This was probably due  to  lower  renal  excretion  associated  with  a  lower  creatinine  clearance  in  the  elderly  patients. Pharmacokinetics  of  sitagliptin  has  not  been  evaluated  in  patients  &gt;  75  years  of  age.  No  dose adjustment other than based on creatinine clearance is necessary in elderly patients.

Race. In  a  composite  analysis  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  obtained  in  Phase  I  studies  136 Caucasians, 15 Blacks, 79 Hispanics and 42 Asians were included. The GMRs (NonCaucasian/Caucasian) and corresponding 90% CIs from the composite analysis for AUC0-∞ were not different for Black 0.92 (0.86, 0.99), for Hispanic 0.95 (0.91, 0.99) and for Asian subjects 1.02 (0.97, 1.06).

Hepatic insufficiency. Ten patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (score of 7 to 9 on the ChildPugh's scale) and ten healthy matched control subjects were enrolled in a hepatic impairment study. AUC was increased by 21% (90% CI 1% , 46%) and Cmax by 13% (-9%, 42%). No dose adjustment is needed.  Pharmacokinetics  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  insufficiency  was  not  studied.  This  is adequately described in the SPC.

Renal  Insufficiency. Sitagliptin  plasma  concentrations  increased  approximately  1.6-fold  in  patients with  mild  renal  insufficiency  as  compared  to  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  Patients  with moderate and severe renal insufficiency had approximately 2.3- and 3.8-fold, respectively, increased plasma drug exposure and patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis had an approximately 4.5-fold higher plasma drug exposure. Steady-state is expected to be reached later in patients with renal impairment. Based on this single dose study, no dose adjustment is required for mild renal impairment, however as experience still remains limited in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, these should not be treated with sitagliptin. This is reflected in the SPC. Treatment in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  insufficiency  will  be  addressed  as  part  of  the  postauthorisation follow up measures, and in the RMP.

The Applicant was requested to discuss the impact of non-renal clearance on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin  in  renally  impaired  subjects  and  to  discuss  potential  interactions  with  drugs  that  affect CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 mediated metabolism. Study P008 that assessed metabolites suggested that the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate of metabolite formation is largely independent of renal function and that substantial accumulation of metabolites is not expected.

Results  from  this  study  also  showed  that  effects  of  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibition  on  sitagliptin pharmacokinetics are expected to be modest. However, the effects of potent metabolism inhibitors on sitagliptin exposure are anticipated to be strongly dependent on renal function (increase of &lt;2-fold in moderate renal insufficiency and ≤ 5-fold increase with severe renal insufficiency) and have not been assessed in a clinical study. Therefore, there remains a concern that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole,    itraconazole,  ritonavir  and  clarithromycin  may  increase  sitagliptin  exposure  to  a clinically relevant extent in patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD. This concern is reflected in section 4.5. of the SPC.

Interactions In  vitro studies  indicated  that  sitagliptin  did  not  inhibit  CYPs  or  induce  CYP3A4  at physiological concentrations. As it is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, it has low potential for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions in vivo .  The Applicant discussed that induction of sitagliptin  metabolism  and  Pgp  are  unlikely  to  result  in  clinically  relevant  effects  and  showed  that sitagliptin was not an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.

Eight clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted: sitagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin or oral contraceptives to a clinically relevant extent.

Sitagliptin at 100 and 200 mg doses slightly increased the digoxin Cmax  plasma concentrations with 18% and 24% respectively. No digoxin dose adjustment is needed, and only patients at risk of digoxin toxicity need to be monitored.

Co-administration of metformin 1000mg bid had no effect on pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin 50 mg bid.

Cyclosporine  A (600  mg  qd)  increased  the  C max of  sitagliptin  (100  mg  qd)  1.7-fold  (68%)  and  the AUC 1.3-fold (29%) but had no significant effect on its renal clearance. The observed effects with cyclosporine  A,  a  potent  Pgp  inhibitor,  suggest  that  sitagliptin  is  a  Pgp  substrate in  vivo but  Pgp appears  not  to  be  involved  in  its  renal  excretion.  The  effects  of  high  dose  of  cyclosporine  A  were modest  probably  due  to  the  high  absolute  bioavailability  of  sitagliptin  and  are  considered  to  be clinically insignificant. Therefore, no meaningful interactions are expected with other Pgp inhibitors. (see Non-Clinical section).

As stated previously in the Non-Clinical section, in vitro studies indicated that an hOAT3 transporter may be involved in the renal excretion of sitagliptin. Data indicate that sitagliptin is a substrate for OAT3, but is unlikely to perpetrate or be susceptible to clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with  other  OAT3  substrates.  As  noted  above,  drug-drug  interaction  data  with  other  OAT  or  OCT substrates  suggest  that  the  magnitude  of  change  in  plasma  concentrations  resulting  from  these interactions  is  modest.  Sitagliptin  is  also  eliminated  by  non-renal  mechanisms.  Taken  together, sitagliptin  is  not  expected  to  be  a  perpetrator  or  victim  of  drug-drug  interactions  in  a  clinically meaningful way.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics was studied in 9 trials, including 252 healthy volunteers and 58 T2DM patients. In these studies the effects of sitagliptin were investigated on DPP-4 activity, incretins, and on glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon levels.

Since theoretically a DPP-4 inhibitor might stabilize potentially vasoactive peptides such as substance P, an ambulatory blood pressure study was conducted in 18 hypertensive patients, stably treated with one or more antihypertensive agents.

## · Mechanism of action

Sitagliptin is the first of a novel class of antihyperglycaemic agents, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Although several actions potentially contribute to the glucose-lowering effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, the most  likely  mechanism  is  through  elevated  incretin  concentrations  that  lead  to  enhancement  of glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion  and  a  reduction  in  glucagon  release.  Increases  in  incretin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations  occur  because  DPP-4  inhibition  reduces  the  cleavage  and  inactivation  of  the  active (intact) form of the incretin hormones, including GLP-1 and GIP.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

## Primary pharmacology

Single dose pharmacodynamics were studied in P001, P001C1, P003 and P013 , including a total of 90 healthy male volunteers, healthy elderly male and female subjects, young female subjects, obese males and 18 Japanese subjects. Multiple dose pharmacodynamics were investigated in P004, P007, RC715A111 and RC431A112 including a total of 162 healthy male volunteers, middle-aged, obese male and female subjects, and 60 healthy young male Japanese subjects. Single dose pharmacodynamics  in  T2DM  patients  were  investigated  in P005 ,  including  58  drug  naïve  patients with mild to moderate T2DM.

Proximal  biomarkers  were  DPP-4  activity  and  incretins  (GLP-1  and  GIP-levels,  active  and  total). Distal biomarkers included glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon levels.

In both normoglycaemic healthy subjects and patients with T2DM, sitagliptin inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity in a dose and concentration-dependent manner. Results of study P001 are shown in Figure 1 .

Figure 1: Mean Percent Inhibition (%) of DPP-4 Activity From Baseline Versus Time (Hours) Post-dose After Single Oral Doses of MK-0431 in Healthy Young Male Subjects (N=6) (P001, P001C1) (Mean ± SE).

Results from other studies were similar. Race, gender and age did not have meaningful effects on the relationship between sitagliptin plasma concentrations and DPP-4 activity.

Sitagliptin  increased  post-meal  (in  healthy  subjects  and  T2DM  patients)  and  post-oral  glucose tolerance  test  (OGTT)  (in  T2DM  patients)  active  GLP-1  levels  by  approximately  2-3-fold,  as compared to placebo. Active GIP levels were similarly increased following an OGTT in patients with T2DM. Sitagliptin did not increase total GLP-1 or GIP plasma levels.

In normoglycaemic healthy subjects, sitagliptin had no consistent, treatment-related effect on fasting or  post-meal  levels  of  glucose,  C-peptide,  insulin  or  glucagon  levels.  In middle-aged  obese individuals, sitagliptin reduced post-OGTT glucose excursion. In T2DM patients single oral doses of sitagliptin  reduced  post-OGTT  glucose  excursion,  increased  insulin/C-peptide  levels  and  decreased glucagon levels.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses from the single dose study P005 in T2DM patients suggested  that  near-maximal  reduction  of  post-challenge  glucose  excursion  was  associated  with sitagliptin plasma concentrations of approximately 100 nM or higher, plasma DPP-4 inhibition of 80% or higher and augmentation of post-challenge active GLP-1 levels of 2-fold or higher. It was reasoned

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that for optimal chronic glucose lowering in T2DM patients, plasma DPP-4 inhibition should be 80% or  greater  at  trough.  These  data  served  as  the  basis  for  selecting  doses  in  the  Phase  II  dose  range finding studies P010 and P014.

As GLP-1 has been demonstrated to slow gastric emptying, it was thought that this effect might also be seen with sitagliptin. No Phase II study investigating gastric emptying was performed. This issue was examined in the larger Phase III studies; selected gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea) were subjected to additional statistical analysis to define increases in their occurrence, and all gastrointestinal AEs were carefully reviewed.

## Secondary pharmacology

Study P011 was performed in 18 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension on stable treatment with one  or  more  antihypertensive  agents  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  sitagliptin  on  ambulatory  blood pressure  as  well  as  safety  and  tolerability.  Small  but  statistically  significant  or  nearly  significant decreases in mean 24-hour blood pressure between both 100 mg b.i.d. and 50mg compared to placebo were observed for  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP),  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  and  mean  arterial pressure (MAP).

To fulfil recent draft regulatory guidance (ICH E14) study P032 was performed in 86 (79 available for final QTc analysis) healthy subjects to assess the potential effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of sitagliptin on SBP and QTc interval prolongation. Following a dose of 800 mg, QTc interval was  slightly  increased,  but  not  to  a  clinically  significant  extent.  However,  considering  the  data separately by gender, a borderline effect was seen in females at the high dose (800mg) (mean value 5.85 msec with an upper limit of the 95% CI of 9.96 (~10) msec, which is the threshold according to ICH guideline E14). However, sitagliptin was shown to inhibit HERG current at concentrations (IC50 117 µ M, worst case scenario) that were far beyond therapeutic free plasma levels. The safety margin calculated  from  non-clinical  studies  was  38,  which  was  considered  sufficient,  even  if  women  were slightly more sensitive to an effect of sitagliptin on QTc. No change in QTc interval was measured after a single dose of 100 mg.

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical efficacy was studied in 4 phase II and 5 phase III studies.  Table 1. gives an overview of the Phase II/III studies contributing to the efficacy profile of sitagliptin.

‡ Once results from the Phase II dose-range finding studies were available, an amendment to the extension study protocol provided for patients not on sitagliptin 100 mg to be switched to this dose for the remainder of the extension study. For this reason, patients on sitagliptin were switched at different time-points during the extension studies to sitagliptin 100 mg q.d.

## · Dose response studies

Results of P010 and P014 (dose finding) showed that sitagliptin provided improvements in glucose control,  as  reflected  by  reductions  across  glycaemic  endpoints  examined  (e.g.  HbA1c,  FPG,  and fructosamine). A total daily dose of 100 mg per day, given either as 100 mg once daily (q.d.) (P014) or 50  mg  twice  daily  (b.i.d.)  (P010)  provided  maximum  glucose  lowering;  there  was  no  meaningful difference in efficacy between these dosing regimens. Thus, these studies supported selection of the sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. for further development. The dose-response relationship was very flat for all efficacy endpoints studied. Therefore, it was difficult to conclude superiority of a 100 mg compared to a 50 mg daily dose. On the other hand, since the safety profile of sitagliptin did not appear to be dosedependent, the choice of the 100 mg daily dose was acceptable. Since no clear plateau between 50 and 100 mg per day was established however, doses above 100 mg per day were considered to have the potential  of  providing  additional  glycaemic  benefit.  For  this  reason,  a  dose  of  200  mg  per  day  was included in selected Phase III studies.

## · Main studies

The pivotal studies were two monotherapy trials (P021V1, P023V1), two combination trials (P020V1, P019) and active comparator trial P024V1. Study P028V1 and P015 were considered supplementary trials. Study P024V1 was submitted as part of the answers to the D120 LoQ.

## METHODS

## Monotherapy studies

P021V: A  multicenter  randomised,  double-blind,  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of sitagliptin  monotherapy  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  who  have  inadequate  glycaemic control.

P023V1: A multicenter, randomised, double blind study of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control.

## Combination studies

P019: A  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the addition of sitagliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on pioglitazone therapy.

P020V1: A  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the addition of sitagliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin therapy.

## Active comparative trial

P024V1: A multicenter,  double-blind,  randomised  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the addition  of  sitagliptin  compared  with  sulfonylurea  therapy  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy.

## Study Participants

Male and female patients, ages 18 to 78 years, who were either not on an antihyperglycaemic agent (AHA), on an AHA monotherapy or low dose combination therapy at ≤ 50% of maximum dose of either  agent,  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  monotherapy  studies.  Patients  who  met  enrolment criteria entered an up to 13-week diet/exercise and, for patients on an AHA, a wash-off run-in period.

A wide range of T2DM patients were eligible to be screened for the combination studies and active comparator study, including patients not currently on an AHA, patients on monotherapy, and patients on  dual  oral  combination  therapies.  Patients  entered  a  run-in  period  in  which  their  AHAs  were discontinued,  and  treatment  with  the  single  agent  was  initiated,  titrated  as  necessary,  and  then maintained at a stable dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the monotherapy studies, patients who had HbA1c within ≥ 7 to ≤ 10% after the run-in period were randomised,  after  completion  of  a  2-week  single-blind  placebo  treatment  period,  to  placebo  or sitagliptin  100  or  200  mg  q.d.  (1:1:1  ratio  for  P021V1  and  1:2:2  ratio  for  P023V1).  There  was  no stratification in either study.

P021V1 had a 24-week double-blind treatment period (Phase A). At week 24 patients on placebo were switched to glipizide (Phase B), a 36-week active treatment period. The second-year of Phase B is currently ongoing.

P023  had  an  18-week  double-blind  treatment  period  (Phase  A),  and  also  a  longer-term  (Phase  B) treatment period.

An  additional  feature  of  both  studies  was  rescue  therapy  with  metformin  in  patients  with  poor glycaemic control. This rescue treatment was used as add-on therapy and was provided so as to allow patients  to  benefit  from  continued  participation  in  the  study  and  to  support  collection  of  a  larger database of safety and tolerability information while avoiding prolonged exposure to poorer control.

In  the combination studies  P019  (+PIO)  and  P020V1  (+MET),  patients  who  had  inadequate glycaemic  control  (HbA1c ≥ 7  and ≤ 10%)  after  the  dose-stable  run-in  period  were  eligible  to  be randomised after completing a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patients were randomised to either placebo or to sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. (1:1 ratio for P019 and 1:2 ratio for P020V1).  Rescue therapy was also included in both trials.

The percentage of patients with rescue therapy seen in studies P020V1 (monotherapy) and P021V1 (+MET) reached substantial figures (4-7% in treatment groups, 12-18% in placebo groups). To avoid the confounding influence of rescue therapy on efficacy comparisons in Phase A, the efficacy analyses treated data as missing after the initiation of rescue therapy. The primary approach to handling missing data was the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. These patients had high HbA1c values just before rescue therapy. If the actual values for HbA1c had been used, the rescue patients would have had on average lower values for HbA1c after initiation of rescue therapy. Therefore, the decrease in HbA1c within groups would have been larger with the actual values for HbA1c compared to using the LOCF values for HbA1c after initiation in rescue patients. The difference in mean change HbA1c between the groups was larger with the LOCF values substituted in rescue patients compared to using the  actual  HbA1c  values.  As  a  consequence,  the  difference  in  change  from  baseline  between  the treatment and placebo was larger in the All-Patients-Treated (APT) analysis than in the completers analysis. The Applicant was requested to submit the mean change in HbA1c within groups and mean difference between groups with the actual values for HbA1c in rescue patients in order to assess the sensitivity on the outcome for various analysis methods. Once submitted, this data did not change the overall conclusions.

In P024V1 (active comparator) patients who were already on metformin at a stable dose (for at least 10 weeks) of ≥ 1500 mg/day with inadequate glycaemic control (i.e., HbA1c ≥ 6.5% but ≤ 10%) entered a 2week, single-blind placebo run-in period, and after completion were eligible to be randomised. Patients currently on other AHA(s) had these discontinued and were started on metformin monotherapy, as were patients not currently on AHA(s). Patients already on metformin continued on metformin monotherapy. The dose of metformin was titrated to at least 1500 mg per day within 6 weeks, and after up-titration, patients entered a metformin dose-stable period of variable length, depending on patient characteristics, of at least 6 to 10 weeks in duration.

Patients  on  metformin ≥ 1500  mg/day  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  sitagliptin  100  mg  q.d.  or glipizide, which was initiated at a dose of 5 mg/day for a 104-week double-blind treatment period. . Up-titration of glipizide was performed over 18 weeks to a maximum dose of 20 mg. After 18 weeks no increase in glipizide dose was permitted, as a result of which the full potential of this drug may have been prevented.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the monotherapy studies were:

P021V : (1) After 24 weeks, to assess the effect of treatment with sitagliptin compared with placebo on HbA1c. (2) To assess the safety and tolerability of sitagliptin.

P023V1 :  (1)  After  18  weeks,  treatment  with  sitagliptin  compared  with  placebo  will  provide  greater reduction in HbA1c; (2) sitagliptin will be well tolerated.

The primary objectives of the combination and active comparator studies were:

P019 : (1) After 24 weeks, to assess the effect of the addition of treatment with sitagliptin compared with placebo on HbA1c. (2) To assess the safety and tolerability of sitagliptin.

P020V1 : (1) After 24 weeks, to assess the effect of the addition of treatment with sitagliptin compared with placebo on HbA1c; (2) To assess the safety and the tolerability of sitagliptin

P024V1 : (1) After 52 weeks, to assess the effect of the addition of sitagliptin compared with glipizide on HbA1c (2) To assess the safety and the tolerability of sitagliptin compared with glipizide.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint for the 5 Phase III studies was the change from baseline in HbA1c; fasting plasma glucose was a key secondary endpoint in all studies.

## Sample size

In P021V1, P023V1, P020V1 and P019, sample sizes were calculated to detect a true difference of 0.5% in mean change from baseline in HbA1c between sitagliptin 100 mg and placebo for a two-tailed test at α =0.05 with a power of 99%.

In P024V1 it was calculated that a sample size of 375 patients per group had greater than 96% power to declare non-inferiority for a margin of δ = 0.3% assuming that the true mean difference in HbA1c between sitagliptin and glipizide was 0%. The power calculation was based upon a two-tailed test at = 0.05.

## Blinding

Blinding  was  accomplished  by  random,  masked  assignment  of  allocation  numbers  to  the  treatment groups and by ensuring the drug supplies administered in the treatment groups appeared identical.

## Statistical methods

In all pivotal studies an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare the treatment groups in the continuous efficacy parameters, focusing on HbA1c change from baseline (Week 0) at study  endpoint.  Analyses  are  adjusted  for  baseline  values  and  presence  or  absence  of  AHA medication.

The  primary  hypothesis  in  studies  P021V1,  P023V1,  P020V1  and  P019,  regarding  superiority  of sitagliptin to placebo in decreasing HbA1c was assessed using a closed testing procedure.

The  primary  approach  to  handling  missing  data  was  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF) method.

A maximum likelihood approach for repeated measurements was used as the secondary approach for handling missing data and a completers analysis.

The  similarity  hypothesis  in  P024V1  (active  comparator  trial)  was  assessed  as  a  non-inferiority hypothesis,  that  is,  that  sitagliptin  was  not  clinically  inferior  to  (or  no  worse  than)  glipizide  in lowering HbA1c by more than a defined amount, δ =0.3%, the non-inferiority margin.

The primary population for efficacy analysis was the 'per-protocol' (PP) population. The ANCOVA model  included  terms  for  treatment,  prior  diabetes  pharmacotherapy,  and  baseline  HbA1c  as  a covariate. If the upper boundary of the two-sided 95% CI for the mean difference between sitagliptin and glipizide was less than the margin, =0.3%, then sitagliptin could be declared as non-inferior to glipizide in terms of HbA1c.

Safety and tolerability were assessed by a review of safety parameters including adverse events (AEs), laboratory  safety  parameters,  body  weight,  vital  signs,  and  ECG.  The  analysis  of  safety  parameters followed a multi-tiered approach. For tier 1 clinical AEs (hypoglycaemia and selected gastrointestinal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adverse  events)  and  body  weight,  inferential  testing  provided  statistical  significance  levels  for between-group  comparisons.  For  other  AEs  (not  in  tier  1)  and  predefined  limits  of  change  in laboratory  and  ECG  variables,  95%  CIs  for  between-group  differences  were  obtained  when  the incidence was at least 2% in one or more treatment groups.

Baseline demographic and disease specific data for the pivotal studies are presented in Table 4 and Table 5.

In the monotherapy trials, although mean baseline HbA1c was similar across treatment groups, there were differences in its distribution at baseline. In the placebo groups more patients had HbA1c &lt;8% [P021V1: placebo 132 (52.2) vs 200mg 129 (51.6); P023V1: placebo 63 (57.8) vs 200mg 99 (48.3)], while in the 200mg groups more patients had HbA1c ≥ 9% [P021V1: placebo 36 (14.2) vs 200mg 52 (20.8); P023V1: placebo 20 (18.3) vs 200mg 44 (21.5)].

In  the combination studies,  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  Study population  of  P020V1  was  considered  as  representative  for  the  claimed  indication  add-on  with metformin, as patients were inadequately controlled by metformin ≥ 1500 mg daily. In study P019, a wider range of patients was included than permitted for pioglitazone monotherapy. However, patients who are intolerant for metformin have not been reported to be distinct in other characteristics from the general population of T2DM patients. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or  congestive  heart  failure  requiring  pharmacologic  therapy.  Pioglitazone  is  also  contraindicated  in patients  with  congestive  heart  failure;  therefore  such  patients  were  not  included  into  the  trial.  A separate  study  was  performed  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency  (P028);  however  in  that  study monotherapy or combination therapy with insulin was used. Although the study population in study P019  included  a  wide  range  of  diabetic  patients  (beyond  the  current  label  for  pioglitazone),  it  is believed that these subjects adequately represented the subset of patients for which pioglitazone can be prescribed.

In active comparator trial , P024V1, demographic, anthropometric and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced across the treatment groups and were similar between the PP cohort and the all randomised cohort. The PP cohort exhibited a better baseline glycaemic control, a slightly shorter mean duration of diabetes, and a slightly smaller fraction of previously combination therapy treated patients relative to the APT cohort. The baseline HbA1c values in both the PP and the APT cohort reflected a relatively mild degree of baseline hyperglycaemia. In the PP cohort 73% of patients had baseline HbA1c values &lt;8%, and 7% of patients had baseline HbA1c values &gt;9%; in the APT cohort these values were 65% and 10% respectively.

## Outcomes and estimation

All  four superiority  trials suggested  that  sitagliptin  at  the  recommended  dose  of  100  mg  per  day effectively reduced HbA1c in patients with T2DM. The primary analysis performed was appropriate. The results clearly showed that sitagliptin reduced baseline HbA1c in the treatment group in a period of 18-24  weeks.  The  p-values  for  testing  the  difference  in  mean  change  in  the  treatment  and  placebo group  were  &lt;0.001.  Although  there  were  a  number  of  treatment  subgroup  interactions,  treatment effects in subgroups were generally consistent.

Results on HbA1c in the monotherapy Phase III trials are shown in Table 9 .

For the APT population, sitagliptin appeared to be superior to placebo in lowering HbA1c at both the 100 and 200 mg dose [least square (LS) mean difference form placebo (95% CI) -0.74, -0.49 and 0.88,  -0.64  respectively].  The  analyses  conducted  on  the  completers  populations  supported  these results.  The  sitagliptin  treatment  groups  showed  larger  within-group  decreases  from  baseline  in  the completers analysis than in the APT analysis; however, the placebo-adjusted treatment effects were smaller in the completers analysis (-0.65 and -0.75% for MK-0431 100 mg vs. placebo and MK-0431 200 mg vs. placebo, respectively), than in the APT analysis (-0.79 and -0.94% for sitagliptin 100 mg vs.  placebo  and  sitagliptin  200  mg  vs.  placebo,  respectively).  This  attenuation  of  the  placebosubtracted  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  due  to  the  removal  of  a  larger  number  of  rescued/discontinued patients from the placebo group than from the sitagliptin groups in the completers population, relative to the APT population. Rescued/discontinued patients generally had poorer HbA1c responses compared with patients who completed without rescue therapy, and thus the completers placebo group showed a greater  reduction  from  baseline  when  the  imputed  week  24/18  values  for  the  rescued/discontinued subset were removed.

Results on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Post-meal glucose confirm the effect of sitagliptin.

Both in the monotherapy studies and in the combination studies, treatment with sitagliptin resulted in a reduction in FPG at study endpoint. Furthermore, in study P021V1 and P020 (+MET), sitagliptin was superior to placebo in lowering glucose 2 hours after administration of a standard meal challenge.

Results on HbA1c for the Combination studies are shown in Table 10

.

In both studies a decrease in HbA1c was measured in the APT-Population at week 24. The difference with placebo was -0.65 (95% CI -0.77, -0.53) and -0.70 (95% CI -0.85, -0.54) respectively and was statistically significant.

In  study  P020V1  (+MET),  approximately  61%  (428/701)  of  the  randomised  patients  were  on metformin doses ≥ 2000 mg per day. Results from the analyses of change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 in this subset of patients were similar to the overall population.

In study P019 (+PIO), approximately 85% (286/334) of the patients were pioglitazone 'responders'. These included patients not on AHA therapy who were started on pioglitazone during the screening period and had at least a 20 mg/dL (1.1mmol/L) decrease in FPG by the start of the 2-week placeboblind  run-in  period;  or  patients  who  were  switched  directly  to  pioglitazone  from  another  AHA monotherapy,  and  showed  no  meaningful  deterioration  in  HbA1c  ( ≤ 0.2%  increase  in  HbA1c);  or patients  who  were  washed-off  of  their  prior  AHA  therapy,  and  then  had  at  least  a  20  mg/dL  (1.1 mmol/L)  reduction  during  the  run-in  pioglitazone  treatment  period.  Patients  entering  the  study  on PPAR γ medication (either alone or in combination) were also considered to be responders. Results of an analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 in pioglitazone responders showed results that were similar to results based on the overall study population.

Both combination studies suggested that sitagliptin was more effective than placebo in reducing HbA1c at 24 weeks. In the pioglitazone combination study a small reduction in HbA1c was also seen in the placebo group, which suggested that the optimal effect of pioglitazone had not yet been reached at study randomisation.

Results from the active comparator trial on HbA1c are shown in Figure 2 for the PP population. In both  analyses  (i.e.  PP  and  APT)  glipizide  provided  greater  initial  lowering  of  HbA1c,  with  the maximum between-group difference observed at week 24. In the secondary (APT) analysis, using the LOCF method for imputing missing data, the difference was greater than in the PP analysis. In both analyses, there was a rise in mean HbA1c in both treatment groups after Week 24. The rate of rise from nadir in the glipizide group was greater than the rate of rise in the sitagliptin group, such that by week 52 very similar reductions from baseline in the two treatment groups were seen in both the PP and APT populations.

The additional analysis performed on week 30 and week 24 data gave similar results as those from week 52.

More patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to lack of efficacy as compared to glipizide treated patients (86 [15%] vs 58 [10%]). Sitagliptin users discontinued primarily at the beginning of the  study,  while  glipizide  patients  discontinued  at  the  end.  If  the  glipizide  dose  could  have  been increased  beyond  the  initial  titration  phase,  better  results  might  have  been  obtained  with  glipizide. There was a difference between the APT and PP results, but the difference was not substantial.

Results concerning FPG showed that similar changes were observed after 52 weeks of treatment in both groups. In the PP analysis the LS Means were -10.0 mg/dL (-0.56 mmol/L) and -7.5 mg/dL (0.42 mmol/L) for the sitagliptin and glipizide treatment groups, respectively.

Profiles over time showed that both treatment groups achieved the maximal FPG effect at week 24 with subsequent attenuation of FPG-lowering efficacy. The course of the FPG change from baseline in the two treatment groups was similar. Both PP and APT analyses showed similar trends.

At Week 52, a modest, statistically significant (p&lt;0.001), decrease from baseline in body weight of 1.5 kg was observed in the sitagliptin treatment group, while the glipizide treatment group had a modest, statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.001),  increase  of  1.1  kg  from  baseline  in  body  weight,  resulting  in  a significant between-group difference of -2.5 kg (p&lt;0.001).

It  is  concluded  that  sitagliptin  at  the  recommended  dose  of  100  mg  per  day  was  shown  to  have  a significant and clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control, and that efficacy is considered similar to  glipizide  in  this  patient  population  with  predominantly  mild  to  moderate  hyperglycaemia  on monotherapy with metformin as described in the SPC, section 5.1, but non-inferior efficacy compared to  sulfonylureas  was  not  unequivocally  proven.  The  latter  conclusion  was  based  on  the  restrictions regarding dose titration of glipizide possibly preventing assessment of the full potential of this drug. Furthermore, although not designed and powered to compare efficacy, in study P010 (dose finding), glipizide  performed  statistically  better  and  in  study  P020V1  (+MET)  numerically  better  than sitagliptin. To address the point of non-inferiority, a description of study P024V1, including the dose titration of glipizide has been described in the SPC, section 5.1.

## Ancillary analyses

In  Phase  III  studies,  several  endpoints  were  included  to  assess  changes  in β -cell  function  with sitagliptin  therapy  including  HOMAβ ,  measurement  of  fasting  insulin  secretion,  and  proinsulin  to insulin ratio, intended to assess improvement in beta-cell function.

In P021V1 (monotherapy), there was a significant reduction in the proinsulin to insulin ratio relative to placebo in all treatment groups. In P023V1 (monotherapy), there was a significant reduction in this ratio relative to placebo for the 100 mg dose (p&lt;0.05); this was also seen for the 200 mg dose but it did not reach statistical significance. In these studies showed a significant increase in HOMAβ at both doses.

In study P020V1 (+MET), significant treatment group differences for sitagliptin compared to placebo (p&lt;0.05)  were  observed  for  change  from  baseline  in  the  proinsulin  to  insulin  ratio;  similarly,  the results  presented  for  HOMAβ also  show  a  statistically  significant  increase  with  sitagliptin  100  mg q.d.  relative  to  placebo  (p&lt;0.001).  In  study  P019  (+PIO),  a  significant  decrease  in  the  fasting proinsulin  to  insulin  ratio  with  sitagliptin  was  seen. Sitagliptin  provided  a  statistically  significant increase (p&lt;0.001) from baseline in HOMAβ . A more modest increase in HOMAβ was observed in the  placebo  treatment  group  that  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.027). However,  with  the  small increase observed in the placebo group, the between-treatment group difference was not statistically significant (p=0.080).

## · Clinical studies in special populations

Study  P028V1  was  designed  to  examine  the  safety  of  dose-adjusted  sitagliptin  monotherapy  or combination therapy with insulin in T2DM  patients  with  moderate to severe chronic renal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insufficiency, including those with ESRD on dialysis, who had inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise, or inadequate glycaemic control on insulin monotherapy.

After  12  weeks,  an  improvement  was  seen  in  glycaemic  control  in  sitagliptin  treated  patients. However,  efficacy  was  not  a  primary  endpoint  in  this  study  and  only  descriptive  statistics  were provided for glycaemic variables (HbA1c, FPG, and fructosamine).

Results on efficacy are therefore not further described here. See Safety section for further information on the results of this study.

## Clinical safety

Potential  safety  issues  considered  in  the  development  program  of  sitagliptin,  which  impacted  the design  of  the  clinical  studies,  were  based  upon  (1)  issues  arising  from  the  results  of  preclinical toxicology studies and (2) potential issues that are based upon the mechanism of action of sitagliptin.

Issues from preclinical toxicology studies were skeletal muscle degeneration and neurological toxicity. Furthermore, skin necrosis was seen in monkeys treated with other DPP-4 inhibitors. No such skin findings have been seen in clinical studies with sitagliptin.

Issues based on the mechanism of action were:

1. Gastrointestinal AEs related to increased active GLP-1 levels with DPP-4 inhibition.
2. Effects related to the fact that DPP-4 is present on immune cells.
3. Effects of inhibition of DPP-4 on other DPP-4 peptide substrates.

Therefore  the list of potential safety issues which  was  followed  closely  during  the  clinical development  was:  based  on  the  preclinical  findings,  slight  muscle  degeneration  and  neurological toxicity;  and  based  upon  theoretical  concerns,  allergic  phenomena/angioedema,  hypoglycaemia, hypotension, gastrointestinal AEs, and infections/immune phenomena.

Initially, safety assessment of sitagliptin was hampered by the fact that no overall data was presented and  data  from  ongoing  studies  at  that  moment  was  not  submitted.  Concerns  on  missing  data  were addressed in the responses to the D120 LoQ, when comparisons of safety data were submitted. These were:

Comparison  1 :  Sitagliptin  vs  Placebo  as  Add  on  to  Metformin  (based  upon  P020V1  [Placebocontrolled Study of Sitagliptin as Add on to Metformin]). This clinical study report for this study was submitted as part of the marketing application.

Comparison 2 : Sitagliptin vs Glipizide as Add-on to Metformin (based upon the recently completed 52 week period of P024V1, the Active- Comparator [Glipizide] Controlled Study of Sitagliptin as Add on to Metformin).

Comparison  3 :  Sitagliptin  vs  Placebo  as  Add  on  to  PPAR γ Agonist  (based  upon  P019  [Placebocontrolled Study of Sitagliptin as Add on to PPAR γ Agonist]. This clinical study report for this study was submitted as part of the marketing application.

Comparison 4 : Sitagliptin vs Placebo in Monotherapy (from Pooled Monotherapy Studies).

Comparison  5 :  Sitagliptin  Exposed  vs  Non-Exposed  based  upon  a  new  Pooled  Phase  II/III Population.

Comparison 5 included  results  from  Phase  II  studies  (P010  and  P014  base  and  extension  periods), results from Phase III studies that were in the original marketing application (P019, P020V1, P021V1, P023V1),  additional  results  through  1-year  from  two  of  these  studies  (P020V1  and  P023V1),  and results from three studies that were completed after the filing of the marketing application: P024V1, P035 and P036. Therefore this was the comparison that included nearly all submitted data.

- Patient exposure

Phase I studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The total number of patients exposed to sitagliptin in the Phase I studies was 561, with doses ranging from ≤ 25 mg to 800 mg.

## Phase II/III studies

A total of 3832 patients were randomised to receive sitagliptin in the pooled phase II/III studies: 590 to doses of sitagliptin &lt;100mg/day, 2786 to sitagliptin 100mg/day, and 456 to sitagliptin 200mg/day. The non-exposed group comprised 2355 patients. Since sitagliptin 100mg was the most common dose across the Phase II/III studies, this dose group is the largest and hence most robust.

- Adverse events

## Phase I studies

The most common clinical AEs (occurring in &gt;1% of any sitagliptin subjects) that were of numerically slightly  higher  incidence  than  placebo  included  dizziness  (4.9%  vs.  2.2%),  headache  (21.0%  vs. 15.4%), and somnolence (4.1% vs. 2.2%) though these adverse experiences were infrequent and the differences were small. In the rising single-dose and multiple-dose studies, during which single doses of 800 mg and multiple doses up to 600 mg were administered, there were no clear differences in the incidence of any AE from placebo (including those noted above) and no increase in the incidence of AEs  (overall  or  specific)  with  increasing  dose.  AEs  related  to  theoretical  concerns  or  preclinical toxicities showed a similar incidence rate to placebo (i.e. allergic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal phenomenon, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and infections). A slightly higher incidence of AEs related to neurological events following treatment with sitagliptin was seen versus placebo.

Two serious AEs occurred in Phase I studies; these were acute myocardial infarction  (healthy subject) and  primary  atypical  pneumonia  (T2DM  subject).  Both  subjects  recovered  and  both  events  were determined to be 'probably not' related to study drug by the investigators.

There were no apparent treatment or dose-dependent clinically meaningful effects on laboratory safety parameters. In addition, there was no evidence for dose-dependent, meaningful effects on the growth hormone  axis.  No  dose-dependent,  treatment-related,  clinically  relevant  effects  were  seen  on  vital signs. Sitagliptin did appear to modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension.

## Phase II/III studies

## \"SITAGLIPTIN EXPOSED VS NON-EXPOSED\"

Clinical  AEs  were  reported  for  1788  (64.2%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin  exposed  100  mg  group  and 1484 (63.0%) patients in the non-exposed group (patients receiving placebo or other oral antidiabetic drug(s)), who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. The incidences of deaths, patients  discontinued  due  to  serious  or  non-serious  AEs,  serious  drug-related  AEs,  and  patients discontinued due to serious  drug-related  AEs  were  similar  in  both  groups.  The  incidences  of  drugrelated  AEs  and  patients  discontinuing  due  to  a  drug-related  AEs  were  higher  in  the  non-exposed treatment group.

The  comparison  of  sitagliptin  'Exposed  vs  Non-Exposed'  based  upon  the  new  Pooled  Phase  II/III Population, seen in Table 11, showed that in general treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg was associated with an increased incidence ( ≥ 1% in one or more treatment groups) or event rate in AEs in the SOCs of:

- Gastrointestinal Disorders (18.6% in sitagliptin exposed vs 16.4% in non-exposed),
- Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (16.4% in sitagliptin exposed vs 14.3% in non-exposed), and
- Infections and Infestations (33.8% in sitagliptin exposed vs 29.9% in non-exposed),
- Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (6.6% in sitagliptin exposed vs 5.6% in non-exposed)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidences of AEs grouped by SOC for Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders , Infection and Infestations , Gastrointestinal  Disorders and Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders SOCs were higher in the exposed group, with 95%-CI's not including \"0\".

When  event  rates  were  grouped  by  SOC  (i.e.,  for  each  treatment  group,  total  number  of  events occurring  within  a  SOC  divided  by  mean  duration  of  exposure  for  the  group)  the  between-group differences for the Infection and Infestation , Gastrointestinal Disorders , and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOCs were smaller (Infection and Infestations: 76 and 74.8 events per 100  patient-years  in  sitagliptin  exposed  vs  non-exposed;  Gastrointestinal  Disorders:  41.8  and  39.1 events per 100 patient-years in sitagliptin exposed vs non-exposed; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: 32.6 and 31.5 events per 100 patient-years in sitagliptin exposed vs non-exposed).

The difference in SOC for Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (incidence 0.9 vs 0.3%; number of events per patient-year were 1.5 vs 0.6 for sitagliptin 100mg and non-exposed group) was mainly due to anaemia and iron deficiency in the sitagliptin 100mg group.

Similarly,  in  study  P024V1  (comparison  with  glipizide  as  add-on  to  metformin)  difference  was observed  in  change  from  baseline  in  haemoglobin  in  the  sitagliptin  100mg  relative  to  glipizide treatment group (difference -0.07 g/dL). It is unlikely that these differences have clinical importance.

The most frequent AEs reported, regardless of causal relationship to medication, and occurring in at least  5%  and  more  commonly  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin,  included  upper  respiratory  tract infection (7.7%) and nasopharyngitis (6.6%).

In study P024V1 (comparison with glipizide as add-on to metformin) the main AEs were in the same SOCs, with an additional  SOC of Nervous  System  Disorders .  Furthermore,  compared  to  placebo, most frequently reported AEs were in these SOCs too.

The following specific clinical adverse events occurred at a higher incidence (i.e., confidence interval around  the  between-group  difference  did  not  include  \"0\")  in  the  primary  safety  analysis  in  the sitagliptin 100 mg group compared to the non-exposed group: abdominal pain upper, dyspepsia, chills, bronchitis,  nasopharyngitis,  tooth  abscess,  meniscus  lesion,  osteoarthritis,  nasal  congestion,  and contact dermatitis. Although psychiatric disorders occurred at similar frequencies, the higher incidence of  suicide  ideation/completed  suicide  in  sitagliptin  exposed  vs.  non-exposed  individuals  (4  vs.  1, respectively) was considered disturbing; as CNS effects of sitagliptin cannot be excluded, these events will be monitored post-marketing.

The  incidence  of  drug-related  clinical  AEs  overall  was  lower  for  the  sitagliptin  100  mg  group compared to the non-exposed treatment group (13.1% vs. 18.0%).

Across  clinical  studies,  a  small  increase  in  white  blood  cell  count  (approximately  200 cells/microl difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This observation was seen in most but not all studies. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.

Overall,  it  was  concluded  that  sitagliptin  treatment  was  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  in infections  and  infestations , gastrointestinal  disorders , musculoskeletal  disorders ,  and nervous system AEs. Event rate was increased for skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders . These AEs have been included in the SPC, and in the RMP.

## COMBINATION WITH METFORMIN

In study  P020V1 ,  a  24-week  study  of  sitagliptin  100 mg  in  combination  with  metformin,  the incidence of AEs considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/metformin compared to treatment with placebo/metformin was 9.3 % and 10.1 %, respectively.

The most frequent ADRs reported in patients treated with sitagliptin occurring in excess (&gt; 0.2 % and difference &gt; 1 patient) of that in patients treated with placebo can be seen in table 12.

Nausea was the only drug-related AE that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1%, occurring in 5 patients (1.1%) in the sitagliptin treatment group compared to 1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo group.

| Blood Glucose Decreased    | 2 (0.4)                            | 0 (0.0)                 |

SAEs were reported with a generally similar frequency between treatment groups for 13 (2.8%) and 7 (3.0%) patients in the sitagliptin and the placebo treatment groups, respectively. None of the SAEs was considered to be drug-related.

In study  P024V1 ,  1-year  study  of  sitagliptin  100 mg  in  combination  with  metformin  compared  to sulfonylurea/metformin,  clinical  AEs  were  reported  by  419  (71.3%)  patients  in  the  sitagliptin treatment group and 444 (76.0%) patients in the glipizide treatment group, who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. There was a slightly higher incidence of overall AEs in the glipizide  treatment  group,  and  a  moderately  higher  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  reported  in  the glipizide treatment  group  (30.3%)  compared  to  the  sitagliptin  treatment  group  (14.5%).  The differences in overall and drug-related AEs  were  primarily due to the higher incidence of hypoglycemia reported in the glipizide treatment group (32%) compared to the sitagliptin group (5%). No meaningful differences were observed for the sitagliptin treatment group compared to the glipizide treatment group in incidence of SAEs, serious or non-serious AEs leading to discontinuation, or other summary measures of clinical AEs analyzed. For all of these summary measures, the 95% CI for the between-group differences included \"0\".

In  pooled  studies  of  up  to  1  year  in  duration  comparing  sitagliptin/metformin  to  a  sulfonylurea agent/metformin ( P020V1 and P024V1 ), the incidence of drug-related AEs was notably lower in the sitagliptin treatment group than in the glipizide treatment group due to the higher incidence of drug related hypoglycemia in the glipizide treatment group. The drug-related AEs of hypoglycemia and of weight gain occurred at a notably higher rate in the glipizide treatment group. The adverse reactions considered  as  drug-related  reported  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  100 mg  occurring  in  excess (&gt; 0.2 % and difference &gt; 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulfonylurea agent were from the following SOCs:

Investigations : weight decreased (4 patients [0.4%] and 0, respectively)

Metabolism and nutrition disorders : anorexia (4 patients [0.4%] and 1 patient [0.1%], respectively).

## COMBINATION WITH A PPAR γ AGENT (PIOGLITAZONE)

Study  P019 (+PIO),  had  a  duration  of  24  weeks  and  was  considered  a  priori  too  short  for  an appropriate safety assessment in terms of cardiovascular safety.  The incidence of peripheral oedema in  this  study  was  slightly  increased  (4.0%  vs  2.8%,  7  vs.  5  patients)  when  sitagliptin  was  added  to pioglitazone compared to the addition of placebo. Though not considered a strong signal the data were also not considered reassuring. The Applicant agreed to follow up on the cardiovascular safety of this patient population in the approved indications as a post-authorisation commitment.

The  incidence  of  AEs  considered  as  drug-related  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin/pioglitazone compared to patients treated with placebo/pioglitazone was 9.1 % and 9.0 %, respectively. Adverse reactions  considered  as  drug-related  reported  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  occurring  in  excess (&gt; 0.2 % and difference &gt; 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo were as follows:

## MONOTHERAPY

Results from comparison 4, showed that in the monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks duration, AEs considered  as  drug-related  reported  in  patients  treated  with  sitagliptin  in  excess  (&gt; 0.2 %  and difference  &gt; 1  patient)  of  that  in  patients  receiving  placebo  were  headache  (1.3 %),  hypoglycaemia (1.1 %), constipation (0.7 %), and dizziness (0.6 %). These results were obtained excluding data after initiation of glycaemic rescue therapy.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Information on all  deaths  with  a  cut-off  date  of  7-July-2006,  including  results  from  completed  and ongoing studies, regardless of occurrence prior to or after initiation of rescue glycaemic therapy was submitted.  30  deaths  were  reported  in  the  development  program  for  sitagliptin:  23  deaths  were reported  in  the  Phase  II/III  studies  in  patients  with  T2DM  (excluding  P028),  and  7  deaths  were reported in P028. No deaths were considered related to study drug.

Of the 23 deaths reported in the Phase II/III studies, 4 were reported prior to randomisation (all during the run-in period in Phase III studies) and 19 after randomisation. Among the 19 patients who died after randomisation, 5 occurred in Phase II studies (P010 and P014 base period or study extensions) and 14 occurred in Phase III studies. Of the 5 post-randomisation deaths in Phase II studies, 3 occurred in patients in a sitagliptin group and 2 occurred in patients on glipizide.

Of the 14 post-randomisation deaths in Phase III studies, 7 occurred in a sitagliptin treatment group, and  7  occurred  in  a  non-  exposed  group.  Since  this  information  includes  deaths  that  occurred  in ongoing studies as well as completed studies, the exact exposure in the sitagliptin and the non-exposed treatment  groups  was  not  available.  However,  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  studies,  3832  patients  were randomised  to  a  sitagliptin  treatment  group,  and  2355  patients  were  randomised  to  a  non-exposed group. Since patients in the placebo group in studies P010 (dose finding) and P021V1 (monotherapy) were switched to a sitagliptin treatment group, the actual number of patients exposed to sitagliptin was larger  than  that  indicated  by  the  original  randomised  patient  numbers.  However,  based  upon  the number  of  patients  randomised  to  a  sitagliptin  or  to  a  non-exposed  group  in  the  Phase  II  and  III studies,  0.26%  of  patients  randomised  to  sitagliptin  died  and  0.38%  patients  randomised  to  a  nonexposed group died.

In  study  P028,  65  patients  were  randomised  to  sitagliptin  and  26  patients  were  randomised  to treatment with placebo (switched at week 12 to glipizide). Of the 7 deaths reported, one was reported prior  to  randomisation,  5  deaths  were  reported  in  patients  randomised  to  sitagliptin  and  one  was reported in a patient randomised to glipizide treatment. One additional patient, who had severe renal insufficiency and who had been allocated to the placebo/glipizide group, died of bowel ischemia in the post-study period. Looking at the randomisation ratio the difference is higher than expected. In the sitagliptin group, 4 of the 5 patients died due to cardiac AEs, while there was no cardiac death in the glipizide group. It was observed, however, that in addition to the larger size of the sitagliptin treatment group (65 vs 26 patients), the proportion of patients in the sitagliptin group with prior cardiac disease at  baseline  was  also  higher  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Although,  study  P028  was  very  small, precluding  an  appropriate  safety  assessment,  this  finding  was  of  some  concern.  The  data  was considered in general too limited to confirm the safe use of sitagliptin in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, therefore sitagliptin is not recommended in this patient population and this has been reflected as such in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of serious non-fatal clinical AEs was similar in the sitagliptin 100 mg (5.9%), 200 mg (5.0%) and the non-exposed (5.5%) treatment groups, and slightly higher in the sitagliptin &lt;100 mg (7.8%).  There  was  no  apparent  pattern  of  specific  serious  non-fatal  clinical  AEs  observed  in  the sitagliptin 100 mg treatment group.

In the whole Pooled Phase II/III Population there were 2 patients with a serious laboratory AE. One patient in the sitagliptin 100 mg group had increased lipase; one patient in the sitagliptin 200 mg group experienced decreased blood potassium and blood sodium.

## · Laboratory findings

Laboratory AEs were reported for 271 (9.8%) patients in the sitagliptin 100 mg group and 221 (9.5%) patient in the non-exposed group who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and had  at  least  one  laboratory  test  performed  post-baseline.  The  incidences  of  laboratory  AEs,  drugrelated laboratory AEs and patients discontinued due to a laboratory AE were generally similar in the sitagliptin 100 mg group compared to the non-exposed group although all incidences were low. For all of these summary measures, the 95% CI for between group differences included '0'.

There  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  incidence  of  specific laboratory AEs, or all specific laboratory AEs, the CIs around the between group differences included \"0\".  The  incidence  of  specific  drug-related  laboratory  AEs  was  generally  similar  in  the  sitagliptin 100mg and the non-exposed groups.

## · Safety in special populations

Safety data of elderly patients was presented for the Pooled Phase II/III Population. No meaningful differences  were  observed  in  younger  compared  to  older  patients  in  the  overall  incidence  of  either clinical or laboratory AEs by SOC, or any specific AEs. Older patients had a higher overall incidence of serious clinical AEs, as might be expected; however, there was no meaningful difference observed in the sitagliptin treatment groups relative to the non-exposed group. A slightly greater proportion of older patients discontinued due to SAEs in the sitagliptin 100 mg group compared to the non-exposed group, but this was not observed in the sitagliptin 200 mg group. Review of the specific SAEs leading to  discontinuation  did  not  show  any  discernable  pattern  in  the  types  of  SAEs  observed  in  the sitagliptin groups relative to non-exposed group.

Review of safety results from older and younger patients showed that the incidence of AEs by SOC or of  specific  AEs  in  the  sitagliptin  treated  relative  to  the  non-sitagliptin  treated  patients  was  not meaningfully  different. No  particular AEs  appeared  to  occur with sitagliptin treatment at a meaningfully higher incidence in older patients relative to younger patients.

Overall,  safety  and  tolerability  of  sitagliptin  are  considered  acceptable.  However,  patients  with moderate to severe renal insufficiency should not use sitagliptin, as safety in these patients has not been demonstrated sufficiently, as is mentioned in several sections of the SPC. Additionally, further data on cardiovascular safety in the patient population to be treated with sitagliptin will be addressed as part of the post-authorisation follow-up measures.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues, which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The primary glucose-lowering property and effects on GLP-1 plasma levels of DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin  have  been  shown.  Except  for  some  minor  cardiovascular  safety  effects  through  DPP-4 inhibition, inhibition of other enzymes such as DPP8/9 are not anticipated at exposures required for glucose lowering in humans.

Sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, was bioavailable, and exhibited fairly linear oral pharmacokinetics. It is a moderate to high clearance drug, with a relatively short plasma half-life. Metabolism of the drug is minor, being excreted primarily unchanged in human, rat and dog

In  vitro assays  indicated  that  the  risk  for  clinically  meaningful  interactions  is  low.  At  clinically relevant concentrations, sitagliptin did not inhibit cytochrome P450s or Pgp, nor did it induce human CYP3A4.  However  interactions  could  be  of  greater  importance  in  patients  with  severe  renal insufficiency or ESRD. This has not been assessed in clinical studies.

Skin necrosis was seen in monkeys treated with other DPP-4 inhibitors; this was considered in the development program of sitagliptin, and some studies are still ongoing to this respect. No skin findings were seen in preclinical studies with monkeys or clinical studies with sitagliptin

Renal  and  liver  toxicity  were  observed  in rodents  at  systemic  exposure  values  58 times  the  human exposure level. The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical  signs, some  of  which  suggest  neural  toxicity  were  observed  in  dogs  at  exposure  levels approximately 23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight-to-slight skeletal muscle degeneration  was  also  observed  histologically  at  doses  resulting  in  systemic  exposure  levels  of approximately 23 times the human exposure level.

Sitagliptin  has  not  been  demonstrated  to  be  genotoxic  in  preclinical  studies.  Sitagliptin  was  not carcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas; however, these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation in humans.

No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and throughout mating. Reproductive toxicity studies showed  a  slight treatment-related increased incidence  of  fetal  rib  malformations  in  the  offspring  of  rats  at  systemic  exposure  levels  more  than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than 29 times the human  exposure  levels.  These  findings  do  not  suggest  a  relevant  risk  for  human  reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of lactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1), and was seen to cross the rat and rabbit placenta readily. Based on this pre-clinical data, and the lack of human studies, sitagliptin should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding.

## Efficacy

Sitagliptin 100mg or 200mg qd was compared to placebo in two monotherapy trials (P021V1/P023V1). The duration of these studies was of 18 and 24 weeks, both presenting extension phases. These studies showed that sitagliptin at the recommended 100mg dose clearly and clinically relevantly reduced baseline HbA1c for the duration of the studies.

In the combination studies sitagliptin was added to metformin (P020V1) or pioglitazone (P019), and compared to the effect of addition of placebo. These studies had 24-week durations, with an extension

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  104  weeks  in  the  metformin  combination  study.  The  results  of  these  combination  studies  also showed  that  sitagliptin  100mg  effectively  reduced  HbA1c  in  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  for  the duration of the studies.

In  the  active  comparator  study  P024V1  (Sitagliptin+Metformin  compared  to  Metformin+Glipizide), sitagliptin 100 mg per day was shown to have a significant and clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control.  Sitagliptin  was  similar  to  glipizide  in  reducing  HbA1c  in  this  patient  population  with predominantly  mild  to  moderate  hyperglycaemia  on  monotherapy  with  metformin,  but  non-inferior efficacy  compared  to  sulfonylureas  has  not  unequivocally  been  proven.  The  latter  conclusion  was based on the restrictions regarding dose titration of glipizide possibly preventing assessment of the full potential of this drug. Furthermore, although not designed and powered to compare efficacy, in study P010,  phase  II  dose  finding  study  in  monotherapy,  glipizide  performed  statistically  better  than sitagliptin; and in study P020V1 numerically better than sitagliptin.

Studies  P021V1,  P020V1  and  P024V1  provided  long-term  efficacy  data.  The  results  from  the monotherapy and combination studies showed that sitagliptin treatment resulted in an improvement in HbA1c with a nadir observed at week 30, followed by a rise but still maintenance of HbA1c lowering at week 54. Glipizide treatment in Phase B of study P020V1 as add-on to metformin resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c values, but the difference was small. In P024V1, there was a rise in mean HbA1c in both treatment groups after Week 24. The rate of rise from nadir in the glipizide group was greater than the rate of rise in the sitagliptin group, such that by week 52 very similar reductions from baseline in the two treatment groups were seen. More patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to lack of efficacy as compared to glipizide treated patients.

## Safety

Overall, it can be concluded that sitagliptin treatment was associated with an increased incidence in infections,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  musculoskeletal  disorders,  and  nervous  system.  These  adverse events  have  been  included  in  the  SPC.  Event  rate  was  increased  for  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue disorders.  These  adverse  events  are  seen  as  potential  risk  and  have  been  included  in  the  risk management plan.

In favour of sitagliptin, studies indicate that the risk of hypoglycaemia is decreased as compared to glipizide  treatment.  In  addition,  sitagliptin  was  shown  to  have  a  favourable  impact  on  body  weight compared to glipizide.

Specific adverse drug reactions that were increased in the Januvia group vs. placebo when sitagliptin was  combined  with  metformin  were:  somnolence,  nausea,  upper  abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  blood glucose decreased, anorexia and weight decreased.

In  the  combination  with  pioglitazone,  specific  adverse  drug  reactions  that  were  increased  in  the Januvia group vs. placebo when sitagliptin was combined with pioglitazone were: hypoglycaemia and flatulence. There was also a slight increase in the frequency of peripheral oedema as an adverse event.

Safety data of elderly patients were presented for the Pooled Phase II/III Population. No meaningful differences  were  observed  in  younger  compared  to  older  patients  in  the  overall  incidence  of  either clinical or laboratory adverse events by SOC or of specific adverse events.

In the study on renal insufficiency (P028), there were more cardiac adverse events and more patients died in the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo/glipizide group. Although, study P028 was very small, precluding an appropriate safety assessment, this finding was of some concern. The data was considered in general too limited to confirm the safe use of sitagliptin in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, therefore sitagliptin is not recommended in this patient population and this has been reflected as such in the SPC.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## · User consultation

The  target  patient  groups  'user  consultation'  was  assessed  as  part  the  applicant's  responses  to  the D120 List of Questions.

## Risk-benefit assessment

In conclusion, the benefit-risk ratio for sitagliptin is considered positive in the treatment of patients with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  or  a PPAR γ agonist  (i.e.  thiazolidinedione)  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  the  single  agent  do  not  provide glycaemic control. However, more safety data are needed in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency before the use of sitagliptin can be recommended in this patient population.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  Pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Januvia  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin when diet and exercise, plus metformin  do  not  provide  adequate  glycaemic  control,  and  also  for  patients  with  type  2  diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPAR γ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, in combination with the  PPAR γ agonist  when  diet  and  exercise  plus  the  PPAR γ agonist  alone  do  not  provide  adequate glycaemic  control  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation .
