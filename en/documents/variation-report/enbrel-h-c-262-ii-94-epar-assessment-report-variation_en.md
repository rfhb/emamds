## I. SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION

## 1. Introduction

Etanercept is an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agent that has been approved for the treatment of moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  in  adult  patients,  Rheumatoid  Arthritis  (RA),  Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).

Plaque  psoriasis  is  a  common  condition  affecting  1-3%  of  the  population.  In  about  one  third  of patients, psoriasis starts in the first or second decade of life ( Benoit and Hamm , 2007 Clin Dermatol .; 25(6):555-62.).  Systemic  therapy  is  reserved  for  a  minority  of  cases  ( Leman  J,  Burden  D .  2001, Paediatric  Drugs ;3(9):673-80).  Currently  licensed  medications  for  paediatric  plaque  psoriasis  are limited and the options available vary from one country to another.

The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) submitted this Type II variation to extend the indication to ' treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to topical or other systemic therapies or photo-therapies '. The posology proposed was 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly  for  up  to  24  weeks  and  if  re-treatment  with  Enbrel  is  indicated,  the  same  guidance  for treatment duration was applied for.

Consequential  changes  were  proposed  to  sections  4.2,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  summary  of  product information (SPC) and sections 1 and 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL).

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to relocate one sentence in section 7 of the PL (Instructions for Preparing and Giving an Injection of Enbrel) for the paediatric pack. In the subsection on 'Adding solvent to the vial', under step 3, the sentence 'Remove the solvent syringe and needle from the vial and discard them.' was moved from the end of the paragraph to the beginning of the paragraph. This change places the sequence of steps in the powder reconstitution procedure in the proper order for the patient.

## 2. Clinical aspects

One clinical study (20030211) was submitted in this dossier to support the use of etanercept in the treatment of plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients.

## Main Study

Study  20030211  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  of  211 subjects, followed by an open-label treatment period and a randomised treatment withdrawal period (total duration 48-weeks), to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) once a week (QW) versus placebo in children (ages 4 to 11 years) and adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who met study eligibility criteria.

The study consisted of 3 treatment periods (Figure 1):

(1) a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period lasting 12 weeks;

(2) an open-label treatment period lasting 24 weeks; and

(3) a randomised, double-blind, withdrawal-retreatment period lasting 12 weeks.

During the double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, subjects with substantial worsening of their  disease  were  given  the  option  to  enter  an  escape  arm  where  they  would  receive  open-label etanercept therapy. Additionally, during the open-label treatment period, subjects who did not achieve a  pre-specified  disease  improvement  (psoriasis  area  and  severity  index  (PASI)  50 1 at  24  weeks  or PASI 75 2 at  36 weeks) were given the option to withdraw from the study or to enter an incomplete-

1 A PASI 50 response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease (i.e., improvement) from baseline in PASI score.

2 A PASI 75 response was defined as a 75% or greater decrease (i.e., improvement) from baseline in PASI score.

responder arm and add topical standard of care to the investigational therapy. Subjects who achieved disease  control  at  week  36  (PASI  75)  were  re-randomised  double-blind  to  receive  etanercept  or placebo  (the  withdrawal-retreatment  period)  to  evaluate  disease  relapse  and  durability  of  response. Subjects  who  no  longer  maintained  a  PASI  75  response  could  resume  treatment  with  open-label etanercept in the incomplete responder arm.

## Inclusion Criteria

All  subjects  were  anti-TNF  therapy  naïve  and  were  between  4  and  17  years  old  inclusive  with  a history of stable moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of ≥ 3, PASI score of ≥ 12, and body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥ 10%) for ≥ 6 months at the time of randomisation. Subjects were required to

- Have current or past treatment with phototherapy or systemic psoriasis therapy (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporin, retinoids), or
- Be  considered  poorly  controlled  with  topical  psoriasis  therapy,  as  evidenced  by  persistence  of moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  despite  a  current  or  previous  treatment  course  of  at  least  6-week duration  with  a  corticosteroid  of  at  least  moderate  potency  or  a  vitamin  D  analogue.  Persistent moderately severe psoriasis during the treatment course was defined as signs and symptoms of psoriasis listed as follows, occurring over a clinically significant portion of the body surface area (BSA), in the opinion of the investigator: erythema - at least moderate red coloration, induration at least moderate plaque elevation with rounded or sloped edges, scaling - at least coarse scaling.

## Exclusion Criteria

The following were specific exclusion criteria:

The presence of guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis during the screening period or any other skin  condition  (e.g.  eczema)  which  would  interfere with  evaluations  of the  effect  of  investigational product on psoriasis: any chronic or recurrent active infection within 6 months of screening: receipt of any systemic psoriasis therapy or oral or parenteral steroids within 14 days before the first dose of investigational  product:  receipt  of  any  topical  therapy  (vitamin  A  or  D  analogues,  anthralin,  or calcineurin inhibitor) - other than topical steroids at no higher than moderate strength on the scalp, axillae, and groin - within 14 days before the first dose of investigational product: receipt of any other investigational product within 30 days before the first dose of investigational product: receipt of live attenuated  vaccine  (e.g.  MMR,  varicella)  within  12  weeks  before  the  first  dose  of  investigational

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product, or intranasal influenza vaccine (FluMist). Other relevant exclusion criteria were the diagnosis of  multiple  sclerosis  or  any  other  demyelinating  disease;  insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  or  a history of cancer.

## Prior and Concomitant Therapy

Subjects must have had an updated immunisation schedule according to the American Academy of Paediatrics guideline in the US or the Canadian Immunization Guide in Canada to minimise the need for immunisation during the study treatment period.

Throughout  the  study,  investigators  could  prescribe  concomitant  medications  or  treatments  deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care other than the disallowed medications as listed below.

To prevent interference with efficacy assessments, subjects were not to receive the following therapies throughout the duration of the study, including the 30-day follow-up period:

- PUVA, UVA, or UVB therapy
- Any systemic psoriasis therapy (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, etanercept or any other anti-TNF agent(s))
- Oral or parenteral corticosteroids including intramuscular or intraarticular administration (the use of otic, nasal, or inhaled corticosteroids within recommended doses was allowed).
- Topical  steroids,  topical  vitamin  A  or  D  analog  preparations,  or  anthralin.  The  use  of  topical steroids that are low or moderate potency, per the package insert, was allowed during the study on the scalp, axilla, and groin only. At the investigator's discretion, the use of topical steroids of mild potency, per the package insert, was allowed on the face.

Exception: Topical standard of care, including those listed above, was allowed for subjects who entered the incomplete-responder arm.

- Topical calcineurin inhibitors Exception: allowed for subjects who entered the incomplete-responder arm
- Kineret (anakinra)
- Excessive sunbathing or use of tanning salons
- Any investigational product other than etanercept

Subjects who entered the incomplete-responder arm could be treated with topical standard of care such as vitamin A and vitamin D analogue preparations, anthralin, calcineurin inhibitors, and corticosteroids (mild or moderate, per package inserts).

Topical  anaesthetic  agents  were  encouraged  for  use  as  local  analgesia  approximately  30  minutes before SC injections of investigational product or prior to venipuncture.

In the event the subject was exposed to or infected with varicella zoster virus during the study, the subject was treated according to the standard of care for those at high risk of developing severe disease (e.g. varicella zoster immunoglobulin and/or acyclovir).

The CHMP considered the study design adequate according to its objectives. The randomised, doubleblind comparison with placebo during 12 weeks allowed for efficacy and safety assessment, while for an evaluation of treatment duration, the open-label and withdrawal retreatment periods are of interest, although the total study duration of 48 weeks was considered insufficient for a full characterisation of an adequate use of a new drug in a chronically remitting and relapsing disease.

In order to ensure an adequate disease control, escape of the treatment allocated was allowed during the  study,  from  as  soon  as  week  4,  in  order  to  receive  open-label  etanercept.  Although  this  can facilitate a disease improvement, it also complicated the analysis and interpretation of study results.

During the study, concomitant therapies for psoriasis, (apart from topical steroids of low to moderate potency  in  limited  areas),  were  not  allowed  (except  in  the  incomplete-responder  arm);  however,  in clinical practice, possibly, the combination of both therapies could be beneficial.

The study population was in accordance with the target population of this variation, although the lower age  limit  of  4  years  precluded  obtaining  information  in  children  of  3  years-old  or  younger  with psoriasis.

## 2.1 Clinical Pharmacology

## Clinical pharmacokinetics

The formulation of etanercept used in study 20030211 was the 25-mg lyophilized vial that is currently approved.  Therefore,  there  was  no  new  important  information  related  to  bioavailability  that  might affect efficacy and/or safety.

In study 20030211, the posology proposed was 0.8 mg/kg once weekly to a maximum dose of 50 mg. This choice of posology was based on the fact that 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly is used in JIA and that equivalence between posology of 25 mg twice weekly and 50 mg once weekly in adults has previously been demonstrated in AS and RA. Of note is that a marketing authorisation has been granted for once weekly etanercept in adults with PsA, based on population PK data and efficacy data.

Serum etanercept concentrations were determined from all etanercept-treated subjects with available samples (Table 1).

At  week  12,  the  mean  trough  etanercept  concentration  for  subjects  who  were  initially  randomly assigned to etanercept was 1614 ng/mL. At week 48, the mean trough etanercept concentration was 1650  ng/mL  for  all  subjects  who  received  etanercept  for  at  least  12  weeks  and  for  subjects  who received  etanercept  during  the  entire  48-week  study,  the  mean  trough  etanercept  concentration  was 1829 ng/mL at week 48.

Etanercept concentrations were determined after receiving 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) QW etanercept. The  mean  etanercept  concentrations  in  this  study  did  not  differ  substantially  along  the  study  and neither from those found previously in paediatric juvenile arthritis patients or adult psoriasis patients with 25 mg etanercept BIW, in spite of the different dosing interval.

Analysis of the serum etanercept concentration within the two age groups studied (4-11 years and 1217 years) was requested. A description of pharmacokinetic results (serum etanercept concentration) according to the age of the study patients and the age distribution within the paediatric age subgroups was provided. These data showed that the serum of etanercept levels were comparable in both age groups.

The MAH also presented the distribution of the study subjects from the minimum age of 4 years to the maximum age of 17 years (Table 2) and clarified that there were more subjects at the upper end of the age interval, reflecting higher prevalence of paediatric psoriasis in adolescents than in children.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the breakdown of data by age highlighted a lack of insufficient data in the younger age group (under the age of 8 years). The CHMP therefore recommended that until further  data  is  available  in  younger  children,  the  license  for  paediatric  plaque  psoriasis  should  be restricted to children over the age of 8 years.

## 2.2 Clinical efficacy

## Efficacy Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the PASI 75 response at week 12.

The secondary efficacy endpoints included the following:

- PASI 50 response at week 12
- PASI 90 response at week 12
- Clear/almost clear status of sPGA at week 12
- Percentage improvement from baseline in children's dermatology life quality index (CDLQI) at week 12

Other  efficacy  endpoints  included:  PASI  50,  PASI  75,  and  PASI  90  responses,  clear/almost  clear status  of  sPGA and percentage improvement from baseline in CDLQI at each scheduled visit week (except week 12); sPGA, clear status of sPGA, percentage improvement from baseline in PASI score and CDLQI subscales; improvement from baseline in joint pain, Stein Impact on Family, Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory total score and subscale scores, Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children (6  subscales),  and  Harter's  Self-Perception  Profile  for  Adolescents  (9  subscales)  at  each  scheduled visit week.

In  addition,  the  following  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  as  part  of  the  final  week-48  analysis: improvement  from  baseline  in  photograph-derived  nail  psoriasis  severity  index  (NAPSI)  at  each scheduled  visit  week,  and  time  to  disease  relapse  (i.e.,  loss  of  PASI  75  response)  for  all  PASI  75 responders who entered the randomised double-blind withdrawal period at week 36.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

The primary  analysis  set  for  all  efficacy  analyses  with  respect  to  the  initial  12-week  double-blind, placebo-controlled  period  was  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  analysis  set,  which  included  all  randomly assigned subjects  regardless  of  receipt  of  investigational  product.  Analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint was done using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by age group.

Subjects who entered the escape arm or who had missing data were considered treatment failures with respect  to  their  original  randomised  treatment  group  in  the  primary  analysis.  The  efficacy  data  for subjects  who  entered  the  escape  arm  were  changed  to  non-responder  at  the  time  they  entered  the escape arm. Data for those subjects from before they entered the escape arm were not changed. For subjects who had missing data, their missing data were imputed as non-responder, but their existing data were included as observed. The primary analysis was performed using data through week 12 that were collected in a blinded fashion and, then, unblinded for analysis while the open-label portion of the study was ongoing.

Data collected after week 12 were analysed separately for the open-label treatment period, incompleteresponder arm, randomised double-blind withdrawal period, and retreatment period.

Data  from  the  open-label  treatment  period  and  incomplete-responder  arm  were  analysed  by  the original randomised treatment group for efficacy endpoints and by actual treatment received during the placebo-controlled period for safety endpoints.

Data  from  the  randomised  double-blind  withdrawal  and  retreatment  periods  were  analysed  by  the second randomisation for efficacy endpoints and by actual treatment received during the withdrawal period for safety endpoints.

All analyses for the open-label treatment period, incomplete-responder arm, and randomised doubleblind withdrawal and retreatment period were conducted using descriptive statistics as in the week-12 final  analysis,  without  statistical  inferences  between  the  treatment  groups.  Time  to  disease  relapse during  the  randomised  double-blind  withdrawal  period  was  assessed  for  treatment  effect  without adjusting for multiplicity.

The  overall  significance  level  for  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  was  controlled  at  0.05  using  a sequential testing scheme in the following order: PASI 75 response, PASI 50 response, clear/almost clear status of sPGA, percentage improvement from baseline in CDLQI and PASI 90 response. In this sequential testing scheme, statistical testing is stopped once the first non-significant result is observed. Because  the  primary  efficacy endpoint  was  significant, the secondary  endpoints  were  tested sequentially at a significance level of 0.05. Subjects who entered the escape arm or who had missing data were considered treatment failures with respect to their original randomised treatment group.

The  reported  p-values  for  the  analysis  of  additional  efficacy  endpoints  are  nominal  and  were  not adjusted for multiplicity.

The CHMP considered that PASI 75 at week 12 as the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was acceptable to assess short term efficacy, according to the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal  products  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  psoriasis  (CHMP/EWP/2454/02  corr).  Other endpoints (PASI 50 and 90 at week 12, clear/almost clear status of sPGA, among others) were also considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The CHMP also considered that the statistical methods for efficacy assessment were acceptable.

## RESULTS

Forty-two  sites  (30  in  the  United  States  and  12  in  Canada)  randomised  subjects  in  this  study.  The study population consisted of 108 male and 103 female subjects aged 4 to 17 years.

## During the 12-week double-blind period:

At  baseline  of  the  initial  12-week  double-blind  study,  subject  demographics  were  generally  well balanced between the etanercept and placebo groups, although a higher percentage of subjects in the placebo group had psoriatic arthritis at baseline than subjects in the etanercept group (13% vs. 5%, respectively). Mean age was 12 year-old, ranges 4-17 and mean weight was 62 kg, which showed that the proportion of younger children is lower than the older ones. Most patients were white (74.9%).The population included met the inclusion criteria established in the study regarding psoriasis, i.e. mean PASI  was  16  and  mean  duration  was  6  years,  and  it  was  considered  representative  of  the  target population. Previously, 30% of patients had received systemic therapy and 48% phototherapies. This

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  subject  disposition  during  the  study  was  evaluated during  the  three  study  periods.  During  the  initial  12-week  comparative  period,  a  high  number  of patients of the placebo group (27 out of 105) entered the escape arm due to insufficient response, by contrast, only 5 patients of the etanercept group escaped. At the end of this period, all patients entered the open-label period of treatment with etanercept, but, during this second period, a substantial number of  patients  were  also  considered  incomplete  responders.  Finally,  138  patients  entered  the  12  week withdrawal-retreatment period.

Etanercept provided statistically significant improvements in the PASI 75 to paediatric subjects with moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis:  at  week  12,  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  etanercept group achieved a PASI 75 response compared with the placebo group (57% vs. 11%, p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the 12-week double-blind period, a significantly higher percentage of subjects in the etanercept group achieved a sPGA status of clear/almost clear compared with the placebo group as early as week 4 (Figure 3).

Note: Subjects who entered the escape arm were considered treatment failures at time of entering escape arm during thie 12-week double-blind period.

The proportion of subjects who achieved a sPGA status of clear/almost clear was maintained during the open-label period in the original etanercept group and continued to improve in the original placebo group when they began receiving open-label etanercept.

The CHMP considered that there was a clear evidence of efficacy of etanercept over placebo in the main psoriasis assessment tools PASI 75 and sPGA. Responders achieved benefit by week 12, with a 10%  increase  in  PASI  75  responders  between  weeks  12  to  24  in  the  original  etanercept  group. However no such further improvement in PASI 75 was seen after 12 weeks of treatment in the original placebo group (62% vs. 65% at weeks 24 and 36 respectively). No further improvement in sPGA was seen  after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  The  CHMP  therefore  considered  that  treatment  should  be discontinued in those patients who do not show a response at 12 weeks and treatment course should be limited to 24 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the 12-week double-blind period, the mean percentage improvement in CDLQI from baseline was significantly greater for the etanercept group compared with the placebo group as early as week 2, and continued to improve during the open-label period for both the original etanercept group and the original placebo group, and was similar by week 36 for subjects in the original placebo group (59.1%) compared with the original etanercept group (63.3%).

This showed a good relative improvement in CDLQI scores compared with baseline and at baseline the scores were similar between the two groups.

The  results  from  the  analysis  of  improvement  in  joint  pain,  growth  analyses,  and  photographs  and photo-derived NAPSI scores were largely inconclusive because of the small sample sizes (particularly the placebo group). The results of the patient-reported outcomes measures (Stein Impact on Family (completed by parents/caregivers), Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (completed by parents/caregivers  for  4-7  year  olds  and  by  subjects  8-17  years  old  themselves),  and  Harter's  SelfPerception Profile for Children and Adolescents (2 versions - only used for children over 7 years, the 7-12 year old had the child version and the 13-18 yr olds completed the adolescent version) were not statistically significant.

The efficacy results in the double-blind period were independent of age group, with 4-11 year olds having a similar response to 12-17 year olds (Table 3 and 4).

The CHMP noted that although there was no difference in efficacy for those with a history of psoriasis between 2-10 years, there was a lower response in those with a history of &gt;10 years. Those with a short  history  of  psoriasis  ( &lt; 2  years)  had  a  high  spontaneous  rate  of  improvement  (placebo  results: PASI 75 of 43% at week 12 in those with a history of psoriasis of 0-2 years, versus PASI 75 of 6% in those with psoriasis of 6-10 years). The MAH was therefore asked to provide information on length of disease  history  in  each  age  group  by  year  (e.g.  4-5  year,  6-7  year)  and  the  responses  including spontaneous  remission  in  each  of  these  subgroups.  The  data  presented  by  the  MAH  showed  that although the complete spontaneous remissions were rare at the week 12 time point, it was evident that a  higher  percentage  of  patients  who  had  a  short  duration  of  disease ≤ 2  years  attained  a  PGA  of clear/almost clear on placebo (32%) compared with those with longer disease duration. The CHMP considered this issue as resolved and stated that further data on this finding will be available from the ongoing multicentre, open-label safety trial (study 20050111) which is an extension study for subjects who  participated  in  study  20030211  conducted  by  the  MAH.  This  study  will  continue  to  collect information on efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity, infections and malignancy).

## During the 24-week open-label period:

After  12  weeks  of  open-label  etanercept,  subjects  who  were  originally  randomised  to  the  placebo group in the double-blind period achieved a similar PASI 75 response at week 24 as the etanercept group had achieved at week 12 (62% and 57%, respectively: Table 9).

By week 24 of the open-label period, the clear/almost clear status of the sPGA had been achieved by similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  the  original  placebo  group  (56%)  compared  with  the  original etanercept group at week 12 (54%).

## Incomplete responders

The  same  proportion  of  incomplete  responders  (those  who  showed  substantial  worsening  of  their disease when in the double-blind period, or those who failed to reach the pre- determined responses of PASI 50 at week 24 or PASI 75 at week 36) from the placebo group achieved a PASI 75 response at week 24 (24%) as did incomplete responders from the original etanercept group at week 12 (20%) (Table 10).

A separate for sPGA clear/almost clear responses for subjects who entered the incomplete-responder arm (with treatment failure imputation for missing data) was also provided.

The  CHMP noted that  the  analysis  of  subjects  who  entered  the  incomplete  responder  arm  showed lower  responses  to  treatment  than  responders.  This  may  be  because  they  were  inherently  less responsive to etanercept or were undergoing a flare in their disease which coincided with the onset of the study. The former possibility may be related to lower serum etanercept levels or serum TNF levels in  this  group  compared  with  responders.  The  CHMP  considered  that  it  would  be  useful  to  identify probable  non-responders  when  considering  treatment  with  etanercept,  and  therefore  requested  the MAH  to  provide,  for  non-responders,  information  comparing  the  serum  TNF  levels  and  serum etanercept levels in these cases compared with those subjects who had a good initial response to active treatment.  The  data  provided  by  the  MAH  showed  that  non-responders  achieve  similar  serum etanercept concentrations to responders, demonstrating that a lack of response in some patients is not secondary to lower serum levels of etanercept. The CHMP considered the issue as resolved.

The  CHMP also requested  the MAH  to  provide  a  further  analysis  of  the  incomplete  responders  in terms of age, length of disease, serum TNF levels and serum etanercept levels. The data provided by the  MAH  showed  that  no  difference  between  the  group  who  were  incomplete  responders  and  the group as a whole were found for any of the indices  measured. The CHMP considered the issue as resolved.

## Efficacy results from randomised withdrawal-retreatment period:

At week 36, subjects who achieved a PASI 75 were considered to be responders to therapy (138 out of the initial 211) and were randomly reassigned to placebo or etanercept QW in a double-blind manner for the 12-week withdrawal-retreatment period of the study to evaluate disease relapse and durability of response.

All subjects were to be followed every 4 weeks and assessed for disease relapse. Relapse was defined as  a  loss  of  PASI  75  response  or  &lt; 75%  decrease (i.e.  improvement) in PASI  score compared with baseline.  Upon  relapse,  subjects  were  to  enter  open-label  retreatment  with  etanercept  QW  through week 48.

During the withdrawal period, no subject had rebound of their disease, defined as a post-baseline PASI score that was &gt; 125% of baseline PASI within 3 months of treatment discontinuation.

Overall, less than 50% of subjects in each group lost their PASI 75 response during the withdrawal period.

The placebo group lost the PASI 75 response more rapidly than did the etanercept group during the withdrawal period. After treatment withdrawal, 75% of subjects in the placebo group versus 81% in the etanercept group retained their PASI 75 response at week 40 (Table 11).

As a consequence, by week 48, more subjects randomly reassigned to placebo (29 of 69, 42%) had entered the retreatment period than had subjects randomly reassigned to etanercept (13 of 69, 19%).

Similar maintenance of response for sPGA status of clear/almost clear, and percentage improvement from baseline in the CDLQI total score were observed.

The CHMP noted that long-term responders were favoured by the trial design in that the only subjects allowed  to  remain  in  the  placebo  arm  during  the  withdrawal  retreatment  period  were  those  who maintained  their  PASI  75  response.  Excluding  subjects  from  the  placebo  group  who  entered retreatment  with  etanercept,  34  patients  out  of  the  69  subjects  originally  randomised  for  placebo treatment remained on placebo and retained PASI 75 at week 48. Therefore 49% of subjects retained a PASI  75  for  12  weeks  after  cessation  of  etanercept  treatment.  Eighty-five  (85)%  of  those  who remained on etanercept retained their PASI 75 at week 48. This demonstrated effective maintenance of response in 49% responders. An alternative possibility is that of disease remission in this group. The CHMP  therefore  asked  the  MAH  to  perform  a  re-analysis  of  the  subjects  who  relapsed  in  the withdrawal-retreatment period of the trial and to identify if they were any differences in this sub-group in terms of demographics and baseline disease characteristics compared with those who retained their PASI 75. The MAH was asked to provide PASI 75 and sPGA scores. The data provided by the MAH showed that there were no baseline disease characteristics or demographic differences between those who  relapsed  and  those  who  maintained  their  response  in  the  withdrawal-retreatment  period.  The PASI 75 and sPGA score data presented were not helpful in view of the small numbers treated for more than 56 days. The CHMP concluded that those who relapse cannot be predicted on the basis of demographics of baseline disease characteristics. The post hoc analysis showing higher efficacy with short-term  re-treatment  compared  to  longer  retreatment  is  difficult  to  explain  and  is  likely  to  be  a spurious result in view of the small number of subjects in these groups. The CHMP considered this issue as solved and noted that further information on efficacy of long-term treatment, and efficacy and safety of re-treatment will become available from the proposed trial 20050111.

The  CHMP  also  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  information  on  the  ages  and  length  of  history  of psoriasis  in  the  group  who  maintained  their  response  and  those  who  relapsed  for  12  weeks  after cessation of etanercept treatment. The MAH presented a comparison of baseline mean age and mean psoriasis disease duration for subjects who had disease relapse versus the subjects who did not have disease relapse during the withdrawal-retreatment period and concluded that the mean age and disease duration do not appear to be related to disease relapse status. Of subjects who had disease relapse and who entered the retreatment period from the placebo group, 27% had regained a PASI 75 response by week 44 and 36% had regained a PASI 75 response by week 48, after receiving open-label etanercept for 4 to 8 weeks, respectively (Table 12).

One subject did not had disease relapse before entering retreatment period and was excluded from efficacy analyses.

° Last visit in open-label period

Treatment groups represent second randomized treatment after week 36

All subiects received Etanercept 0.8 mq/kq QW during retreatment period

These results were similar to those observed after subjects had received the initial treatment during the double-blind period: at week 4 of the double-blind period, 9% of subjects in the etanercept group had achieved a PASI 75 response, and by week 8, 44% of subjects had achieved a PASI 75 response. No subjects had a rebound of their disease, as defined by the National Psoriasis Foundation as a PASI score that is &gt; 125% of the baseline PASI score within 3 months after treatment withdrawal.

The CHMP considered that the randomised withdrawal-retreatment period, conducted in responders to etanercept, was useful to assess the duration of treatment effect and adequacy of retreatment. Overall, less than 50% of subjects in each group lost their PASI 75 response during the withdrawal period. As expected, the placebo group lost the PASI 75 response more rapidly than did the etanercept group, as after  4  weeks (week 40), 75% and 81% of patients, respectively, retained the response. It was also informative  that,  after  12  weeks  (week  48),  more  subjects  reassigned  to  placebo  had  entered  the retreatment period than had subjects randomly reassigned to etanercept (42% vs. 19%) and that they were able to regain a PASI 75 response in a similar proportion to that found during the initial doubleblind period. From this data it can be concluded that, although the results of part I and II of the study showed  that  the  treatment  with  etanercept  during  36  week  was  useful  to  control  the  disease  in  a substantial proportion of patients, in many of the responders, this treatment period was insufficient; after cessation of etanercept administration, 42% of patients had to enter the retreatment period. The CHMP therefore asked the MAH to provide results (efficacy and safety) obtained in study patients during the follow-up after 48 weeks. The MAH provided data on between 17 and 22 children for PASI results, serum etanercept levels, anti-etanercept antibody status and vital sign measurements. Ten out of twenty-one (10/21) subjects retained their PASI 75 at the follow-up visit. The CHMP considered that the relevance of these findings was limited in view of the small sample size. The data on serum etanercept levels was not helpful because of the small numbers of subjects comprising largely of those who had completed the end of study visit early in the study. The CHMP considered, as many subjects are enrolled into the long-term safety trial, that more complete data will become available from the follow on study 20050111.

In addition the group of patients who entered the third phase of the study were those who had shown a good response to initial treatment. Because of the potential risks of repeated immunosuppression in children (effects on developing immune system and growth) and the lack of long-term safety data the optimal duration of therapy and frequency of retreatment needed to be addressed by the MAH. The identification of factors associated with a rapid loss of response would prevent frequent re-treatment in those least likely to respond. The data provided (analysis to ascertain whether any predictive factors existed at baseline to predict those subjects who had relapse in disease following cessation of active treatment)  did  not  reveal  any  predictive  indictors  for  clinicians  to  determine  which  patients  may experience a more rapid loss of response.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical study submitted to support a paediatric plaque psoriasis indication for etanercept included a  total  of  211  children  aged  4  to  17  years-old  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis  who  were poorly  controlled  with  topical  psoriasis  therapy  or  had  received  phototherapy  or  systemic  therapy. Etanercept  at  a  dosage  of  0.8  mg/kg  QW  was  efficacious  in  paediatric  subjects  with  moderate  to severe  plaque  psoriasis.  At  week  12  of  the  double-blind  period,  significantly  more  subjects  in  the etanercept  group  had  positive  efficacy  responses  compared  with  those  in  the  placebo  group,  as assessed by PASI 75, sPGA and CDLQI. During the open-label period, subjects originally from the placebo group had responses in efficacy measures at week 24 (after 12 weeks of etanercept treatment) that were similar to the original etanercept group at week 12 of the double-blind period. Some quality of  life  assessments  (patient-reported  outcomes  measures  (Stein  Impact  on  Family  (completed  by parents/caregivers), Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (completed by parents/caregivers for 4-7 year olds and by subjects 8-17 years old themselves), and Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children and Adolescents (2 versions - only used for children over 7 years, the 7-12 year old had the child version and  the  13-18  yr  olds  completed  the  adolescent  version)  did  not  yield  major  differences  between placebo  and  etanercept  groups.  During  the  withdrawal  period,  more  subjects  who  were  randomly reassigned  to  the  placebo  group  had  disease  relapse  (loss  of  PASI  75  response)  compared  with subjects who were randomly assigned to etanercept 0.8 mg/kg QW. Subjects who had relapsed and entered the retreatment arm showed improvement in their PASI responses but this was less that the original responders and took longer to become evident. No subjects had a rebound of their disease. Thus,  the  data  suggest  that  disruption  of  etanercept  therapy  does  not  lead  to  a  rebound  of  disease within 12 weeks. From the results obtained in this 3-period study, it can be concluded that etanercept at  a  dosage  of  0.8  mg/kg  QW  has  shown  short-term  efficacy,  compared  with placebo,  in the  study population.  This  is  consistent  with  its  mechanism  of  action  (immunosuppressant)  and  the  previous findings in adult population with chronic plaque psoriasis. Additionally, the treatment effect duration (including withdrawal and retreatment) was investigated in this study, but more data are required to reach solid conclusions. Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease and the possibility of repeated courses in subjects who relapse quickly is a concern since there is limited safety data available in this group.

As only a total of 19 children under the age of 8 years were included in study 20030211, the CHMP was of the opinion that Enbrel's indicated age group should be from 8-17 years. The indicated group should be restricted to chronic severe plaque psoriasis, until further safety data is available. Where the standard practice is to administer systemic therapy or phototherapy with a well known safety profile to such cases, Enbrel should be reserved for those who have failed to respond to systemic therapies or phototherapies. The limitation of prescription of etanercept in this indication to physicians experienced in the treatment of plaque psoriasis will ensure that only those with severe plaque psoriasis for whom limited options are available will be given etanercept.

## 3. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Two hundred and eleven (211) subjects received at least 1 dose of test article (106 received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg QW and 105 received placebo) in the 12-week double-blind period. A total of 208 subjects entered the 24-week open-label period and received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg QW. 138 subjects completed the open-label period and were randomly reassigned in the 12-week withdrawal-retreatment period.

The mean exposure to etanercept during the 12-week double-blind period was 21.67 doses over 77.20 days    for  the  etanercept  treatment  group.  The  mean  exposure  to  etanercept  during  the  open-label period  was  47.20  doses  over  175.05  days  for  the  original  etanercept  group  and  48.87  doses  over 182.03 days for the original placebo group. Because etanercept was administered QW using 1 or 2 vials of etanercept at a concentration of 25 mg/mL, 1 dose is counted as an injection from 1 vial in the calculation of mean doses above.

The overall exposure to etanercept through 48 weeks was 153.6 subject-years.

No significant change in body measurements (height, weight BMI) was evident in either age group over the initial 12 week double-blind placebo controlled part of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Over the 48 week period an increase in the weight and BMI percentiles were noted in the group as a whole and a slight drop was noted in the height percentiles (Table 13).

The CHMP commented that the height percentile showed a drop from baseline at week 48. The height SDS table was found difficult to interpret. The data provided by the MAH (height SDS in the format of  age  stratified  (4-11  years,  and  12-17  years)  height  SDS  scores  at  baseline  and  at  48  weeks demonstrated  that  that  there  were  no  detectable  adverse  effects  on  growth,  with  the  limited  data available  using  the  two  age  groups,  4-11  years  and  12-17  years.  To  obtain  an  accurate  estimate  of growth in each sub-group, growth would need to be compared with age and sex- matched controls over a period of a year, in order to get a good estimate of growth rate for a particular group. As they were a very small number of children under the age of 8 years, it was very difficult to exclude an adverse effect on growth within this younger population. Concerns remained about the lack of data in children  under  the  age  of  8  in  this  study.  As  the  ongoing  safety  study  includes  only  those  who completed study 20030211, this will not constitute enough safety data for this group. The marketing authorisation was therefore restricted to children aged 8-17 and those under the age of 8 years will need to have more data collected before authorisation can be granted for this younger age group.

During the initial 12-week double-blind period, the proportions of subjects reporting adverse events or infections  were  generally  similar  between  the  etanercept  group  (64.2%)  and  the  placebo  (59.0%) group (Table 14). There were no serious adverse events (SAEs).

The CHMP commented that compared to the study of etanercept in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis the side effects profile in this double-blind period of the study was similar, except that no SAEs occurred in study 20030211 during the first 12 weeks and the incidence of injection site reactions (ISRs), upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), gastrointestinal (GI) infections and headache was lower than in the study with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

Long-term  safety  analyses  through  week  48  were  based  on  exposure-adjusted  rates,  as  all  subjects received  etanercept  during  the  open  label  period  of  the  study.  In  this  analysis,  treatment  groups represented the actual treatment received at the time of the event. The overall rate of AEs through week 48 associated with etanercept treatment was 554.8 events per 100 subject-years versus a rate of 685.3 events per 100 subject-years associated with placebo treatment.

Although times of exposure to etanercept (E = 153.6 subject-years) and placebo (E = 30.1 subjectyears)  were  very  different,  most  events  in  the  etanercept  group  occurred  at  a  similar  or  lower exposure-adjusted rate than in the placebo group. Three (3) exceptions to this included streptococcal pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and arthralgia, which occurred at exposure-adjusted rates of 14.3, 9.8, and 8.5  events  per  100 subject-years,  respectively,  in  the  etanercept  group  compared  with  3.3,  0,  and  0 events per 100 subject-years, respectively, in the placebo group.

The most frequently reported adverse events during the study were all mild to moderate in severity, except for 1 case of gastroenteritis, which was reported as severe (also reported as SAE).

During  the  randomised  withdrawal  period,  52.9%  of  subjects  receiving  etanercept  and  46.4%  of subjects  receiving  placebo  reported ≥ 1  adverse  event  or  infection.  The  most  frequently  reported adverse  events  included  nasopharyngitis  (10.3%  etanercept  vs.  2.9%  placebo)  and  headache  (8.8% etanercept vs. 2.9% placebo).

The CHMP noted that subject incidence of adverse events must be interpreted with caution during the retreatment  period  because  of  the  small  sample  size.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events reported  during  this  period  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (25.0%  etanercept  vs.  10.0% placebo) and sinusitis (8.3% etanercept vs. 6.7% placebo).

## 3.1 Safety-Related Discontinuations

Six subjects were withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event or infection. One subject in the etanercept group was withdrawn during the double-blind period because of bronchospasm. Five subjects  were  withdrawn  during  the  open-label  period  because  of  psoriasis  progression,  atopic dermatitis,  muscle  spasms,  skin  infection,  and  lobar  pneumonia  (the  case  of  pneumonia  was considered a serious infection)

The  2  subjects  who  withdrew  during  the  open-label  period  because  of  infections  were  from  the original etanercept group, and the other 3 subjects were from the original placebo group. No subjects were withdrawn during the randomised withdrawal or retreatment periods.

It  was  noted  that  it  was  of  interest  that  those  who  withdrew  because  of  infection  had  a  higher cumulative  dose  of  etanercept  than  those  who  withdrew  for  other  reasons.  Data  presenting  the incidence of infection and all other AEs against the cumulative dosage of etanercept received were provided showing that there was no evidence over the 48 week period of an increase in rate of nonserious AEs. No SAEs were seen in the 1-85 day exposure period and the 4 SAEs in the trial occurred after that time.

## 3.2 Serious Adverse Events

No  non-infectious  SAEs  or  serious  infections  occurred  during  the  12-week  double-blind  period  or during the randomised withdrawal or retreatment periods of the study. Four SAEs were reported in 3 subjects during the open-label period.

Page 1 of 15

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. A 14-year-old female subject from the original etanercept group developed an ovarian mass, which was later determined to be benign. The right ovary and mass were surgically removed and pathology revealed fibrous tissue with marked chronic inflammation.
2. A 7-year-old female subject from the original etanercept group with a history of asthma developed pneumonia and was withdrawn from the study because of the event; the subject recovered without sequelae.
3.  An  8-year-old  female  subject  from  the  original  placebo  group  developed  gastroenteritis  and dehydration  (2  SAEs)  while  receiving  etanercept  in  the  incomplete-responder  arm.  This  subject's symptoms  of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain developed 2 weeks after a tonsillectomy, and resulted in hospitalisation for dehydration and gastroenteritis.

The SAEs of ovarian mass, gastroenteritis, and dehydration were considered not related to test article, and the SAE of pneumonia was considered related.

The CHMP concluded that it was reasonable to expect that the gastroenteritis was related to the test article as gastroenteritis is a common side effect of etanercept therapy in children

## Deaths

No deaths occurred during the study.

## Malignancies

No malignancies were reported during the study.

## Clinically Important Laboratory Test Results

Transient elevated haemoglobin concentrations were reported: all occurred in adolescent boys (all 15 years old) and were within the normal range for adult men. None of the laboratory abnormalities were associated with any clinical reports of SAEs.

## Safety in special populations

No studies have been conducted in special populations in the paediatric psoriasis group.

At baseline, the background rate for ANA was 6.6-11.4%. Those in the original placebo group at week 48 did receive etanercept in the open label period of the study. Of note is that the data presented in table 23 gives percentages calculated on the total number in each group rather than the total number of subjects with test results at each time point. Calculations of the percentage positive at week 48 in the etanercept group would give a result of 5/52 (9.6%). Data were also provided on the titre of ANA at baseline and 48 weeks, the ages of those positive for ANA, the AE profile and whether any further tests were performed in ANA positive cases (such as ENA and dsDNA testing). These data showed that there were only small number of subjects tested for ANA and no clear correlation with age or AE profile emerged from the limited data set.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Anti-etanercept antibodies

No analysis of the 20 cases with anti-etanercept antibodies was performed. Data assessing whether the presence of anti-etanercept antibodies had any effects on efficacy or safety were provided showing that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy of AE profile between subjects who developed  antibodies  to  etanercept  and  those  who  did  not  at  week  12.  At  week  48  the  efficacy responses were lower in the antibody positive group but this was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of efficacy or AE profile.

Of the 211 subjects who were randomly assigned to the study, 208 had predose and postdose serum samples available for testing for antibodies to etanercept. Of these 208 subjects, 20 (9.6%) had at least 1 sample that was positive for anti-etanercept antibodies at ≥ 1 time point. Ten (10) of the 208 subjects (4.8%) had samples that were positive for anti-etanercept antibodies at week 48 or at the end-of-study time point.

All samples were negative for neutralising anti-etanercept antibodies.

ANA and anti-etanercept antibody results on the cases with arthralgia were provided and clarified that 3/11  (27%)  of  cases  with  arthralgia  and  related  AEs  were  positive  for  ANA  and/or  anti-etanercept antibodies. Although there was limited data no association between the presence of these antibodies and the development of arthralgia was evident.

Data on those with anti-nuclear antibodies in terms of demographics, baseline disease characteristics, PASI  75,  sPGA  scores,  adverse  events  including  arthralgia  as  a  function  of  total  cumulative  dose received were also provided showing that the demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the ANA-positive subjects were comparable to those of the ANA-negative subjects and that the efficacy was similar between these 2 groups and no correlation between arthralgia and ANA positivity was found.

## 3.3 Risk management plan

In the initial application no revision of the etanercept risk management plan ( RMP) was submitted. As part  of  the  etanercept  RMP,  two  paediatric  registries  were  set  up  (UK  and  Germany)  in  order  to evaluate the safety profile of etanercept in children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However,  because  psoriasis  may  need  multiple  courses  of  treatment,  the  MAH  was  requested  to submit a RMP addressing this specific paediatric population as well as to consider setting up a registry for paediatric psoriasis.

A RMP was therefore submitted which addressed only the plaque psoriasis indication for this product. A  summary  of  the  RMP  (distinguishing  between  identified  risks,  potential  risks  and  missing information and providing clear indication as to what additional PV activities are planned) is included in the below table.

- Long-term extension study 2005011l

Wyeth is proposing to conduct a single-am, open-label, long-teim, prospective, obsarrational cohort shudy of safety and effectiveness of pediatric psoriasis patients (eated with etanercept (ie, regisay).

In  its  initial  RMP,  the  MAH  mentioned  that  the  British  Association  of  Dermatologists  Biological Interventions Register (BADBIR) was recently established with the primary purpose of evaluating the long-term  safety  of  biological  agents  used  to  treat  psoriasis.  It  is  a  prospective  longitudinal  cohort study consisting of two cohorts, psoriasis patients treated with biological interventions and a control group  (presumably  with  similar  disease  characteristics)  exposed  only  to  non-biological  systemic therapies. The primary objective of BADBIR is active surveillance for potential adverse events, which have not been detected in the relatively short-term clinical trials,  and  those  which  are  perceived  as clinically important. Safety outcomes of interest include malignancy, cardiovascular events, demyelinating  disease,  serious  infection,  and  tuberculosis.  The  register  aims  to  recruit  all  patients receiving all approved biologic agents, including etanercept, until the required cohort size has been attained. Currently, the investigators have approval for the inclusion of adult psoriasis patients. The MAH  has  been  in  communication  with  the  BADBIR  investigators  regarding  the  possibility  of including pediatric psoriasis patients who are treated with etanercept in the register.

## 3.4 Discussion on clinical safety

During the clinical study submitted to support this variation, there were no unexpected safety findings associated with etanercept therapy in paediatric plaque psoriasis. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and injection site reactions.

The AE profiles for the retreatment group as a function of length of treatment showed that there were no baseline disease characteristics or demographic differences between those who relapsed and those who maintained their response in the withdrawal-retreatment period. The overall AE rate was higher in  those  who  received  etanercept  in  the  withdrawal  phase  (69%  vs.  31%)  compared  with  those receiving placebo. The data showed that infection and infestation rates were lower in those on placebo (26.67%)  compared  with  those  on  etanercept  (66.67%).  Infections  and  infestations  were  higher  in those treated for 29-56 days. The CHMP concluded that those who relapse cannot be predicted on the basis of demographics of baseline disease characteristics.

Because  of  the  potential  risks  of  repeated  immunosuppressive  therapy  in  children  (effects  on developing immune system, immunogenicity and growth) and the lack of long-term safety data, the CHMP requested the MAH to discuss the optimal duration of therapy and frequency of retreatment. The  identification  of  factors  associated  with  a  rapid  loss  of  response  would  prevent  frequent  retreatment in this group and the MAH was also asked to comment on this.

Similarity  in  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  in  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  with  psoriasis  was  noted. Treatment  duration  of  'up  to  24  weeks'  recommended  for  the  adult  population  can  therefore  be recommended in the paediatric population. In the absence of a response to treatment after 12 weeks, it is recommended that etanercept therapy be discontinued for paediatric patients (in line with the adult patients recommendation). If retreatment is clinically indicated, the same regimen should be employed with  regard  to  dose  and  duration.  However,  further  data  will  be  provided  from  the  open-label extension study 20050111.This long-term safety trial (20050111) has recruited from subjects in study 20030211  and  will  therefore  not  provide  sufficient  safety  data  in  younger  children.  The  MAH acknowledged that only 17 subjects under the age of 8 years were enrolled in study 20050111 from study 20030211 and therefore, safety data collected during the study will be insufficient to establish a safety  profile  in  this  young  psoriasis  population.  Psoriasis  affects  approximately  2%  of  the  world's population. The prevalence of psoriasis in children has been estimated at 0.55% to 1.4%, the large majority of which is comprised of mild disease. Consequently, there are significant challenges with the recruitment  of  children  with  severe  psoriasis  aged  4  through  7  years.  Due  to  the  small  number  of patients  with  psoriasis  under  8  years  of  age,  the  MAH  was  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  not  feasible  to conduct  a  robust,  controlled  clinical  trial  in  this  population,  and  proposed  to  conduct  a  single-arm, open label, long-term, prospective, observational cohort study. An outline protocol for this study has been  submitted.  The  planned  study  is  a  single-arm  open-label  long-term  prospective  observational study, aiming to recruit at least 100 European paediatric psoriasis patients and as many as 200, across 5 countries over the first 3 years of the study. Patients will be followed up every three months for the first 2 years and every six months for years 3 through to 5. The objectives of this study are to describe the risk of serious infection associated with current or recent treatment with etanercept in paediatric psoriasis; to describe the long-term risk of malignancy in paediatric psoriasis patients who have ever received etanercept; to identify any new, potentially unrecognized ADRs by collecting SAE data in this population; and to assess effectiveness by describing patterns of initial treatment with etanercept, premature discontinuation,  and  subsequent treatment  with  systemic  therapies  including  re-treatment with etanercept.

Analyses of infections, SAEs, and treatment patterns will be descriptive. Should any patient develop cancer  during  follow-up,  standardized  incidence  ratios  (SIRs)  will  be  calculated  for  malignancies, adjusted for age and gender, using geographically appropriate population-based reference rates.

The  MAH does  not  plan  to  request  blood  samples  to  be  taken  from  children  during  the  study  for immunogenicity  testing.  The  anti-etanercept  assay  developed  for  use  in  clinical  trials  is not commercially  available,  and  it  cannot  be  used  to  test  ad  hoc  blood  samples  since  the  assay methodology  requires  a  baseline  sample  to  determine  whether  a  post-exposure  sample  meets  the criteria for the presence of anti-etanercept antibodies. Thus, even if testing for antibodies were to be limited  to  patients  only  where  indicated, all patients  would  need  to  provide  a  sample  at  baseline . Inclusion  of  phlebotomy  for  study  participation  would  likely  dissuade  parents  and  physician  from patient  enrolment  in  the  study  (since  the  medicinal  product  would  otherwise  be  readily  available), thereby diminishing the already limited patient population for the study.

The CHMP considered the outline protocol as appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP also considered that whilst it is regrettable that blood samples cannot be collected from patients  for  immunogenicity  testing,  the  MAH's  argument  that  this  will  not  be  feasible  within  this study is accepted. Also immunogenicity data is to be collected in paediatric psoriasis patients in study 2005011, the long term trial extension.

## 4. Overall conclusion and benefit risk assessment

The  evidence  presented  showed  that  etanercept  is  an  effective  short-term  treatment  for  paediatric patients with severe plaque psoriasis and who respond within 12 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Although the side effect profile demonstrates an increased risk of infection, other rarer side effects will only become evident with prolonged pharmacovigilance in this patient group, which will be provided by the MAH.

In view of the lack of long-term safety data in patients with paediatric psoriasis, the  CHMP was of the  opinion  that  only  those  with  severe  plaque  psoriasis  who  are  inadequately  controlled  by  or  are intolerant to systemic therapies or phototherapies should constitute the indicated group .

The CHMP was of the opinion that the breakdown of data by age highlighted a lack of insufficient data in the younger age group and was considered insufficient. The CHMP therefore recommended that  until  further  data  is  available  in  younger  children,  the  license  for  paediatric  plaque  psoriasis should  be  restricted  to  children  over  the  age  of  8  years  and  to  amend  section  4.1  of  the  SPC accordingly.  The  CHMP  therefore  considers  that  the  etanercept  indication  in  treatment  of  severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents should be limited to children over the age of 8 years.

The  CHMP  also  pointed  out  that  the  long-term  safety  trial  has  recruited  from  subjects  in  study 20030211  and  will  therefore  not  provide  sufficient  safety  data  in  younger  children.  The  lack  of sufficient data on younger children and the need for longer term efficacy and safety data in paediatric plaque psoriasis is to be addressed with an open label observational study with at least 100 patients from 4-17 years, to assess the safety and efficacy in paediatric plaque psoriasis. This study will collect data on efficacy, safety - particularly in relation to infection, malignancy and loss of efficacy - and will also collect  information  on  dose  length and  frequency  of courses. The  aim  to  collect immunogenicity  in  such  a  long-term  study  cannot  be  fulfilled  due  to  the  need  for  baseline  blood samples for all entrants to the study - which is likely to reduce the number of entrants as the majority of these children and adolescents (from the age of 8 years) could be treated without the need for extra blood tests.  Long-term data on immunogenicity will be available from the open-label long term safety trial  (study  20050111)  and  the  results  will  be  submitted  within  6  months  of  completion  and  will provide long-term safety and immunogenicity data on the subjects from study 20050111. This study aims to recruit  at  least  100  European  paediatric  psoriasis  patients  (from  the  age  of  4  years)  and  as many as 200, across 5 countries over the first 3 years of the study.

The other concern is that in a relapsing remitting disease such as plaque psoriasis the possibility of multiple serial courses being administered before further long-term safety data is available arises. In the  absence  of  long-term  safety  and  growth  data  maximum  treatment  duration  should  follow  the current SPC for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and be limited to 24 weeks.

By  restricting  the  indication  to  severe  disease  in  those  who  are  inadequately  controlled  by,  or  are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies and by restricting the age group to those over 8 years, the benefit/risk balance for etanercept in paediatric plaque psoriasis was considered positive.

## II . CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION

Section 4.1 of the SPC was updated as follows:

'Paediatric plaque psoriasis

Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 8 years who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies'. The PL was updated accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Section 4.2 was updated to limit the prescription of Enbrel in this indication to physicians experienced in the treatment of plaque psoriasis which will ensure that only those with severe plaque psoriasis for whom limited options are available will be given Enbrel.

This section  also  states  that  treatment  should  be  discontinued  in  those  patients  who  do  not  show  a response  at  12  weeks  and  treatment  course  should  be  limited  to  24  weeks.  The  PL  was  updated accordingly.

Whilst  accepting  the  restriction  to  the  age  range  for  the  indication,  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  reflects whole age range of study 20030211 and was updated as follows:

'Undesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis

In a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse events reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.'

At the CHMP's request, section 5.1 of the SPC includes information about the randomised withdrawal period.

Annex II was updated to include the new version of the RMP approved with this indication and to reflect the recommendation from the CHMP regarding future RMP submissions.

The MAH has also taken the opportunity to relocate one sentence in section 7 of the Package Leaflet (Instructions  for  Preparing  and  Giving  an  Injection  of  Enbrel)  for  the  paediatric  pack.    In  the subsection on 'Adding solvent to the vial', under step 3, the sentence 'Remove the solvent syringe and needle from the vial and discard them.' is moved from the end of the paragraph to the beginning of the paragraph.  This change places the sequence of steps in the powder reconstitution procedure in the proper order for the patient.

The MAH has also made a correction in section 4.8 of the 50 mg presentations' SPC. The sentence \"There were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials.\" was missing in this section and was therefore included.

The other wording proposed by the MAH was agreed by the CHMP.

## III. CONCLUSION

On 20 November 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.
