## STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

## For procedures finalised after 1 November 2001 please refer to module 8B.

- The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA on 9 August 2000 an application for  a  type  I  variation  falling  within  the  scope  of  item  No.  1  of  Annex  I  to  Commission Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  applied  to  change  in  the premises  of  one  of  the  manufacturing  sites  responsible  for  batch  release.  On  20  September 2000,  the  EMEA  issued  the  corresponding  notification  (EMEA/H/C/219/I/01).  This  variation required amendments to annexes II and IIIB of the Community Marketing Authorisation. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 15 January 2001.
- On 20 February 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a type II variation  in  accordance  with  the  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95,  as  amended.  The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to demonstrate compliance with Commission Directive 1999/82/EC  and  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products (CPMP/BWP/1230/98 rev.1), and provided  certificates  of  suitability  issued  by  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  for  the  materials listed in Annex B. On 18 October 2001, the CPMP approved the variation (EMEA/H/C/219/II/02),  which  did  not  require  any  amendment  to  the  Community  Marketing Authorisation.
- Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation No. 2309/93 and Part 4G of the Annex to Council n Holder provided throughout the first year of the Marketing Authorisation additional data as stated in Annex IIC to Commission Decision, which formed  the  basis  of  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Ammonaps.  On  25 January  2001,  the  CPMP,  having  reviewed  the  evidence  of  compliance  with  the  specific obligations  submitted  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  and  having  re-assessed  the benefit/risk  profile  of  the  medicinal  product,  informed  the  European  Commission  that  no updating  of  Annex  I  and  III  to  the  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  medicinal product is required. The CPMP opinion included a revised list of specific obligations of Annex II.C. to the Community  Marketing  Authorisation (EMEA/H/C/219/S/2).  The  respective Commission Decision was issued on 6 June 2001.
