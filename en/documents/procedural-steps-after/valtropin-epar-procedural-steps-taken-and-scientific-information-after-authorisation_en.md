| A20/0008 | Article 20 Review On 10 December 2010, the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for somatropin-containing medicinal products authorised in the centralised procedure and requested the CHMP to assess all the available data and its impact on the risk benefit balance for somatropin- containing medicinal products and to give its opinion on measures necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of these medicinal products and whether the marketing authorisations for these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The scope of the review was to assess the long-term safety of growth hormone treatments in light of the emerging safety data from the French SAGHE study in particular with regards the potential increased risk of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system, bone tumours and | 15/12/2011 product                  | 02/03/2012 no                               | Please refer to the Assessment Report: Valtropin-H-602-A20-08- Assessment Report-Article 20 |

Valtropin was approved in the EU on 24 April 2006, and was placed on the market in Germany on 6 January 2009. The placing on the market was temporarily ceased as of 1 June 2009 for economical reasons. No post-authorisation adverse events have been reported thus far. Due to the very limited post-marketing safety data available for Valtropin, the CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five- year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds is required. The MAH will continue to submit PSURs in line with the PSUR cycle of the reference product. During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the Product Information to bring it in line with that of the reference product, the current EMEA/QRD template, SPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. |
