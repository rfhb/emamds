## 1. Introduction

On  02JUN2016,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Hyperammonemia  in  Organic Acidemia  Decompensation,  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study title and number is a stand alone study:

Retrospective Observational Study of Hyperammonemia in Organic Acidemia Decompensation Episodes in Patients Treated with Carbaglu® with/or without Ammonia Scavengers versus Ammonia Scavengers Alone.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

No information was provided regarding the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study. However the drug product / name was 'Carglumic acid (Carbaglu®) ' thus it is assumed that it is the one marketed in EU.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012; \"Retrospective Observational Study of Hyperammonemia  in  Organic  Acidemia  Decompensation  Episodes  in  Patients  Treated  with Carbaglu® with/or without Ammonia Scavengers versus Ammonia Scavengers Alone\" (study code: OE-CGA001-OA2009/ 0E-CGA001-OA2012)
- exploratory analysis of the pooled results of these 2 retrospective observational studies (OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012);

## Resumé

In  2009,  a  retrospective  observational  study  (OE-CGA001-OA2009)  was  submitted  to  the  EMA  to support the claim of an extension of the indication of Carbaglu in the treatment of hyperammonemia due to organic acidemias (Methyl-Malonic academia/MMA, Propionic Acidemia/PA, Isovaleric Acidemia/IVA). The new indication for Carbaglu was approved in the European Union in May 2011.

Clinical study report (dated 31 August 2015)

Later in 2012, Orphan Europe wanted to also extend the indication of Carbaglu in US. For this purpose, it  was  advised  to  Orphan  Europe  to  add  a  comparative  arm  to  study  OE-CGA001-OA2009  by conducting a retrospective observational study to evaluate hyperammonemia in OA decompensation episodes in patients treated with NH3 scavengers without carglumic acid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study, with protocol number OE-CGA001-OA2012, is considered as the control arm of study OECGA001-OA2009.  Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012  was  set  up  and  conducted  in  the  closest  possible conditions to study OE-CGA001-OA2009, particularly regarding the type of study, the selected sites, the period of data collection and the data collected. The data from the two studies were pooled; an analysis by treatment group was performed. This analysis supports the efficacy and safety of carglumic acid (Carbaglu) for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to PA, MMA and IVA. This study showed that the reduction of plasma NH3 level occurred faster in patients treated with carglumic acid with or without NH3 scavengers. This reduction was particularly marked during the first hours of the acute hyperammonemic metabolic decompensation i.e. when it is critical to rapidly decrease the plasma NH3 level to limit potential neurological sequelae.

Addendum to clinical study report (dated 21 September 2015)

An addendum to this CSR written later and dated 21 September 2015 is also included. It summarizes the  exploratory  analysis  of  the  pooled  results  of  these  2  retrospective  observational  studies  (OECGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012) in 3 separate treatment groups: carglumic acid only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009),  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009),  and  NH3 scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012).  Ammonia  level  data  were  censored  at  the  time  of extracorporeal detoxification initiation. The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to examine the effect of carglumic acid without the effect of NH3 scavengers or extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in patients with OA following episodes of hyperammonemic decompensation. Use of carglumic acid alone does not reflect clinical practice since the primary goal of treatment is to adequately treat patients as soon as possible using all available medications to reduce NH3 levels quickly.

Depending  on  NH3  levels,  NH3  detoxification  usually  occurs  through  the  use  of  a  combination  of pharmacological  treatments  to  eliminate  NH3  excess  (e.g.,  NH3  scavengers:  sodium  benzoate  or sodium phenylbutyrate) and/or through extracorporeal detoxification, such as Hemodialysis, Hemofiltration or Hemodiafiltration, or Peritoneal dialysis in severely decompensated patients. Due to their  invasive  nature,  extracorporeal  detoxification  is  usually  initiated  when  other  measures  fail  to control  hyperammonemia.  The  age  of  the  patient,  local  facilities,  and  center  experience  orient  the choice  of  extracorporeal  detoxification  method.  At  present,  none  of  these  NH3  scavengers  are approved  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonemia  associated  with  propionic  acidemia  (PA),  methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), or isovaleric acidemia (IVA) in the European Union (nor in US).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Clinical study number and title

OE-CGA001-OA2009/ OE-CGA001-OA2012: Retrospective Observational Study of Hyperammonemia in Organic Acidemia Decompensation Episodes in Patients Treated with Carbaglu® with/or without Ammonia Scavengers versus Ammonia Scavengers Alone

## Description

Studies OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-OA2012  were  retrospective  observational studies conducted  to  evaluate  hyperammonemia  in  OA  decompensation  episodes  in  patients  treated  with carglumic  acid  with  or  without  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009:  treatment  group)  and NH3  scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012:  control  group).  Data  regarding  decompensation episodes from 01 January 1995 until 31 October 2009 were recorded in as many patients as possible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolled  in  key  experienced  European  hospitals  in  Italy,  France,  Spain,  and  the  United  Kingdom (Studies  OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012) and Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009).

The  pooled  results  of  these  2  retrospective  observational  studies  (OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OECGA001-OA2012)  is  summarized  in  3  separate  treatment  groups:  carglumic  acid  only  (Study  OECGA001-OA2009), carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009), and NH3 scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012).  Ammonia  level  data  were  censored  at  the  time  of extracorporeal detoxification initiation. The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to examine the effect of carglumic acid without the effect of NH3 scavengers or extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in patients with OA following episodes of hyperammonemic decompensation.

Use of carglumic acid alone does not reflect clinical practice since the primary goal of treatment is to adequately  treat  patients  as  soon  as  possible  using  all  available  medications  to  reduce  NH3  levels quickly.

Depending  on  NH3  levels,  NH3  detoxification  usually  occurs  through  the  use  of  a  combination  of pharmacological  treatments  to  eliminate  NH3  excess  (e.g.,  NH3  scavengers:  sodium  benzoate  or sodium  phenylbutyrate)  and/or  through  extracorporeal  detoxification,  such  as  HD,  HF,  or  PD  in severely decompensated patients. Due to their invasive nature, extracorporeal detoxification is usually initiated when other measures fail to control hyperammonemia. The age of the patient, local facilities, and center experience orient the choice of extracorporeal detoxification method.

At  present,  none  of  these  NH3  scavengers  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonemia associated with propionic acidemia (PA), methyl-malonic acidemia (MMA), or isovaleric acidemia (IVA) in the US or Europe.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The post-hoc exploratory analyses discussed in this addendum were performed in 3 treatment groups:

- Carglumic acid only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009)
- Carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009)
- NH3 scavengers only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2012)

Data related to demographics, other baseline characteristics, and efficacy are presented by episode of decompensation and data related to safety are presented by episode and patient. For some patients, data from several episodes were collected. Since these episodes may have been treated differently, data  related  to  them,  despite  being  from  the  same  patient,  may  have  been  included  in  different treatment groups.

## Study design

This was a pooling of retrospectively acquired data in studies OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001OA2012.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The rationale for these post-hoc analyses (3 treatment groups and censored data) was to better assess the isolated effect of carglumic acid in lowering NH3 levels over time by removing 2 main confounding NH3-reducing factors: NH3 scavengers and HD/HF/PD.

## Study population /Sample size

The safety set (SS) included all decompensation episodes from patients enrolled in 1 or both studies who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (carglumic acid, NH3 scavengers).

The full analysis set (FAS) included all decompensation episodes from patients enrolled in 1 or both studies who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (carglumic acid, NH3 scavengers) and had a confirmed diagnosis of OA (PA, MMA, or IVA) by the treating physician.

The post-hoc exploratory analyses were conducted on the FAS population. For the efficacy analyses, NH3 data was censored at the time of HD/HF/PD initiation.

The post-hoc exploratory analyses were limited to:

· Demographic summary with descriptive statistics only: Demography, Baseline characteristics, Study treatment dosing and Concomitant medications.

## Treatments

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy summaries:

- Summary of daily plasma NH3 levels by 12-hour periods from 0 to 48 hours and by 24-hour periods from Day 2 to Day 5

The highest NH3 levels by period were summarized using descriptive statistics. The mean ratio to  baseline  was  calculated  and  compared  between  treatment  groups  (in  pairs)  using  the Wilcoxon test.

- Success rate

Success rate was defined as achieving a plasma NH3 level &lt;= 60 μmol/L (in the absence of death, initiation of HD/HF/PD, or withdrawal from treatment for safety reasons): the proportion of success in each treatment group was computed with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method; the 2 proportions were compared using the Fisher's exact test.

- Time to success

Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  for  time  to  success  (in  the  absence  of  death,  initiation  of HD/HF/PD, or withdrawal from treatment for safety reasons) were produced for each treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test.

- Summary of clinical symptoms and markers at baseline and endpoint

- Change in the number of clinical symptoms and markers: analyzed from baseline to endpoint with descriptive statistics

- Shift in clinical symptoms and markers (symptoms versus no symptoms): analyzed from baseline to endpoint

Safety summaries:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## - Adverse event (AE) summaries with descriptive statistics

## Statistical Methods

## General Considerations

Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics:  mean,  standard  deviation  (SD), median,  interquartile  range  (Q1  -  Q3),  range  of  values  (i.e.,  minimum  and  maximum  values),  and number of patients and/or number of episodes.

Categorical data were presented using counts and percentages. Percentages were calculated according to the number of patients/episodes for whom/which data were available.

For  safety  analyses,  descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  safety  parameters  by  treatment group. Adverse events were summarized at the patient and episode level with regard to number of AEs per patient, and presented as a summary. Adverse events were also summarized at the event level with  regard  to  the  relationship  to  treatment,  action  taken,  and  outcome,  and  presented  in  tabular form. Finally, the number and percentage of episodes/patients experiencing each AE within each body system were summarized overall in tabular form.

Post-hoc  statistical  analyses  were  performed  on  the  database  locked  on  02  July  2014.  All  analyses were  produced  using  the  Statistical  Analysis  Systems  (SAS®)  software  versions  9.2/9.3,  (SAS Institute,  Cary,  Northern  Carolina,  USA)  and  Adclin®  software  version  TPF  3.2.2  (Adclin  SA,  Paris, France).

## Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data

With regard to dropouts and missing data, the same rules as in the full CSR were applied for the posthoc analyses. No imputations were performed on missing plasma NH3 data.

## Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity

No  correction  to  nominal  p-values  for  multiple  comparisons  was  applied.  All  tests  were  considered significant at the 5% significance level (i.e., p ≤ 0.05). These post-hoc analyses should be considered exploratory,  and  inferences  made  based  on  p-values  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Statistical tests should be considered to be descriptive/suggestive rather than conclusive.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A consort chart by episode is presented in Figure 1. Note that the same patient may have had several episodes that were treated differently which explains the difference between the number of patients and the number of episodes in each treatment group.

A total of 102 episodes were collected: 39 episodes in the carglumic acid group, 36 episodes in the NH3 scavengers group, and 27 episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

Among the 102 episodes collected, 3 episodes were considered screen failures (study treatment not received [n=2] and episode already included [n=1]). All 99 episodes were included in the SS. A total of 98 episodes from 83 patients were included in the FAS; 1 episode was excluded due to a diagnosis other than OA.

## Baseline data

Demographic Data

Demographic data by episode for patients included in the FAS are presented in Table below.

The majority of episodes in all treatment groups occurred in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PA although the proportion was higher in the NH3 scavengers group than the other 2 groups (50.0% in the carglumic acid group, 81.8% in the NH3 scavengers group, and 51.9% in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group).

Episodes  occurred  in  a  relatively  even  number  of  females  and  males  in  all  treatment  groups  and median gestational age of patients was 39.0 weeks in all groups.

FAS = full analysis set; IVA = isovaleric acidemia; Max = maximum; Min = minimum; MMA = methyl-malonic acidemia; N/n = number; NH3 = ammonia; PA = propionic acidemia; Q = quartile; SD = standard deviation

## History of the Disease

The median age at diagnosis was 13.0 days (Q1 - Q3 = 5.0 - 33.0 days) in the carglumic acid group, 9.5 days (Q1 - Q3 = 5.0 - 19.5 days) in the NH3 scavengers group, and 8.0 days (Q1 - Q3 = 5.0 15.0 days) in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

A family history of OA was reported in a greater proportion of episodes in the NH3 scavengers group (48.5%) than in the carglumic acid (15.8%) or the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (7.4%) groups. Likewise,  consanguinity  of  parents  was  reported  in  a  greater  proportion  of  episodes  in  the  NH3 scavengers group (69.7%) than in the carglumic acid (42.1%) or the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (29.6%) groups.

## Summary of Episodes

Summary of episodes data are presented in Table 2.

The median number of days between the start of the episode and the start of treatment was 1 day in all treatment groups. More than 80% of the episodes ended within 15 days, with a median duration of episodes of 6.0 days in the carglumic acid and carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers groups, and 8.5 days in the NH3 scavengers group.

The median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups, and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

End  of  the  treatment  was  due  to  the  end  of  the  episode  in  31  out  of  35  (88.6%)  episodes  in  the carglumic acid group, 16 out of 31 (51.6%) episodes in the NH3 scavengers group, and 25 out of 27 (92.6%) episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

End of the treatment was due to death in 3 out of 35 (8.6%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, 3 out of 31 (9.7%) episodes in the NH3 scavengers group, and none of the episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Switched  to  long-term  treatment  was  reported  only  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  (10  out  of  31 episodes, 32.3%). No episode reported lack of efficacy or AE as a reason for the end of treatment.

## Baseline Characteristics of Episode

Baseline characteristics of episodes included in the FAS are presented in Table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median age at the start of the episode was lower in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (0.2  months  or  5.0  days)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (1.7  months  or  50.5  days)  or  the  NH3 scavengers group (2.2 months or 68.0 days).

The  median  baseline  NH3  level  was  higher  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (270.9 μmol/L) than in the carglumic acid group (199.0 μmol/L) or the NH3 scavengers group (122.0 μmol/L).

## Prior and Concomitant Medications

Prior medications included ongoing treatment at the time of enrollment and before the start of study treatment.

As expected, most of the prior and concomitant medications corresponded to treatment used to treat and monitor the metabolic decompensation and to prevent life-threatening complications. An overview of the treatments of interest initiated to treat the episode by treatment group is presented in Table 4. The most common treatment in all treatment groups was carnitine (90 out of 98 episodes, 91.8%). Carnitine is given to compensate for secondary carnitine deficiency caused by urinary loss of carnitine bound  to  organic  acids.  Carnitine  seems  to  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  hyperammonemia  in  PA patients and to demonstrate antioxidant capacity

Hemodialysis/Hemofiltration/Peritoneal Dialysis

Extracorporeal detoxification methods data by episode for patients included in the FAS are presented in Table 5.

The percentage of episodes treated with HD/HF/PD was similar in the carglumic acid group (13.2%) and the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (11.1%), less than half of the percentage in the NH3 scavengers group (30.3%).

In  the  majority  of  episodes  for  which  data  was  collected,  the  patients  did  not  receive  HD/HF/PD treatment (80 out of 98 episodes, 81.6%).

## Efficacy results

## Daily Plasma NH3 Levels

A summary of the change in maximum daily NH3 levels over time for episodes included in the FAS (NH3 data censored at HD/HF/PD initiation) is presented in Table 6. Data are presented at baseline and after  initiation  of  treatment  by  period  of  treatment  up  to  and  including  120  hours  (5  days)  of treatment,  corresponding  to  the  acute  phase  of  the  hyperammonemic  metabolic  decompensation

episode.  Note  that  median  duration  of  treatment  was  4.0  days  in  the  carglumic  acid  and  NH3 scavengers groups and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

In addition, a summary of mean ratio in NH3 levels to baseline over time for episodes included in the FAS (NH3 data censored at HD/HF/PD initiation) is presented in Figure 2 by 12-hour periods from 0 to 48 hours and Figure 3 by 24-hour periods from Day 1 to Day 5.

Change from baseline was calculated as the maximum NH3 level during the given time period minus the last NH3 value prior to treatment initiation. Ratio to baseline was calculated as the maximum NH3 levels  during  the  given  time  period  divided  by  the  last  NH3  value  prior  to  treatment  initiation. Reduction from baseline was calculated as 1 - [ratio to baseline] x 100.

During the first 12 hours after treatment initiation, the mean ratio to baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3  scavengers  group  was  0.731;  this  corresponds  to  a  mean  reduction  from  baseline  of  -26.9% which is statistically significantly different (p=0.0238) from the NH3 scavengers group (mean ratio to baseline = 1.116, mean reduction from baseline = +11.6%). During the same time period, the mean ratio to baseline in the carglumic acid group was 0.866 which corresponds to a mean reduction from baseline of -13.4% which, when compared to the mean reduction from baseline in the NH3 scavengers group, was just above the statistical significance level limit (p=0.0576).

From 12 to 24 hours after treatment initiation, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (-51.9%) and the NH3  scavengers  group  (-21.5%;  p=0.0806)  or  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-46.8%)  and  the  NH3 scavengers group (p=0.1821), although the mean reductions were more than double in the carglumic acid-containing groups.

From 24 to 36 hours after treatment initiation, there were statistically significant differences between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (-71.2%) and the NH3  scavengers  group  (-6.6%;  p=0.0003)  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-43.8%)  and  the  NH3 scavengers group (p=0.0183). During the same time period, there was also a statistically significant difference between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid group and the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (p=0.0120).

From 36 to 48 hours after treatment initiation, there were statistically significant differences between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (-63.6%) and the NH3  scavengers  group  (-15.2%;  p=0.0274)  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-62.5%)  and  the  NH3 scavengers group (p=0.0348).

From 48 to 72 hours after treatment initiation, there continued to be statistically significant differences between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (-75.6%) and the NH3 scavengers group (-16.3%; p=0.0011) and the carglumic acid group (-65.9%) and the NH3 scavengers group (p=0.0054). There were statistically significant differences between the mean reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and the NH3 scavengers from 72  to  96  hours  after  treatment  initiation  (p=0.0136)  and  from  96  to  120  hours  after  treatment initiation (p=0.0184), both in favor of the combination group.

## Success/Failure

Success was defined as 2 consecutive measures of plasma NH3 level equal to or below the threshold of 60  μmol/L  without  i)  HD/HF/PD  started  after  the  initiation  of  treatment  by  carglumic  acid  or  NH3 scavengers, ii) death, or iii) treatment withdrawal for safety reasons. Improvement without success confirmed was defined as the last post-baseline NH3 assessment equal to or below 60 μmol/L without i) HD/HF/PD treatment initiated after the first day of treatment, ii) death, or iii) treatment withdrawal for  safety  reasons.  The  proportion  of  success  and  improvement  without  success  confirmed  in  each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment group was computed with its 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. In the carglumic acid group, 10 out of 38 episodes (26.3%) were treated with success and improvements were seen with  treatment  in  11  out  of  38  episodes  (28.9%).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference between treatment groups (p = 1.0000).

## Time to Success/Failure

The time to success/improvement was calculated as the time from the first treatment administration to the  time  of  the  first  value  of  NH3  equal  to  or  below  60  μmol/L  after  treatment  initiation.  The  3 treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test for homogeneity between strata.

In  the  carglumic  acid  group,  it  took  34  hours  to  achieve  success/improvement  in  25% of  episodes. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the time to success/improvement (p = 0.7380).

## Changes in Clinical Symptoms and Markers

Table 7 summarizes the neurological findings and feeding difficulties observed in &gt;10% of episodes in any treatment group at baseline as these 2 parameters are most relevant at the onset of metabolic decompensation.

The number of episodes with clinical symptoms and markers in all categories was generally higher in all treatment groups at baseline than at endpoint.

Overall,  shifts  in  findings  from  symptoms  at  baseline  to  no  symptoms  at  endpoint  occurred  for  the majority of categories.

Table  8  summarizes  the  shift  in  the  number  of  episodes  in  which  patients  displayed  neurological findings and feeding difficulties.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At baseline, in most episodes (86% to 100%) across all 3 treatment groups, patients presented with neurological findings. The shift from neurological findings at baseline to normal neurological status at endpoint occurred for 9 out of 18 (50%), 4 out of 11 (36%), and 5 out of 11 (45%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively.

Rarely,  patients  with  no  neurological  symptoms  at  baseline  developed  symptoms  at  endpoint;  this occurred in 1 (5%) episode in the carglumic acid group, 1 (8%) episode in NH3 scavengers group, and no episode in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

Similarly,  at  baseline,  in  most  episodes  (86%  to  100%)  across  all  3  treatment  groups,  patients presented with feeding difficulties. The shift from feeding difficulties at baseline to normal feeding at endpoint occurred for 11 out of 19 (58%), 9 out of 12 (75%), and 8 out of 10 (80%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively.

No patient in any treatment group developed feeding difficulties at endpoint when the symptom was not present at baseline.

Table 9 summarizes the number, as well as the change from baseline, of neurological findings and feeding difficulties.

The median change in the number of neurological findings from baseline to endpoint was -2.0 in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and -1.0 in both the carglumic acid and the NH3 scavengers groups. The median change in the number of feeding difficulties from baseline to endpoint was -1.0 in all 3 treatment groups.

Overall,  the  number  of  clinical  findings,  including  clinical,  laboratory,  neurological,  psychiatric,  and respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all  treatment groups.

## Safety results

## Extent of exposure

In the carglumic acid group, all episodes (n = 38) were orally treated with carglumic acid; the mean (SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment was 152.2 (123.1) mg/kg for patients in the FAS. Likewise, in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group, all episodes (n = 27) were orally treated with carglumic acid; the mean (SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment was 171.2 (94.7) mg/kg for patients in the FAS. Twenty (74.1%) of the episodes in this treatment group were treated concomitantly with 1 NH3 scavenger and 7 (25.9%) of the episodes in this treatment group were treated concomitantly with 2 NH3 scavengers.

Treatment with NH3 scavengers was given intravenously in 72% of episodes. Sodium benzoate was the most popular concomitant NH3 scavenger used (alone in 66.7% of episodes and in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate in 25.9% of episodes); the median (range) dose of sodium benzoate was 257.8  (149-790)  mg/kg  .  Sodium  phenylbutyrate  was  used  alone  in  7.4%  of  episodes  and  in combination  with  sodium  benzoate  in  25.9%  of  episodes;  the  median  (range)  dose  of  sodium phenylbutyrate was 282.0 (169-5625) mg/kg.

The median doses of the NH3 scavengers in the combination group were similar to the median doses in the NH3 scavengers group. In the NH3 scavengers group, the median (range) dose of sodium benzoate during the first 24 hours of treatment was 250.0 (81-1000) mg/kg and the median (range) dose of sodium phenylbutyrate during the first 24 hours of treatment was 277.8 (58-971) mg/kg.

## Adverse events

## Brief Summary of AEs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A summary of AEs for patients/episodes included in the FAS is presented in Table 10.

In total, 61 AEs were experienced by 17 (50.0%) patients during 19 (50.0%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, 97 AEs were experienced by 15 (68.2%) patients during 19 (57.6%) episodes in the NH3 scavengers group, and 21 AEs were experienced by 11 (40.7%) patients during 11 (40.7%) episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. Patients in the NH3 scavengers group experienced the greatest number of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; n = 85), serious TEAEs (n = 31), severe TEAEs (n = 34), deaths (n = 14), and treatment-emergent deaths (n = 13).

Patients in the carglumic acid group experienced the greatest number of drug-related TEAEs (n = 18) and drug-related serious TEAEs (n = 5).

In the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group, 6 TEAEs and 1 serious TEAE were considered drugrelated.  Drug-relatedness in  the  combination  treatment  group  was  assessed as  related  to  carglumic acid treatment exclusively and not to treatment with NH3 scavengers.

Overall,  the  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  largely  related  to  the  disease/condition  (i.e.,  metabolic decompensation) rather than drug toxicity.

1 Categories for relatedness were as follows: related or umknown in Study OE-CGA001-OA2009 and certainly, probably/likely, possibly, condionally, or umassessable in StudyOE-CGA001-OA2012.

2Drug-relatedness in the combination grouprefers exclusively to carglumic acid treatment andnot NH scavenger treatment.

4 One AE led to death but as the agravation ofthe health status started before treatment initiation, the event was not considered treatment-emergent.

The relationship to study drug was initially reported as umknown by the physician for all5 TEAEs and was upgraded by the sponsor to related as a conservative phamacovigilance measure.

## Display and Analysis of AEs

A  summary of  TEAEs  for  patients/episodes  included  in  the  FAS  is  presented  by  system  organ  class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) in Table 11.

In the carglumic acid group, 54 TEAEs were experienced by 15 patients (44.1%) during 17 episodes (44.7%); the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were general disorders and administration site conditions (n = 10) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (n = 9).

In the NH3 scavengers group, 85 TEAEs were experienced by 13 patients (59.1%) during 17 episodes (51.5%); the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were metabolism and nutrition disorders (n = 26) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (n = 16).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group, 18 TEAEs were experienced by 10 patients (37.0%) during 10 episodes (37.0%); the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were blood and lymphatic system disorders (n = 3).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Efficacy

In  this  very  exploratory  analysis,  the  efficacy  of  treatment  with  carglumic  acid  compared  to  NH3 scavengers was assessed through comparisons of plasma NH3 levels during hyperammonemia in OA decompensation episodes prior to or not treated with extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in order to examine the effect of carglumic acid without confounding NH3-reducing treatments.

This comparison, based on paired retrospective comparison, yields very low quality or strength. Yet, given the rareness of the condition, the scarce population and the risks of non treatment within a short period of time, this approach may be the only one valuable in the near future.

The following conclusions may be understood from the study:

- During  the  12-hour  periods  from  treatment  initiation  to  48  hours  and  the  24-hour  periods thereafter until 120 hours, the mean reduction in NH3 levels from baseline in the carglumic acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  were  greater  than  in  the  NH3 scavengers group despite that both groups had higher NH3 levels at baseline. Overall, NH3 reductions from baseline were greatest in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.
- Differences between the combination group and the NH3 scavengers group were statistically significant in favor of the combination group during all time periods except from 12 to 24 hours after  treatment  initiation  even  though  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  combination group was more than double that in the NH3 scavengers group.
- There was  no statistically significant difference between  treatment  groups in rate of success/improvement (p = 1.0000) or time to success/improvement (p = 0.7380).
- Overall, the number of clinical findings, including clinical, laboratory, neurological, psychiatric, and  respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all treatment groups. The median change in the number of findings from baseline to endpoint was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-4.0 in the carglumic acid group and -3.0 in both the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers and the NH3 scavengers groups.

- An overall shift in findings from symptoms at baseline to no symptoms at endpoint occurred for the majority of findings, including the neurological findings and feeding difficulties categories. The  shift  from  neurological  findings  at  baseline  to  normal  neurological  status  at  endpoint occurred for 9 out of 18 (50%), 4 out of 11 (36%), and 5 out of 11 (45%) episodes in the carglumic  acid  group,  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  the  combination  group,  respectively. Simarly the shift from feeding difficulties at baseline to normal feeding at endpoint occurred for 11 out of 19 (58%), 9 out of 12 (75%), and 8 out of 10 (80%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively.
- The median change in the number of neurological findings from baseline to endpoint was -2.0 in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and -1.0 in both the carglumic acid and the NH3 scavengers groups. The median change in the number of feeding difficulties from baseline to endpoint was -1.0 in all treatment groups.
- Median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. More than 80% of the episodes ended within 15 days; the median duration of episodes was 6.0 days in the carglumic acid and carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers groups, and 8.5 days in the NH3 scavengers group.

## Safety

Analysis of the safety data in the 3 treatment groups showed that:

- The mean (SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in the FAS was in the same range in the carglumic acid group (152.2 [123.1] mg/kg) and the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (171.2 [94.7] mg/kg).
- Likewise, the median (range) dose of NH3 scavengers (sodium benzoate/sodium phenylbutyrate) during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in the FAS was similar in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (257.8 [149-790] mg/kg / 282.0 [169-5625] mg/kg) and the NH3 scavengers group (250.0 [81-1000] mg/kg / 277.8 [58-971] mg/kg).
- Overall,  the  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  largely  related  to  the  disease/condition  (i.e., metabolic decompensation) rather than drug toxicity.
- Patients  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  experienced the  greatest  number  of  TEAEs  (n  =  85), serious TEAEs (n = 31), severe TEAEs (n = 34), deaths (n = 14), and treatment-emergent deaths  (n  =  13).  Patients  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  experienced  the  greatest  number  of drug-related TEAEs (n = 18) and drug-related serious TEAEs (n = 5).
- The  SOC  with  the  greatest  number  of  TEAEs  was  general  disorders  and  administration  site conditions (n = 10) in the carglumic acid group, metabolism and nutrition disorders (n = 26) in the NH3 scavengers group, and blood and lymphatic system disorders (n = 3) in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.
- A  total  of  3  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  3  patients  (8.8%)  during  3  episodes  (7.9%)  in  the carglumic  acid  group,  13  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  4  patients  (18.2%)  during  4  episodes (12.1%)  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  6  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  3  patients  (11.1%) during 3 episodes (11.1%) in the carglumic acid group + NH3 scavengers group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This report presents the exploratory analysis of data collected in 2 different retrospective studies from patients hospitalized due to metabolic hyperammonemic decompensation episodes in OA (PA, MMA and IVA). Propionic acidemia, MMA and IVA are rare inherited metabolic diseases which are characterized by a dysfunction of a specific step in amino acid catabolism, leading to accumulation of organic acids in blood and urine as well as high NH3 concentrations. Hyperammonemia is one of the most severe, lifethreatening  symptoms  in  metabolic  decompensation  episodes.  High  NH3  levels  are  neurotoxic [Butterworth, 1998] and it has been shown that longer durations and higher values of hyperammonemia  are  associated  with  poorer  neurological  outcomes  [Bachmann,  2003].  Prompt management  of  the  disease,  by  using  all  pharmacological  treatments  and  methods  available,  is required to avoid, or at least limit, the potential neurological sequelae encountered in OA patients.

In the full CSR (dated 31 August 2015), patients/episodes were divided into 2 treatment groups: those treated with carglumic acid with or without NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009) and those treated with NH3 scavengers only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2012). In this Addendum, patients/episodes were  divided  into  3  treatment  groups:  those  treated  with  carglumic  acid  only  (Study  OE-CGA001OA2009), those treated with carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009), and those treated with NH3 scavengers only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2012). In addition, NH3 data presented were censored at the time of HD/HF/PD initiation in order to further isolate the potential effects of carglumic acid without other NH3-reducing treatments.

Data from a total of 98 episodes were included in the FAS; 60 of these episodes occurred in patients with a diagnosis of PA (61.2%), 32 of these episodes occurred in patients with a diagnosis of MMA (32.7%),  and  6  of  these  episodes  occurred  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  IVA  (6.1%).  The  relatively small number of IVA patients is consistent with the frequency observed in clinical practice.

The median age at the start of the episode was lower in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (0.2  months  or  5.0  days)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (1.7  months  or  50.5  days)  or  the  NH3 scavengers group (2.2 months or 68.0 days). Furthermore, mean NH3 levels at baseline were higher in the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (346  μmol/L)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (257 μmol/L) or the NH3 scavengers group (227 μmol/L).

The patient population included in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavenger group appears slightly more severe taking into consideration 2 key risk factors: younger age and initial levels of ammonemia. In addition, all of the patients whose episodes were treated with the combination of carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers  displayed  neurological  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  the  2  most  relevant  clinical symptoms  in  metabolic  decompensation,  at  baseline.  On  the  contrary,  patient  populations  in  the carglumic acid and the NH3 scavengers groups were comparable with regard to demographics and risk factors.

The median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups, and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. The median duration of episodes was 6.0 days in  the  carglumic  acid  and  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  groups,  and  8.5  days  in  the  NH3 scavengers group.

During the 12-hour periods from treatment initiation to 48 hours and the 24-hour periods thereafter until  120  hours,  the  mean  reduction  in  NH3  levels  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scavengers  group  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  were  greater  than  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group. Overall, NH3 reductions from baseline were greatest in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group.

Differences between the combination group and the NH3 scavengers group were statistically significant in favor of the combination group during all time periods except from 12 to 24 hours after treatment initiation  even  though  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  combination  group  was  more  than double that in the NH3 scavengers group.

Overall,  the  number  of  clinical  findings,  including  clinical,  laboratory,  neurological,  psychiatric,  and respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all  treatment groups.  The  median  change  in  the  number  of  findings  from  baseline  to  endpoint  was  -4.0  in  the carglumic acid group and -3.0 in both the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers and the NH3 scavengers groups. In addition, an overall shift in findings from symptoms at baseline to no symptoms at endpoint occurred  for  the  majority  of  findings,  including  the  neurological  findings  and  feeding  difficulties categories, in all treatment groups.

A  greater  percentage  of  episodes  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  (30.3%)  were  treated  with extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) than in the carglumic acid (13.2%) or the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers  groups  (11.1%).  Since  NH3  levels  are  one  of  the  main  biological  parameters  that trigger the decision to start these procedures, it is possible that the more rapid reduction in NH3 levels seen in episodes treated with carglumic acid may have lead to a decision not to initiate HD/HF/PD.

This exploratory analysis, attempting to examine the isolated effect of carglumic acid, the data may suggest that carglumic acid is effective in reducing NH3 levels. Whether it may be more rapidly than NH3  scavengers,  especially  during  the  first  hours  that  are  critical  to  limit  potential  unfavorable neurological outcomes remains to be confirmed in a more powerful seting. Acute hyperammonemia is a medical  emergency,  which  may  require  HD/HF/PD  for  rapid  removal  of  NH3,  with  adjunctive pharmacological treatment and protein restriction to prevent serious neurological sequelae. The use of NH3  scavengers,  is  still  debated  in  MMA  and  PA  as  there  is  the  theoretical  risk  of  increasing intramitochondrial  accumulation  of  coenzyme  A  (CoA)  esters  and  of  further  depleting  free  CoA availability The mean daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in the FAS treated with carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (171.2 mg/kg) and carglumic acid only (152.2 mg/kg) was in the same range. Likewise, the median dose of NH3 scavengers (sodium benzoate/sodium phenylbutyrate) during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in the FAS was similar  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (257.8  mg/kg  /  282.0  mg/kg)  and  the  NH3 scavengers group (250.0 mg/kg / 277.8 mg/kg).

Overall,  there  were  fewer  AEs  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (n  =  21)  than  in  the carglumic acid group (n = 61) or the NH3 scavengers group (n = 97). Most AEs/SAEs appeared related to the disease/condition (i.e., metabolic decompensation) rather than drug toxicity. The carglumic acid group had the greatest number of drug-related TEAEs (n = 18 versus n = 6 in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group, and n = 1 in the NH3 scavengers group). It is, however, worthwhile to note that the categories of drug-relatedness were different in the 2 studies and that relatedness referred exclusively to carglumic acid in the combination treatment group.

In  line  with  the  reasoning  of  the  MAH,  and  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  full  CSR,  this  analysis apparently support the efficacy and the safety of carglumic acid for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to PA, MMA, and IVA. This exploratory analysis showed that the reduction of plasma NH3 level

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occurred faster in episodes treated with carglumic acid with or without NH3 scavengers. This reduction was particularly marked during the first hours of the acute hyperammonemic metabolic decompensation,  i.e.,  when  it  is  critical  to  rapidly  decrease  plasma  NH3  levels  in  order  to  prevent potentially devastating neurological sequelae.

The presented retrospective pooled analysis of studies OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012 pretend to consolidate the results of the retrospective study whose analysis has been presented earlier to EMA. This pooling result from US recommendation for granting MA in the indication of Carbaglu in the treatment of hyperammonemia due to organic acidemias (Methyl-Malonic academia/MMA, Propionic Acidemia/PA, Isovaleric Acidemia/IVA).

The pooling of retrospectively acquired data in two different time settings is prone to several bias, and their conclusions must be very cautious. The fact that in some studied efficacy measures there has not been a difference between carglumic acid response and the other group also raise doubts over the efficacy  in  the  medium-long  term  of  Carbaglu  treatment.  Nevertheless,  in  some  patients,  Carbaglu appear to be efficacious in the steep control of hyperammonemia in the studied population.

This PAM has not been a required EMA procedure.

The data provided do not negatively impact the benefit-risk balance of Carbaglu. Therefore no further regulatory action is required.

In the package submitted by the MAH, information on the characteristics of the administered product was not clear. The MAH was informed of this and responded with the following information:

'In the context of the retrospective nature of the study, the episodes treated with carglumic acid were collected between 1997 and 2009.

The information was not available for all patients/episodes.

Out  of  66  episodes,  the  information  on  the  carglumic  acid  formulation  used  was available for 43 episodes:

- -2 episodes treated with carglumic acid powder (between 1997 and 1998)
- -41  episodes  treated  with  Carbaglu  200  mg  dispersible  tablets  (marketed  in  EU) (between 2002 and 2009)

For the 23 remaining episodes treated between 2002 and 2009 the information was not reported on the Case Report Form.  '

More than 60% of the episodes occurred when under treatment with the EU formulation. The response was considered acceptable.
