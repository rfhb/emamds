## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Siklos, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

'Preliminary results of the HYDREP study were provided in March 2013. Sperm results were available for the  majority  of  patients:  63%  of  the  trial  population,  corresponding  to  31  patients  of  the  49  patients included,  for  whom  follow-up  sperm  results  after  6  months  of  hydroxycarbamide  treatment  were available.  The  preliminary  results  show  that  there  is  a  statistically  significant  impairment  in  all  sperm parameters after a 6 months HU therapy. The rapporteur acknowledges that these results may vary with the final  analysis.  However they are evocative of a risk of male fertility impairment after 6 months of treatment with SIKLOS.In view of available data, the PRAC considers that the changes to the product information proposed by the MAH should be amended. The frequency of azoospermia and oligospermia in the SmPC/PL should be changed from 'very rare' to 'very common'.  The proposed changes to sections 4.6 and 4.8 of the SmPC and the leaflet are detailed in Annex 1 of this assessment report. However, a further update to the SmPC might be needed, if final study results become available in 2014 .'

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Siklos, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance HYDROXYCARBAMIDE is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.
