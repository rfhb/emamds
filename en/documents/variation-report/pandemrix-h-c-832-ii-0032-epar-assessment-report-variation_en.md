## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following the declaration of the pandemic by WHO, the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The  vaccine  also  contains  the  marketing  authorisation  holder's  (MAH)  proprietary  adjuvant  AS03, which is composed of squalene, DLα -tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix  H1N1 to reflect  newly  available  post  dose  2  efficacy  and  safety  results  from  a  clinical study in adults 18-60 years of age (D-PAN-H1N1-007). In submitting the above mentioned data from study 010 the MAH also fulfilled the Specific Obligation to provide an abridged report for: post dose 2 data from study D-PAN H1N1-007 (SO2 50.1). In  addition,  this  procedure  discusses  data  in  young  adults  10-17  years  of  age  who  have  received  a single adult dose in study H1N1- 010., while the data in children 3-9 years of age  from this trial are being discussed in variation II-33. Study H1N1010 provided post-dose 1 data with the adult dose in subjects aged 10-17 years. Since these data in subjects aged 10-17 years from study H1N1- 010 are pertinent to the use of adult doses, the  CHMP  considered  that  the  information  on  use  of  the  adult  dose  in  subjects  aged  10-17  years including the newly available safety data from this population should be added to the SPC and PL . The data on administration of an adult dose to children 3-9 years of age in study H1N1-010 are under separate assessment within the scope of variation II-33. 1.2 Clinical aspects D-PAN H1N1-007 This is an ongoing study in 130 Belgian adults aged 18-60 years who have been randomised (1:1) with stratification by age (18-40, 41 to 50 and 51 to 60 years; 2:1:1) to receive: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Group A: (N=64) two doses 21 days apart of HA (3.75µg) adjuvanted with AS03A = Pandemrix H1N1v as approved
- Group B: (N=66) two doses 21 days apart of HA 15 µg (derived from the same H1N1v strain) without adjuvant.

HA : haemagglutinin AS03A:  GSK  Biologicals'  proprietary  adjuvant  containing  the  oil-in-water  SB62  emulsion, consisting  of  an  oil  phase  containing  DLα -tocopherol  and  squalene,  and  an  aqueous  phase containing the non-ionic detergent Tween 80 The primary objective is to demonstrate that two doses of vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain with AS03A results in an HI immune response to vaccinehomologous virus that meets or exceeds the CHMP criteria applied to seasonal influenza vaccines. The study is observer-blinded i.e. vaccine recipients and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint are unaware of which vaccine was administered. Blood samples for evaluation of HI antibody immune response are drawn prior to (Day 0) vaccination and at Days 21, 42, 182 and 364 after the first vaccination. HI antibody is determined in GSK Biologicals' central laboratory (SSW, Dresden, Germany) using standardised procedures with adequate controls validated by GSK Biologicals as previously described. The data from days 0, 21 and 42 reported below originate from testing of all sera in parallel. This means that the D0 and D21 data differ slightly from those previously reported in variation II-019 as a result of assay variability. This PI is therefore updated with these values in section 5.1 The synoptic report included in the submission also provided data on cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Subsequent analyses will be performed after all data will become available for Day 182 and Day 364. Results reported as of 19 November 2009 The mean age at the time of the first vaccination was 38.6 ± 13.78 years (mean ± SD) for all subjects. Mean ages were 26.2 ± 6.40 years for subjects randomised to the 18-40 years age stratum and 51.0 ± 5.31 for subjects randomised to the 41-60 years age stratum. Females outnumbered males in this study. Of the 130 enrolled, 129 subjects received the second dose and one subject was lost to follow-up. Subjects who received study vaccine doses (Total vaccinated cohort) Medicinal product no longer authorised

At Day 0 overall seropositivity rates were 38.3% and 42.4% in the two vaccine groups and Geometric Mean  Titer  (GMT)  values  were  8.8  and  10.8.  All  subjects  were  seropositive  at  Day  42.  In  the

At Day 42, HI responses in subjects from both study groups exceeded all the CHMP criteria. In the H1N1+AS03A group the SCR was 98.3%, the SCF was 72.9 and the SPR was 100.0%. For GMTs, SCR and SCF a general trend towards lower estimates in the unadjuvanted group was observed. As shown in the tables below the CHMP criteria were also met in each of the sub-groups according to HI baseline serostatus. The SCFs in the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group showed increases from D21 to D42 regardless of baseline serostatus. In the unadjuvanted group there was an increase only in those seronegative at baseline, reflecting the modest increase in GMT observed in this subset. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH provided the HI responses by age strata 18-40 and 41-60 years and baseline serostatus. The CHMP  criteria  were  met  in  both  age  strata  in  both  vaccine  groups  and  regardless  of  baseline serostatus. However, the GMTs after each dose were lower in the older age stratum.

The  MAH also provided the  HI  responses  by  age  strata  18-40,  41-50  and  51-60  years  by  baseline serostatus.  The  CHMP  criteria  were  met  in  all  age  strata  in  both  vaccine  groups  and  regardless  of baseline serostatus. However, the GMTs after each dose were almost always lowest in the oldest of these three age strata.

Similar analyses were provided according to history of influenza vaccination and again this had no impact on meeting CHMP criteria in any age stratum.

The oldest group (51-60 years) generally showed the lowest responses as outlined in the tables below in which results are presented according to baseline serostatus. The responses in this group also met the CHMP criteria.

SCF (ATP age stratum 51-60) Neutralising antibodies Neutralising  antibodies  (NA)  at  Day  0,  day  21  and  day  42  have  been  evaluated  on  a  subset  of  28 subjects  from  the  AS03  group  and  30  subjects  from  the  unadjuvanted  vaccine  group  at  Viroclinics laboratory. The Viroclinics NA assay is known to be less sensitive than GSK's. The differences are likely  due  to  assay  protocol  specificities,  such  as  the  short  incubation  time  (1h)  of  the  mix serum/virus/cells. NA seropositivity rates at D0 were imbalanced at 28.6% in the AS03 group and 56.7% in the nonadjuvanted  vaccine  group  and  in  each  group  showed  a  trend  to  increase  with  age.  At  D21  rates increased to 96.4% and 97.6% for adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups, respectively, and to 100% for both groups post-dose 2. Medicinal product no longer authorised

GMTs were low at Day 0 but D21 GMTs were 152.3 (adjuvanted group) and 89.9 (non-adjuvanted group)  with  a  further  increase  at  D42  (243.8  and  144.9).  Seroconversion  rates  reached  75.0%  and 73.3% post-dose 1 but were 96.9% vs. 76.7% at D42

The analysis by age strata showed an overall trend to a lower response to each vaccine with increasing age. Results in the youngest and oldest stratum also showed a larger difference between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups with increasing age but the results for the 8 subjects aged 41-50 years did not show this difference.

## Cell mediated immune response (CMI)

The CD4 T-cell response observed after dose 2 was markedly higher in the H1N1 + AS03A group as compared to the H1N1 group. A consistent trend for a further increase in the CD4 T-cell response was observed from D21 to D42 in the H1N1 + AS03 A group, whatever the antigen used for stimulation in vitro (split antigen or HA peptide pool). A smaller increase was observed after stimulation with the HA peptide pool in the H1N1 group.

There was no detectable effect of vaccination on the frequency of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells with the assay method used.

D-PAN H1N1-010 is an ongoing study that commenced on 10 September 2009 at five study sites in Spain. The study planned to enrol 200 subjects aged 3-17 years with stratification by age groups 3-5, 6-9 and 10 to 17 years in a ratio of 1:1:2. All subjects were to receive two doses of Pandemrix three weeks apart, given into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. The vaccine comprised the following content and lots: Composition and lot numbers of vaccine formulations used in D-Pan-H1N1-010 HA : haemagglutinin AS03A: GSK Biologicals' proprietary adjuvant containing the oil-in-water SB62 emulsion, consisting of an oil phase containing DL-GLYPH&lt;31&gt;-tocopherol and squalene, and an aqueous phase containing the nonionic detergent Tween 80 The sequential co-primary objectives are: · To evaluate whether the humoral immune response after two doses meets or exceeds the CHMP criteria  (as  applied  to  adults  age  18-60  years  and  to  seasonal  influenza  vaccines)  at  day  42  in children aged 3 to 17 years. · To  evaluate  superiority  in  terms  of  HI  response  to  a  6-month  booster  compared  to  the  D42 response. The criteria for success require a lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (at seven days after a 6-month booster after 2-dose primary vaccination / 21 days after the first dose) &gt; 2.0. The secondary objectives are: · To assess HI responses at D21, D42 and M6 · To assess HI responses 7 days, six months and one year after the booster · To describe the response by age strata Medicinal product no longer authorised

- To evaluate safety in terms of selected biochemistry safety parameters at Day 0, 21, 42, at Month 6, and Month 6 + 7 days.
- To evaluate safety and reactogenicity after each dose in terms of 7-day solicited local and general symptoms, unsolicited AEs, medically attended AEs (MAEs), AEs of specific interests (AESIs) or potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs) and SAEs

Exploratory  objectives  include  evaluation  of  the  CMI  response  and  immune  responses  to  drifted variants. Also, to describe the occurrence of lab-confirmed (H1N1)v cases (including drifted variant cases) during the entire study period.

The mean age at the time of the first vaccination was 13.3 years. Females slightly outnumbered males in this study as outlined in the table below Demography: age (in years) at vaccination dose by gender (Total vaccinated cohort) A history of seasonal influenza vaccine was obtained from 11/89 subjects aged 10-17 years. The  D0  HI  seropositivity  rate  was  39%  in  the  10-17  years  age  group,  resembling  that  reported  in adults aged 18-60 years in studies 007 and 008. At D21 all subjects were seropositive. The highest GMT was noted in the 10-17 years age group (699.7) and GMT values increased with age. H1N1 HI Antibodies against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) -  10 to 17 years age stratum In  adolescents from 10-17 years the baseline status was comparable with that observed in adults in studies H1N1-007 and H1N1-008. The GMT reported in study 010 in this age group closely resembles that reported at D21 in subjects aged 18-40 years in studies 007 and 008 (561 and 607).

Incidence and nature of grade 3 symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) with causal relationship to vaccination, reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose and overall (Total vaccinated cohort)

Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited adverse event but was more than twice as common in the adjuvanted vaccine group compared to the non-adjuvanted vaccine group. No increase in pain was observed after dose 2 as compared to after dose 1 in either group. Grade 3 pain was infrequent in the H1N1 + AS03A group and was not reported in the H1N1 group. Swelling and redness were observed at much lower frequencies than pain in the H1N1 + AS03A group and were not observed after either dose in the H1N1 group.

The table below shows the symptoms reported after dose 2, which display the higher rates for each in the  adjuvanted  group  as  was  observed  after  dose  1.  The  frequency  of  Grade  3  solicited  general symptoms after the second dose did not exceed two subjects per symptom (3.2%).

While the total of solicited and unsolicited general symptoms reported after dose 2 was not higher than after dose 1 in either vaccine group the rates for individual solicited symptoms in the H1N1 + AS03A group after dose 1 and dose 2 showed a clear trend for higher reactogenicity after dose 2. The rates after doses 1 and 2 respectively were: fatigue (34.9 vs. 45.2%), headache (27 vs. 35.5%), muscle aches (31.7% after both doses), sweating (9.5 vs. 19.4%), joint pain at other location (11.1 vs. 21%) and shivering (9.5% vs. 17.7%). Symptoms persisted for 1-3 days in almost all cases although prolonged fatigue was reported occasionally.

No subjects reported any fever after dose 1 and there were only two subjects with any fever after the second  dose  of  adjuvanted  vaccine.  Three  subjects  in  the  adjuvanted  group  reported  taking  a prophylactic  antipyretic  before  the  first  dose  but  no  subject  in  either  group  took  prophylactic antipyretics before the second dose. The  frequency  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  within  the  total  42-day period  was  comparable  between  groups  (53.1%  in  H1N1  +  AS03A  and  48.5%  in  H1N1).  These reports  were  very  varied  in  nature  but  included  three  and  one  subjects  in  respective  groups  with lymphadenopathy, two and none with injection site lymphadenopathy and 10 (15.6%) and 2 (3%) with rhinitis although rates of URTI overall were comparable.

## Study H1N1-007

Safety  data  were  provided  following  the  first  and  second  adult  doses  in  subjects  aged  from  10-17 years. The reporting rates for local and general solicited and unsolicited symptoms in this age group were generally comparable with rates observed in young adults as above but mostly slightly lower for individual  symptoms.  However,  rates  of  local  and  general  solicited  symptoms  showed  a  consistent trend to be higher after the second dose compared to the first dose.

The  limited  NA  data  available  from  a  subset  of  subjects  and  derived  from  an  assay  performed  at Viroclinics showed a baseline imbalance in seropositivity rates. Responses appeared to be generally greater in the AS03 group, including the results by age strata although the responses in the 8 subjects aged  41-50  years  were  somewhat  anomalous. These  results  must  be  viewed  with  some  caution  but they do demonstrate a good increment in NA titres in the AS03 group after one dose and overall a further increment after the second dose.

In the subjects aged 10-17 years, incidences after the first and second dose were 49.0% and 54.9% for headache, 44.9% and 54.9% for fatigue and 35.7% and 51.6% for myalgia. The respective incidences of any fever were 17.3% and 24.2%. but only one subject had a fever &gt; 39 0 C (after the second dose). Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment The  new  data  relating  to  administration  of  a  second  dose  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  in  study  007  are  in keeping with the results of study 021 in which the vaccine used contained a slightly higher amount of HA. The  baseline  serostatus  of  the  Belgian  subjects  in  study  007  was  generally  comparable  with  that observed  in  German  subjects  in  study  021  and,  although  there  was  some  difference  in  HI  GMTs according to baseline serostatus, especially in the older subjects, there was no impact on satisfaction of the  CHMP  criteria  after  the  first  or  second  doses.  Based  on  these  data  the  current  SPC  advice regarding the use of a single dose in adults aged from 18-60 years is supported subject to the caveats regarding the unknown longer-term benefit that might be afforded by a second dose. The HI data reported for D42 in study 007 can be directly compared with those reported in the tables above from D0 and D21 since all samples were run in parallel to avoid any effect of assay variability on interpretation of the findings. Re-run of the D0 and D21 samples did not have a marked effect on the data previously reported at these time points in variation II-019. Importantly, data from re-run of the sera confirmed that all CHMP criteria were already met at D21 in each age stratum and regardless of baseline serostatus or prior seasonal influenza vaccination history. There  was  a  clear  increment  in  GMT  from  D21  to  D42  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  group  only  and GMTs after each dose showed a trend to decrease with increasing age. The findings were consistent with those reported after the second dose in study H1N1-021 (using a higher dose of HA) as already reported in the assessment of FU2.020.

The report to D42 from study 007 also indicates that the CD4 T-cell response observed 21 days after dose  2  was  higher  in  the  H1N1  +  AS03A  group  compared  to  the  H1N1  group  and  there  were increments from D21 to D42 in the adjuvanted vaccine group regardless of the mode of testing. As observed in the H5N1 studies, there was no effect of vaccination on the CD8 response but this issue has been explored and discussed previously and will not be revisited specifically with regard to H1N1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile described with Pandemrix H1N1 in study 007 was generally comparable with that observed  after  first  and  second  doses  in  study  021,  supporting  the  previous  conclusions  that  the presence of the adjuvant is much more influential than the HA content in terms of the reactogenicity profile.  However,  in  study  021  there  was  no  consistent  trend  for  higher  rates  of  reporting  solicited general symptoms after the second dose although this was observed in study 007 for most symptoms.

Although the current SPC recommends only a single dose in adults aged 18-60 years the option of a second dose is left open and therefore the CHMP proposed that the data relevant to the second dose should have been added to sections 4.8 (as a brief mention) and 5.1 (tabulated) of the SPC (see the Annex 1).

While this variation proposed to update the SPC only with the post-dose 2 data from study 007 in adults  the  MAH  simultaneously  provided  post-dose  1  data  from  study  010  with  the  adult  dose  in subjects aged 10-17 years. Since  these  data  from  study  010  (filed  as  part  of  variation  II/033)  are  pertinent  to  the  use  of  adult doses,  and  since  the  current  SPC  already  recommends  dosing  of  subjects  aged  10-17  years  in accordance with the adult dose recommendation, the CHMP agreed to add the information on use of the adult dose and the safety data in subjects age 10-17 years to the SPC and PL in this variation. Overall the HI responses to a single adult dose in subjects aged 10-17 years generally resemble those in young adults. In addition, in the table proposed in section 5.1 of the SPC the MAH showed the HI responses separately for children aged 10-17 years who were seronegative at baseline. As expected, these data show satisfactory responses in this subset that far exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to adults. In addition, the safety profile of the first and second adult doses in subjects aged 10-17 years was generally comparable with that observed after each dose in young adults. In subjects aged 10-17 years  there  were  increments  in  local  as  well  as  general  solicited  symptoms  with  the  second  dose compared to the first dose whereas in young adults general symptoms increased with the second dose. On  this  basis  the  CHMP  considered  that  it  is  very  reasonable  that  the  SPC  should  continue  to recommend a single adult dose from 10 years upwards Changes to the Product Information The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH: o Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC were updated to reflect information from study H1N1009  in  the  subgroup  of  10-17  year  old  subjects.  In  this  respect,  section  4.2  and  4.4  were updated  to  inform  that  data  in  this  age  group  are  now  available,  and  to  delete  the recommendation in  section  4.2  that  the  choice  of  dose  for  this  age  group  should  take  into account the available data on safety and immunogenicity in adults and in children aged from 3-9 years for this reason.

- o Section 4.8 was updated to reflect that in 10-17 year old subjects no increased reactogenicity after the second dose was observed, however gastro-intestinal symptoms and shivering were reported at higher rates in the children aged 10-17 years than previously reported for other age groups . Furthermore it was added that after the second dose there were higher rates of most general  solicited  symptoms  (such  as  fatigue,  headache,  arthralgia,  shivering,  sweating  and fever) compared to the first dose in adults.
- o Annex II was updated to reflect the current status of the Specific Obligations and availability of further data as agreed by CHMP.
- o The PL was updated in section 4 to reflect the revised SPC section 4.
