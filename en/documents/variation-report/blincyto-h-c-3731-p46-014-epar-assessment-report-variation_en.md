## 1. Introduction

On 2 June 2023, the MAH  submitted a completed paediatric study (study 20120215) for blinatumomab, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

This was a Randomized, Open-label, Controlled Phase 3 Trial to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability  of  the  BiTE  Antibody  Blinatumomab  as  Consolidation  Therapy  Versus  Conventional Consolidation  Chemotherapy  in  Pediatric  Subjects  With  High-risk  First  Relapse  B-precursor  Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  Study  20120215  a  Randomized,  Open-label,  Controlled  Phase  3  Trial  to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of the BiTE Antibody Blinatumomab as Consolidation Therapy  Versus  Conventional  Consolidation  Chemotherapy  in  Pediatric  Subjects  With  High-risk  First Relapse B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a stand-alone study. No changes to the product labelling are proposed.

In addition, study 20120215 is classified as a Category 3 Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) in the Blincyto risk management plan (RMP). The due date for the final report was expected in July 2024, the RMP will be updated at the next opportunity.

The study 20120215 is part of the blinatumomab European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).

Updated data were submitted within the renewal application and efficacy results were in line with those reported and analysed within the type II EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0038 extension of indication variation. At this time no new clinical efficacy data are considered to modify the clinical efficacy profile to date.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

Blincyto  is  brand  name  for  Blinatumomab.  Blinatumomab  was  supplied  as  single-use  glass  injection vials containing a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for IV administration after reconstitution with sterile water for injection.

Blinatumomab was administered using infusion pumps approved for use by the appropriate regulatory authorities for the country in which the subject was undergoing treatment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Blinatumomab was approved in the European Union as an orphan medicinal product on November 25, 2015 in the following indication: treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL.

Blinatumomab was approved on July 26, 2018 for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relapse  after  receiving  at  least  two  prior  therapies  or  in  relapse  after  receiving  prior  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT).

Blinatumomab  was  approved  on  January  18,  2019,  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  Philadelphia chromosome-negative  CD19  positive  B  precursor  ALL  in  first  or  second  complete  remission  with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% for BLINCYTO monotherapy.

Blinatumomab was approved on 21 June 2021 for the treatment of of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with high-risk first relapsed Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL as part of the consolidation therapy.

Two Clinical study reports (CSR) are provided in this submission for the study 20120215:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objectives and endpoints

The primary objective of the study was event free survival (EFS) after blinatumomab when compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy as calculated from the time of randomization until the date of relapse or M2 marrow (bone marrow blast percentage (≥ 5% and &lt; 25% blasts) after having achieved a  complete remission (CR), failure to  achieve a CR at the end of treatment, second malignancy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate:

- The effect  of  blinatumomab  on  overall  survival  (OS)  when  compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy. Overall survival was calculated from time of randomization until death due to any cause.
- Reduction  in  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  after  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  SOC chemotherapy. The endpoints were:
- o Minimal residual disease response, defined as MRD level &lt; 10 -4  at the end of treatment with investigational products.
- o Cumulative incidence of relapse.
- The  safety  of  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy.  The  endpoints  were incidence  of  adverse  events  (both  serious,  and  non-serious),  treatment  related  adverse events, adverse events of interest, clinically significant changes in laboratory values
- The safety of alloHSCT after blinatumomab when compared to alloHSCT after  SOC chemotherapy. The endpoints were:
- o Survival status at 100 days following alloHSCT
- o Incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation (blinatumomab arm only)
- The PK of blinatumomab. The endpoints were:
- o Pharmacokinetic sampling for blinatumomab concentrations for population PK analysis
- o Blinatumomab steady state concentrations

## Study design

Study 20120215 is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 in paediatric subjects (&gt; 28 days and &lt; 18 years of age) with Philadelphia chromosome negative high-risk (HR) first relapse Bprecursor ALL (as defined by International Berlin Frankfurt-Muenster study arm [I-BFMSG]/International Study for Treatment of HR Childhood Relapsed ALL [IntReALL] criteria).

After induction therapy and 2 blocks of high-risk consolidation (HC) chemotherapy, paediatric subjects with HR first relapse B-cell ALL were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either blinatumomab arm (Arm 1A) or a third block of standard high risk consolidation (HC3) chemotherapy (Arm 2A).

R = Randomization; HC = high-risk consolidation; HSCT = hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Figure 1. Study Design and Treatment Schema

The study design included the following:

- -An up to 3 weeks screening visit: It occurs after induction therapy and 2 blocks of high-risk consolidation (HC) chemotherapy, to evaluate eligibility of the subject and perform randomization according to age and marrow status of patients at the end of HC2.
- -Treatment  period:  Patients  receive  a  single  consolidation  cycle  with  blinatumomab  or  HC3. During this period, subjects who are in or achieve cytomorphological CR2 (M1 marrow) after completing  consolidation  therapy,  in  any  treatment  arm,  will  undergo  alloHSCT.  Visits  are performed on Days 1, 15 and Day 29/End-of-treatment.
- -Follow-up period: Two safety follow-up periods were performed from 7 days before alloHSCT to 36  months  after  alloHSCT  or  died,  whichever  occurred  first.  After  reaching  the  primary endpoint, subjects were followed directly in the long-term follow-up period.
- o A  short-term  efficacy  follow-up  period  of  12  months  after  alloHSCT:  visits  were performed at 45 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after alloHSCT.
- o A long-term follow-up period : visit were performed by telephone and/or e-mail contact to  assess  disease  and  survival  status  every  3  months  (+/-  2  weeks)  until  the  last subject on study either was followed for 36 months after alloHSCT or died, whichever occurred first.

## Study population/ Sample size

The study aimed to observe 94 EFS events in approximately 202 randomized subjects. The following operating characteristics were based on 5000 simulations using a 2-sided log-rank test with an overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2-sided type 1 error of 5%, a 1:1 randomization ratio, exponentially distributed EFS times for noncured subjects, and a uniform enrollment period of 48 months.

If the control arm (HC3 group; Arm 2A) were to have a true cure rate of 40% and a median EFS of 7 months among noncured subjects (Amgen data on file) and the treatment group (blinatumomab; Arm 1A)  were  to  have  a  true  cure  rate  of  56.2%  and  a  median  EFS  of  11.1  months  among  noncured subjects  (a  noncured  hazard  ratio  of  0.63),  then  approximately  84%  of  the  simulations  would  have produced a statistically significant result (power). Under the assumption of no-treatment effect (a 40% cure rate and a median EFS of 7 months for all the arms), the probability of detecting a significant result in favor of blinatumomab (Arm 1A) was approximately 2.3%, which was similar to the planned type  1  error.  To  observe  94  events,  approximately  202  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  during  an approximate 48-month enrollment period with each subject followed until the last subject on study that either  was  followed  for  36  months  after  alloHSCT,  or  died,  whichever  occurred  first.  Two  interim analyses were planned to assess benefit when approximately 50% and 75% of the total number of EFS events have been observed.

Stopping for benefit was based on the O'Brien-Fleming (O'Brien and Fleming, 1979) member of the family  of  Lan-DeMets  (Lan  and  DeMets,  1983)  alpha  spending  functions;  the  critical  p-values corresponding to this spending function were 0.0031 for the 50% interim analysis, 0.0183 for the 75% interim analysis, and 0.044 for the primary analysis, if the interim analyses occurred precisely at 47 events (50%) and 71 events (75%).

To preserve the overall significance level, statistical testing followed hierarchical structure. First, the EFS was tested. If blinatumomab demonstrated superiority to SOC chemotherapy for EFS then OS was tested.  Hierarchical  testing  was  only  to  be  carried  out  at  the  primary  analysis  (ie,  final  analysis); testing  of  OS  at  the  interim  analysis  was  considered  descriptive.  Testing  of  the  other  secondary endpoints  was  considered  descriptive.  An  independent  DMC  external  to  Amgen  oversaw  the  first preplanned interim analyses and also assessed safety at regular intervals.

## Assessor's comment

The planned sample size was 202 subjects. However, on 17 July 2019, the DMC recommended to stop enrolment  for  benefit  in  the  blinatumomab  arm,  and  only  continue  with  treatment  and  long-term follow-up for those already enrolled on the study per the protocol-specified follow-up period. The MAH accepted the DMC's recommendation. Thus, a total of 108 patients was enrolled (54 per study arm).

## Treatments

Blinatumomab was administered as continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) to patients in Arm 1A.  One cycle of blinatumomab treatment included 4 weeks of CIVI of blinatumomab dosed at a constant daily flow rate of 15 μg/m2/day over 4 weeks (maxi mum daily dose not exceeded 28 µg/day), followed by 14 days without dosing, as per the agreed PIP.

Figure 3. Dosage, Administration, and Schedule

For patients, study duration included a 3-week screening period, a 4-week treatment period (for the blinatumomab arm:  1 consolidation cycle of blinatumomab; for the HC3 arm:  1 consolidation cycle of HC3), followed by a 1 week safety follow-up period prior to alloHSCT, a 12 months short-term efficacy follow-up, and a long-term follow-up that continued until the last subject on study either was followed for 36 months after alloHSCT or died, whichever occurred first.

## Assessor's comment

Blinatumomab was given in accordance with the approved scheme regimen.

## Statistical Methods

The  primary  analysis  was  planned  to  test  whether  EFS  was  superior  in  the  blinatumomab  arm compared with the HC3 arm. At the first pre-planned interim analysis, the criteria for primary endpoint was met and the results for primary analysis (data cutoff date of 17 July 2019) are presented in the primary analysis CSR (dated, 27 April 2020). The secondary endpoints were also summarized during the primary analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two interim analyses were planned to assess benefit when approximately 50% and 75% of the total number of EFS events have been observed.

The final analysis was planned to assess the potential long-term effect of blinatumomab on safety. The final analysis was triggered when the last subject enrolled in long-term follow-up was 36 months after alloHSCT or died, whichever occurred first. At the time of final analysis, the EFS and OS analyses were updated with additional follow-up data; these analyses were considered descriptive. If the last subject enrolled on study died or was lost to follow-up before 36 months after alloHSCT, the remainder of the subjects on study were followed until all subjects on study reached 36 months after alloHSCT, until death or lost to follow-up, which triggered the final analysis. This report presents the results of the final analysis with last subject last visit date of 21 November 2022.

## Assessor's comment

In  EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M03  procedure,  the  applicant  requested  the  addition  of  two  interim analyses to assess benefit when 47 (50%) and 71 (75%) events were observed in study 20120215, due  to  the  early  termination  of  recruitment  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  DMC  because  of efficacy.

The PDCO accepted the study design modification in view of the planned long-term follow-up of patients until all subjects on study have reached 36 months following alloHSCT, died or have been lost to follow-up, whichever occurred first.

HC3 -high-risk consolidation 3 chemotherapy: N -number of subjects in the analysis set; n -number of subjects with observed data; TA - received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; TC - other treatment compliance.

Deviation categories were not mutually exclusive. Multiple deviations within the same category were counted once per subject.

First subject enrolled date: 10 November 2015.

Last subject last visit date: 21 November 2022.

The most common IPD was 'missing data (other than the subjects that received the wrong treatment or  incorrect  dose  [TA]  or  other  treatment  compliance  [TC])',  most  of  which  occurred  when  bone marrow samples were not sent for central review during treatment or short-term follow-up. The second and  third  most  common  IPDs  were  'off-schedule  procedures  (other  than  TA  or  TC)'  and  'other deviations',  respectively.  The  nature  of  these  IPDs  were  primarily  administrative,  and  thus  did  not have significant impact on study efficacy or safety (Listing 16-2.2.1).

Randomization of subjects was stratified by age (1 to 9 years; other [&lt; 1 year and &gt; 9 years]), by bone marrow status determined at the end of HC2 and MRD status determined at the end of induction (M1 with MRD level &lt; 10 -3 ; M1 with MRD level &lt; 10 -3 ; and M2).

## Assessor's comment

The HC3 arm and the blinatumomab arm are globally the same, even in term of discontinuation. On the 111 randomized subjects, 5 discontinued investigational product because of adverse event (1 in the HC3 arm and 2 in the blinatumomab arm) and requirement of an alternative therapy (2 in the HC3 arm and none in the blinatumomab arm).

Note that, there is a higher rate of HSCT in the blinatumomab arm (94.4%) compared to the HC3 arm (68.4%)  and  a  higher  rate  of  death  in  the  HC3  (47.4%)  arm  compared  to  the  blinatumomab  arm (18.5%). This data will be evaluated in the efficacy analysis.

Regarding protocol deviations, the number of subjects with at least one important protocol deviation was similar in the 2 arms (30 [52.6%] in the HC3 arm and 26 [48.1%] in the blinatumomab arm). Some  of  these  deviations,  such  as  Missing  Data  (Other  Than  TA  Or  TC)  (25.2%)  or  Off-Schedule Procedures (Other Than TA Or TC) (14.4%), were in the most recurrent. The majority of these missing data came from bone marrow samples that were not sent for central review during treatment or shortterm follow-up. However, the applicant states that all cytological evaluations of bone marrow collected from screening to the end of short-term follow-up were reviewed centrally by a laboratory or assessed by PCR and/or flow cytometry when no central examination were performed. The distribution of the type of tests performed on these marrows is presented in table 4.

About  the  other  deviation  (16.2%),  there  were  essentially  subjects  who  did  not  sign  the  updated IRB/IEC-approved Informed Consent Form or other significant protocol or GCP deviation.

Data were stratified  according  to  age  and  bones  marrow  status.  The  proportion  of  subjects  in  each sub-group of the stratification is similar.

The overall results were consistent with those reported for the supplemental analysis.

Baseline demographic characteristics were detailed in the following Table 4. In the Full Analysis Set, approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  females  (52.3%),  and  most  of  the  subjects  were  white (86.5%) and were not Hispanic or Latino by ethnicity (96.4%). The median (range) age was 5.0 (1, 17) years, and majority of the subjects were in the age group of 1 to 9 years (72.1%).

## Assessor's comment

Baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  consistent  between  HC3  and  blinatumomab treatment arms, even if there are some disparities, particularly in terms of genetic anomalies, which are  not  distributed  in  the  same  way.  Some  genetic  abnormality  are  not  represented  in  the blinatumomab arm as the t(v;11q23)/MLL rearranged associated with a poor prognosis.

Most patients, in the two arms, had no extramedullary disease at the time of primary diagnosis. At relapse, the proportion of extramedullary disease is more frequent in the HC3 arms (26.3%) than in the blinatumomab arm (18.5%). The body site for extramedullary disease, was similar between the two arms.

Concerning  the  central  bone  marrow  assessment,  equivalent  cytomorphology  rate  were  showed between the two arms. The majority of patients presented a cytomorphology M1 (Representative bone marrow  aspirate  or  biopsy  with  blasts  &lt;  5%,  with  satisfactory  cellularity  and  with  regenerating hematopoiesis).

There was a difference between the MRD rates of the two arms. More patients in the HC3 arm had a rate above the ≥ 10 -4  threshold, whether measured by PCR or flow cytometry, with 15 subjects (26.3%) and 13 subjects (22.8%) respectively, compared with the blinatumomab arm with 10 subjects (18.5%) and 9 subjects (16.7%) respectively, which could reflect a higher relapse rate.

In  addition,  there  was  a  non-negligible  proportion  of  MRD  PCR  (38.7%)  and  MRD  flow  cytometry (34.2%) not done.

The populations of the two arms appear to be balanced and the overall results were consistent with those reported in the SmPC section 5.1.

## Efficacy results

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: At the time of final analysis, 35.1% of subjects (20 of 57) in the HC3 arm and 61.1% of subjects (33 of 54) in the blinatumomab arm were alive without events and censored. The result are detailed in the Table 5.

CR = complete remission: HC3 -high-risk consolidation 3 chemotherapy: KM -Kaplan-Meier:

MRD = minimal residual disease; N = number of subjects in the analysis set; n = number of subjects with observed data; NE - not estimable; w/o = without.

- M1: Representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with blasts &lt; 5%. with satisfactory cellularity and with regeneratinghematopoiesis.

M2:Representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with at least 5% and  25% blasts.

- Event-free survival was calculated from the time of randomization until the date of relapse or M2 marrow after having achieved a CR, failure to achieve a CR at the end of treatment, second malignancy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.
- b A normal score &lt; O indicated fewer than expected events for blinatumomab relative to HC3 and therefore a longer EFS time.
- Stratification factors were: sge (1 to 9 years vs other [&lt; 1 year and &gt; 9 years]). and marrow/MRD status (M1 with MRD level &lt; 103 vs M1 with MRD level ≥ 10-3 vs M2).
- Months were calculated as days from randomization date to event/censor date, divided by 30.5.
- The hazard ratio estimates were obtained from the Cox proportional hazard model. A hazard ratio &lt; 1.0 indicated a lower average event rate and a longer EFS for blinatumomab relative to HC3.
- d Time to censoring measured follow-up time by reversing the status indicator for censored and events.
- f The hazard ratio estimates were obtained from the Cox proportional hazard model including time from randomization to alloHSCT as a time-dependent covariate.

The  sensitivity  analyses  for  EFS  to  evaluate  potential  bias  of  differing  cycle  lengths  between  the treatment arms showed that the results were similar to the results from the primary EFS analysis. The estimated hazard ratios within the treatment arms were all &lt; 1 and directionally favored blinatumomab treatment.

## Secondary Endpoint:

At the time of final analysis, 50.9% (29 of 57 subjects) in the HC3 arm and 79.6% (43 of 54 subjects) in the blinatumomab arm were alive at last follow-up visit and censored. The overall median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months. The subject incidence of death was 49.1% in the HC3 arm and 20.4% in the blinatumomab arm; the treatment difference was statistically significant (p-value of 0.001 from the stratified log rank test). The results are presented in the Table 6.

HC3 - high-risk consolidation 3 chemotherapy: KM --Kaplan-Meier; MRD - minimal residual disease;

N - number of subjects in the analysis set; n = number of subjects with observed data; NE = not estimable:

M1: Representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with blasts c 5%6, with satisfactory cellularity and with regenerating hematopoiesis.

M2: Representative bone marrow aspirate or biopsy with at least 5% and c 25% blasts.

Overall survival time was calculated from time of randomization until death due to any cause.

Stratification factors were: age (1 to 9 years vs other [&lt; 1 year and &gt; 9 years]). and maimow/MRD status (M1 with MRD level &lt; 10² vs M1 with MRD level ≥ 10² vs M2).

Death events which occurred after the end of study are also included as the Osl event.

b A nomal score c 0 indicated fewer than expected events for blinatumomab relative to HC3 and therefore a longer survival time.

d Time to censoring measured follow-up time by reversing the status indicator for censored and events.

C Months were calculated as days from randomization date to event/censor date, divided by 30.5.

+ The hazard ratio estimates are obtained from the Cox proportional hazard model. A hazard ratio c 1.0

indicates a lower average event rate and a longer survival for blinatumomab relative to HC3. Source: Table 14-4.2.1.

Results for minimal residual response, one of the secondary endpoints, are shown in the Table 7.

A  total  of  63.2%  of  subjects  (36  of  57)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  29.6%  of  subjects  (16  of  54)  in  the blinatumomab arm had either  relapse  or  death  due  to  disease  progression,  of  which  1  subject  had disease progression in the HC3 arm and none in the blinatumomab arm. The cumulative incidence of relapse hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.48), indicating a 73% reduction in the risk of relapse in the blinatumomab arm. The median time to event was 7.9 months in the HC3 arm and not reached in the blinatumomab arm. The results from this final analysis were consistent with those reported for the primary analysis.

## Assessor's comment

About the primary endpoint, which was to evaluate EFS after blinatumomab when compared to SOC chemotherapy, the final analysis has demonstrated a significantly improvement in the blinatumomab arm when compared with HC3 arm (p &lt; 0.001 by the stratified log-rank test). Indeed, the subject incidence of EFS events was 64.9% in the HC3 arm and 38.9% in the blinatumomab arm.

The overall median follow-up time for EFS was 51.9 months. Median time to EFS in blinatumomab arm was not reached (95% CI:  24.8 months to non estimable [NE] vs 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 13.4 months) in HC3 arm) and the EFS hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.61).

The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 27.6% (95% CI:  16.2% to 40.3%) in the HC3 arm and 63.3% (95% CI:  48.7% to 74.8%) in the blinatumomab arm. The hazard ratio obtained from a Cox proportional hazard model with a time dependent covariate (hazard ratio = 0.34; 95% CI:  0.20% to 0.59%) was consistent with the hazard ratio provided above.

These  subgroup  analyses  to  assess  potential  bias  between  treatment  groups  show  no  increase  in occurrence  in  any  of  the  subgroups,  and  indicate  a  lower  mean  event  rate  and  longer  EFS  for blinatumomab compared with HC3.

About the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the overall population and was similar between treatment arms. The OS hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional  hazard  model  was  0.33  (95%  CI:  0.16  to  0.66)  and  the  median  time  to  OS  was  25.6 months (95% CI:  17.5 months to NE) in the HC3 arm and not reached in the blinatumomab arm.

The  36-month  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  was  49.0%  (95%  CI:  34.8%  to  61.8%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and 80.8% (95% CI: 67.3% to 89.2%) in the blinatumomab arm.

About the Minimal Residiual Disease Response, 53.1% of subjects in the HC3 arm and 93.9% subjects in the blinatumomab arm achieved an MRD response by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 60.0% of subjects in the HC3 arm and 92.6% of subjects in the blinatumomab arm achieved an MRD response by flow cytometry.

Blinatumomab treatment resulted in a higher MRD response when compared with HC3 and the MRD response results by flow cytometry were consistent with the MRD response results by PCR.

About the AlloHSCT and the survival status following AlloHSCT, 82.5% of subjects (47 of 57) in the HC3 arm and 94.4% of subjects (51 of 54) in the blinatumomab arm received an AlloHSCT.

The median time to transplant was 1.7 months (range: 1 to 4 months) in the HC3 arm and 1.9 months (range:  1 to 3 months) in the blinatumomab arm.

At  time  of  100  days  post-transplant,  the  mortality  rates  reach  3.9  (95%  CI:  1.0  to  14.8)  in  the blinatumomab arm and 5.1 (95% CI: 1.3 to 19.0) in the HC3 arm. The Kaplan-Meier median time to death  was  1558.0  days  in  the  HC3  arm  (95%  CI:  431.0  days  to  NE)  and  not  reached  in  the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018 extension of indication procedure mentioned that the data on mortality at 100 days post-transplant will be essential for judging the real benefit of Blincyto in the paediatric population.

These data have been presented above and support the blinatumomab arm compared to the HC3 arm. Efficacy results are in line with those reported and analysed within the type II EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0038  extension  of  indication  variation. No  new  clinical efficacy data are considered to modify the clinical efficacy profile to date.

## Pharmacokinetics Results

Blinatumomab was administered through continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at 15 µg/m2/day over a 4-week treatment period. Two PK samples were collected per subject on day 1 (at least 10 hours after infusion start and up to 24 hours) and on day 15. Comparison of PK parameters in pediatric patients from Studies 20130265, Study MT103-205, and Study 20120215 (current study) are provided in Table 10.  During  continuous  IV  infusion  of  15  µg/m2/day  to  pediatric  subjects,  the  mean  (+SD)  of blinatumomab  steady-state  concentrations  (Css)  was  884  (969)  pg/mL  while  the  mean  (+SD)  of clearance  (CL)  was  1.14  (0.836)  L/m2/hr.  The  intersubject  variability,  as  assessed  by  percent coefficient  of  variation  in  the  PK  parameter  estimates,  was  up  to  110%.  Given  the  high  observed intersubject variability in this study, mean (SD) Css and CL of blinatumomab were generally within the range of those previously reported in pediatric subjects from Study 20130265 and Study MT103-205.

In addition, blinatumomab CL values of subjects with high-risk first relapsed ALL and baseline MRD &lt; 10 -3   were  within  range  of  those  from  the  corresponding  subjects  with  baseline  MRD ≥ 10 -3 . Corresponding  analysis  comparing  CL  values  of  subjects  who  had  baseline  MRD  &lt;  10 -4   and ≥ 10 -4 showed similar results.

No analyses of the relationship between PK and safety data were planned or conducted.

The PK results from the final analysis were consistent with the results of the primary analysis given that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the  PK  results  reported  for  the  final  analysis  remain  the  same  as  those  presented  in  the supplemental  CSR  as  no  new  PK  data  have  been  generated  since  the  data  cutoff  date  of  the aforementioned report.
- the PK results of the supplemental CSR were consistent with those from the primary analysis.

## Assessor's comment

The PK results were observed by the laboratory on a population with high intersubject variability (110%). Such inter-subject variability is not exceptional. The applicant states that the results observed in the latest study are within the range of previous observations: Studies 20130265, Study MT103-205 which is generally expected.

## Anti-blinatumomab Antibody Assays

Of the 54 subjects in the blinatumomab arm who were included in the Safety Analysis Set, 52 subjects (52 of 54; 96.2%) had a postbaseline antibody result; none of the subjects tested positive for binding or neutralizing antiblinatumomab antibodies. Therefore, analyses evaluating the effect of antiblinatumomab antibodies on PK were not conducted.

## Safety results

At the time of final analysis, the mean (SD) duration of blinatumomab treatment was 27.0 (5.2) days, and the median cumulative blinatumomab dose was 419.4 µg/m2.

A total of 96.2% of subjects (50 of 52) in the HC3 arm and 100.0% (54 of 54) in the blinatumomab arm had treatment-emergent adverse events as presented in the Table 11.

Key risks in the blinatumomab program are neurologic events, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and medication errors. The key risks are summarized below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· Neurologic Events : Fifteen subjects (28.8%) in the HC3 arm and 26 subjects (48.1%) in the blinatumomab arm had neurologic events. By PT, the most frequently reported neurologic event (HC3 arm;  blinatumomab  arm)  was  headache  (9  subjects  [17.3%];  20  subjects  [37.0%]).  One  subject (1.9%) in the HC3 arm and 3 subjects (5.6%) in the blinatumomab arm had neurologic events that were grade ≥ 3 in severity. In the HC3 arm, the grade 3 event by PT was confusional state in 1 subject (1.9%) and in the blinatumomab arm, the grade 3 events by PT were nervous system disorder and neuralgia (each in 1 subject [1.9%]), and a grade 4 event of seizure in 1 subject (1.9%). One subject (1.9%) in the HC3 arm and 5 subjects (9.3%) in the blinatumomab arm had neurological event that were deemed serious. The serious adverse event of interest by PT was headache in 1 subject (1.9%) of the HC3 arm and it resolved. The serious adverse events of interest by PT were neurological symptom and  seizure  (each  in  2  subjects  [3.7%]),  and  nervous  system  disorder  (1  subject  [1.9])  of  the blinatumomab arm and all the events were resolved.

· Cytokine Release Syndrome : One subject (1.9%) in the HC3 arm and 2 subjects (3.7%) in the  blinatumomab  arm  had  CRS;  the  PT  for  all  of  these  events  was  CRS.  No  events  were  deemed grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse events for CRS.

· Medication  Errors :  No  subject  (0.0%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  1  subject  (1.9%)  in  the blinatumomab arm had medication errors. The event by PT was accidental overdose. This event was deemed grade 2 and serious by the investigator and it resolved.

All  results  presented  above  for  this  final  analysis  were  similar  to  those  presented  for  the  primary analysis.

## Assessor's comment

Among  the  108  patients  who  received  a  dose  of  treatment,  all  patients  in  the  blinatumomab  arm (100%) versus 96.2% (50 of 52) in the  HC3  arm  experienced  treatment  emergent  adverse  events (TEAE). These proportions are globally the same.

The most frequently reported TEAEs, for blinatumomab, were pyrexia (81.5% of subjects [44 of 54]), nausea (42.6% of subjects [23 of 54]), headache (37% of subjects [20 of 54]), vomiting (31.5% of subjects  [17  of  54]),  anaemia  (24.1%  of  subjects  [13  of  54]),  diarrhoea  and  stomatitis  (22.2%  of subjects [12 of 54] each) and are already known to be associated with the use of blinatumomab.

The most frequently re ported grade ≥ 3 TEAEs , for blinatumomab, were anemia (14.8% of subjects [8 of  54]),  mucosal  inflammation  (13.0%  of  subjects  [7  of  54]),  platelet  count  decreased  (11.1%  of subjects [6 of 54]), neutropenia (9.3% of subjects [5 of 54]) and thrombocytopenia, neutrophil count decrease and white blood cell count decrease (7.4% of subjects [4 of 54] for each).

The  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  (SAE),  for  blinatumomab,  were  neurological symptom and seizure (3.7% of subjects [2 of 54] each).

In  terms  of  treatment-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TERAE),  the  overall  number  of subjects  in  each  arm  was  similar,  with  41  (78.8%  of  subjects  [41  of  54])  in  the  HC3  arm  and  45 (83.3% of subjects [45 of 54]) in the blinatumomab arm and concerned

These  proportions  are  no  longer  equivalent  for  the  grade ≥ 3  TERAEs,  and  are  lower  in  the blinatumomab arm (16.7% of subjects [9 of 54]) than in the HC3 arm (63.5% of subjects [33 of 54]). No treatment-related grade ≥ 3 adverse events with a subject incidence of ≥ 10% were reported for the  blinatumomab  arm  and  the  incidence  of  grade ≥ 3  treatment-related  adverse  events  by  system organ  class  included:  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (3.7%  of  subjects  [2  of  54]  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blinatumomab arm), and investigations (9.3% of subjects [5 of 54] in the blinatumomab arm) and are already known to be associated with the use of blinatumomab.

These proportions are also different for serious adverse events, and are lower in the blinatumomab arm (16.7% of subjects [9 of 54]) than in the HC3 arm (28.8% of subjects [15 of 54]).

In the blinatumomab arm, the TEAEs led to 6 discontinuations and 2 interruption of the investigational product compared with HC3, in which there were only 2 treatment interruptions. The adverse events leading to interruption of blinatumomab included nervous system disorder (3.7% of subjects [2 of 54]) and  seizure,  abdominal  pain,  accidental  overdose  and  neurological  examination  abnormal  (1.9%  of subjects [1 of 54] for each).

Concerning  the  subject  incidence  of  treatment-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were  in system organ class of general disorders and administration site conditions (11.5% [6 of 52] for the HC3 arm and 59.3% [32 of 54] in for the blinatumomab arm), blood and lymphatic system disorders (57.7% of subjects [30 of 52] in the HC3 arm and 3.7% of subjects [2 of 54] in the blinatumomab arm), and gastrointestinal disorders (50.0% [26 of 52] for the HC3 arm and 25.9% [14 of 54] for the blinatumomab arm).

These events are listed as very common Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in the current SmPC, or part of the system organ class families.

Concerning the key risks, there are consistent with the previous study (study 20130320) and already mentioned in the SmPC.

The types and frequencies of AEs reported were globally consistent with the known safety profile of blinatumomab  and  concerned  population  of  subjects.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  this study.

## Deaths

No  subject  had  treatment-emergent  fatal  adverse  events.  Between  the  data  cut  off  dates  of  the primary analysis and the final analysis; no subject died while on the study, and 2 subjects died after end of the study.

From all enrolled subjects (N = 111, Full Analysis Set), 37 subjects (33.0%) died while on study, (27 subjects [47.4%] in the HC3 arm and 10 subjects [18.5%] in the blinatumomab arm) and 2 subjects died after end of the study (Table 1 Subject Disposition (Full Analysis Set)). Overall, the most frequent reason for death was due to disease progression in 29 subjects (74.4%; [29 of 39]) (Listing 16-2.7.3).

Eight  subjects  who  died  (4  subjects  each  in  the  HC3  arm  and  blinatumomab  arm),  the  reasons  for death by PT were: fungal sinusitis, CRS, recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia, and acute respiratory failure, (1 subject each in the HC3 arm); infection, hepatic failure, pneumonia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (1 subject each in the blinatumomab arm). The cause of death was not reported (PT:  not  applicable;  2  subjects  [1  subject  each  in  the  HC3  and  blinatumomab  arm]).  The  8  deaths occurred between 51 and 1591 days after the last dose of investigational product.

- -The death due to fungal sinusitis occurred 51 days after the last dose of HC3.
- -The death due to acute respiratory failure occurred 305 days after the last dose of HC3.
- -The death due to CRS occurred 334 days after the last dose of HC3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The death due to recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia occurred 1591 days after the last dose of HC3.
- -The death due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis occurred 87 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.
- -The death due to pneumonia occurred 99 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.
- -The death due to hepatic failure occurred 162 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.
- -The death due to infection occurred 291 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.

None of these deaths were deemed by the investigator as related to HC3 or blinatumomab.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

Study 20120215 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 in paediatric subjects (&gt; 28 days and &lt; 18 years of age) with Philadelphia chromosome negative high-risk (HR) first relapse B-precursor ALL (as defined by International Berlin Frankfurt-Muenster study arm [I-BFMSG]/International Study for Treatment of HR Childhood Relapsed ALL [IntReALL] criteria).

The planned sample size was 202 subjects. However, the recruitment in the study was prematurely stopped on 17 July 2019 for efficacy in blinatumomab arm, based on DMC recommendation at time of first interim analysis when approximately 50% of the total EFS events had occurred. Thus, a total of 108 patients was enrolled (54 per study arm).

The dosing regimen used is consistent with the one approved in the SmPC for Blinatumomab, and the population were globally the same.

Regarding  efficacy  data,  the  EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M03  report  underlined  the  importance  of  the planned long-term follow-up of patients until all subjects on study have reached 36 months following alloHSCT, died or have been lost to follow-up, whichever occurred first.

- -The  EFS  has  demonstrated  a  significantly  improvement  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  when compared with HC3 arm. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 27.6% (95% CI:  16.2% to 40.3%) in the HC3 arm and 63.3% (95% CI:  48.7% to 74.8%) in the blinatumomab arm.
- -The median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the overall population and was similar between treatment arms. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 49.0% (95% CI: 34.8% to 61.8%) in the HC3 arm and 80.8% (95% CI: 67.3% to 89.2%) in the blinatumomab arm.

The EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018 extension of indication procedure has also mentioned that the data on mortality at 100 days post-transplant will be essential for judging the real benefit of Blincyto in the paediatric population.

- -At time of 100 days post-transplant, the mortality rates reach 3.9 (95% CI: 1.0 to 14.8) in the blinatumomab arm and 5.1 (95% CI: 1.3 to 19.0) in the HC3 arm. The Kaplan-Meier median time to death was 1558.0 days in the HC3 arm (95% CI: 431.0 days to NE) and not reached in the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE).

Efficacy results are in line with those reported and analysed within the type II EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0038  extension  of  indication  variation. No  new  clinical efficacy data are considered to modify the clinical efficacy profile to date.

Regarding  the  safety  data,  the  reported  events  among  the  108  patients  who  received  a  dose  of treatment are known and listed as very common Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in the current SmPC,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or part of the system organ class families. Concerning the main risks, there are consistent with the previous study (study 20130320) and already mentioned in the SmPC.

The types and frequencies of AEs reported were globally consistent with the known safety profile of blinatumomab  and  concerned  population  of  subjects.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  this study.

Closing  data  from  the  20120215  study,  provided  by  the  laboratory,  do  not  change  the  benefit-risk balance, which remains positive.

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this procedure:

## Question 1.

The  applicant  is  requested  to  update  the  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  add  a  brief  text  to summarise  the  updated  efficacy  data,  also  in  terms  of  transplant  access  and  100-day  mortality. Indeed, these data might be informative to the prescribers.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1:

Amgen proposes to include the following text within Section 5.1 of the SmPC:

The  overall  median  follow-up  time  for  EFS  was  51.9  months  (95%  CI:  47.2%,  62.1%).  In patients who received the SOC consolidation chemotherapy (HC3), the 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate of EFS, was 27.6% (95% CI: 16.2%, 40.3%) compared to 63.3% (95% CI: 48.7%, 74.8%) in patients who received BLINCYTO and the hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.35 (0.20, 0.61).

The median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the overall population and was similar between treatment arms. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 49.0% (95% CI: 34.8% to 61.8%)  in  the  chemotherapy  (HC3)  arm  and  80.8%  (95%  CI:  67.3%  to  89.2%)  in  the BLINCYTO  arm  and  the  hazard  ratio  (95%  CI)  was  0.33  (0.16,  0.66).  The  median  time  to transplant was 1.7 months (range: 1 to 4 months) in the HC3 arm and 1.9 months (range: 1 to 3 months) in the BLINCYTO arm.

A  numerically  higher  incidence  of  postbaseline  alloHSCT  was  reported  in  the  BLINCYTO  arm compared  with  the  HC3  arm;  82.5%  of  subjects  (47  of  57)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  94.4%  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects (51 of 54) in the BLINCYTO arm. In the HC3 arm, 39 of 57 subjects (68.4%) received a transplant while in complete remission, whereas, 51 of 54 subjects (94.4%) in the BLINCYTO arm received a transplant while in complete remission.

At time of 100 days post-transplant, the mortality rates reached 3.9 (95% CI: 1.0 to 14.8) in the  BLINCYTO  arm  and  5.1  (95%  CI:  1.3  to  19.0)  in  the  chemotherapy  (HC3)  arm.  The Kaplan-Meier median time to death was 1558.0 days in the HC3 arm (95% CI: 431.0 days to NE) and not reached in the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE).

Following  agreement  and  close  out  of  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003731/P46/014,  Amgen  intends  to implement the changes through a Type Ib variation.

## Assessor's comment

Data and proposed wording provided by the applicant to update SmPC section 5.1 are acceptable and consistent with data already presented.
