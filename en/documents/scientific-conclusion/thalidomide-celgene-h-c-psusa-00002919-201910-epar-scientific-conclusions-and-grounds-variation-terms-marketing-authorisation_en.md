## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for thalidomide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Considering  that  thalidomide  has  been  on  the  market  for  more  than  10  years  and  that  therefore substantial experience in the use of thalidomide has been gained and bearing in mind that there has not been any recent changes to the implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP), the 6monthly reporting to EMA by each Member State of the status of implementation of the PPP and the estimate of usage in their Member State could be replaced by a reporting by the Marketing Authorisation Holders in the frame of the yearly PSURs.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for thalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing thalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the Annex 127a.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
