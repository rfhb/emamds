## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for daptomycin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Thrombocytopenia has been noted in association with daptomycin use in post marketing experience and bone marrow toxicity is an important potential risk in the RMP. A cumulative review revealed 144 cases with the preferred terms of thrombocytopenia or platelet count decreased. Of the 144 total cases, 95 were serious and 31 reported a fatal outcome. For this reporting period (12 Sep 2016 to 11 Sep 2017), 18 cases were reported, seven of which reported a fatal outcome. Cumulatively, 13 cases with the preferred terms of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased with positive dechallenge and rechallenge information have been received. Twelve cases report positive dechallenge and one case reported both positive dechallenge and rechallenge.

In the cumulative review of the 31 fatal cases that contained event as preferred terms of thrombocytopenia and/or platelet count decreased, there were 9 cases where the outcome of thrombocytopenia and/or platelet count decreased was fatal. The remaining 22 cases, including 3 cases from this reporting period, did not have fatal outcomes reported.

Based on the review of post-marketing cases for thrombocytopenia and  platelet count decreased, taking into consideration the number of cases, temporal association and presence of positive dechallenge the MAH concluded a possible causal relationship may exist. The MAH has not proposed additional monitoring of haematology laboratories, as the current standard of care of patients with serious gram-positive infections already includes close monitoring of complete blood counts.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing daptomycin were warranted. Thrombocytopenia is to be added to section 4.8 of the EU SmPC (undesirable effects) as an adverse reaction of not known frequency under blood and lymphatic disorders and section 4 to the package leaflet.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for daptomycin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing daptomycin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
