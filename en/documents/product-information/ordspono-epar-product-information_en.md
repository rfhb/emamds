## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Ordspono as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (r/r FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

Ordspono as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Ordspono must only be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients and who has access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (see section 4.4). At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of CRS should be available prior to Ordspono administration for Cycle 1. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of use of the previous tocilizumab dose should be available .

## Posology

Prophylaxis, premedications, and post-medications for the treatment of patients with r/r FL or r/r DLBCL

Ordspono should be administered to well-hydrated patients.

Premedications must be administered for each dose in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, Days 1 and 8 and post-medications for Cycle 1, Days 3, 10, and 17 and Cycle 2, Day 2 as described in Table 1 to reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or infusion-related reactions (IRR) (see section 4.4). Premedications may be continued beyond Cycle 2, Day 8 until the dose is tolerated without experiencing CRS or IRR. In addition, prophylaxis is recommended to reduce the risk of infection (see section 4.4), tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), and corticosteroid-induced gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions.

Management of adverse reactions in the treatment of patients with r/r FL or r/r DLBCL

## Cytokine release syndrome

CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation (see section 4.4). Other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension should be evaluated and treated. If CRS is suspected, withhold Ordspono until CRS resolves. CRS should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 4. Supportive therapy for CRS should be administered, which may include intensive care for severe or lifethreatening CRS.

If Grade 1, 2, or 3 CRS occurs, premedications should be administered prior to next dose of Ordspono, and patients should be monitored more frequently. Refer to Table 1 for additional information on premedications.

a If there is a dose delay, refer to Table 3 for recommendations on restarting Ordspono after dose delays.

b The type of neurologic toxicity should be considered before deciding to withhold Ordspono.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Ordspono has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; 3 to 10 x ULN and any AST). No dose recommendations can be made for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Ordspono in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Ordspono is for intravenous use after dilution only.

- The first cycle of Ordspono is administered as a 4-hour infusion. If Ordspono is tolerated on Cycle 2, Day 1, infusion time can be reduced to 1 hour for all subsequent doses. Refer to Table 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Ordspono should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line.
- Ordspono must not be administered as intravenous push or bolus.
- See Table 1 for premedications and post-medications.
- For doses that are not tolerated, refer to Tables 4, 5, and 6 for management guidance.

Ordspono must be diluted using aseptic technique.

For instructions on dilution of Ordspono before administration, see section 6.6. Compatible materials for tubing are also described in section 6.6. It is recommended to use a 0.2-micron or 5-micron polyethersulfone (PES) filter.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

Ordspono can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening (see section 4.8).

Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS included, but were not limited to, fever, hypotension, hypoxia, tachycardia, chills, dyspnoea, and headache. CRS events occurred predominantly in Cycle 1. Transient elevation of liver enzymes has been observed in patients experiencing CRS. See sections 4.2 and 4.8 for CRS monitoring and management guidance.

Therapy according to the step-up dosing schedule should be initiated, premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of CRS, and patients should be monitored accordingly for potential CRS following Ordspono. The step-up dosing schedule and premedications were established to mitigate the risk of CRS and should be followed (see section 4.2).

## Monitoring and management of CRS

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS during and following Ordspono administration for immediate management and should remain within proximity of a qualified healthcare facility for at least 24 hours after administration of each dose within the Ordspono step-up dosing regimen and after the first full dose. At the first sign of CRS, patients should be immediately evaluated for hospitalisation, managed per the guidance provided in Table 4, and supportive care should be administered; withhold or permanently discontinue Ordspono based on severity. Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.

Patients who experience CRS (or other adverse reactions that impair consciousness) should be evaluated and advised not to drive and to refrain from operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until resolution (see section 4.7).

Some manifestations of infusion-related reactions (IRR) may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. For IRR, withhold, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue Ordspono based on severity of reaction (see section 4.2).

## Serious infections

Ordspono can cause serious or fatal infections (see section 4.8).

## Monitoring and management of serious infections

Patients should be monitored before and during treatment with Ordspono treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections and treated appropriately. Ordspono should not be administered in the presence of active infection. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of Ordspono in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials as appropriate.

Prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is recommended for all patients. Prophylactic treatment is recommended for patients with a history of herpes virus infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and/or measurable viral load. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should be considered per guidelines.

Febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment with Ordspono. In the event of febrile neutropenia, patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care, according to local guidelines.

Withhold Ordspono or consider permanent discontinuation of Ordspono based on severity (see section 4.2).

## Neurologic toxicity

Neurologic toxicities, such as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), aphasia, and encephalopathy, which may be severe, occurred following treatment with Ordspono.

## Monitoring and management of neurologic toxicities

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity, evaluated, and provided supportive care; withhold or permanently discontinue Ordspono based on severity (see section 4.2 ).

Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur.

## Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)

TLS has been reported in patients receiving odronextamab (see section 4.8). Patients with high tumour burden, rapidly proliferative tumours, or renal dysfunction are at greater risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Patients at an increased risk for TLS should have adequate hydration and prophylactic antihyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol or rasburicase) prior to the administration of odronextamab.

## Monitoring and management of TLS

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of TLS, including blood chemistries, and any abnormalities should be managed promptly.

## Pneumonitis/Interstial lung disease (ILD)

Pneumonitis/ILD, which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported in patients receiving odronextamab and should be considered in case of respiratory symptoms without any causative pathogen.

## Patient card

The Patient Card describes the common signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, and provides instructions on when a patient should seek immediate medical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

attention. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Ordspono therapy with the patient. Patients should be provided with the Patient Card, instructed to carry it at all times, and show it to all of their healthcare providers.

## Immunisation

Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with Ordspono. Studies have not been conducted in patients who recently received live vaccines.

## Excipients

This medicinal product contains polysorbate 80, which may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. Initiation of treatment with Ordspono causes a transient elevation of cytokines, which may suppress CYP450 enzyme activities. The highest risk is during Cycle 1 in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, or theophylline). On initiation of therapy with Ordspono in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Ordspono and for at least 6 months after the last dose.

## Pregnancy

There are no available data on the use of Ordspono in pregnant women. No animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with odronextamab. Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is known to cross the placenta; therefore, odronextamab has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. Based on its mechanism of action, odronextamab may cause foetal harm, including B-cell lymphocytopenia, when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.1). Ordspono is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

There is no information regarding the presence of odronextamab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is known that human IgG can be secreted in human milk. Women should be advised not to breastfeed during treatment with Ordspono and for at least 6 months after the last dose due to the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of odronextamab on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects on male or female reproductive organs or fertility parameters (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ordspono has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who experience CRS (or other adverse reactions that impair consciousness) should be evaluated and advised not to drive and to refrain from operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until resolution.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most common adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (54%), neutropenia (41%), pyrexia (39%), anaemia (38%), thrombocytopenia (27%), diarrhoea (24%), and COVID-19 (22%).

The most common severe (NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) adverse reactions were neutropenia (34%), anaemia (19%), thrombocytopenia (13%), lymphopenia (12%), pneumonia (10%), leukopenia (9%), COVID-19 (8%), hypokalaemia (6%), and hyperglycaemia (5%).

The most common serious adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome (14% ), pneumonia (9%), COVID-19 (9%), and pyrexia (6%).

The frequency of infusion interruption of Ordspono due to an adverse reaction was 16%. The frequency of treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was 14%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were COVID-19 (2.4%), pneumonia (1.3%), and encephalopathy (0.8%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Unless otherwise stated, the frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies identified in a pooled safety population of 372 patients who received odronextamab as a single agent in two open-label, multi-centre studies (Study 1333 and Study 1625), including 153 patients with r/r FL and 219 patients with r/r DLBCL. The median exposure to odronextamab was 20.4 weeks (range: 0.4 to 195.7 weeks) (see section 5.1).

Two different step-up regimens were used during development. The step-up regimen was modified to mitigate the risk of CRS after 175 patients (74 with r/r FL and 101 with r/r DLBCL) were enrolled. Data for CRS and IRR are reported in 197 patients (79 with r/r FL and 118 with r/r DLBCL) who received the recommended step-up dosing regimen.

The adverse reactions are listed below in Table 7 by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories of frequency. Frequency categories are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of frequency by SOC and preferred term.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

In patients with r/r FL treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen, the rate of CRS was 58%, including Grade 1 CRS (47%), Grade 2 CRS (10%), and Grade 3 CRS (1.3%). Recurrent CRS occurred in 32% of patients with r/r FL. In patients with r/r DLBCL treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen, the rate of CRS was 52%, including Grade 1 CRS (35%), Grade 2 CRS (16%), and Grade 3 CRS (0.8%). Recurrent CRS occurred in 20% of patients with r/r DLBCL.

In patients with r/r FL or r/r DLBCL (combined) treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen, 24% experienced CRS after Cycle 1, Day 1 or 2, 29% experienced CRS after Cycle 1, Day 8 or 9, and 26% experienced CRS after Cycle 1, Day 15 or 16. From Cycle 2 on, 22% of patients experienced CRS. From Cycle 3 on, 4.6% of patients experienced CRS. With continued Ordspono dosing, the incidence and severity of CRS decreased.

Of patients who experienced CRS, 96% had an initial CRS event during the step-up dosing or with the first 80-mg dose for r/r FL or 160-mg dose for r/r DLBCL; 3.7% had their first CRS event after their second 80-mg dose for r/r FL or 160-mg dose for r/r DLBCL.

The median time to onset of CRS from the end of infusion across all doses in the combined group of patients treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen was 19.8 hours (range: -3.4 hours to 9 days). The median time to onset of CRS from the end of infusion in Cycle 1, Day 1 or Day 2 was 6 hours (range: -2.4 hours to 4 days), Cycle 1, Day 8 or Day 9 was 22 hours (range: 3.7 hours to 5 days), and Cycle 1, Day 15 or Day 16 was 22 hours (range: -3.4 hours to 9 days). Transient elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST &gt; 3 x ULN) were concurrent with CRS in 6.5% of patients with CRS. One patient (0.5%) discontinued due to CRS.

99% of CRS events resolved, and the median duration of CRS was 2 days (range: 1 to 10 days).

24% of patients treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen received tocilizumab, 26% received corticosteroids, and 13% received both tocilizumab and corticosteroids to treat CRS.

Hospitalisations due to CRS in patients treated with the recommended step-up dosing regimen occurred in 14% of patients, and the median duration was 2.0 days (range 1.0 to 9.0 days).

## Serious infections

Among 153 patients with r/r FL who received Ordspono, serious infections occurred in 44%,  with Grade 3 infections in 27% and Grade 4 infections in 2.6% of patients. Infections that were fatal within 90 days of the last dose occurred in 8% (13/153) of patients, and of these infections, 62% (8/13) were due to COVID-19 infection.  The most common Grade 3 or greater serious infections  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

COVID-19 (9%), pneumonia (8%), COVID-19 pneumonia (7%), cytomegalovirus infection (3.3%), urinary tract infection (2.6%), sepsis (2.6%) and cytomegalovirus infection reactivation (2.0%).

Among 219 patients with r/r DLBCL who received Ordspono, serious infections occurred in 33%, with Grade 3 infections in 20% and Grade 4 infections in 0.9% of patients. Infections that were fatal within 90 days of the last dose occurred in 9% (19/219) of patients, and of these infections, 42% (8/19) were due to COVID-19 infection. The most common Grade 3 or greater serious infections  were pneumonia (10%), COVID-19 (6%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (3.7%), sepsis (3.2%), and COVID-19 pneumonia (2.7%).

## Neurologic toxicity

Among 372 patients with r/r FL or r/r DLBCL who received ORDSPONO, the most frequent neurologic toxicities of any grade were headache (13%), dizziness (8%), anxiety (4.3%) and confusional state (3.5%), and encephalopathy (3%). Grade 3 or 4 neurologic adverse reactions occurred in 7% of patients. Event of ICANS (Grade 2) was reported in one patient (0.3%).

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Among 372 patients with r/r FL or r/r DLBCL who received ORDSPONO, TLS was reported in 0.5% of patients (N=2); both events were Grade 3. For these events, TLS onset was on Day 2 and Day 7, and both resolved within 2 days.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose, at more than twice the recommended dose, has been reported in patients taking Ordspono. Some of these patients experienced symptoms consistent with the known risks of Ordspono (see section 4.8). In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX34

## Mechanism of action

Odronextamab is a human IgG4-based bispecific antibody that binds to CD20, a B-cell surface antigen present on normal and malignant B cells and CD3, a T-cell antigen associated with the T-cell receptor complex. Simultaneous engagement of both arms of odronextamab results in formation of a synapse between the T cell and the CD20-expressing cell, resulting in T-cell activation and generation of polyclonal cytotoxic T-cell response, which result in redirected lysis of the targeted cells, including malignant B cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Circulating B-cell count

Following administration of the recommended doses of odronextamab, median circulating B cells decreased to undetectable levels (&lt; 1 cells/microliter) by Week 4 (Cycle 2, Day 1, after the first 80-mg dose for r/r FL or 160-mg dose for r/r DLBCL) administered in patients who had detectable B cells at baseline. The B-cell depletion was sustained while patients remained on treatment.

## Cytokine concentration

Concentrations of cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and IFN -γ) in serum were measured. Transient elevation of circulating cytokines was observed at dose levels of 0.2 mg and above. After administration of the recommended step-up dosing regimen of odronextamab, the highest elevation of systemic cytokine concentrations was observed within 24 hours after each intravenous infusion in Cycle 1, typically observed in the first two weeks. The elevated cytokine concentrations generally returned to baseline prior to the next infusion during the step-up dosing period (Cycle 1). Limited cytokine release was observed following subsequent doses.

## Immunogenicity

During treatment in Study 1625 and Study 1333, anti-odronextamab antibodies (ADA) were detected in 1.5% (6/400) of patients. No neutralizing antibodies were observed. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics or safety was observed, however, data are still limited .

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (r/r FL)

The efficacy of Ordspono was evaluated in 128 patients with r/r FL (based on WHO Classification 2017) in an open-label, multi-centre, non-randomized, multi-cohort study: Study 1625. The trial included adult patients with histologically confirmed grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma whose disease relapsed or became refractory after at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent. This study included patients with adequate bone marrow and organ function. The study excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement or prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Following step-up dosing in Cycle 1, patients were treated with Ordspono 80 mg weekly until the end of Cycle 4 followed by 160 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who maintained complete response (CR) for 9 months switched from maintenance dosing of 160 mg every 2 weeks to 160 mg every 4 weeks.

Among the 128 patients with r/r FL in Study 1625, the median age was 61 years (range: 22 to 84), 38% were age 65 or older, 53% were male, 62% were White, 27% were Asian, 51% with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0, and 48% with ECOG PS 1. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 2 to 13), 72% of patients had disease that was refractory to the last line of therapy, 74% were refractory to an anti-CD20 antibody in an earlier line of therapy, and 42% were double refractory (to anti-CD20 antibody and alkylating agents) in any line of therapy. Fourteen percent of patients had received a prior PI3K inhibitor, 13% had received prior lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, 26% had a Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score of 2 (intermediate) and 58% had a FLIPI score of 3 to 5 (high), 14% had bulky disease, 49% had progression of disease within 24 months (POD24), and 30% had prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Efficacy was established based on the primary efficacy endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoint of duration of response (DOR) as assessed by an independent central review committee (IRC) using 2014 Lugano criteria (see Table 8).

a DOR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented PR or CR until the patient experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first).

b DOCR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented CR until the patient experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first).

The first response assessment occurred at 12 weeks. The median time to first response was 2.7 months (range: 1.8 to 7.9 months) and the median time to first complete response was 2.7 months (range: 2.3 to 7.9 months).

The median follow-up for DOR was 17.6 months (95% CI: 14.8, 29 months).

Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL)

The efficacy of Ordspono was evaluated in 187 patients with r/r DLBCL (based on WHO Classification 2017) in two open-label, multi-centre, non-randomized, multi-cohort studies: Study 1625 (n=127) and Study 1333 (n=60). Both trials included adult patients with r/r DLBCL after at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent. Study 1333 included patients who progressed after CAR-T therapy. Both studies included patients with adequate bone marrow and organ function. Both studies excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement or prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Following step-up dosing in Cycle 1, patients were treated with Ordspono 160 mg weekly until the end of Cycle 4 followed by 320 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who maintained CR for 9 months switched from 320 mg every 2 weeks to 320 mg every 4 weeks.

## Study 1625: r/r DLBCL CAR-T therapy naïve

Among the 127 patients with r/r DLBCL in Study 1625, the median age was 67 years (range: 24 to 88), 57% were age 65 or older, 60% were male, 48% were White, 42% were Asian, 32% with ECOG PS 0, and 68% with ECOG PS 1. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 2 to 8). The diagnosis was de novo DLBCL in 76%, DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma in 19%, and Richter's transformation in 6%. Of these patients, 87% had disease refractory to last line of therapy, 55% had primary refractory disease, 91% had DLBCL NOS, 9% had high-grade B-cell lymphoma with double-hit or triple-hit gene rearrangements (MYC with BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements), 56% had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 3 (high-intermediate) to 5 (high), 44% had activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL/non-germinal centre B-cell-like (non-GCB) DLBCL,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

78% were refractory to an anti-CD20 antibody in an earlier line of therapy, 65% were double refractory (to anti-CD20 antibody and alkylating agents) in any line of therapy, and 17% had prior HSCT.

Efficacy was established on the basis of the primary efficacy endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint of duration of response (DOR) as assessed by an independent central review committee (IRC) using 2014 Lugano criteria (see Table 9).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Pharmacokinetics (PK) of odronextamab was characterized in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) over a dose range from 0.03 mg to 320 mg following intravenous infusion. During the step-up dosing period, the disposition of odronextamab is concentration- and timedependent. As dose levels increase with continued treatment to ≥ 80 mg, the PK profile of odronextamab becomes linear and dose-proportional at steady-state. The exposure parameters at doses ≥ 80 mg were approximately dose-proportional (see Table 11). PK was similar across the B-NHL patient populations evaluated.

a Values are median and 5th and 95th percentiles from a simulation of 507 subjects with B-NHL. b   AUC τ for the specified dosing interval.

## Distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The estimated geometric mean (CV%) of volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) of odronextamab is 9.34 L (CV% 48.5).

## Biotransformation

Odronextamab is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Odronextamab elimination is mediated by two parallel processes, a linear, non-saturable catabolic process and a nonlinear, saturable target-mediated pathway, with higher clearance at lower doses.

Following administration of the last dose of 160 mg once every 2 weeks at steady-state, the time to reach a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ, 0.00313 mg/L) was 19 weeks, and the time to reach 1% of the median Cmax of 160 mg once every 2 weeks dose was 12 weeks.

Following administration of the last dose of 320 mg once every 2 weeks at steady-state, the time to reach the LLOQ (0.00313 mg/L) was 24 weeks, and the time to reach 1% of the median Cmax of 320 mg once every 2 weeks dose was 16 weeks.

## Special populations

No clinically relevant differences in exposure to odronextamab were observed based on age (22 to 89 years; N=507), sex, race [white (N=316), Asian (N=129), or Black (N=7)], body weight, renal impairment, or mild to moderate hepatic impairment.

## Renal impairment

The population pharmacokinetics analysis of odronextamab showed that creatinine clearance (CrCL) does not affect the pharmacokinetics of odronextamab. No clinically relevant differences in exposure to odronextamab were observed in patients with normal renal function and with mild (N=178; CrCL ≥ 60 to &lt; 90 mL/min), moderate (N=110; CrCL ≥ 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min), and severe (N=4; CrCL ≥ 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min) renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

No clinically relevant differences in exposure to odronextamab were observed in patients with normal hepatic function and with mild (N=78; total bilirubin &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN or AST &gt; ULN) and moderate (N=5; total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. The effects of severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 to 10 x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment on the PK of odronextamab are unknown.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with odronextamab.

No specific studies have been conducted to evaluate potential effects of odronextamab on fertility. No adverse effects on male or female reproductive organs and no effects on semen analysis or menstrual cyclicity were observed in a 16-week repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys.

No developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with odronextamab. Based on its mechanism of action, odronextamab may cause foetal B-cell lymphocytopenia that may be harmful to the foetus and transient CRS that may be harmful to pregnancy maintenance.

## Method of administration

Ordspono is for intravenous use after dilution only. Ordspono must be diluted using aseptic technique.

- The first cycle of Ordspono is administered as a 4-hour infusion. If Ordspono is tolerated on Cycle 2, Day 1, infusion time can be reduced to 1 hour for all subsequent doses.
- Ordspono must not be administered as intravenous push or bolus.
- See Table 1 for premedications and post-medications.
- For doses that are not tolerated, refer to Tables 4, 5, and 6 for management guidance.

After Ordspono has been diluted as instructed above, administer as follows:

- Connect the prepared intravenous infusion bag containing the final Ordspono solution to intravenous tubing constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU). It is recommended to use a 0.2-micron or 5-micron polyethersulfone (PES) filter.
- Prime with Ordspono to the end of the intravenous tubing.
- Do not mix Ordspono with other medicinal products or concurrently administer other medicinal products through the same intravenous line.
- Upon completion of Ordspono infusion, flush the infusion line with adequate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure that the entire contents of the infusion bag are administered.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -Your doctor will give you a Patient Card. Read it carefully and follow the instructions on it. Keep this Patient Card with you at all times.
- -Always show the Patient Card to the doctor or nurse when you see them or if you go to hospital.

## 1. What Ordspono is and what it is used for

Ordspono is a type of antibody that is a cancer medicine. Ordspono contains the active substance odronextamab.

Ordspono is used in adults to treat the following blood cancers:

- Follicular lymphoma (FL)
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

In FL and DLBCL, a type of white blood cells that protect you from infection called 'B cells' become cancerous. The abnormal B cells do not work properly and grow too quickly. These cancerous B cells crowd out the normal B cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes.

Ordspono is given to patients who have already tried at least two previous treatments for FL or DLBCL, when either the cancer has not responded to them (refractory), or it has come back again (relapsed).

## How Ordspono works

The active substance in Ordspono, odronextamab, is a bispecific monoclonal antibody. This is a type of protein that attaches to two specific targets in the body.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Odronextamab attaches to a target substance found on B cells, including the cancerous 'B cells,' and another target found on 'T cells', a different type of white blood cell.
- T cells are another part of the body's defences that can destroy invading cells.
- By attaching T cells and B cells together like a bridge, Ordspono encourages the T cells to destroy the cancerous B cells.
- This helps control the FL and DLBCL and prevent their spread.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Ordspono

## You must not be given Ordspono

- if you are allergic to odronextamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Ordspono.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Ordspono if you:

- have ever had heart, lung, liver, or kidney problems
- have an infection or have had an infection in the past that lasted a long time or keeps coming back. An infection should be treated before you receive Ordspono.
- recently had a vaccine or are due to have a vaccine in the near future. Certain vaccines should not be given while you are receiving treatment with Ordspono.

If any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Ordspono.

Tell your doctor straight away if you get signs or symptoms of any of the side effects listed below during or after treatment with Ordspono. You may need immediate medical treatment. The most common signs or symptoms of each side effect are listed in section 4 under 'Serious side effects.'

- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) - a condition that can happen with medicines that stimulate T cells. CRS can be life-threatening.
- -Signs or symptoms of CRS may include fever, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, and difficulty breathing.
- -You may be given medicines that help reduce possible side effects of CRS before or after certain infusions.
- -Your doctor will monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to remain within proximity of a qualified healthcare facility for at least 24 hours after administration of each dose within the Ordspono step-up dosing regimen and after the first full dose.
- Infections - you may get signs or symptoms of infection (for example, a fever, chills, cough, or pain in urination), including life-threatening infections that may lead to death.
- -The signs and symptoms of infections can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.
- -Your doctor may prescribe another medicine to prevent certain types of infection while you are receiving Ordspono.
- Effects on your nervous system - you may get signs or symptoms that can include confusion or problems with the use of language.
- Tumour lysis syndrome some people may get unusual levels of some salts (such as potassium and uric acid) in the blood - caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment.
- -Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition.
- -Before each infusion with Ordspono, you should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -These measures may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
- Lung inflammation (pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease) you may get signs or symptoms that can include new or worsening cough, being short of breath

## Children and adolescents

Ordspono should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age because Ordspono has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Ordspono

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

## Pregnancy

It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. Ordspono is not recommended during pregnancy and in women who can get pregnant and are not using contraception. Ordspono may harm your unborn baby.

## Contraception

Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment - and for 6 months after the last dose of Ordspono.

## Breast-feeding

You must not breast-feed during and for at least 6 months after your last treatment with Ordspono. This is because it is not known whether any Ordspono passes into breast milk and could therefore harm the baby.

## Driving and using machines

Ordspono has minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. Some people may feel tired, dizzy, light-headed, or confused while taking Ordspono. If you feel any symptoms that may affect your ability to drive, do not drive or use tools or machines until your symptoms go away. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

## Ordspono contains polysorbate 80

The 2 mg vial of odronextamab contains 1 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 1 mL vial which is equivalent to 1 mg/mL.

The 80 mg vial of odronextamab contains 4 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 4 mL vial which is equivalent to 1 mg/mL.

The 320 mg vial of odronextamab contains 16 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 16 mL vial which is equivalent to 1 mg/mL.

Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Ordspono is given

Ordspono is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in giving such treatments. Follow the treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How Ordspono is given

Ordspono is given into a vein, as a drip (intravenous infusion).

- For Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4, a treatment cycle is 21 days.
- Ordspono is given over 4 hours during Cycle 1 and on Cycle 2, Day 1.
- The next doses may be given over 1 hour if side effects are not too severe.
- After Cycle 4, you will get a maintenance dose every 2 weeks.

## Medicines given before and after treatment with Ordspono

You will be given other medicines before and after treatment with Ordspono in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, Days 1 and 8. These medicines help reduce the risk of CRS and infusion-related reactions (IRR). These medicines may include:

- Corticosteroids - such as dexamethasone
- Paracetamol
- An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine

After Cycle 2 Day 8, your doctor will decide if you need to continue to take other medicines to help reduce side effects from Ordspono during future cycles.

## How much Ordspono is given

For the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a treatment cycle of Ordspono from Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 21 days.

In Cycle 1, you will be given increasing doses of Ordspono to treat FL or DLBCL on the following days:

- Day 1: 0.2 mg
- Day 2: 0.5 mg
- Day 8: 2 mg
- Day 9: 2 mg
- Day 15: 10 mg
- Day 16: 10 mg

In Cycles 2, 3, and 4, you will be given a dose on Days 1, 8, and 15:

- for follicular lymphoma: 80 mg
- for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: 160 mg

If your dose of Ordspono is delayed for any reason, you may need to restart treatment from Cycle 1.

One week after the end of Cycle 4, you will be given a maintenance dose every 2 weeks. The maintenance doses are as follows:

- for follicular lymphoma: 160 mg
- for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: 320 mg

If your cancer has been in remission for at least 9 months, your doctor may decide to reduce your dosing frequency from every 2 weeks to every 4 weeks.

Your doctor may continue your treatment for as long as you continue to respond to Ordspono or for as long as side effects are not too severe. Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Ordspono if you have certain side effects.

## If you miss an appointment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

## If you stop receiving Ordspono

Do not stop treatment with Ordspono unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because stopping your treatment may make your condition worse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

For storage conditions of the diluted solution in infusion bags, see Storage below.

## Method of administration

Ordspono is for intravenous use after dilution only. Ordspono must be diluted using aseptic technique.

- The first cycle of Ordspono is administered as a 4-hour infusion. If Ordspono is tolerated on Cycle 2, Day 1, infusion time can be reduced to 1 hour for all subsequent doses.
- Ordspono must not be administered as intravenous push or bolus.
- See Table 1 for premedications and post-medications.
- For doses that are not tolerated, refer to Tables 4, 5, and 6 for management guidance.

After Ordspono has been diluted as instructed above, administer as follows:

- Connect the prepared intravenous infusion bag containing the final Ordspono solution to intravenous tubing constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU). It is recommended to use a 0.2-micron or 5-micron polyethersulfone (PES) filter.
- Prime with Ordspono to the end of the intravenous tubing.
- Do not mix Ordspono with other medicinal products or concurrently administer other medicinal products through the same intravenous line.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Upon completion of Ordspono infusion, flush the infusion line with adequate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure that the entire contents of the infusion bag are administered.

## Storage

## Unopened vial

Store in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the original outer carton in order to protect from light.

## Storage of diluted solution

Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for the diluted Ordspono infusion solution as follows:

- in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) for all doses for up to 24 hours.
- at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) for up to 6 hours for the 0.2-mg dose with Albumin (Human).
- at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) for up to 12 hours for doses of 0.5 mg or greater.

Discard diluted infusion solution if storage time exceeds these limits.

## Disposal

The release of pharmaceuticals into the environment should be minimised. Medicinal products should not be disposed of via wastewater and disposal through household waste should be avoided.

The following points should be strictly adhered to regarding the use and disposal of syringes and other medicinal sharps:

- Needles and syringes should never be reused.
- Place all used needles and syringes into a sharps container (puncture-proof disposable container).

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
