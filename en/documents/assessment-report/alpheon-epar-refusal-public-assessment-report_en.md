## 3 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 3.1 Introduction

BioPartners  GmbH  applied  for  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Alpheon  6  million  IU/ml  solution  for injection. Alpheon contains recombinant human interferon-alfa-2a as active substance. The application was submitted under the legal basis of Similar Biological Medicinal Product under Article 10(1)(a)(iii) of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  and  with  reference  to  Part  II.4  of  Annex  I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as amended.

The  reference  medicinal  product  for  this  application  was  Roferon-A  Solution  for  Injection,  a recombinant interferon alfa 2a containing product expressed in E. coli produced by Roche originally authorised in the EU in 1986. Alpheon was claimed to be similar to this reference medicinal product as approved in the Community.

As required for a Similar Biological Medicinal Product application , the dossier contained a full quality Module 3 and a reduced non-clinical and clinical Modules 4 and 5, with the required elements of the comparability exercise, respectively as required by the CHMP guidelines.

The indication applied for was as follows: Adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C who  are positive for HCV  antibodies or HCV  RNA  and  have  elevated  serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT)  without  liver  decompensation.  The  efficacy  of  Interferon-alfa-2a  in  the treatment of hepatitis C is enhanced when combined with ribavirin. Alpheon should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contra-indication to ribavirin.

## 3.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The active ingredient of Alpheon was recombinant human interferon alfa-2a expressed in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae .  Human  interferonα 2a  protein  consists  of  165  amino  acids  with  a molecular weight of approx. 19,240 kD and two disulfide bonds.

Alpheon drug product was presented in multidose vials as a ready-to-use solution for injection.

## Active Substance

- Manufacture

## Cell bank system

The drug substance for Alpheon was produced from a sufficiently well-defined and characterised S. cerevisiae cell  bank  system    Genetic  stability  was  demonstrated  during  production,  at  the  end  of production and in post-production cells, indicating sufficient genetic stability.

## Manufacturing Process

The manufacturing process consists of a fermentation process where the secreted product was purified by a protein purification process comprising 5 chromatography and 3 ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps in order to remove process and product-related impurities and reduce product-related substances.

Process validation was performed on small scale as well as commercial scale conditions. All process steps were validated and included in-process and manufacturing controls.

## Manufacturing Process Development

The  manufacturing  process  of  the  drug  substance,  which  was  originally  developed  in  1990,  was modified in 1999 in the following ways:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- (1)  the replacement of the animal derived bacto-peptone by yeast-derived peptone; and
- (2)  the introduction of a second cation exchange chromatography step.

The manufacturing process remained unchanged throughout the Alpheon development programme.

## Characterisation

State-of-the-art analytical methods were used to thoroughly investigate recombinant human interferonα 2a with regard to its structural, physico-chemical, immunological and biological characteristics. The drug substance was considered to have been sufficiently characterised.

The following analytical methods were used:

- -Physico-chemical characterisation

Reducing  /  Non-Reducing  SDS-PAGE,  Isoelectric  Focusing,  Extinction  Coefficient  UV Spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism, Size Exclusion HPLC (SEC-HPLC), Reverse-phase HPLC and Mass Spectrometry

- -Structural characterization and conformation

Peptide  Mapping,  Disulfide  Bridges,  N-terminal  Sequence,  C-terminal  Sequence,  Analysis  of Amino Acid Composition, Free Cystein , Carbohydrate Structure

- -Biological activities and immunological properties

SDS-PAGE/Western  blotting, Epitope Mapping, Enzyme-linked Immunoassay (ELISA), Potency

- -Purity

Size Exclusion HPLC (SEC-HPLC), Reverse-phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE, CZE, CM-HPLC.

It  was  concluded  that  the  drug  substance  was  sufficiently  well  characterised  based  on  the  data provided. However, differences in impurity profile were observed.

Information about the related substances was still insufficient to determine their impact on Alpheon quality and characteristics.

## Impurities

Process-related  impurities  were  analysed  as  well  as  product-related  impurities  and  product-related substances  arising  either  from  the  culture/fermentation  process  or  from  the  purification  process (downstream  processing),  demonstrating  sufficient  removal  of  process-related  and  product-related impurities and reduction of process-related substances.

## Control of Drug Substance

The  proposed  release  specifications  have  been  selected  taking  into  account  the  properties  and characteristics  of  the  drug  substance.  The  proposed  test  items  address  the  physical  state,  identity, purity and content as well as the presence of a number of related substances and the general safety of the product.

The analytical methods were improved according to state-of-the-art requirements during the procedure and  have  been  validated  and  harmonised  for  the  drug  substance  and  the  drug  product,  taking  into account the large difference in protein concentration (mg/ml) between the drug substance and drug product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability

Thirty-six month real-time stability data on four batches were presented in the application Due to the improvement of the analytical methods new stability data were requested since a retrospective analysis of older drug substance batches was not considered sufficient. A shelf-life could not be assigned at this stage.

## Finished Product

Alpheon was presented as a liquid formulation in multidose vials containing 6 individual doses 0.5 mL each. Each 0.5 mL dose represents an activity of 3 x 10 6 IU interferon alpha-2a corresponding to a label claim of 6 x 10 6 IU/mL.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Originally, the (lyophilised) product contained human serum albumin (HSA) as a stabilizer. During the development of the liquid formulation HSA was replaced by an alternative stabilizing agent and preservative system. This formulation was used in all pivotal nonclinical and clinical studies.

## · Manufacture

Alpheon  finished  product  is  manufactured  from  drug  substance  that  was  compounded  with  the excipient solutions and aseptically filled into vials.

## Process validation

Extensive validation of the  manufacturing process was performed; however, unexpected difficulties were encountered during the upgrading of the filling line at the drug product manufacturer IDT , and the process could not be regarded as validated.  Thus, the drug product production process was not considered  to  be  fully  validated  and  there  was  no  assurance  of  control  and  consistency  of  the manufacturing process.

## Analytical Validation

As a consequence of the improved analytical methods for the drug substance and with the intention to harmonise  the  methods  for  drug  substance  and  drug  product  considering  the  difference  in  protein concentration, the methods employed in the testing of the drug product were also revised. Validation of the methods was performed.

## Comparability of clinical batches vs. commercial batches

Quantitative  differences  in  the  related  substance  profile  of  the  clinical  batches  and  the  recently produced batches of Alpheon were demonstrated. The applicant assumed that the differences were due to ageing of the samples. Conclusions could not be drawn from these experiments with aged samples due to lack of data on the stability profile of Alpheon.

Reliable  release  data  proving  comparability  of  clinical  and  the  recent  batches  in  terms  of  related substances  were  not  available.  Therefore  uncertainties  remained  regarding  the  comparability  of clinical trial material with the proposed commercial product.

## Container Closure System

Alpheon was presented in a 4.0 mL borosilicate Type I glass vial which was closed with a coated butyl rubber stopper and covered with an aluminium overseal and a polypropylene flip-off cap.

## Compatibility

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compatibility will be assessed through the ongoing stability studies and in addition on the basis of product-specific  migration  data  on  potential  leachables  and  extractables  from  the  coated/laminated stopper material with the drug product.

- Stability of the Product

Sufficient stability data representative of the intended commercial drug product tested with the revised analytical methods were not available and a shelf life could not be assigned.

- Comparability exercise of Alpheon vs. Roferon-A

A  number  of  factors  impacted  on  any  study  designed  to  compare  Alpheon  drug  substance  and Roferon-A. These included the unavailability of Roferon-A drug substance, formulation effects, and effects  of  sample  preparation.  The  difficulties  of  performing  a  like  to  like  comparison  were  well recognised.

The  applicant  designed  a  number  of  studies  taking  into  account  the  above-mentioned  factors.  The applicant identified that Alpheon drug substance was structurally comparable to the Interferon alfa in Roferon-A. However, while there were similarities between Alpheon drug substance and Roferon-A drug product in terms of the product-related substance profile, the applicant  also demonstrated that there were some differences.

Data comparing the two drug products were considered to be incomplete and inconclusive. Alpheon Drug  Product  manufactured  with  a  validated  process  representative  for  the  proposed  commercial process was not available.  As a result of the aforementioned deficiencies and the observed differences in  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  product-related  substance  profile,  no  conclusion  regarding  the comparability of Alpheon and Roferon-A could be reached.

Issues regarding the samples of Alpheon used (currently no validated drug product) and the impact of sample preparation (concentration procedures and presence of excipients) on the analytical methods were unresolved.

## Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation

No materials  of  animal  origin  were  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the  drug  substance.  No  human-  or animal-derived materials were used in the formulation of the medicinal product.

## GMP issues

Compliance with general GMP principles was demonstrated for all manufacturing sites.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Active substance

The active ingredient of Alpheon was recombinant human interferon alfa-2a expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Human interferonα 2a (IFNα 2a) was a characterized protein consisting of 165 amino acids.

The primary structure of Alpheon was identical to that of a marketed recombinant human interferon alfa 2a product expressed in E. coli (Roferon-A). Similarity was claimed to Roferon-A.

The cell banking system for Alpheon was three tiered and included a Master Cell Bank, Intermediate Cell Bank, and Working Cell Banks.

The  fermentation  process  was  a  two  stage  process  with  the  main  fermentation  at  50  L  scale.  The production  organism Saccharomyces  cerevisiae secreted  the  drug  substance  into  the  fermentation medium.  The  drug  substance  was  recovered  from  the  fermentation  both  by  a  conventional  protein purification process comprising 5 chromatography and 3 ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based  on  the  data  presented,  it  could  be  concluded  that  the  drug  substance  was  sufficiently  well characterised. However, new information on the related substances/ impurities in Alpheon emerged at a very late stage in the assessment process, thus putting into question the previous data provided and the conclusions drawn from it.

Regarding the drug substance stability, the applicant based their response on re-evaluation of old data against the new specifications. This can provide some information but was insufficient if presented without confirmation using the current test methods and specifications.

The proposed shelf-life for the drug substance was not supported by adequate data. The presented data were not  regarded  as  sufficient  to  support  the  shelf  life  of  the  drug  substance  at  the  recommended storage and transportation conditions.

## Finished Product

The drug product was presented as a liquid formulation in multidose vials. Target fill volume was 3.60 ml  including  a  20  %  overfill  (6  x  0.1  ml)  which  was  stated  to  be  required  for  the  removal  of  6 individual doses 0.5 mL each.

The manufacturing process for Alpheon comprised the preparation of the solution, sterile filtration, aseptic filling/closing and secondary packaging.

After  the  introduction  of  a  new  filling  line,  three  new  validation  batches  were  manufactured  in December 2005. The new validation results demonstrated that the filling process was not sufficiently under control. Major concerns existed regarding the control of the drug product production process. These  could  only  be  answered  by  a  full  and  satisfactory  validation  of  the  drug  product  production process,  which  takes  into  account  experience  during  previous  failed  validations.  Thus,  the  drug product production process was not considered to be fully validated and there was no assurance of adequate control and consistency of the manufacturing process.

It  should  be  highlighted  that  in  the  original  dossier  the  applicant  had  not  used  a  harmonised  set  of analytical methods for the assessment of related proteins in Alpheon drug substance and drug product. This  lack  of  adequate  method  transfer  led  to  the  significant  differences  seen  in  related  proteins between the drug substance and the drug product.

ICH compliant stability data were not available for the drug product, since the most recent production batches were not be considered to be validation batches. As a result, a shelf life for Alpheon could not be assigned. An adequate stability study would require validation and finalisation of the manufacturing method and controls. In addition, the impact of the new impurity detected in all batches of the new stability study, needed to be fully evaluated and a specification set prior to the conduct of new stability studies.

## Comparability of Alpheon vs. Roferon-A

The data provided for the Alpheon and Roferon-A finished products did not support the key claim of comparability. Assays where product related impurities had been investigated indicated that Alpheon and Roferon-A displayed a different impurity profile. The precise nature, biological properties, and the qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  the  different  impurities  had  not  been  fully  studied. Differences in the stability profile also required investigation.

It  was  therefore  concluded  that  the  data  comparing  the  two  drug  products  were  incomplete  and inconclusive.  Issues  regarding  the  samples  of  Alpheon  used  (currently  no  validated  manufacturing process) and the impact of sample preparation (concentration procedures and presence of excipients) on the analytical methods were unresolved.

As a consequence of the deficiencies set out above and the quantitative and qualitative differences in the impurity profile, no conclusion regarding the comparability of Alpheon and Roferon-A based upon the available quality data could be reached.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Comparability of clinical batches vs. commercial batches

In  addition,  the  applicant  was  unable  to  satisfactorily  address  the  comparability  of  the  clinical  trial material with the drug product produced from the intended commercial process. The lack of validation of analytical methods used as well as validation of the production process made this task even more difficult.

The  applicant  provided  retrospective  analysis  of  retained  samples,  and  as  much  information  as possible about the clinical trial material. However, the retrospective analysis of related substances was not  considered  satisfactory.  Quantitative  differences  in  the  related  substance  profile  of  the  clinical batches and the recently produced batches of Alpheon were demonstrated. The applicant considered that  these  differences  were  due  to  ageing  of  the  samples.  However,  no  firm  conclusions  could  be drawn  from  these  experiments  with  aged  samples  due  to  lack  of  data  on  the  stability  profile  of Alpheon.

Reliable  release  data  proving  comparability  of  clinical  and  the  recent  batches  in  terms  of  related substances  were  not  available.  Therefore  uncertainties  remained  regarding  the  comparability  of clinical trial material with the proposed commercial product.

## 3.3  Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The objectives of the applicant in terms of the non-clinical aspects for Alpheon were to establish its activity as an IFNα -2a and to demonstrate similarity regarding safety and efficacy to Roferon-A.

In  accordance  with  the CHMP-Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005) ,  the demonstration of similarity in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy of  a  medicinal  product  to  another  one  already  authorised  in  the  EU,  required  an  extensive comparability exercise. The required non-clinical studies should be comparative in nature.

For  this  purpose  the  applicant  submitted  an in  vitro study  comparing  the  activity  of  Alpheon  and Roferon-A in terms of antiviral activity and induction of interferon-sensitive genes together with a 4week subcutaneous repeated-dose toxicity study.

In addition, the applicant also submitted several non-clinical studies, on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology, which were conducted in the early 1990s with a HSA-stabilised, lyophilised formulation of Alpheon derived from an earlier manufacturing process.

## GLP

The 4-week repeated-dose toxicity study in monkeys was conducted in compliance with GLP.

The  non-clinical  toxicology  studies  conducted  in  Korea  prior  to  1992  were  not  performed  under current GLP regulations, but were in agreement with the regulations for non-clinical studies in force in that country at the time.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

An  i n  vitro study  comparing  the  activity  of  Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  in  terms  of  antiviral  activity against  encephalomyelitis  virus  (EMCV)  in  two  cell  lines  (A549  cells  and  HuH7  cells)  and  gene induction (response to interferon in HuH7 hepatocytes) were performed. A standard interferon α -2a preparation  from  the  National  Institute  for  Biological  Standards  and  Control  (NIBSC)  was  also included as a control.

Theses preparations were compared in antiviral assays in A549 cells and HuH7 cells using EMCV as the  challenge  virus  and  in  a  gene  induction  assay  in  HuH7  cells  measuring  the  induction  of  the interferon sensitive genes for 2', 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2', 5'-OAS) and the human myxovirus resistant protein, MxA, after interferon treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  three  interferon  alfa-2a  preparations  exhibited  antiviral  activity  and  induced  the  interferon sensitive genes 2', 5'-OAS and MxA. This was consistent with the known properties of interferonα -2a.  The  antiviral  activity  of  the  preparations  in  A549  cells  was  nearly  comparable,  but  a  high variability  was  observed  in  the  antiviral  assay  in  HuH7  cells  for  each  preparation.  Furthermore, considerable differences were observed between the potencies of the different preparations in the gene induction assays, again performed in HuH7 cells.

In A549 cells challenged with EMCV the antiviral activity of the three IFNs was nearly comparable. In  contrast,  in  HuH7  cells  challenged  with  EMCV the antiviral activity of each IFN was extremely variable  probably  due  to  difficulties  in  handling  these  cells  and  exclusion  of  many  single  outlier measurements. Therefore, a comparison between the different IFNs was not possible in this assay.

In  the  gene  induction  assay  all  three  preparations  induced  the  IFN-sensitive  genes  2',  5'-OAS  and MxA. However, for each interferon a high variability in the magnitude of gene induction was observed and no comparability between the IFNs could be found.

In conclusion, based on this comparative study no definitive statement on the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A could be made.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics / safety pharmacology

No specific studies on safety pharmacology of Alpheon have been conducted. Several parameters on safety pharmacology (respiratory rate, heart rate ECG) have been measured during the repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys. No major findings were reported.

## Toxicology

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

A repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  female  rhesus  monkeys  comparing  Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  was submitted. This study was a 4-week repeated dose study with an immunological response evaluation in female Rhesus monkeys with a 2-week recovery period. The animals, assigned to 5 groups (3/dosegroup),  received  6  million  IU/kg/dose  (Alpheon  with  preservatives  or  Roferon-A)  or  12  million IU/kg/dose  (Alpheon  in  formulations  with  and  without  preservatives)  or  Alpheon  vehicle  (control group) every other day.

During this study the following parameters were monitored:

- Toxicological investigations (clinical signs, blood parameters)
- Pharmacokinetic parameters: serum IFNα levels
- Biological activity (serum neopterin levels)
- Immune response (anti-IFNα antibody, neutralising capacity)
- Safety pharmacology (breath rate, heart rate, ECG)
- Local tolerance at the injection side

All  monkeys  survived  the  treatment  and  recovery  phase  without  the  occurrence  of  severe  adverse effects.

IFNα was measurable in all animals treated with IFNα -2a (Alpheon or Roferon-A) and the higher dose resulted in higher titers. Some IFNα -like effects were observed, such as the appearance of IFNantibodies and neopterin in serum, slight and transient changes in clinical haematological (decreases in erythrocyte  parameters,  reticulocyte  and  platelet  counts,  increase  in  APTT)  and  clinical  chemistry (ALT, AST increase) parameters, and a lower food consumption.

Signals of differences between Alpheon and Roferon-A regarding the occurrence of single IFNα -2alike  adverse  effects  (food  consumption,  some  clinical  haematology  and  chemistry  values)  were observed during this study. Low food consumption occurred in all treated groups. Whereas the food consumption in Alpheon treated groups was reduced only on single days, in the Roferon-A group low food consumption was observed on several days during the whole study period in all animals. Changes in  clinical  haematological  and  chemistry  values,  such  as  a  decrease  in  platelet  count  and  fibrin, increases  in  APTT,  ALT  and  AST,  were  observed  in  animals  in  the  high  dose  Alpheon  group  (12 million IU/kg/dose) and in animals receiving 6 million IU/kg/dose of Roferon-A, but not in the dose corresponding  Alpheon  group.  Furthermore,  a  higher  plasma  level  of  IFNα was  observed  in  the Alpheon group compared to the dose corresponding Roferon-A group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The low number of animals (3F/group), the use of only female animals, and the high interindividual variability  of  the  data  complicated  the  detection  of  differences  between  Alpheon  and  Roferon-A. Additionally, the time intervals of blood sampling for analysing blood levels of IFNα ,  anti-IFNα -antibodies,  and  neopterin  were  quite  long  and  only  one  dose  group  was  chosen  for  the  comparator product, Roferon-A. This made time-and dose-dependent differences in the occurrence of anti-IFNα antibodies,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  between  Alpheon  and Roferon-A difficult to detect.

Therefore, on the basis of this study no conclusion on the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A could be drawn.

## · Genotoxicity

No genotoxicity studies were required according to the relevant guideline (EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005).

## · Carcinogenicity

No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed.  These  studies  were  not  required  according  to  the ICH/CPMP-Note for Guidance on preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/320/95) and EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

No reproduction toxicity studies were performed with Alpheon. Such studies were not mentioned as a requirement in the Concept paper on similar medicinal products containing alpha-interferon (CHMP/BMWP/7241/2006).  Data  from  published  scientific literature indicated  that interferons affected  male  and  female  fertility  and  induced  abortions  in  monkeys.  Several  case  reports  have described successful pregnancies in women who received interferon-alpha during the first trimester or throughout  gestation.  In  the  light  of  current  scientific  knowledge  it  was  concluded  that  there  was sufficient information on the reproductive toxicity profile to support a relevant statement in the text of the Summary of Product Characteristics for Alpheon.

## · Local tolerance

During the repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys the injection site was examined and was found to have a normal appearance. This indicated that Alpheon was well tolerated at the injection site.

## · Other toxicity studies

A battery of standard toxicity studies was conducted with the HSA-stabilised, lyophilised formulation of Alpheon derived from an earlier manufacturing process. These studies included single and repeated dose toxicity studies in mice and rats, genotoxicity studies (Ames test, chromosome aberration assay and  micronucleus  assay),  reproductive  toxicity  studies  (fertility,  teratogenicity  and  peri/postnatal toxicity)  in  rat  and  rabbits,  acute  skin  and  eye  irritation  studies  in  rabbits  and  antigenicity  studies (PCA test and ASA test) in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.

No mutagenic,  skin  and  eye  irritant,  or  antigenic  potential  of  IFNα -2a  was  observed  during  these studies.

Due  to  the  species  specificity  of  IFNα ,  the  lack  of  pharmacological  response  in  rodents  and  the differences in the  manufacturing processes used to produce the original HSA-stabilised, lyophilised formulation and the Alpheon product intended for marketing, the relevance of these studies for the safety assessment of Alpheon was limited.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Proteins were unlikely to result in significant exposure to the environment and will be consequently of low environmental risk. Thus, no environmental risk assessment was required for Alpheon.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

The applicant submitted an in vitro study which compared the pharmacodynamic activity of Alpheon and Roferon-A in assays of antiviral activity and induction of interferon-sensitive genes 2' 5' OAS and MxA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Insufficient information was submitted on the extent to which the methods used had been previously established and on the analysis of the data.

In  addition,  the  applicant  did  not  provide  a  comprehensive  discussion  of  the  inconsistent  results obtained and did not adequately address the differences shown among the three preparations.

In particular whereas the antiviral activity of the preparations in A549 cells was nearly comparable, a high variability in the data was observed in the antiviral assay in HuH7 cells for each preparation.

In the gene induction assay the applicant could demonstrate that both interferons as well as the NIBSC reference  standard  induced  2',  5'-OAS  and  MxA  genes.  However,  for  each  preparation  a  high variability  in  the  magnitude  of  the  gene  induction  was  observed.  In  conclusion,  based  on  this comparative study no definitive statement on the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A could be made.

The applicant submitted a 4-week repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys. Since the development programme  of  Alpheon  preceded  the  publication  of  the Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical issues  (EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005 ), the design of this study did not meet the criteria of a comparability study. According to the guideline, non-clinical studies conducted for the investigation of comparability  should  be  used  to  highlight  differences  between  the  product  proposed  for  marketing authorisation and the reference product and should be designed to detect differences in response and not  just  the  response  per  se.  The  applicant  had  justified  the  development  programme  through  the process.

During  the  4-week  repeated  dose  study  toxicity  in  monkeys  some  signals  of  differences  between Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  regarding  the  occurrence  of  single  IFNα -2a-related  adverse  effects  (food consumption, some clinical haematology and chemistry values) were observed. Furthermore, a higher plasma  level  of  IFNα was  observed  in  the  Alpheon  group  compared  to  the  dose  corresponding Roferon-A group.

The study had a number of deficiencies,  such  as  the  low  number  of  animals  used,  the  use  of  only female animals, the long time intervals and number of blood sampling for analysing IFNα , antibody, and neopterin levels, and the dose levels and use of only one dose group for the comparator product, Roferon-A.

The non-clinical data submitted did not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn regarding the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A.

## 3.4  Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The applicant submitted three comparative clinical trials  with  Alpheon  and the  reference  medicinal product Roferon-A:

- BP-IFN-001  and  BP-IFN-005  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  a  comparable  pharmacokinetic profile of Alpheon and Roferon-A. Study BP-IFN-005 was also performed to assess pharmacodynamic comparability.
- Study BP-IFN-002, was an open-label, multicentre, centrally randomised, parallel-group phase III trial to demonstrate the comparable efficacy and safety of Alpheon and Roferon-A. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparability was also assessed in this study.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

A  GCP  inspection  of Study BP-IFN-002 was  performed.  Although  this  inspection revealed  some potential issues the applicant provided satisfactory assurance that the overall validity of the study data was not compromised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

No studies on pharmacokinetics (Absorption / Distribution /Elimination; dose proportionality and time dependencies;  special populations; pharmacokinetic  interaction studies;  pharmacokinetics  using human biomaterials) were required according the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues (EMEA/CPMP/42832/05).

## · Study BP-IFN-001 (comparison of Alpheon and Roferon-A)

Study BP-IFN-001 was an open study performed with the Roferon-A. The reference product had a different pharmaceutical form and a different strength and had to be refilled at the study site.

The  evaluation  of  data  showed  supra-bioavailability  of  Alpheon  over  the  reference  product.  The evaluation  of  the  reasons  for  supra-bioavailability  revealed  a  period  effect  in  the  Alpheon  group. However, there was no carry-over effect because baseline concentrations were always under the limit of quantification and it could also be shown that there was only a slight sequence effect that was not statistically significant. Analytical errors were also excluded by re-analysis of plasma samples .

The Applicant concluded that that the ambiguous results of the  study  were  suggestive  of  problems with the conduct of the study itself.

The  results  of  this  study  did  not  support  a  conclusion  of  comparable  pharmacokinetics  between Alpheon and the reference product.

## · Study BP-IFN-005 (comparison of Alpheon and Roferon-A)

As a consequence of the above, the applicant performed a second comparative pharmacokinetic study. The study  design  was  different  from  the  design  of  the  first  study  in  various  aspects:  double  blind, sampling times were slightly different, the wash-out phase was extended to 12 days (instead of 7), and the same pharmaceutical form and strength of the test product and the reference products was used.

The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of the geometric means of AUC(0-∞ ), AUC(0-36) and  C max were contained within the range 80-125%.

|            |    | Ratio Alpheon / Roferon-As%   | Ratio Alpheon / Roferon-As%   |
|------------|----|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Parameter  | N  | Estimate                      | 90% confidence interval       |
| AUC(0- ∞ ) | 25 | 105.78%                       | (101%,111%)                   |
| AUC(0-36)  | 27 | 107.67%                       | (103%,112%)                   |
| Cmax       | 27 | 114.62%                       | (110%,119%)                   |
| Tmax       | 27 | 0h                            | (-1.0h,+0.96h)                |

The  statistical  analysis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data  detected  a  significant  period  effect,  for  both compounds, with higher values for period 2, probably indicative of a carry-over effect.

This  study  supported  a  conclusion  of  comparable  pharmacokinetics  between  Alpheon  and  the reference product.

## · Study BP-IFN-002 (comparison of Alpheon and Roferon-A)

Within the clinical study BP-IFN-002, the Applicant planned to perform an analysis of pharmacokinetics for the test and reference formulation. However, this evaluation was not possible, as the  serum  concentration  data  exhibited  marked  variability,  not  only  between,  but  also  within individual  patient  profiles.  In  addition,  implausible  results  were  obtained  in  a  number  of  patients (unquantifiable concentrations, very high concentrations at all time-points).

Due to the small sample sizes (21 and 19 patients in the Alpheon and Roferon-A group, respectively) these pharmacokinetic data could not support a conclusion of comparable pharmacokinetics between Alpheon and the reference product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Study BP-IFN-005 (comparison of Alpheon and Roferon-A)

Study  BP-IFN-005  was  also  performed  to  assess  pharmacodynamic  equivalence.  The  parameters chosen for this assessment were: Beta-2-microglobulin, 2'5'-Oligo-adenylate-synthetase (2'5'-OAS), and neopterin, which were unspecific parameters of the pharmacodynamic effects of interferons. The measured levels for these parameters were corrected for the baseline endogenous levels by subtracting the  mean  of  the  measured  concentrations  in  the  pre-dose  samples.  The  following  tables  give  an overview of the results of these investigations:

|                      |              |           | Alpheon    | Alpheon   | Roferon    | Roferon   |

## Summary of the statistical comparisons for pharmacodynamic parameters in study

|                    |              | Ratio Alpheon / Roferon-As%   | Ratio Alpheon / Roferon-As%   |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|                    | Parameter    | Estimate                      | 90% confidence interval       |
| Neopterin          | AUC (0-t z ) | 99.87%                        | (93%, 107%)                   |
| Neopterin          | C max        | 105.44%                       | (100%, 112%)                  |
| β 2 -microglobulin | AUC (0-t z ) | 93.95%                        | (83%, 106%)                   |
| β 2 -microglobulin | C max        | 98.60%                        | (92%, 105%)                   |
| 2'5' OAS           | AUC (0-t z ) | 97.74%                        | (84%, 114%)                   |
| 2'5' OAS           | C max        | 95.66%                        | (83%, 110%)                   |

The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratios  of  the  AUC  and  Cmax  values  determined  were  wholly contained  within  the  80-125%  equivalence  range.  For  AUC  (0-t)  higher  values  were  observed  for neopterin and for 2'5'OAS in period 1 compared to period 2 and for ß2-microglobulin in period 2 compared to period 1.

## · Study BP-IFN-002 (comparison of Alpheon and Roferon-A)

Pharmacodynamic equivalence was also assessed in the clinical efficacy and safety study BP-IFN-002. Blood samples were taken from 18 vs. 20 patients. Two selected markers (Beta-2-microglobulin and neopterin)  were  determined  to  characterise  comparable  pharmacodynamics  in  the  target  population. The point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the AUC and Cmax were well within the pre-specified boundaries of bioequivalence (80-125%) for ß-2-microglobulin. However, consistently higher values were obtained for neopterin, thus pharmacodynamic equivalence could not be unequivocally concluded for this parameter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacodynamic data seem to indicate the similarity of the two compounds tested. An overall conclusion  on  pharmacodynamic  equivalence,  however,  has  to  consider  the  results  of  the  clinical study, which investigated the most valuable pharmacodynamic parameter, viral response.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study

No studies were required according to EMEA/CPMP/42832/05.

- Main study

Study  BP-IFN-002,  was  an  open-label,  multi-centre,  centrally  randomised,  parallel-group  phase  III trial.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Male  and  female  patients,  18-70  years  of  age,  with  a  positive  serum  anti-HCV  antibody  (Ab) screening assay, HCV-RNA serum positive and elevated ALT (&gt;1,5 ULN) were enrolled. Liver biopsy had to have been obtained within 12 months of study start, and histology had to show chronic active viral hepatitis with no evidence of cirrhosis.

## Treatments

Patients received Interferon alpha-2a at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (TIW) s.c. Alpheon was administered with the multi-dose vials (3 ml with 18 million IU corresponding to 6 million IU/ml) intended  for  marketing.  The  reference  product  Roferon-A  was  administered  in  the  pharmaceutical form of pen-cartridges containing 18 million IU in 0.6 ml (corresponding to 30 million IU/ml).

## Objectives

The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  demonstrate  the  comparable  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of Alpheon and Roferon-A monotherapy in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis C.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  rate  of  treatment  responders  (defined  as  patients  with undetectable HCV-RNA) after 12 weeks of treatment.

Secondary  endpoints  were:  the  rate  of  treatment  responders  after  24,  48  (end-of-treatment)  and  72 weeks (6-months after end of treatment); the rate of sustained virological response (SVR), 6 months after  the  end  of  treatment.  Biochemical  response  after  12,  24,  48  and  72  weeks  and  histological response after  48  weeks  were  further  secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  These  secondary  analyses  were only conducted for those patients with a response after 12 weeks of treatment.

## Sample size

The sample size calculation stated in the protocol (or the protocol amendment No. 1) estimated the required size of the study to be 200 patients per treatment arm. However, the study report indicated that the number to be screened was 400 and the number to be randomised was 360.

The  sample  size  of  the  study  and  the  associated  calculations  seemed  adequate;  in  particular,  the assumed delta of ±15% for the three-month responder rate could be considered appropriate. However, the protocol assumed the calculation of 90% confidence intervals for the difference in responder rates, which  did  not  correspond  to  the  postulated  overall  significance  level  of  5%.  However,  in  the  final evaluation of the trial appropriate confidence intervals (95%) were presented.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was performed centrally with stratification according to genotype (1 and non-1). The randomisation list was generated using the method of random permuted blocks. A separate random scheme  was  generated  for  each  stratum.  Blocks  of  randomisation  numbers  within  each  of  the  two strata ('Genotype 1' and 'Genotype other') were allocated for each site.

Randomisation also led to a balanced allocation with regard to viral load.

## Blinding (masking)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study BP-IFN-002 was an open study. Due to the very different appearances of the two preparations, it was decided that blinding was not possible.

## Statistical methods

The  main  analysis  of  the  study  was  based  on  the  estimation  of  the  12  weeks  rate  of  HCV-RNA negativity with the calculation of two sided 95% confidence intervals. This interval was expected to lie within a delta of ± 15%.

Patients with major protocol deviations, incomplete documentation, less than 80% study drug intake or premature  termination  due  to  reasons  not  related  to  study  medication  were  excluded  from  the  perprotocol (PP) population.

All randomised patients treated with study medication that had at least one post-baseline evaluation of the primary efficacy variable available were included in the intend-to treat (ITT) population.

The safety data set consisted of all patients that took the study medication at least once.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

## Recruitment

There was a high rate of screening failures; of the 887 patients screened, 455 were included into the study. The main reasons for exclusion were not meeting exclusion/ inclusion criteria. However, the demographics of included and excluded patients were roughly similar.

There  were  22  centres  and  the  number  of  recruited  patients  varied  from  4  (1.0%)  in  the  smallest centres, up to 35 (8.6%) in the biggest centres.

## Conduct of the study

Patients were seen for the screening visit and baseline visit, and then at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 72. Efficacy assessments were performed at week 12, 24, 48 (end of treatment) and 72 (end of 6month observation period). Safety evaluations were performed at each visit (antibody formation was determined at week 24, 48, and 72).

## Baseline data

The age of the randomised patients ranged from 18 to 63 years, with most patients between 22 and 34 years old. All patients except one in the Alpheon group, who was Asian, were of Caucasian origin. All other baseline demographic data were comparable between the groups, including the distribution of viral genotype.

## Numbers analysed

There were 455 patients randomised: 453 patients were included in the safety and ITT populations and 421 in the per-protocol population.

Alpheon and Roferon-A were comparable in terms of the main virological and biochemical endpoints. In addition, the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses yielded almost identical results, indicating that the main efficacy analyses were robust.

Liver  biopsies  were  performed  at  week  48  in  88  (38.6%)  patients  in  the  Alpheon  and  82  (36.4%) patients in the Roferon-A group (intention to treat analysis). The mean change of stage in comparison to screening biopsy up to week 48 was -0.87 in the Alpheon group, and -0.93 in the Roferon-A group for the PP set and -0.88 and -0.90 for the ITT set. This translated into an 'improvement rate' (patients with a decrease of 1 and more stages) of 22.9% and 21.3% in the PP set, and 21.5% and 21.3% in the ITT set for the Alpheon and Roferon-A groups, respectively, An analysis of the grading of the liver biopsies was not performed during the study.

## Ancillary analyses

An analysis was performed for the relapse rate between the end of treatment (week 48), and the end of the observation period (week 72).

## Relapse rate between the end of treatment and the end of observation period

|                                                                      | Alpheon      | Roferon-A   |   p-value |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Number of relapsers (relating to the whole study population)         | 23/228 10.1% | 8/225 3.6%  |     0.008 |
| Number of relapsers (related to the number of responders at week 48) | 23/97 23.7%  | 8/80 10.0%  |     0.02  |

This analysis revealed an overall rate of late relapses of 23 (10.1%) and 8 (3.6%) in the Alpheon and Roferon-A  groups,  respectively.  Since  this  represented  a  clinically  relevant  and  a  statistically significant difference (p=0.008), the applicant was requested to explore the reasons for this finding.

The  following  factors  were  investigated:  gender,  age,  weight,  height,  and  body-mass-index  for  the demographic factors, antibody status, viral genotype, and baseline viral load.

There were no relevant differences in the patient groups regarding demographic factors at any time point, neither in the whole study population nor in the 'patients with late relapse' group.

A positive correlation between anti-interferon antibodies and 'late relapse' could not be found. Thus antibody formation was highly unlikely to have contributed to the higher relapse rates in the Alpheon group.

The applicant also explored the correlation of genotype and viral load at baseline and 'late relapse' subset.  The  following  table  gives  the  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  performed  according  the genotype at inclusion.

No  significant  imbalance  at  baseline  regarding  the  genotype  distribution  for  the  patients  with  late relapse could be shown.

The following table shows the results for the responder rates in the genotype 1 patients only:

| Responders Genotype 1   | Alpheon   | Alpheon   | Roferon-A   | Roferon-A   | Overall   | Overall   |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Evaluable population    | n=81      | %         | n=77        | %           | n=147     | %         |
| Week 12                 | 27        | 35.1      | 26          | 35.6        | 53        | 35.3      |
| Week 24                 | 20        | 26.0      | 18          | 24.7        | 28        | 25.3      |
| Week 48                 | 18        | 23.4      | 15          | 20.5        | 28        | 25.3      |
| Week 72                 | 10        | 12.3      | 17          | 22.1        | 26        | 17.3      |

A 10% difference in SVR for genotype 1 infected patients was observed at Week 72. Moreover, only 30% of the patients included in the clinical study were of genotype 1, compared to ca. 60% in other clinical trials in Hepatitis C and an average 60% infection rate with genotype 1 across Europe (with variable  rates  in  different  countries  between  40%  and  over  95%).  The  low  number  of  genotype  1 patients included raised doubts about the robustness and external validity of the study.

Furthermore,  the  submitted  data  could  not  substantiate  the  argument  that  the  late  relapse  rate  was associated with a high virus load at baseline, since no significant imbalance regarding the viral load for the patients with late relapse could be shown.

In conclusion, no imbalance regarding baseline factors between the groups leading to the differences in sustained virological response could be identified.

## · Discussion on efficacy

The objectives of the efficacy study were to demonstrate comparable clinical efficacy of Alpheon and Roferon-A in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis C.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  the  rate  of  treatment  responders  (defined  as  patients  with undetectable  HCV-RNA)  after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  Secondary  endpoints  were  the  virological

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

response rate at weeks 24, 48 and 72; the biochemical response rate at weeks 12, 24, 48 and 72; and the histological response at week 48.

In  all  of  these  secondary  parameters  comparable  efficacy  between  Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  was demonstrated even though separate non-inferiority margins were not defined in advance. However, the 15%  margin  as  defined  for  the  primary  endpoint  was  met  in  almost  all  evaluations  regarding virological and biochemical response.

A clinically and statistically significant difference (p=0.008) in relapse rate between end of therapy and end of observation period (at 72 weeks) was observed. The applicant explored the reasons for late relapse  in  these  patients.  No  factors  present  at  baseline  contributing  to  this  difference  could  be identified.  The  applicant  stated  that  since  Alpheon  was  comparable  to  Roferon-A  in  terms  of  the primary  and  the  secondary  endpoints  this  difference  should  not  be  regarded  as  being  of  clinical concern and it was implausible that this disparity in relapse rate after week 48, which was not a prespecified efficacy endpoint, was related to differences in the two interferons.

However, uncertainties remained about the observed difference in relapse rate after week 48.  It was therefore  concluded  that  the  results  presented  did  not  support  comparable  clinical  efficacy  between Alpheon and Roferon-A.

The differences in the virological response rates at week 72 in patients with genotype 1 (the 'difficult to  treat'  patients)  were  also  of  clinical  concern.  For  this  subpopulation,  it  was  stated  that  the  'zero relapse'  rate  in  the  Roferon-A  group  was  an  extraordinary  finding  and  the  virological  response  at week 72 observed in the Alpheon group was as expected and consistent with the literature. However, with the low numbers in this study - only 30% of the patients included in the clinical trial BP-IFN-002 were  of  genotype  1,  as  opposed  to  ca.  60%  in  other  clinical  trials  in  hepatitis  C  -  no  reliable conclusions  could  be  drawn.  Furthermore,  it  had  to  be  acknowledged  that  within  the  clinical  study there were quite a lot of exceptional results with Roferon-A and with Alpheon due to the fact that the patient  population  was  of  a  very  young  age  and  consisted  of  a  high  percentage  of  patients  infected with genotype non-1 virus. With the low rate of included genotype 1 patients - putting the overall validity and robustness of the data into question - a 10% difference in SVR for this subgroup had to be considered clinically relevant and did not allow a clear conclusion to be reached on the comparable clinical efficacy of Alpheon and Roferon-A.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

Two  single-dose  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  studies  with  the  exposure  of  56  healthy  male volunteers were included in the dossier (Studies BP-IFN-001, and BP-IFN-005).

The clinical study BP-IFN-002 comprised 455 patients with a mean study duration of 336.6 and 337.0 days  of  treatment  in  the  Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  groups  in  patients  completing  the  study.  The treatment duration for those patients withdrawn prematurely was 135.0 and 132.8 days for Alpheon and Roferon-A, respectively. The figures for the 'time in study' were 508.9 and 508.3 days for the patients completing the study, and 297.2, and 293.1 days for those that were prematurely withdrawn. All patients were treated with a dose of 3 million IU three times a week. The number of missed doses and the number of dose reductions was low.

- Adverse events
- ¾ Healthy volunteers

The total number of adverse events (AEs) in study BP-IFN-001 was 42 and 34 during treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A respectively. All of these events were assessed as being possibly or probably related to the treatment. No deaths and no serious AEs were reported during this study.

The total number of AEs reported in study BP-IFN-005 was 256 of which 125 events occurred in 26 subjects in the Alpheon group and 131 events in 27 subjects occurred in the Roferon-A group. 83% of these events were assessed as being probably related to the application of the drug. No deaths and no serious events occurred during the course of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ¾ Study BP-IFN-002

A total  of  1,444  AEs  were  reported  in  391  patients.  Of  these,  777  events  occurred  in  203  (89.0%) patients in the Alpheon group and 667 in 188 (83.6%) patients in the Roferon-A group.

The large majority of adverse events were of mild intensity (512 in the Alpheon group vs. 455 events in the Roferon-A group). Of the remainder, 252 vs. 198 events were of moderate intensity, 7 vs. 10 events were of severe intensity and no intensity was specified in the case of 6 vs. 4 events.

Of all the adverse events, 34 vs. 37 events were unlikely related, 118 vs. 79 events were not related, 132 vs. 105 events were possibly related while 493 vs. 445 events were probably related to treatment. Of the remaining events, 0 vs. 1 event was reported as not assessed.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No deaths were reported during the conduct of the study. Altogether, 10 serious adverse events were reported  in  7  vs.  2  patients  during  the  active  treatment  phase  of  the  study.  Three  events  in  2  vs.  1 patients occurred during the screening phase of the study. All events were considered not related to the study medication.

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory changes considered as clinically relevant were reported in 114 patients (63 patients in the Alpheon group and 51 patients in the Roferon group). In these patients 453 events were reported.

With regard to the other parameters no consistent pattern of laboratory differences could be shown that was  to  the  advantage  or  the  disadvantage  of  one  or  the  other  drug.  No  relevant  changes  and  no differences between the treatment function screening tests were seen.

## · Immunogenicity

The  formation  of  binding  antibodies  was  investigated  at  baseline,  after  24,  48,  and  72  weeks  of treatment, using a commercial available test kit.

The  number  of  patients  that  were  positive  for  anti-interferon  alfa  antibodies  was  similar  in  both groups. The absolute rate of antibody formation tended to be higher in the Roferon-A group at all time points.  The  differences  in  the  rate  of  antibody  formation  during  treatment  between  the  two  groups tended to increase until the end of treatment at week 48, whereas the difference levelled out slightly after  cessation  of  therapy.  The  applicant  provided  the  one-sided  95%  confidence  limit  for  the difference in the proportions of patients with anti-interferon alfa antibodies at week 24 with the lower end given as -3.26% indicating non-inferiority (delta = 15%).

Regarding  the  validation  of  the  methods  used  for  the  detection  of  antibodies,  the  applicant  had  no access  to  the  original  validation  data  and  had  not  performed  any  pre-validation  experiments  before starting the relevant studies. Thus comprehensive validation data for the commercial available ELISA (MDS) were not provided. Instead the applicant presented results from a post validation study. The validation experiments included: specificity, precision (repeatability, intermediate precision),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

determination  of  detection  limit  and  quantification  limit  and  short  term  stability  and  freeze  thaw stability  of  serum  samples.  The  analytical  results  were,  with  the  exception  for  linearity,  within  the acceptance  criteria  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  The  applicant  concluded  that  the  double antigen  enzyme  immunoassay  system  was  adequate  for  the  determination  of  anti-Interferon-alpha antibodies  by  the  ELISA  applied.    However,  the  applicant  failed  to  exclude  that  depending  on  the antibody  concentration  false  negative  results  might  occur,  which  would  appear  to  be  an  intrinsic disadvantage of the double antigen enzyme immunoassay system.

In addition, the data provided for the post study validation were not a complete assay validation but more an assay qualification.

An additional analysis was performed for the 70 vs. 78 patients who had anti-IFN alpha-2a antibodies reported at least once and who also had an adverse event. This analysis did not reveal any clinically relevantly different pattern of adverse events in comparison to the rest of the study population

The  applicant,  contrary  to  the  Scientific  Advice  received,  only  reports  the  occurrence  of  binding antibodies in the population under investigation.

No  other  parameters  of  immunological  nature,  such  as  mean  titres  of  antibodies  (binding  and neutralising, and overall) were reported.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuation due to adverse events was reported in 3 vs. 3 patients in the Alpheon and Roferon-A group.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No studies were required according to EMEA/CPMP/42832/05.

- Discussion on clinical safety

In the clinical study BP-IFN-002 no unexpected events were seen, and the events were regarded as being typical for this kind of medication. However, there was a slightly higher (and almost statistically significant (chi-square test shows a p-value of 0.09)) incidence of adverse events in the Alpheon group compared to the Roferon-A group.

The  applicant  attributed  the  differential  rate  of  reporting  to  the  open  study  design  -  the  open-label study  design  could  have  introduced  a  bias  since  patients  in  the  Alpheon  group  knew  they  were receiving an experimental drug and they may have been more likely to report adverse events.

However, the differences in adverse event rates were mirrored for laboratory related adverse events judged as clinically relevant by the investigators. These events amount to 146 and 104 (when counting the events only once per patient), or 257 and 196 (when counting all reported events) in the Alpheon and  Roferon-A  groups,  respectively.  The  first  of  these  figures  amounts  to  a  highly  statistically significant difference when related to the whole safety population (p&lt;0.001; Fisher's exact test).

Although the available immunogenicity data for Alpheon and Roferon A were comparable, the method used was not fully validated and did not sufficiently exclude false negative results. The overall extent of  investigations  regarding  immunogenicity  did  not  fully  comply  with  the Guideline  on  similar biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  nonclinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CPMP/42832/05), as only the binding properties of the antibodies was investigated.

Despite the applicants arguments there was still uncertainty about the safety and immunogenicity data generated in the pivotal clinical study, which did not allow a clear conclusion to be made regarding the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A.

## 3.5  Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time.

## 3.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

The  applicant,  BioPartners  GmbH,  submitted  an  application  for  Marketing  Authorisation  to  the European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  Alpheon,  under  the  legal  basis  of  Similar  Biological Medicinal Product. The reference medicinal product for this application was Roferon-A Solution for Injection, a recombinant interferon alfa 2a containing product expressed in E. coli produced by Roche. Alpheon was claimed to be similar to this reference medicinal product as approved in the Community.

## Quality

The  assays  where  product  related  impurities  have  been  investigated  indicated  that  Alpheon  and Roferon-A  display  a  different  impurity  profile.  The  precise  nature,  biological  properties,  and  the qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  the  different  impurities  had  not  been  fully  studied. Differences in the stability profile also required investigation.

It  was  therefore  concluded  that  the  data  comparing  the  two  drug  products  were  incomplete  and inconclusive.  Issues  regarding  the  samples  of  Alpheon  used  (currently  no  validated  manufacturing process) and the impact of sample preparation (concentration procedures and presence of excipients) on the analytical methods were unresolved.

As a consequence of the deficiencies set out above and the quantitative and qualitative differences in the impurity profile, no conclusion regarding the comparability of Alpheon and Roferon-A based upon the quality data currently available could be reached.

The  company  was  unable  to  fully  validate  the  drug  product  production  process  for  Alpheon, consequently there was insufficient assurance of control and consistency of the manufacturing process.

No stability data representative for the intended commercial drug product were available and a shelf life could not be assigned. The drug substance stability data were also insufficient.

In  addition,  the  applicant  was  unable  to  satisfactorily  address  the  comparability  of  the  clinical  trial material  with  the  drug  product  produced  from  the  intended  commercial  process.  The  task  was hampered by the lack of validation of analytical methods used as well as validation of the production process.

Furthermore,  the  applicant  provided  a  retrospective  analysis  of  the  clinical  stability  samples  versus consistency lots as part of the comparability exercise. However, no conclusion could be drawn from these experiments with aged samples due to the lack of data on the stability profile of Alpheon.

Reliable  release  data  proving  comparability  of  clinical  and  the  recent  batches  in  terms  of  related substances  were  not  available.  Therefore  uncertainties  remained  regarding  the  comparability  of  the clinical trial material with the proposed commercial medicinal product.

Other concerns raised during the assessment process also remained unresolved.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  applicant  submitted  the  results  of  an in  vitro study,  which  compared  the  pharmacodynamic activity of Alpheon and Roferon-A in assays of antiviral activity and induction of interferon-sensitive genes 2' 5' OAS and MxA. For A549 cells the antiviral activity of each preparation was comparable, however, a high variability was observed in the second antiviral assay (using HuH7 cells). In the gene induction assay the applicant could demonstrate that both interferons as well as the reference standard induced  2',  5'-OAS  and  MxA  genes.  However,  for  each  preparation  a  high  variability  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

magnitude of the gene induction was observed. On the basis of these data no decision on the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A could be drawn.

The applicant submitted a 4-week repeated dose study toxicity in monkeys. Since the development programme for  Alpheon  preceded  the  publication  of  the Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical issues  (EMEA/CHMP/42832/2005 ),  the design  of  this  study  did  not  meet  the  current  criteria  of  a comparability study. According to the guideline, non-clinical studies conducted for the investigation of comparability  should  be  used  to  highlight  differences  between  the  product  proposed  for  marketing authorisation and the reference product and should be designed to detect differences in response and not just the response per se. The applicant had justified the development program through the process.

During  the  4-week  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  some  signals  of  differences  between Alpheon and Roferon-A regarding the occurrence of IFNα -2a-related adverse effects were observed. Furthermore, a higher plasma level of IFNα could be observed in the Alpheon group compared to the dose corresponding Roferon-A group.

The non-clinical data submitted did not allow a clear conclusion to be reached regarding the similarity of Alpheon and Roferon-A.

## Efficacy

Alpheon  and  Roferon-A  were  shown  to  have  comparable  pharmacokinetics  in  one  comparative pharmacokinetic study (study BP-IFN-005).

Data  from  two  further  pharmacokinetic  studies  did  not  support  a  conclusion  of  pharmacokinetic comparability between Alpheon and Roferon-A. Data from study BP-IFN-001 were invalid and the pharmacokinetic  data  obtained  from  the  target  population  in  the  clinical  study  BP-IFN-002  were inconclusive.

A comparable  virological  response  was  observed  in  Hepatitis  C  patients  treated  with  Alpheon  and Roferon-A at Week 12 weeks (primary endpoint), Week 24, Week 48 week (end of treatment) and Week  72  (end  of  6-month  observation  period).  Similar  results  were  observed  for  biochemical response.

However,  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  difference  (p=0.008)  in  virological  relapse  rate between  end  of  therapy  (week  48)  and  the  end  of  the  6-month  observation  period  (week  72)  was observed as well as differences in the SVR for the 'difficult-to-treat' genotype 1 patients.

Overall, there was still uncertainty about the comparable clinical efficacy of Alpheon and Roferon-A, which prevented a clear conclusion being made regarding the similarity of the two products.

## Safety

There  was  a  slightly  higher  (and  almost  statistically  significant  (chi-square  test  shows  a  p-value  of 0.09)  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  the  Alpheon  group  compared  to  the  Roferon-A  group.  The differences  in  adverse  event  rates  were  mirrored  for  laboratory  related  adverse  events  judged  as clinically relevant by the investigators. Therefore, from the safety data generated in the pivotal clinical study,  clinical  comparability  of  the  two  compounds  from  the  safety  point  of  view  could  not  be concluded.

As far as immunogenicity was concerned, although the available data did show comparable results for Alpheon and Roferon A, the investigation itself had been incompletely validated and the assay used did not exclude false negative results. Moreover, within the validation data differences between the two compounds were found.

The  overall  extent  of  investigations  regarding  immunogenicity  does  not  fully  comply  with  the Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as active  substance:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues (EMEA/CPMP/42832/05)  as  only  the  binding properties of the antibodies had been investigated during the study. The requested post hoc evaluation of  neutralising  properties  of  the  antibodies  could  only  be  performed  in  a  very  small  number  of samples.

Therefore,  the  investigations  on  immunogenicity  were  not  fully  validated  and  do  not  support  a conclusion of comparable immunogenicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk-benefit assessment

Based upon the remaining major quality issues and the resulting clinical uncertainties Alpheon cannot be  concluded  as  being  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product  to  Roferon  A,  the  chosen  reference medicinal product. Therefore based on the data submitted the benefit/risk balance was not considered to be positive.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that the risk-benefit balance of Alpheon  in  the treatment of Adult patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C who are positive for HCV antibodies or HCV RNA and have elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) without liver decompensation was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation.

## GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL

## Whereas

With regard to Quality a large number of outstanding issues remain. The major objections were as follows:

## Comparability of Alpheon versus Roferon-A

-As a consequence of the deficiencies identified and quantitative and qualitative differences in the impurity profile a conclusion on the comparability of Alpheon and Roferon-A based on the quality dossier cannot be reached.

## For the drug substance

-Insufficient  stability  data  representative  of  the  drug  substance  were  available  and  a  shelf  life cannot be assigned.

## For the drug product

-The manufacturing process for Alpheon has not been adequately validated.

-Insufficient stability data representative of the intended commercial drug product were available and a shelf life cannot be assigned.

Clinical comparability of Alpheon versus Roferon-A has not adequately been demonstrated. This relates to:

- Clinically and statistically significant difference in virological relapse rates found between the end of therapy and the end of the observation period.
- Inconclusive data in the response rate for the 'difficult-to-treat' genotype 1 patients.
- The inadequate immunogenicity documentation because of the incomplete validation of the assays and methods used (and the consequent insufficient exclusion of false negative results and the factual differences observed in the detection of anti-interferon antibodies).
- Different rate of adverse events and the laboratory-related events judged as clinically relevant.

Due to the remaining major objections regarding quality and differences identified between Alpheon and  Roferon-A  in  the  quality  and  clinical  comparability  exercise,  comparable  quality,  efficacy  and safety of Alpheon and Roferon-A has not been adequately demonstrated.

the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Alpheon.
