## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies)

The formulation used in the clinical studies is the currently approved formulation.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted final reports for:

- -6096A1-010;  A  phase  2,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind  trial  evaluating  the safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  a  13-  valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Korea
- -6096A1-3009; A phase 3, open-label, single-arm trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity  of  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in  healthy  infants  given  with routine pediatric vaccinations in Mexico.

## 2. Clinical studies

6096A1-010;  A  phase  2,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind  trial  evaluating  the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 13- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Korea

-  Description
-  Methods
-  Objective(s)

Assess  pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  relative  to  those  induced  by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant series (primary objective) and 1 month after the toddler dose (secondary objective).

The safety objective was to evaluate acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the rates of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs.

-  Study design

Study 6096A1-010 was a phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter trial conducted to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC compared with 7vPnC in healthy infants when administered with routine pediatric vaccines in Korea.

Blood samples were to be obtained from all subjects 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the third dose in the infant series and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. For each blood sample, serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations were to be determined for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes in 13vPnC (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

##  Study population /Sample size

With  a  type  I  error  of  0.05  (2-sided),  75  evaluable  subjects  per  treatment  group  allowed estimation of the proportion of subjects achieving an antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each  serotype  to  be  within  ±7.3%  precision.  Assuming  a  dropout  rate  of  at  most  15%, enrollment of 180 subjects would ensure 150 evaluable subjects.

##  Treatments

Each  subject  was  to  receive  1  dose  (0.5  mL)  of  either  13vPnC  or  7vPnC  at  each  of  the  4 vaccination visits (2-, 4-, 6-, and 12-month visits). Diptheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC or 7vPnC at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. In addition,  inactivated  poliovirus  vaccine  (IPV)  and  Haemophilus  influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine were to be administered 7 to 21 days after each dose of 13vPnC or 7vPnC during the infant series, and hepatitis B virus vaccine (HBV) was to be administered 7 to 21 days after dose 3. No concomitant vaccines were to be administered with the toddler dose (12month visit).

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples for determination of serum antibody concentrations were to be drawn 1 month (28 to 42 days) after dose 3 of the infant series and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on these samples to measure the serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes(1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).

Safety assessments were based on information obtained from AE monitoring throughout the study and from the daily monitoring and recording of local reactions and systemic events (including the use of antipyretic  medication)  by  the  parent(s)/legal  guardian(s)  in  an  e-diary  for  4  days  after  each vaccination (day 1 through day 4). For any local reaction or systemic event that persisted on day 4, the e-diary prompted the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) on a daily basis regarding the status of the local reaction or systemic event until the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) recorded an end date in the e-diary. If the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) did not record an end date, the investigator was asked to record the end  date  on  the  CRF  Symptom  Resolved  Dates  page.  For  all  local  reaction  or  systemic  event  that persisted on day 4, the investigator was to record the end date on the CRF Symptom Resolved Dates page.

##  Statistical Methods

All statistical analyses for this study were descriptive, and any comparisons between the 13vPnC and 7vPnC  groups  were  descriptive.  All  immunogenicity  analyses  were  performed  using  the  subjects' random  vaccine  assignment,  regardless  of  the  vaccine  actually  administered.  Missing  values  were excluded  from  the  immunogenicity  analyses;  no  imputation  or  estimation  of  missing  values  was performed.  Pneumococcal  assay  values  reported  in  the  database  as  being  below  the  limit  of quantification (BLQ) (ie, reported as a text value \"BLQ\", or a reported numeric value below the lower limit  of  quantification)  were  adjusted  to  one-half  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  for  analysis. Indeterminate values were not assigned a numerical value.

Within each vaccine group and for each pneumococcal serotype separately, the proportion of subjects achieving serum IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL (the proportion of responders) was computed, and the exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% confidence interval (CI) on the proportion was calculated. To assess  differences  between  the  2  vaccine  groups  for  each  of  the  13  serotypes,  the  difference  in proportions (13PnC - 7vPnC) was calculated. For each of the 6 additional serotypes, the difference in proportions (13PnC - 7vPnC reference) was also calculated using the lowest proportion of responders in  the  7vPnC group among those for the 7 common serotypes as the 7vPnC reference value. Exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% CIs on the difference in proportions were computed using the procedure of Chan and Zhang,27 using the standardized test statistic and gamma=0.000001.

For  each  pneumococcal  serotype,  geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  of  pneumococcal  IgG antibodies were calculated, and 2-sided, 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results  computed  using  the  Student  t distribution.  To  assess  differences  between  vaccine  groups,  the  ratios  of  the  GMCs  (13vPnC/7vPnC) were calculated and 2-sided, 95% CIs for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) were computed using the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Student  t  distribution  for  the  mean  difference  of  the  measures  on  the  log  scale.  For  each  of  the  6 additional  serotypes,  the  ratio  of  the  GMCs  (13vPnC/7vPnC  reference)  was  also  analyzed  using  the lowest  GMC  in  the  7vPnC  group  among  those  for  the  7  common  serotypes  as  the  7vPnC  reference value.

Empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) are presented graphically by vaccine group for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 180 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 13vPnC (N=91) or 7vPnC (N=89).

In  the  13vPnC  group,  3  subjects  who  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  were  not  vaccinated because the parents/legal guardians decided not to participate in the study. Thus, 88 subjects (96.7%) in the 13vPnC group were vaccinated at dose 1; 86 (94.5%) received dose 2; and 85 (93.4%) received dose  3.  In  the  7vPnC  group,  all  89  subjects  were  vaccinated  at  dose  1,  and  88  subjects  (98.9%) received dose 2 and dose 3. Overall, 96.1% of subjects completed the infant series (ie, completed the visit for the postinfant series blood draw): 85 (93.4%) in the 13vPnC group and 88 subjects (98.9%) in the 7vPnC group.

##  Immunogenicity results

## Proportion of Subjects Achieving a Pneumococcal IgG Antibody Concentration≥0.35 μg/mL

## Infant dose

For each of the 7 common serotypes, the proportion of subjects achieving IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL 1 month after dose 3 of the infant series was at least 97.6% in both vaccine groups (Table 9-2). For the 6 additional serotypes unique to 13vPnC, the proportion of responders in the 13vPnC group was 100% for all serotypes except 6A, for which the responder rate was 97.6%. In the 7vPnC group, the proportion of responders was low for serotypes 1, 3, and 7F (≤4.8%), with higher proportions for serotype 19A (100.0%), serotype 6A (72.3%), and serotype 5 (57.5%).

Comparing the responses in the 13vPnC group with those in the 7vPnC group, there was no marked difference  between  the  2 groups  in the  proportion  of  responders  (13PnC  - 7vPnC)  for  any  of  the 7 common serotypes. The differences ranged from -1.2% (for serotypes 6B and 19F) to 0.0% for the remaining 5 serotypes. For the 6 additional serotypes, there was a marked difference between the 2 groups in the proportion of responders for all serotypes except serotype 19A. The differences ranged from 0.0% (for serotype 19A) to 97.6% for serotypes 1 and 3 (Table 9-2).

For  each  of  the  6  additional  serotypes,  the  proportion  of  responders  in  the  13vPnC  group  was  also compared with the lowest proportion of responders observed in the 7vPnC  group for the 7 common pneumococcal  serotypes  (ie,  7vPnC  reference  =  98.8%  [serotypes  19F  and  23F]).  For  all  of  the  6 additional  serotypes,  the  proportion  of  responders  in  the  13vPnC  group  was  similar  to  the  7vPnC reference value, with no marked difference between the 2 groups (13vPnC - 7vPnC reference) for any serotype. The differences were -1.2% for serotype 6A and 1.2% for the remaining 5 serotypes.

For the 7 common serotypes, the 2 vaccine groups had similar proportions of subjects achieving IgG antibody concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL after the toddler dose. The proportions of responders to the 7 common serotypes in the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population ranged from 98.7% to 100% in the  13vPnC  group  and  were  100%  for  all  serotypes  in  the  7vPnC  group.  The  difference  in  the proportion of responders (13vPnC - 7vPnC) was -1.3% (serotype 14), and 0.0% (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19F, and 23F). (Table 9-2).

For the 6 additional serotypes unique to 13vPnC, the proportion of responders in the 13vPnC group was 100% for all serotypes except serotype 6A (98.8%). In the 7vPnC group, responder rates were low  for  serotype  1  (1.3%),  serotype  3  (12.0%),  serotype  7F  (23.6%),  but  higher  for  serotype  5 (92.4%),  serotype  19A  (98.8%),  and  serotype  6A  (100.0%).  The  difference  in  the  proportion  of responders ranged from 76.4% to 98.7% (serotypes 7F, 3, and 1) and from -1.2% to 7.6% (serotypes 6A, 19A, and 5).

## Pneumococcal IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations Infant dose

For  the  7  common  serotypes,  IgG  GMCs  measured  1  month  after  dose  3  of  the  infant  series  were generally similar for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups. For both vaccine groups, IgG GMCs were lowest for serotype 9V (3.33 μg/mL and 3.78 μg/mL for the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively) and highest for  serotype  14  (14.83  μg/mL  and  16.29  μg/mL,  respectively)  (Table  9-4).  For  all  6  additional serotypes, IgG GMCs were higher in the 13vPnC group than in the 7vPnC group. In the 13vPnC group, IgG GMCs ranged from 1.60 μg/mL for serotype 3 to 7.44 μg/mL for serotype 1; and in the 7vPnC group, GMCs ranged from 0.02 μg/mL for serotype 1 to 2.65 μg/mL for serotype 19A. IgG GMCs were low  in  the  7vPnC  group,  as  expected,  for  serotypes  1,  3,  and  7F  (≤0.04  μg/mL),  while  higher  IgG GMCs were observed for serotype 19A (2.65 μg/mL), serotype 6A (0.64 μg/mL), and serotype 5 (0.39 μg/mL).  For  the  comparisons  of  IgG  GMCs  between  the  vaccine  groups,  the  ratio  of  IgG  GMCs (13vPnC/7vPnC) for the 7 common serotypes ranged from 0.77 for serotype 4 to 1.17 for serotype 6B; and for the 6 additional serotypes the ratios ranged from 2.24 for serotype 19A to 329.44 for serotype 1 (Table 9-4).

For the 6 additional serotypes, IgG GMCs in the 13vPnC group were also compared with the lowest IgG GMC observed in the 7vPnC group for the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes (ie, 7vPnC reference = 3.78  μg/mL  [serotype  9V]).  IgG  GMCs  in  the  13vPnC  group  were  higher  than  the  7vPnC  reference value for all additional serotypes except serotype 3, with IgG GMC ratios (13vPnC/7vPnC reference) ranging from 0.42 for serotype 3 to 1.97 for serotype 1.

## Toddler dose

For the 7 common serotypes, GMCs were generally comparable between the 2 groups and ranged from 4.59 μg/mL (serotype 9V) to 16.81 μg/mL (serotype 6B) in the 13vPnC group and from 4.83 μg/mL (serotype 9V) to 15.64 μg/mL (serotype 14) in the 7vPnC group. For the 7 common serotypes, the GMC ratios ranged from 0.74 (serotype 14) to 1.45 (serotype 19F) (Table 9-4).

For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMCs were higher in the 13vPnC group. GMCs ranged from 1.65 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 13.58 μg/mL (serotype 6A) in the 13vPnC group and from 0.04 μg/mL (serotype 1) to 3.33 μg/mL (serotype 6A) in the 7vPnC group (Table 9-4). For the 6 additional serotypes, the GMC ratios ranged from 4.08 (serotype 6A) to 234.33 (serotype 1).

## MAH´s Immunogenicity conclusions

These data support a conclusion that 13vPnC will be as effective as Prevenar against the 7 common serotypes, and will provide protection against the 6 additional serotypes.

Assessor's comments: The results of this study are in agreement with previously presented studies. If anything the immune responses were higher than observed in other studies. The results in the two groups were generally of the same magnitude. It is a limitation that no OPA results were presented.

##  Safety results

In  study  6096A1-010,  the  safety  population  for  the  infant  series  included  177  subjects  who  were administered vaccine (88 in the 13vPnC group and 89 in the 7vPnC group). The toddler dose safety population included 172 toddlers (84 in the 13vPnC group and 88 in the 7vPnC group).

## Local Reactions - Infant Series

After each vaccine administration, the incidence and severity of each type of local reaction were similar for  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups,  and  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between groups in the incidence of any type of local reaction after any dose. For each type of reaction, there was no trend toward increasing or decreasing incidence from dose 1 through dose 3 for either vaccine group.

Across the 3 doses, tenderness was reported for between 23% and 39% of subjects vaccinated with 13vPnC, compared with between 27% and 38% of 7vPnC recipients, and the incidence of significant tenderness (defined as tenderness interfering with limb movement) was ≤8.8% for each group after any dose. At each dose, the incidence of swelling was between 19% and 36% in the 13vPnC group and between 23% and 29% in the 7vPnC group; and the incidence of redness was between 30% and 38% in  the  13vPnC group and between 26% and 39% in the 7vPnC group. Most reports of swelling and redness were mild (0.5 cm to 2.0 cm in diameter), and none were severe (&gt;7.0 cm). For both vaccine groups, the highest incidence of swelling and redness occurred consistently on day 2, while the highest incidence of tenderness was observed on day 1 or day 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Local Reactions - Toddler Dose

At least 1 local reaction was reported for 47.4% of subjects in the 13vPnC group and for 35.1% of subjects in the 7vPnC group during the 4 days after vaccination. Most cases of local reactions were mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  the  frequencies  of  local  reactions  were  similar  in  the  13vPnC  and 7vPnC groups, with no statistically significant differences between them.

Some  degree  of  tenderness  was  reported  in  19  (33.9%)  subjects  who  received  13vPnC  and  14 (25.9%) subjects who received 7vPnC. Significant tenderness was reported in 3 (5.9%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the 7vPnC group. Some degree of swelling was reported in 11 (22.4%)  13vPnC  subjects  and  10  (18.9%)  7vPnC  subjects;  1  case  was  severe  (13vPnC  group). Moderate swelling occurred in 9 (18.4%) subjects in the 13vPnC group and in 4 (7.8%) subjects in the 7vPnC group. Some degree of redness was reported in 15 (28.8%) 13vPnC subjects and 12 (22.2%) 7vPnC subjects. Eight (8; 16.0%) subjects in the 13vPnC group had moderate redness, and 3 (6.0%) subjects in the 7vPnC group had moderate redness; all other cases were mild.

## Systemic Events - Infant Series

In  13vPnC recipients, 1 or more systemic events were reported by 79.5% of subjects after dose 1, 67.2% of subjects after dose 2, and 52.3% of subjects after dose 3. In 7vPnC recipients, 1 or more systemic events were reported by 90.7% of subjects after dose 1, 72.2% of subjects after dose 2, and 53.1% of subjects after dose 3.

All  occurrences  of  fever  were  mild  (≥38°C  but  ≤39°C),  except  for  1  occurrence  of  moderate  fever (&gt;39°C but ≤40°C) after dose 3 in a subject who had received 7vPnC. The incidence of mild fever was similar between vaccine groups, and was between 9% and 16% in each group after any dose.

The incidence of irritability was consistently lower in the 13vPnC group (21.0% to 49.4%) than in the 7vPnC group (41.7% to 70.9%) and the difference between groups was statistically significant at dose 1 and dose 3. The incidence of decreased sleep was consistently higher in the 7vPnC group (29.3% to 50.0%)  than  in  the  13vPnC  group  (16.4%  to  37.8%),  while  the  incidence  of  increased  sleep  was consistently  higher  in  the  13vPnC  group  (28.8%  to  49.3%)  than  in  the  7vPnC  group  (21.1%  to 39.0%). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for either of these  events.  The  incidence  of  decreased  appetite  was  generally  similar  between  groups  and  was between 23% and 33% in each group after any dose, except after dose 2, when the incidence in the 7vPnC group was 44.4%.

## Systemic Events - Toddler Dose

Systemic events were reported in  54.7% and 63.1% of subjects in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively.  The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  any  type  of  systemic  event  were  similar  in  the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups after the toddler dose.

Most cases of fever were mild (≥38.0°C but ≤39.0°C). Mild fever was reported in 13.7% and 19.6% of subjects  in  the  13vPnC  and  7vPnC  groups,  respectively,  after  the  toddler  dose  and  moderate  fever (&gt;39.0°C but ≤40.0°C) in 2.0% and 0% of subjects in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively. No cases  of  fever  &gt;40°C  were  reported.  Fever  was  more  frequently  reported  on  day  2  in  the  13vPnC group, and on day 1 in the 7vPnC group.

The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  other  systemic  events  was  generally  similar  in  the  2  vaccine groups. In the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, irritability was reported in 30.5% and 37.5% of subjects; decreased appetite in 22.8% and 27.8% of subjects; increased sleep in 21.2% and 15.4% of subjects; and decreased sleep in 20.4% and 34.5% of subjects.

## Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events

The types and frequencies of subjects reporting AEs were similar in the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups and few differences were noted between the groups. For the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, respectively, at least 1 AE was reported in 88.6% and 84.3% of subjects during the infant series; 27.3% and 28.1% of subjects after the infant series; and 33.3% and 43.2% of subjects after the toddler dose.

The AEs were consistent with the types of childhood illnesses and conditions that commonly occur in this age group. During and after the infant series and after the toddler dose, AEs occurring most often were  categorized  as  infections  and  infestations  (eg,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  bronchiolitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and acute otitis media), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (eg, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and rash). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were also common (eg, rhinorrhoea, cough). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in

the incidence of any type of AE during the infant series as a whole or after any individual dose, or after the infant series. After the toddler dose, the incidence of AEs was significantly higher in the 13vPnC group than the 7vPnC group for 1 category (respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, p=0.031), and 1 event (rhinorrhoea, p=0.026).

During the infant series, 4 subjects had AEs considered related to test article; they included injection site induration and rash in 1 subject each in the 13vPnC group, and pyrexia in 2 subjects in the 7vPnC group. There were no related AEs after the infant series blood draw to before the toddler dose or from the toddler dose through the toddler dose blood draw.

No subjects died during or after the infant series or after the toddler dose. For 13vPnC and 7vPnC, respectively,  SAEs  were  reported  in  8  (9.1%)  and  9  subjects  (10.1%)  during  the  infant  series,  9 (10.2%) and 12 (13.5%) subjects after the infant series, and 3 (3.6%) and 3 (3.4%) subjects during the toddler dose. Most of the SAEs were infections. None of the SAEs during the study were considered related to the test article. During the infant series, 1 subject in the 13vPnC group developed Kawasaki disease on day 49 after vaccination with 13vPnC and was withdrawn from the study. The investigator considered  the  Kawasaki  disease  not  related  to  13vPnC  (subject  recovered  fully  by  day  77  after vaccination). No other subject discontinued from the study because of an AE during the study.

Overall, the safety profile of 13vPnC was acceptable and comparable to that of 7vPnC.

Assessor's comment : The safety profile seen in this study is largely in agreement with what has been seen in previously reported studies. There were no new safety signals.

6096A1-3009; A phase 3, open-label, single-arm trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants given with routine pediatric vaccinations in Mexico

##  Description

##  Methods

##  Objective(s)

Assess pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the 3-dose infant  series  (primary  objective),  1  month  after  the  second  dose  of  the  infant  series  (secondary objective), and 1 month after the toddler dose (secondary objective).

The safety objective was to evaluate acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the rates of local reactions, systemic events, and AEs.

##  Study design

This was a phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  administered  concomitantly  with  routine  vaccines  to  healthy  infants  in Mexico.

The immunogenicity analyses were based on results of assays performed on blood samples obtained 1 month after dose 2, 1 month after dose 3, and 1 month after the toddler dose.

##  Study population /Sample size

The study was sized to allow estimation of the proportion of responders after the third dose of 13vPnC to within ±6.0% precision and after the second dose of 13vPnC to within ±7.7% precision. Assuming a dropout rate of at most 25%, 214 subjects overall were to be enrolled to ensure 160 subjects were evaluable.

##  Treatments

Subjects were to receive 13vPnC at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infant series) and at 12 months of age (toddler dose). DTaP-IPV-Hib was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. HBV was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC at 2 and 6 months of age. Rotavirus vaccine  was  to  be  administered  concomitantly  with  13vPnC  at  2  and  4  months  of  age.  The  MMR vaccine was to be administered concomitantly with 13vPnC at 12 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Blood samples (approximately 3 to 5 mL) were collected for immunogenicity assessments at visit 3 (28 to 42 days after dose 2, at 5 months of age), at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after the 3-dose infant series, at 7 months of age) and at visit 7 (28 to 42 days after the toddler dose, at 13 months of age). For all 3 blood  samples,  serum  concentrations  (μg/mL)  of  anticapsular  IgG  were  determined  using  enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).

Safety  assessment  was  based  on  e-diary  recordings  of  local  reactions  (redness,  swelling,  and tenderness)  and  systemic  events  (decreased  appetite,  irritability,  increased  sleep,  decreased  sleep, temperature, and use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms) for 4 days after each vaccination and on the monitoring of AEs during the study.

##  Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint for each of the pneumococcal serotypes was the proportion of subjects achieving a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series.  This choice  of  endpoints  was  based  upon  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  guideline  for  the pneumococcal serotypes. The secondary endpoints for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  serotypemeasured  1  month  after  the  second  infant  dose  and  the  toddler  dose,  and  the  serotype-specific geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) after the second and third doses of the infant series and after the toddler dose.

The  safety  endpoints  were  AEs,  local  reactions,  and  systemic  events  including  fever  and  use  of antipyretic medications. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of 38.0°C or higher.

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 225 subjects were enrolled and assigned to receive 13vPnC in combination with DTaP-IPVHib, HBV, rotavirus, and MMR vaccines. Of the 225 subjects enrolled in the study, 1 subject (3009002-000037) was not vaccinated. This subject was diagnosed with hypospadias, which the investigator determined to be an exclusion criterion and, therefore, withdrew the subject from the study. One (1) additional  subject  (3009-001-000007)  is  also  listed  as  not  receiving  study  vaccine.  However,  this subject was re-enrolled and given another number (3009-001-000008) and was vaccinated.

Overall, 85.3% of the subjects completed the infant series (ie, completed the visit for the postinfant series  blood  draw).  Of  the  192  subjects  who  completed  the  infant  series,  1  subject  was  withdrawn because of parent/legal guardian request before receiving the toddler dose. Thus, 191 subjects were vaccinated  with  the  toddler  dose.  Overall,  81.3%  of  the  subjects  completed  the  toddler  dose  (ie, completed the visit for the toddler dose blood draw).

## MAH´s Immunogenicity Conclusions

In conclusion, 13vPnC elicits substantial responses to all 13 serotypes after 2 or 3 doses of the infant series.  Responses  were  comparable  or  higher  after  a  3-dose  infant  series.  Responses  to  all  13 serotypes 1 month after the toddler dose were higher than after the infant series.

Assessor's comment : The results of this study were generally in agreement with previously reviewed studies. As mentioned for the other study above, 6096A1-010, it is a limitation that no OPA results were obtained in the study.

##  Safety results

In study 6096A1-3009, the infant series safety population included 223 infants vaccinated with 13vPnC at dose 1 and 191 subjects vaccinated at the toddler dose.

## Local Reactions

One (1) or more local reactions were reported by 72.0% of subjects after dose 1, 70.9% of subjects after dose 2, 66.7% of subjects after dose 3, and 47.4% of subjects after the toddler dose. Most of the local reactions (tenderness, swelling, and redness) were mild or moderate in severity and occurred on days 1 and 2 after each dose. The incidence of significant tenderness ranged from 12.4% to 15.4% during the infant series and was 3.8% after the toddler dose. There were no reports of severe swelling or redness.

## Systemic Events

One (1) or more systemic events were reported by 83.9% of subjects after dose 1, 72.7% of subjects after  dose  2,  73.3%  of  subjects  after  dose  3,  and  59.3%  of  subjects  after  the  toddler  dose.  Most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reports of fever were mild in severity. Mild fever ranged from 7.0% to 18.5% of subjects after any dose  of  the  infant  series  and  was  23%  after  the  toddler  dose.  Moderate  fever  was  reported  by  4 subjects in the infant series (1 after dose 2 and 3 after dose 3); no subjects reported moderate fever after the toddler dose. In addition to fever, the most commonly reported systemic event was irritability (69.8% after dose 1, 62.2% after dose 2, 63.2% after dose 3, and 46.7% after the toddler dose).

## Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events

At least 1 AE was reported for 35.9% of subjects during the infant series and 26.7% of subjects after the  toddler  dose.  AEs  were  most  frequently  observed  in  the  category  of  infections  and  infestations (29.6% during the infant series and 11.5% after the toddler dose). The most common individual AEs reported were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and viral upper respiratory tract  infection during the infant series and pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and vomiting after the toddler dose. Most AEs reported were generally illnesses/conditions common or expected in children of these age groups.

After  the  infant  series  blood  draw  (when  only  SAEs  and  AEs  indicative  of  newly  diagnosed  chronic medical  conditions  were  reported),  6  (2.7%)  subjects  reported  a  total  of  7  AEs.  AEs  were  most frequently  observed  in  the  category  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders.  Two  (2)  subjects reported seborrheic dermatitis; all other AEs occurred in 1 subject each.

There were no related AEs reported after any dose during the infant series or after the infant series. Overall, 4 (2.1%) subjects reported a total of 12 related AEs during the toddler dose. All of the related AEs were solicited events that were not recorded in the e-diary by the parent/guardian. Because the events were present, but not recorded, the site entered the symptoms on the AE page of the case report forms.

Severe AEs were reported by 2 (0.9%) subjects during the infant series, 3 subjects (1.3%) after the infant series, and 2 subjects (1.0%) after the toddler dose. One (1) subject reported a life-threatening AE (angioedema) during the infant series. No life-threatening AEs were reported after the infant series or after the toddler dose. None of these were considered to be related to 13vPnC.

No subjects died during the study. A total of 8 subjects reported SAEs during the study; 3 subjects during the infant series, 3 after the infant series, and 2 during the toddler dose phase. None of these were considered to be related to 13vPnC. During the infant series, 1 subject was withdrawn from the study because of an AE (Kawasaki disease), which was not considered to be related to 13vPnC. No subject  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  because  of  AEs  after  the  infant  series  or  during  the  toddler dose.

In conclusion, 13vPnC given as a 3-dose infant series followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age was safe and well tolerated in Mexican infants.

Assessor's comment : the frequency of significant tenderness was slightly higher in this study than the average  of  the  studies  submitted  previously.  As  there  was  no  obvious  increase  in  other  solicited events, local or systemic, this does not cause further concern.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  submitted  studies  support  the  previously  submitted  results  on  immunogenicity  and  safety.  The studies  were  performed  as  part  of  the  global  development  program  and  will  be  used  for  licensure applications in Korea and Mexico respectively. No further regulatory action is requested.
