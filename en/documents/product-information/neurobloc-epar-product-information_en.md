Injections should be repeated as required to maintain good function and minimise pain. In long term clinical studies, the average dosing frequency was approximately every 12 weeks, however this may vary between subjects, and a proportion of patients maintained a significant improvement relative to baseline for 16 weeks or longer. The dosing frequency should therefore be adapted based on the clinical assessment/response of an individual patient.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. Clear and colourless to light yellow solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications NeuroBloc is indicated for the treatment of cervical dystonia (torticollis) in adults. 4.2 Posology and method of administration NeuroBloc should only be administered by a physician who is familiar with and experience in the treatment of cervical dystonia and in the use of botulinum toxins. Restricted to hospital use only. Posology The initial dose is 10,000 U and should be divided between the two to four most affected muscles. Data from clinical studies suggest that efficacy is dose dependent, but these trials, because they were not powered for a comparison, do not show a significant difference between 5000 U and 10,000 U. Therefore an initial dose of 5000 U may also be considered, but a dose of 10,000 U may increase the likelihood of clinical benefit. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For patients with reduced muscle mass the dose should be adjusted according to individual patient need.

The potency of this medicinal product is expressed in NeuroBloc 5000 U/ml. These units are not interchangeable with the units used to express the potency of other botulinum toxin preparations (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in older people ≥ 65 years of age.

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Studies have not been carried out in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, the pharmacological characteristics do not indicate any need to adjust the dose.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of NeuroBloc in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration NeuroBloc must only be administered by intramuscular injection. Particular caution should be paid to ensure that it is not injected into a blood vessel. The initial dose of 10,000 U should be divided between the two to four most affected muscles. To allow division of the total dose between several injections, NeuroBloc may be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection and the solution used immediately. For instructions on dilution of the product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Individuals with known neuromuscular diseases (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or peripheral neuropathy) or known neuromuscular junctional disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) must not be given NeuroBloc. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use NeuroBloc is recommended for intramuscular administration only. The safety of NeuroBloc outside the approved indication has not been established. This warning includes use in children and in any other indication besides cervical dystonia. The risks, which can include death, may outweigh the potential benefits. Seroconversion As with many biological/biotechnology proteins used as therapeutic agents, repeated administration of NeuroBloc may be associated with development of antibodies to Botulinum Toxin Type B in some patients. Immunogenicity data from three long term clinical studies indicate that approximately one third of patients develop antibodies, as determined by the mouse neutralisation/mouse protection assay dependent on duration of exposure (see section 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

An investigation into the consequence of seroconversion showed that the presence of antibodies was not synonymous with a loss of clinical response, and did not have an impact on the overall safety profile. However, the clinical relevance of the presence of antibodies as determined by the mouse neutralisation / mouse protection assay is uncertain.

Caution should be used in patients with bleeding disorders or receiving anticoagulant therapy.

## Spread of toxin effect

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neuromuscular effects related to spread of toxin, distant from the site of administration have been reported (see section 4.8). These include dysphagia and breathing difficulties.

## Pre-Existing neuromuscular disorders

Patients treated with therapeutic doses may experience exaggerated muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of NeuroBloc (see section 4.3).

There have been spontaneous reports of dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia and/or potentially fatal respiratory disease, after treatment with Botulinum Toxin Type A/B.

Children (non approved use) and patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders including swallowing disorders are at increased risk of these adverse reactions. In patients with neuromuscular disorders or history of dysphagia and aspiration, botulinum toxins should only be used in an experimental setting under strict medical supervision. Following NeuroBloc treatment, all patients and caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention for respiratory difficulties, choking or any new or worsening dysphagia. Dysphagia has been reported following injection to sites other than the cervical musculature. Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products The initial starting dose of 10,000 U (or 5000 U) is relevant only to NeuroBloc (Botulinum Toxin Type B). These dose units are specific to NeuroBloc only and are not relevant to preparations of Botulinum Toxin Type A. The unit dose recommendations for Botulinum Toxin Type A are significantly lower than those for NeuroBloc and administration of Botulinum Toxin Type A at the unit dose recommended for NeuroBloc may result in systemic toxicity and life-threatening clinical sequelae. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes concurrently is unknown. However, in clinical studies, NeuroBloc was administered 16 weeks after the injection of Botulinum Toxin Type A. Co-administration of NeuroBloc and aminoglycosides or agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g. curare-like compounds) should be considered with caution. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy and embryonal/foetal development. The potential risk for humans is unknown. NeuroBloc should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Botulinum Toxin Type B (see section 5.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Botulinum Toxin Type B is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Botulinum Toxin Type B in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision must be made on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with NeuroBloc taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NeuroBloc therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been performed and it is not known whether NeuroBloc can affect reproduction capacity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Neurobloc may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery in case of adverse reactions such as muscle weakness and eye disorders (blurred vision, eyelid ptosis).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with NeuroBloc treatment were dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, and injection site pain.

The following effects have also been reported during post marketing use: abnormal accommodation, dry eye, ptosis, vomiting, constipation, flu-like symptoms, asthenia, angioedema, rash, urticaria and pruritus.

Adverse reactions related to spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have been reported: exaggerated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia with fatal outcome in some cases (see section 4.4). Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions seen in all clinical studies are listed below according to MedDRA system organ class and in decreasing frequency which is defined as follows: Very Common (&gt;1/10); Common (&gt;1/100 to &lt;1/10); Uncommon (&gt;1/1000 to &lt;1/100). In common with Botulinum Toxin Type A, electrophysiological jitter, which is not associated with clinical weakness or other electrophysiological abnormalities, may be experienced in some distant muscles. Post marketing experience Side effects related to spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have been reported (exaggerated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia with fatal outcome in some cases) (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The available reports indicate that the product has been used in the paediatric population. Case reports are more likely to be serious in children (40%) compared to those in adults and older people (12%), possibly as a result of using an inappropriately high dosage for the child (see section 4.9).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Cases of overdose (some with signs of systemic toxicity) have been reported. In the event of an overdose, general medical supportive measures should be instituted. Doses of up to 15,000 U have infrequently resulted in clinically significant systemic toxicity in adults. If botulism is clinically suspected, hospitalisation for the monitoring of respiratory function (incipient respiratory failure) may be required.

A series of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NeuroBloc in the treatment of cervical dystonia. These studies have demonstrated the activity of NeuroBloc in both treatment-naïve patients, and patients who have previously received treatment with Botulinum Toxin Type A, including those that were considered clinically resistant to Botulinum Toxin Type A.

In the event of an overdose or injection into a muscle that normally compensates for the cervical dystonia, it is conceivable that the dystonia may worsen. As with other botulinum toxins spontaneous recovery will occur over a period of time. Paediatric use (non approved): in children, clinically significant systemic toxicity has occurred at doses approved for the treatment of adult patients. The risk of spreading of effect is greater than in adults, and more frequently severe. This can be due to the high dosages usually used in this population. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: muscle relaxant, peripherally acting agents, ATC code: M03AX 01. Mechanism of action NeuroBloc is a neuromuscular blocking agent. The mechanism of action of NeuroBloc in blocking neuromuscular conduction occurs by a three-step process: 1. Extracellular binding of the toxin to specific acceptors on motor nerve terminals 2. Internalisation and release of the toxin into the cytosol of the nerve terminals 3. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction When injected directly into a muscle, NeuroBloc causes a localised paralysis that gradually reverses over time. The mechanism by which muscle paralysis is reversed over time remains unknown, but may be associated with the intraneuronal turnover of the affected protein and/or sprouting of the nerve ending. Clinical efficacy and safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Two Phase III randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in patients with cervical dystonia. Both studies enrolled adult patients ( ≥ 18 years) who had a history of receiving Botulinum Toxin Type A. The first study enrolled patients who were clinically resistant to type A toxin (A-non responders), confirmed by a Frontalis Type A test. The second study enrolled patients who continued to respond to type A toxin (A-responders). In the first study, type A resistant patients (A-non responders) were randomised to receive placebo or 10,000 U of NeuroBloc and in the second, type A toxin responsive patients (A-responders) were randomised to receive placebo, 5000 U

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or 10,000 U of toxin. The medicinal product was injected on a single occasion into 2 to 4 of the following muscles: splenius capitus, sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, semispinalis capitus and scalene. The total dose was divided between the selected muscles and 1 to 5 injections per muscle were administered. There were 77 subjects enrolled into the first study and 109 subjects into the second. Patient evaluations continued for 16 weeks post injection.

The primary efficacy outcome variable for both studies was the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score (range of possible scores is 0-87) at Week 4. The secondary endpoints included Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) to quantify the Patient Global Assessment of change and the Physician Global Assessment of change, both from baseline to Week 4. On these scales, scores of 50 indicate no change, 0 much worse, and 100 much better. Results of comparisons of the primary and secondary efficacy variables are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of the TWSTRS sub scales revealed significant effects on the severity of cervical dystonia and its associated pain and disability.

The non-inferiority of NeuroBloc compared to Botulinum Toxin Type A was further supported by a responder analysis where similar percentages of subjects showed improvement in the TWSTRS score at Week 4 of Session 1 (86% NeuroBloc and 85% Botox), and a similar proportion of subjects experienced at least a 20% decrease from baseline in the TWSTRS score at Week 4 of Session 1 (51% NeuroBloc, 47% Botox).

Table 1 Efficacy Results from Phase III NeuroBloc Studies STUDY 1 (A-Resistant Patients) Assessments Placebo 10,000 U n = 38 n = 39 TWSTRS-Total Mean At Baseline 51.2 52.8 Mean at Week 4 49.2 41.8 Change from Baseline -2.0 -11.1 P-Value* 0.0001 Patient Global Mean at Week 4 39.5 60.2 P-Value* 0.0001 Physician Global Mean at Week 4 47.9 60.6 P-Value* 0.0001 * Analysis of covariance, two-tailed tests, α = 0.05 A further randomised, multicentre, double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy of NeuroBloc (10,000 U) to Botulinum Toxin Type A (150 U) in patients with cervical dystonia who have never previously received a botulinum toxin product. The primary efficacy assessment was the TWSTRS Total score, and secondary efficacy assessments included VAS assessment of change evaluated by patient and investigator, conducted at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. The study met the pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority of NeuroBloc compared to Botulinum Toxin Type A, both in terms of mean TWSTRS total score at week 4 after first and second treatment sessions, and in terms of duration of effect. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Further clinical studies and open label follow-up have shown that subjects can continue to respond to NeuroBloc for prolonged periods of time, with some subjects receiving more than 14 treatment sessions over a period of more than 3.5 years. In addition to improved function as demonstrated by a reduction in TWSTRS-total score, treatment with NeuroBloc was associated with a significant reduction in TWSTRS-Pain and pain VAS scores at each treatment session at weeks 4, 8 and 12 relative to baseline. In these studies, the average dosing frequency was approximately every 12 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The immunogenicity of NeuroBloc has been evaluated in two clinical studies and an open-label extension study. The presence of antibodies in these studies was assessed using the mouse protection assay (also known as the Mouse Neutralization Assay, MNA).

Immunogenicity data from three long-term clinical studies indicate that approximately one third of patients develop antibodies, as determined by the mouse neutralisation/ mouse protection assay dependent on duration of exposure. Specifically, these studies showed approximately 19-25% seroconverted within 18 months of initiation of treatment, increasing to approximately 33-44% with up to 45 months of treatment. An investigation into the consequence of seroconversion showed that the presence of antibodies was not synonymous with a loss of clinical response, and did not have an impact on the overall safety profile. However, the clinical relevance of the presence of antibodies as determined by the mouse neutralisation/ mouse protection assay is uncertain.

The extent and time course of seroconversion were similar in patients with prior toxin A exposure and those who were toxin A naïve, and between toxin A resistant and toxin A responsive patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties NeuroBloc injected intramuscularly produces localised muscle weakness by chemical denervation. Following local intramuscular injection of NeuroBloc serious adverse events that may have been due to systemic effects of Botulinum Toxin Type B, were observed in 12% of adverse reaction cases reported during the post-marketing experience (including the following adverse reactions: dry mouth, dysphagia and blurred vision). However, no pharmacokinetic or Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) studies have been performed. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Single dose pharmacology studies in cynomolgus monkeys have shown no effects other than the anticipated dose-dependent paralysis of injected muscles, together with some diffusion of toxin at high doses producing similar effects in neighbouring non-injected muscles. Single dose intramuscular toxicology studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys. The systemic No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was shown to be approximately 960 U/kg. The dose resulting in death was 2400 U/kg. Because of the nature of the product, no animal studies have been carried out to establish the carcinogenic effects of NeuroBloc. Standard tests to investigate the mutagenicity of NeuroBloc have not been performed. Development studies in rats and rabbits have shown no evidence of foetal malformations or changes to fertility. In the development studies, the No Observed Adverse Effect Dose Level (NOAEL) in rats was 1000 U/kg/day for maternal effects and 3000 U/kg/day for foetal effects. In rabbits, the NOAEL was 0.1 U/kg/day for maternal effects and 0.3 U/kg/day for foetal effects. In the fertility studies the NOAEL was 300 U/kg/day for general toxicity in both males and females and 1000 U/kg/day for fertility and reproductive performance.

Contents of the pack and other information 1. What NeuroBloc is and what it is used for NeuroBloc injection works by reducing or stopping muscle contractions. It contains the active ingredient 'Botulinum Toxin Type B'. NeuroBloc is used to treat an illness called cervical dystonia (torticollis). This is where you have contractions of your neck or shoulder muscles that you cannot control. 2. What you need to know before you use NeuroBloc Do not use NeuroBloc: -if you are allergic to Botulinum Toxin Type B or any of the other ingredients of NeuroBloc (listed in section 6) -if you have other problems with your nerves or muscles, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), peripheral neuropathy, myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome (muscle weakness or numbness or pain) -if you have been experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing You must not be given NeuroBloc if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Warnings and precautions Medicinal product no longer authorised

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using NeuroBloc:

- -if you have a bleeding problem such as haemophilia
- -if you have lung problems
- -if you have difficulty swallowing. This is because swallowing problems could make you breathe food or liquids into your lungs, which could then cause very serious pneumonia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## General precaution:

NeuroBloc has been approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia only and should not be used to treat anything else. The safety of NeuroBloc when used to treat other conditions is not known: some side effects may be fatal.

## Children and adolescents

NeuroBloc is not to be used in children aged less than18 years.

## Other medicines and NeuroBloc

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This is because NeuroBloc can affect the way some medicines work and other medicines can also affect the way NeuroBloc works.

- -if you have had NeuroBloc injections before, your doctor will take into account how well it worked the other times

In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: -aminoglycoside antibiotics for an infection -medicines to stop blood clotting, such as warfarin If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given NeuroBloc. Before having an operation If you are going to have an operation, please tell your doctor that you have been given NeuroBloc. This is because NeuroBloc can affect the medicines you may be given before a general anaesthetic. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility -you will not normally be given NeuroBloc if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because it is not known how NeuroBloc affects patients who are pregnant and it is not known if NeuroBloc passes into a nursing mother's breast milk -if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine Driving and using machines You may have muscle weakness or eye problems such as blurred vision or eyelid drooping after being given NeuroBloc. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. NeuroBloc contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 10,000 units of NeuroBloc. This means it is essentially 'sodium free'. 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -your doctor will decide if you need another injection and how much to give you

If you think that the effect of NeuroBloc is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.

## If you are given more NeuroBloc than you should

- -if you have been given more NeuroBloc than you need, some of your muscles that were not injected may feel weak or you may develop symptoms away from the injected muscles, like difficulty in swallowing or breathing. This may occur when higher doses of up to 15,000 units are given
- -if you have difficulty breathing or you are worried by any symptoms you develop away from the place of the injection, talk to your doctor immediately. If he/she is unavailable seek emergency assistance. You may need urgent medical treatment
- -feeling weak, pain or stiff muscles around your body

A serious condition called 'botulism' which causes paralysis of muscles and respiratory failure could occur if too much of the active ingredient (botulinum toxin) is injected into the body. If your doctor suspects that botulism may have occurred, you will be admitted to hospital and your breathing (respiratory function) will be monitored. Recovery usually takes place over a period of time. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. They may happen days to weeks after you have had the injection. You may feel pain at the place where you had the injection, but this should wear off after a few minutes. You may get a dry mouth and it might become difficult to swallow. In rare cases difficulty in swallowing may be severe and choking is possible. If your swallowing difficulty gets worse or you have choking or breathing problems, see a doctor immediately. You may need urgent medical treatment. Aspiration pneumonia caused by food particles or vomit entering into the lungs, and respiratory disease, have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxins (Type A and Type B). These side effects have sometimes resulted in death and are possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin to body parts away from the place where the injection is given. Other side effects include: Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) -dry mouth -difficulty swallowing -headache Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) -blurred vision or drooping of your upper eyelid -indigestion or being sick (vomiting) -constipation -neck pain Medicinal product no longer authorised
