| WS/0219 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to provide complementary information about the risk of allergic reactions and to reflect that there is very limited data in immunocompromised patients as requested by CHMP further to the assessment of PSUR 5. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the WSA took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the WSA proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8.1. product | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A cumulative review of cases of allergic reactions performed by the MAH covering the period from 24 February 2009 to 31 August 2011, and submitted within PSUR 6, identified 14 case reports of allergic reactions. Among them there were 2 anaphylactic reaction, 2 laryngeal oedema, 1 tongue oedema , 2 laryngeal oedema, and 1 lip swelling and 1 generalized urticaria. The information provided of the cases is considered scarce but a close temporal relationship with the vaccine administration was reported in all cases. Therefore, 'allergic reactions' have been included in the tabulated summary of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC under 'Immune system disorders' with the frequency 'not known'. Section 4.3 and 4.4 are also revised to provide clearer and more detailed information about the risk of allergic reactions. Moreover, section 4.4 is updated to reflect there are very limited data available in immunocompromised |

In addition, the MAH used the opportunity of this variation to amend the Marketing Authorisation numbers and the Authorisation date in sections 8 and 9 of the SmPC and section 12 of the Labelling. The name of the European Medicines Agency has also been updated towards the product information. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 18/02/2010 | 23/03/2010 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer | The dossier presented at the time of submission of the MAA included two confirmatory studies (GID16 and GID17) which showed the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the IDflu to a non-adjuvanted IM Influenza Vaccine (Vaxigrip) for each of the three strains in terms of post- vaccination GMTs. The MAH has provided the results of an additionnal study, FID01C, which compares the immunogenicity and the safety of the ID vaccine versus an adjuvanted (MF 59-containing) IM vaccine. Study FID01C was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase-3 study that compared IDflu 15 µg with an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine containing the same dosage of HA per strain. The data generated were in line with those described in the initial dossier submission, and showed that the ID vaccine was as immunogenic as the comparator vaccine. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated in this study. The safety profile of IDflu observed was in line with the one observed in the clinical trials described in the initial dossier application. The SmPC of IDflu 15 µg has been updated to add the immunogenicity data generated from study FID01C in section 5.1. In parallel, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the comparison with an intramuscular adjuvanted vaccine. |
