## 1. Introduction

On 20 july 2017 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study number 201832 in accordance with Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  The  study  has  not  been  conducted  in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan and will not result in an update to the Product Information.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures specific obligations.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided but it does not discuss information concerning the paediatric population.

The MAH states that the submitted study does not influence the benefit risk for Relvar Ellipta and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Relvar  Ellipta  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  13th  November  2013  and  the  duplicate  licence,  Revinty Ellipta, approved in the EU on 2nd May 2014 for the following indication:

'regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  and  adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older  where  use  of  a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate: patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short-acting beta2-agonists'.

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included a EMA Decision on the granting of a class waiver for the condition COPD (EMA/825560/2009). A EMA Decision on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan, which included a waiver in children under 5 years of age and a deferral in children aged 5-11 years (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M04; P/0049/2012), was also submitted in the application.

The last EMA Decision was issued by August 2013 (P/0216/2013) corresponding to the Modification 06. The agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP), which is expected to be completed by November 2019, established six clinical measures for adolescents (12 to less than 18 years) and adults. Four of these measures were agreed to assay FF/VI in combination.

In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to the EMA the final study report for 201832 which achieved Last Subject Last Visit on 3 february 2017.

Study number 201832 was a stand alone study and not part of a paediatric investigation plan and I hereby confirm that these data do not require an update of the product information, in line with Article 46 regulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  stated  that  the  hereby  submitted  study  'A  Randomised,  Double-Blind,  Double-Dummy, Crossover  Comparison  of  Fluticasone  Furoate/Vilanterol  100/25  mcg  Once-Daily  Versus  Fluticasone Propionate 250 mcg Twice-Daily in Adolescent and Adult Subjects with Asthma and Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction' study number: 201832 is not part of a PIP.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulations of FF/VI used in the study were the same as the products approved in the EU (i.e. FF/VI 100/25 mcg equivalent to a delivered dose of 92/22 mcg) delivered via the Ellipta dry powder inhaler to treat adults and adolescents with asthma.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

For  many  patients  with  symptomatic  asthma,  physical  exertion  can  be  a  precipitating  factor  for bronchoconstriction. Although varying in methodology and criteria, early studies showed that as many as 90% of individuals with asthma have bronchoconstriction after exercise. This is termed exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and is defined as a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) post-exercise challenge of ≥20%.  In patients with symptoms of persistent asthma, exercise and  other  forms  of  physical  activity  represent  one  of  many  triggers  that  can  lead  to  worsening symptoms.

Chronic treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been shown to reduce the severity of asthma associated with exercise. However, some patients continue to demonstrate asthma symptoms and a decrease  in  lung  function  during  exercise  even  whilst  receiving  ICS.  The  addition  of  a  long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) to ICS has been considered as a possible treatment in these cases. International guidelines such as those issued by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NIH) advocate the use of inhaled LABA in combination with ICS as maintenance therapy in asthma for participants who remain symptomatic on low-to-mid-dose ICS.

The MAH submitted a final report for study number: 201832. This was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study in adults and adolescents (aged 12-50) with persistent asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The objective of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily (OD) compared with fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 mcg twicedaily  (BD)  against  EIB.  The  study  used  standard  exercise  challenge  and  spirometry  techniques  to assess the primary and secondary endpoints as well as using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) to assess changes in asthma control.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  201832 'A  Randomised, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Crossover Comparison of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol  100/25  mcg  Once-Daily  Versus  Fluticasone  Propionate  250  mcg  Twice-Daily  in Adolescent and Adult Subjects with Asthma and Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction'

## Description

Inhaled fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  (FF/VI)  is  approved  for  the  treatment of  asthma  in  adults  and adolescents aged 12 years and older, and for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Inhaled FF/VI has been approved for marketing in the EU through the Centralised procedure.

Study  201832  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  crossover  study  in  adults  and adolescents (aged 12-50) with persistent asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  protective  effect  of  FF/VI  100/25  mcg  once-daily  (OD) compared  with  fluticasone  propionate  (FP)  250  mcg  twice-daily  (BD)  against  EIB.  The  study  used standard exercise challenge and spirometry techniques to assess the primary and secondary endpoints as well as using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) to assess changes in asthma control.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of FF/VI 100/25 OD compared with FP 250 BD against EIB in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma.

## Study design

Eligible subjects who  were  currently on a low-to-moderate  dose  inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (equivalent to FP 100-500mcg/day), with a forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥70%, and self-reported EIB, completed a four-week run-in period on FP 250mcg BD. At the end of the run-in period  those  patients  who  showed  physiological  evidence  of  EIB  i.e.  ≥20%  drop  in  FEV1  within  30 minutes post-exercise challenge were randomised to receive one of two treatments: FF/VI 100/25 mcg OD + placebo FP or FP 250mcg BD + placebo FF/VI in the first two-week treatment period. This was followed  by  a  two-week  wash-out  period  on  FP  250mcg  BD,  after  which  subjects  crossed  over  to a second two-week treatment period during which they received the alternate treatment.

Endpoints were measured at the start and end of each treatment period, and after one day of dosing. The primary endpoint was measured 12- hours after the evening dose of study treatment on Day 14 of each treatment period, whilst secondary endpoints were measured 12 and 23- hours after the evening dose of study treatment on Day 14 of each treatment period as well as 23- hours after the first dose of each treatment period.

The formulations of FF/VI used in the study were the same as the products approved in the EU (i.e. FF/VI 100/25 mcg equivalent to a delivered dose of 92/22 mcg) delivered via the Ellipta dry powder inhaler to treat adults and adolescents with asthma.

## Treatment Assignment

Participants  were  assigned  to  IP  at  Visit  2  in  accordance  with  the  randomisation  schedule.  The randomisation  schedule  was  generated  by  Clinical  Statistics  prior  to  the  start  of  the  study,  using validated internal software (GSK RandAll NG). Centralised randomisation was used. Participants were randomised to a treatment sequence using GSK RAMOSNG software. At Visit 2, eligible participants were randomised 1:1 to one of the treatment sequences shown in Table 2.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy Assessment

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  following exercise challenge at 12 hr post-dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed using an exercise challenge and spirometry measurements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exercise Challenge

The exercise challenge test was a stepped challenge on a treadmill at a speed and incline required for participants to reach 80% to 95% of their maximum heart rate within 4 min and maintain this heart rate  with  exercise  for  an  additional  6  min  for  a  total  of  10  min  of  exercise.  During  the  exercise challenge, participants inhaled medical grade dry air at ambient temperature from a reservoir using a two-way non-rebreathing valve.

## Spirometry

The spirometry assessments were performed at a time relative to the prior evening dose of the IP:

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the spirometry assessments were performed 12 hr after the prior evening dose of the IP.

For  the  secondary  and  other  efficacy  endpoints  spirometry  was  performed  either  12  hr  or  23  hr following the prior evening dose of the IP depending on the endpoint.

Full spirometry (FEV1 and forced vital capacity [FVC]) was performed prior to exercise challenges to serve as a within-visit baseline. Immediately following the exercise challenges serial spirometry FEV1 measurements were performed at 6 time intervals over 60 min (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min) postexercise.  Challenge  FEV1  wasmeasured  using  standard  spirometry  procedures,  equipment,  and software  that  met  or    exceeded  the  minimal  recommendations  of  the  ATS/European  Respiratory Society  (ERS),  provided  by  CompleWare.  The  degree  of  EIB  was  determined  by  comparing  the decrease in  FEV1  post-exercise  challenge  to  the  pre-exercise  FEV1.  Spirometry  efforts  had  to  meet specific  quality  measures  to  be  used  for  eligibility  and  to  be  included  in  the  analysis.  Acceptable spirometry efforts had measurements with a satisfactory start of test and end of test (i.e., a plateau in the volume-time curve) and were free from artefacts caused by cough, early termination, poor effort, obstructed mouthpiece, equipment malfunction, or other reasons. In addition, time points had specific criteria applied as follows:

- Visits  1  and  2  (spirometry  prior  to  the  exercise  challenge):  at  least  two  valid  and  two repeatable efforts had to be obtained.
- Visits  3,  4,  6,  and  7  (spirometry  prior  to  the  exercise  challenge)  and  Visit  5  (no  exercise challenge conducted): at least two valid efforts had to be obtained.
- Visits 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 (post-exercise challenge serial spirometry): at least one valid effort had to be obtained.

No more than 8 efforts were performed for any time point.

The  investigators  were  responsible  for  initial  assessment  of  the  quality  of  the  spirometry  efforts. CompleWare performed an additional overread of all spirometry efforts and detected any spirometry effects  that  were  not  considered  of  sufficient  quality.  Upon  consultation  of  this  finding  with  the investigator, CompleWare then deleted the non-satisfactory spirometry efforts. At each time point, the largest FEV1, and FVC values, where required, were recorded even when they did not come from the same effort.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Other Efficacy Endpoints were also analised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety Assessments

Adverse  events  and  concomitant  medications  were  collected  at  each  visit  including  the  Follow-Up phone call and the EW visit. Vital signs were recorded from Visit 1 to Visit 7 and at the EW visit.

## Adverse Events

The  investigator  or  study  centre  staff  detected,  documented,  and  reported  events  that  met  the definition of an AE or SAE (protocol Section 8.4.1). AE information was volunteered by the participant, discovered by investigator questioning, or detected by other means. AEs and SAEs were collected from the start of study treatment (the start of the Run-In period) until the Follow-Up phone call. Any SAEs assessed  as  related  to  study  participation  (e.g.,  protocol-mandated  procedures,  invasive  tests,  or change in existing therapy), or related to a GSK product were recorded from the time a participant consented to participate in the study up to and including the Follow-Up phone call.

For all AEs, the following information was collected: onset and outcome/end date, frequency, intensity, the  clinical  action  taken  with  the  study  treatment  in  response  to  the  AE,  details  of  participant withdrawal (if applicable), and relationship to study treatment.

## Asthma Exacerbations

Severe asthma exacerbations were recorded on the exacerbation log in the eCRF from Randomisation (Visit 2) to the Follow-Up phone call, along with treatment details. Severe asthma exacerbations were not recorded as AEs unless determined to be an SAE (resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulted in disability/incapacity, could have jeopardised the participant, or required medical or surgical intervention).

## Physical Exams

Physical examinations including, but not limited to an evaluation of the lungs and cardiovascular (CV) system, were conducted at Visit 1 by a licensed practitioner listed on FDA Form 1572.

## Vital Signs

Vital signs were obtained at each clinic visit including the EW visit. At each visit, heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured after approximately 5 min of rest in a semi-supine position and  prior  to  spirometry.  At  visits  where  an  exercise  challenge  was  performed,  vital  signs  were measured  prior  to  the  pre-exercise  challenge  spirometry  and  immediately  following  the  end  of  the exercise challenge. Any clinically significant abnormalities in the vital signs were further examined until the abnormality was resolved.

## Electrocardiogram

A 12-lead ECG was performed after 5 min rest, after vital signs, and prior to performing spirometry. ECG readers were interpreted by the investigator at Visit 1.

## Statistical Methods

All data analysis methods for this CSR were described in a Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) dated 15 December 2016. All programming was performed in a HARP environment using SAS Version 9.4 or a later version.

## Randomized Subjects

A total of 75 participants were randomly assigned to treatment and 74 participants received treatment (one participant [Participant 952] was randomised but did not receive treatment, with the participant withdrawing from the study for the reason 'Participant not interested in continuing in study') (Figure 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Participants were randomly assigned to IP at a total of 14 centres in two countries (Table 1.7). More participants were randomised at centres in the USA than Canada (USA: 72 participants [97%],  anada: 2  participants  [3%])  (Table  1.7).  The  majority  of  participants  (93%)  completed  the  study.  Five participants (7%) withdrew over the course of the study (Listing 1): one participant withdrew whilst taking  FF/VI  100/25  OD,  two  participants  withdrew  whilst  taking  FP  250  BD,  and  two  participants withdrew during the Wash-Out period. The only reason for study withdrawal reported for more than 1 participant (3%) was AE. Of the two participants with AEs that led to study withdrawal, one participant had been receiving treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD and one participant had been receiving treatment with FP 250 BD at the time of withdrawal.

## Populations Analyzed

In this study, 163 participants were screened and 74 participants received at least one dose of blinded IP and were included in the ITT Population (Table 6). The majority of participants were included in the PP Population (88%) and the ITT (15 years or older) Population (85%). There were 17 participants (23%) who were less than 18 years old and comprised the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population.

## Asthma, Exacerbation, and Tobacco Use History

At  Screening,  the  majority  of  participants  (84%)  had  never  smoked  (Table  1.19).  In  the  16%  of participants who were former smokers, the mean smoking history was 0.8 pack-years The majority of participants  reported  a  duration  of  asthma  at  Screening  of  ≥10  years  (76%)  (Table  8),  and  most participants had not experienced an asthma exacerbation in the last 12 months (91%). The majority of participants who  experienced  an  exacerbation  in  the  last  12  months  experienced  a  Type  2 exacerbation, which required oral/systemic corticosteroids but did not involve hospitalisation (5 of the 7  participants).  The  remaining  two  participants  experienced  Type  1  exacerbation(s)  in  the  last  12 months, which was managed without oral/systemic corticosteroids.

## Screening and Baseline Lung Function

At Screening, the mean pre-bronchodilator lung function was an FEV1 of 3.040 L (91.59% predicted) and  an  FVC  of  4.137  L  (Table  9).  The  Study  Baseline  lung  function  was  determined  at  Visit  2, Randomisation, following a 4-week Run-In period with FP 250 BD. Study Baseline lung function was similar to that at Screening, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 3.025 L and 91.28% predicted FEV1.

## Efficacy results

Maximal Decrease from Pre-Exercise Challenge FEV1

The primary endpoint of this study was the maximal percent FEV1 decrease from pre-exercise FEV1 following  exercise  challenge  12  hr  post-dose  with  FF/VI  100/25  OD  or  FP  250  BD  on  Day  14  of treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study included the maximal percent FEV1 decrease from pre-exercise FEV1 23 hr post-dose with FF/VI 100/25 OD or FP 250 BD on Day 14 of treatment.

The  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  from  pre-exercise  FEV1  at  12  hr  post-dose  on  Day  14  was similar for FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD treatment (15.02% and 16.71%, respectively) (Table 14). The treatment difference was -1.69% points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.76, 0.39). The analysis for the PP Population and the ITT (15 years or older) Population and a summary produced for the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 2.6) were consistent with the ITT Population.

As  the  outcome  of  the  primary  endpoint  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  and  based  on  the statistical  hierarchy,  no  further  statistical  inference  could  be  made  on  the  secondary  or  other endpoints.

The  maximal  percent  decrease  in  FEV1  and  the  maximal  absolute  decrease  in  FEV1  (L)  from  preexercise FEV1 were also similar between the two treatments at 23 hr post-dose on Day 1 of treatment (Table 15). The analysis for the ITT (15 years or older) Population and a summary produced for the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 2.11) were consistent with the ITT Population.

The  maximal  percent  decrease  from  pre-exercise  FEV1  following  an  exercise  challenge  at  study baseline (Visit 2) (28.55%) was numerically attenuated at all time points (23 hr post-dose on Day 1, and 12 hr post-dose on Day 14, and 23 hr post-dose of Day 14 of treatment) (Table 15). The study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline exercise challenge was performed in the evening, as was the 23 hr Day 1 and 23 hr Day 14 time point exercise challenges. The 12 hr Day 14 time point was performed in the morning.

## Assessor's comments on efficacy results

The primary endpoint was not met. There was no significant difference in maximal percent decrease in FEV1 from pre-exercise FEV1 at 12 hours post-dose on Day 14 between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250  BD  treatment  (15.02%  and  16.71%,  respectively,  treatment  difference:  -1.69%  points,  95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.76, 0.39). The results did not show a difference between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD in protection against EIB.

Data of ITT [12-17 Years Old] Population (a total of 17 subjects (23%) of the total population were 12  to  17  years  of  age)  has  been  provided  separately  in  the  study  report;  The  results  for  this population  were  consistent  with  the  ITT  population.  The  MAH  has  not  presented  any  separate statistical  analysis  for  the  adolescent's  subgroup,  which  is  endorsed  by  the  Rapporteur  due  to  the very small size of this subgroup.

Nevertheless, results obtained in the study 201832 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and  older  are  consistent  to  the  EU  summary  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  not  alter  the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory is action required.

## Adverse Events

## Summary of All Adverse Events

Table 21 presents an overview of all on-treatment AEs that occurred in this study. The proportion of participants who experienced AEs was similar during treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD (16%) and FP 250 BD (15%). One drug-related AE was reported in a participant whilst treated with FF/VI 100/25 OD. Two AEs (one during each of FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD treatments) led to withdrawal from the study. There was 1 SAE reported during treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD, which was not related to the study treatment. There were no fatal Aes in this study.

## Common On-treatment Adverse Events

There was a low number of on-treatment AEs reported in this study, and AE incidence was similar in participants  receiving  FF/VI  100/25  or  FP  250  BD  treatment.  During  either  treatment,  the  Medical Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  system  organ  class  (SOC)  with  the  most  frequently reported on-treatment AEs was Infections and Infestations (Table 22). The only AEs that occurred in ≥2  participants  during  either  treatment,  as  preferred  terms,  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection (URTI) (7% in FF/VI 100/25 OD and 6% in FP 250 BD) and gastroenteritis (3% in FF/VI 100/25 OD and 1% in FP 250 BD) (Table 23). All reports of URTI were mild in intensity and determined to be not related to the study drug by the investigator. During the FF/VI 100/25 treatment there was one report of  gastroenteritis  that  was  severe  in  intensity  and  reported  as  an  SAE.  The  other  incidences  of gastroenteritis  in  both  treatments  were  moderate  in  intensity.  All  reports  of  gastroenteritis  were considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug. The pattern of on-treatment AEs was comparable in the ITT (15 years or older). The ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population had fewer ontreatment  AEs,  with  two  reported  during  FF/VI  100/25  OD  treatment  and  one  during  FP  250  BD treatment (Table 3.4).

## Drug-related Adverse Events

One  drug-related  AE,  reported  as  increased  tendency  to  bruise,  occurred  during  FF/VI  100/25  OD treatment. This AE was mild in intensity and did not lead to study withdrawal. There were no drugrelated SAEs reported in this study.

## Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events

## Deaths

No participants died during the conduct of this study.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

One participant (1%) experienced an SAE whilst taking FF/VI 100/25 OD. There were no SAEs reported during FP 250 BD treatment. No drug-related AEs and no post-treatment SAEs were reported.

Participant 758 experienced a severe SAE of gastroenteritis that resolved within 11 days.

The event occurred 13 days after the commencement of treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD and was considered by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. The event did not lead to changes in treatment dose or withdrawal from the study. This participant was withdrawn from the study due to two other AEs.

## Adverse  Events  Leading  to  Permanent  Discontinuation  of  Study  Medication  or  Withdrawal  from  the Study

Two participants experienced an on-treatment AE leading to withdrawal from the study (Table 24):

One participant (1%) whilst receiving FF/VI 100/25 OD treatment and one participant (1%) whilst receiving FP 250 BD treatment. Neither of these events were SAEs nor considered related to study treatment.

One participant (Participant 758) experienced two non-serious AEs of moderate worsening of asthma and sinusitis, whilst receiving treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD, which led to study withdrawal. This participant also experienced an on-treatment SAE of severe gastroenteritis, two non-serious pre-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment AEs of mild tooth abscess and moderate bronchitis, none of which contributed to participant withdrawal from the study.

One participant (Participant 114) experienced a non-serious AE of cough while receiving treatment with FP 250 BD, which led to study withdrawal.

This participant also experienced a non-serious on-treatment AEs of mild URTI whilst also receiving FP 250 BD.

Additionally, one participant (Participant 504) was withdrawn from the study due to a severe asthma exacerbation which was a stopping criteria in the protocol. Asthma exacerbations were not reported as AEs in this study unless they met the definition of an SAE.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

On-treatment and post-treatment AEs of special interest (AESIs) were recorded for this study. AESIs are  AEs  associated  with  the  known  pharmacological  action  of  ICS  and  LABA  therapy.  AESIs  were identified using either standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs) or GSK-defined special interest terms.

The  incidence  of  AESIs  was  low  in  this  study,  and  similar  rates  of  incidence  were  reported  during treatment with FF/VI 100/25 OD (4%) or FP 250 BD (1%) (Table 25). No individual AESI occurred in &gt;1 participant when receiving FF/VI 100/25 OD or FP 250 BD. The participant who experienced cardiac arrhythmia  (preferred  term:  syncope)  was  not  the  same  participant  that  reported  a  past  medical history  of  arrhythmia  at  Screening.  The  incidence  of  on-treatment  and  post-treatment  AESIs  was comparable with the ITT (12 to 17 years old) Population (Table 3.18).

There were no reports of serious AESIs in this study. There were no reports of on-treatment or posttreatment pneumonia in this study.

## Asthma Exacerbations

Safety assessments in this study included monitoring for severe asthma exacerbations. Severe asthma exacerbations were not recorded as AEs unless the exacerbation met the definition of an SAE.

No participants  in  either  treatment  group  experienced  an  on-treatment  severe  asthma  exacerbation (Table 3.24).

One participant (Participant 504), a 12 year old male, experienced a post-treatment severe asthma exacerbation during the Wash-Out period following the completion of Treatment Period 1 with FF/VI 100/25  OD  (Table  3.24).  This  participant  required  systemic/oral  corticosteroids  and  was  withdrawn from the study as a result of this event. The exacerbation did not meet the definition of an SAE. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exacerbation was resolved within 28 days of onset. This study withdrawal was recorded as a lack of efficacy (worsening of asthma requiring additional asthma medication) (Table 4).

## Assessor's comments on safety data

Safety  results obtained in the study 201832 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and not alter the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory action is required.

The safety data for  (ITT [12-17 Years Old] Population) has been provided separately in the study report and were consistent withe the ITT poplulation.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  FF/VI  100/25  OD  compared  with  FP  250  BD  in protection against EIB in adolescent and adult participants aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma with EIB.

A  total  of  75  subjects  were  randomized,  of  whom  74  were  included  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT) Population, and 66 were included in the Per Protocol (PP) Population. The primary endpoint was not met. There was no significant difference in maximal percent decrease in FEV1 from pre-exercise FEV1 at 12 hours post-dose on Day 14 between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD treatment (15.02% and 16.71%,  respectively,  treatment  difference:  -1.69%  points,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  -3.76, 0.39).  As  this  study  used  a  hierarchical  design  and  the  primary  endpoint  did  not  reach  statistical significance no further statistical inference could be made on the secondary or other endpoints of this study.

In conclusion, the results did not show a significant difference between FF/VI 100/25 OD and FP 250 BD in protection against EIB. Both products had an acceptable safety profile.

GlaxoSmithKline has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that they are in line with the approved  product  information  in  the  EU.  Therefore,  no  changes  to  the  Product  Information  are considered necessary.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Relvar  Ellipta/  Relvinty  Ellipta  have  been  authorised  for  use  as  once  daily  treatment  of  persistent asthma  in  adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older.  In  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) No1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of the study number 201832.

Study 201832 was designed to assess the efficacy of FF/VI 100/25 OD compared with FP 250 BD in protection against EIB in adolescent and adult participants aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma with EIB. The primary endpoint was not met.

17 subjects (23%) from ITT Population which aged less than 18 years were also randomized to the treatment groups. Disaggregated demographic, efficacy or safety data have been provided in the study report and were consistent with the ITT population. The MAH has not presented any separate statistical analysis for the adolescents subgroup, which is endorsed by the Rapporteur due to the very small size of this subgroup.

Nevertheless, results obtained in the study 201832 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and not alter the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory action is required.
