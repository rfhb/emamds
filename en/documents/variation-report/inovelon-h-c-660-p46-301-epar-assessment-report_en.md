## I. INTRODUCTION

On March 31 th 2014, the MAH submitted the synoptic clinical study report for study E2080-J081305  for INOVELON  (rufinamide),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  the  Regulation  (EC)  No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.

The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for INOVELON and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

On  August  11 th 2014,  as  requested,  Eisai  Ltd  submits  to  the  EMA  the  responses  to  the Outstanding Questions.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## II.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical study

The  study  was  conducted  using  Inovelon  tablet  formulation  since  an  alternative  paediatric formulation  was  not  available  at  this  time.  Eisai  Limited  had  since  been  granted  a  marketing approval  for  a  line  extension  MAA  for  an  oral  suspension  formulation  for  use  in  children (Commission decision issued on 21/11/2011).

## II.2 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

Study  E2080-J081-305 was a multicentre long term extension study, to  evaluate  the  long  term safety  and  tolerability  of  rufinamide  under  the  open-label  treatment  in  patients  with  LennoxGastaut syndrome (LGS) who completed the phase 3 placebo-controlled, double-blind, comparative study (study E2080-J081-304).

## 2. Clinical study

## Methods

<!-- image -->

- a: In the Conversion Period, Study Drug A (double-blind; rufinamide or placebo tablets) was switched to the Study Drug B (open-label; rufinamide tablets) in a step-by-step mammer.

The Pre-conversion Period was designed to avoid breaking the blindness in the preceding Study 304 and to prevent any data obtained in the open-label treatment in Study 305 from affecting the evaluation in the Study 304. Under double-blind condition, subjects were treated with the same

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study drug as in the Study 304 (the Study Drug A; rufinamide or placebo) until the evaluation data of the Study 304 for each subject were fixed.

In the Conversion Period, subjects who were on placebo were titrated to the appropriate dose of rufinamide (the Study Drug B) within 2 weeks under double-blind condition.

The long term safety and efficacy of rufinamide were evaluated under the open-label treatment in the  Maintenance  Period.  The  daily  dose  at  the  end  of  the  Conversion  Period  was  used  as  the initial dose for the Maintenance Period. Treatment of rufinamide (the Study Drug B) was allowed to be  continued  as  long  as  the  subject  and  legally  authorized  representative  desired  to  keep receiving rufinamide and the investigator permitted that.

The Maintenance Period was allowed to continue until rufinamide was launched in Japan and was to  be  commercially  available  in  the  respective  study  sites.  This  study  was  conducted  as  a registration study before the launch and as a post-marketing study after that.

The  study  was  to  finish  within  around  3  months  after  the  price  listing  of  rufinamide.  In  case subjects discontinued the study, the study drug was to be tapered (Follow-up Period), but subjects who completed Study 305 were allowed to continue receiving rufinamide as a commercial drug without tapering.

The study drug was administered orally twice daily after breakfast and dinner.

## 1. Pre-conversion Period

Under double-blind condition, subjects were treated with the same study drug as in the Study 304 (the Study Drug A; rufinamide or placebo). As a general rule, the dose was to be maintained at the dose of the final evaluation (Week 12) in the Study 304.

When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns on a subject who completed the Study 304 at the target maintenance dose, a 1- step reduction from the target maintenance dose was allowed. This reduction was performed from the next morning of the judgment, if feasible. Returning to the previous dose (ie, the target maintenance dose) after the reduction was prohibited.

In  subjects  for  whom  the  dose  had  been  reduced  from  the  target  maintenance  dose  by  the completion  of  the  Study  304,  further  dose  reduction  was  prohibited  under  any  circumstances. Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if further dose reduction was judged to be necessary for safety reasons by the investigator

For reference, dose steps to the target maintenance dose depended on the subject's weight in the Study 304 are shown in Table 1.

a: Target maintenance dose for each body weight category.

## 2. Conversion Period

Under double-blind conditions, subjects who were on placebo were titrated to the appropriate dose of rufinamide within 2 weeks in a manner similar to the dose steps shown above. Study Drug A (double-blind;  rufinamide  or  placebo  tablets)  was  switched  to  the  Study  Drug  B  (open-label; rufinamide tablets) in a step-by-step manner by 2 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Daily number of tablets on the final day of the Pre-conversion Period (constant) = Daily number of tablets of the Study Drug A (taper off by 2 days) + Daily number of tablets of the Study Drug B (gradual increase by 2 days)

If a safety problem was observed during conversion, the conversion could be suspended and daily numbers of tablets of the Study Drug A and Study Drug B were maintained temporarily.

Even  in  such  a  case,  the  conversion  was  to  be  completed  by  2  days  before  the  end  of  the Conversion Period.

When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns on a subject who had completed the conversion, a 1-step reduction was allowed only for subjects who had administered at  the  target  maintenance  dose.  This  reduction  was  performed  from  the  next morning of the judgment, if feasible. Returning to the previous dose (ie, the target maintenance dose) after the reduction was prohibited.

## 3. Maintenance Period

As a general rule, the dose of rufinamide (Study Drug B) at the end of the Conversion Period was to be maintained throughout the Maintenance Period.

When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns, a 1step reduction from the target maintenance dose was allowed. This reduction was performed from the next morning of the judgment, if feasible.

In subjects for whom the dose had been reduced 1-step from the target maintenance dose by the end  of  the  Conversion  Period,  further  dose  reduction  during  the  Maintenance  Period  was prohibited. Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if further dose reduction was judged to be necessary for safety reasons by the investigator.

Dose  increase  to  the  target  maintenance  dose  was  allowed  only  when  the  investigator  judged necessary.  Administrations  at  a  higher  dose  than  the  target  maintenance  dose  was  prohibited under any circumstances.

Even when the body weight changed during the study period, dose adjustment based on the new weight category was not to be conducted in the registration study part.

However, since rufinamide had been launched in Japan, the maintenance dose was to follow the approved dosage. In such a case, dose adjustment based on the new weight category might be allowed as long as same tablet form (100 mg tablet or 200 mg tablet) was used.

In subjects who completed Study 305 and continued receiving rufinamide as a commercial drug, tapering of rufinamide and the Follow-up Period were not required.

## 4. Follow-up Period (Tapering; when discontinuing the study)

As a general rule, the dose was reduced by step-by-step every 2 days. The dose reduction was started from the next morning of the study discontinuation decided by the investigator, if feasible. Dose reduction could be postponed and the current dose maintained temporarily by the judgment of the investigator only if there was a safety problem. Even in this case, study drug administration was to be terminated at least by 12 days after start tapering.

Dose steps for tapering rufinamide are shown in Table 2.

## · Study Participants

Patients were included if they had completed the 304 study:

The key criteria for inclusion in study 304 were as follows

- Patients who were diagnoses with LGS with tonic-atonic seizures and typical absence seizures)
- Male and female subjects between 12 and 30 years of age, inclusive;
- Patients whose body weight at the start of the Observation Period was at least 15 kg;
- At least 90 seizures episodes during the 28 days before the start of the Observation Period;
- Current treatment with 1 to 3 approved AEDs, within 28 days prior to the Observation Period and had not changed the drug type;
-  Patients  who  had  a  slow  spike-and-wave  pattern  in  an  EEG  within  6  months  prior  to  the Observation Period.

Exclusion criteria were: Patients who were judged by investigators that they were not appropriate to participate in this clinical study for safety reasons based on the subject information etc. collected up to the evaluation of the end of Treatment Period in the Study 304, patients who were highly likely  to  be  noncompliant  with  treatment  during  the  study  Period,  patients  judged  to  be inappropriate for study participation.

## · Objectives

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

- To evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of rufinamide under the open-label treatment in patients  with  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  who  completed  the  phase  3  placebo-controlled, double-blind, comparative study (E2080-J081-304 study, herein after as Study 304).

## SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

- To evaluated the long term efficacy of rufinamide under the open-label treatment in patients with LGS who completed the Study 304.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy outcome: Percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency, percent change in the total  seizure  frequency,  percent  change  in  the  frequency  of  seizures  other  than  tonic-atonic seizures, and 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% responder, and aggravated subjects in tonic-atonic seizure frequency.

## Safety outcomes:

Adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, blood pressure, pulse rate, physical examination, and 12lead ECG.

## · Statistical methods

## Efficacy

For  percent  change  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency,  the  total  seizure  frequency,  and  the frequency of seizures other than tonic-atonic seizures, the summary statistics were calculated for the entire Efficacy Analysis Set and for each treatment group in Study 304.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% responder, and aggravated subjects in tonic-atonic seizure frequency, responder (or aggravated) rates were calculated for the entire Efficacy Analysis Set and for each treatment group in Study 304. For percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency and the total seizure frequency, median percent change was plotted by visit for each treatment group in Study 304.

## Safety

Adverse  events  were  coded  using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA) Version  13.0.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  and  treatment  related  TEAEs  were summarized for  the  entire  Safety  Analysis  Set  and  for  each  treatment  group  in  Study  304,  the number and percent of subjects having any adverse event in each primary system organ class (SOC)  and  having  each  preferred  term  (PT).  In  addition,  TEAEs  and  treatment  related  TEAEs were  tabulated  by  causal  relationship  with  the  study  drug  or  by  severity.  For  laboratory  tests (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), vital  signs  (blood  pressure,  pulse  rate,  and  body weight),  and  12-lead  ECG  (heart  rate,  PR  interval,  QRS  amplitude,  QT  interval,  and  QTc),  the summary statistics of the observed value at each assessment time point, and changes from the end  of  the  Observation  Period  in  Study  304  (baseline)  were  calculated  for  the  entire  Safety Analysis  Set  and  for  each  treatment  group.  Urinalysis  data  were  subjected  to  cross-tabulation between the end of the Observation Period in Study 304 (baseline) and each assessment time point after the start of treatment.

All of the 54 subjects who entered Study 305 received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Of the 54 treated  subjects,  41  subjects  (75.9%)  completed  the  study  (ie,  kept  administered  rufinamide  in Study  305  until  commercial  drug  of  rufinamide  was  prescribed)  and  13  subjects  (24.1%) discontinued the study.

Primary reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent due to insufficient therapeutic effect (7  subjects),  withdrawal  of  consent  for  a  reason  other  than  insufficient  effect  (2  subjects),  and adverse event (4 subjects).

Efficacy Analysis Set: 46 (23 in the rufinamide group, 23 in the placebo group), 8 subjects have no evaluable efficacy data.

Safety Analysis Set: 54 (25 in the rufinamide group, 29 in the placebo group).

## Demographic and other baseline characteristics

In  the  Efficacy  Analysis  Set  (46  subjects),  65.2%  (30  subjects)  were  males  and  34.8%  (16 subjects) were females. The mean age was 15.2 years, and 39.1% (18 subjects) were younger than 12 years old. The mean weight was 39.45 kg, and more than 40% of the subjects were in the range of 15.0 to 30.0 kg. The mean duration of LGS was 10.61 years. The subjects experienced a median of 268.20 seizures, including 220.85 tonic-atonic seizures, per 28 days.

## Assessor's comments:

Patients aged ≥ 4 to &lt; 17 years were considered as the paediatric population. Taking into account that  the  definition  of  paediatric  population  included  children  until  18  years  old.  The  number  of patients  between  17  and  18  years  old  in  each  arm  should  be  provided  and  the  MAH  should discuss the impact of these patients in the different results.

Tables with demographic and other baseline characteristics (age, sex, body  weight, duration of LGS,….)  and summary of seizure frequency and type of seizure should be submitted.

Issue resolved after further clarification was provided (see section III)

## Assessor's comments:

The  median  percent  changes  in  total  seizure  frequency  relative  to  baseline  were  -47.70%,  48.90%, -50.60%, -52.00%, and -47.35% in Weeks 12, 24, 32, 40, and 52, respectively.

## Overall assessor's comments on efficacy:

The MAH provided a synoptic clinical study report. Results of clinical efficacy outcome showed a therapeutic benefit of long-term use of rufinamide in japanese patients with LGS. Nevertheless, these data should be completed.  Summary of percent change in the frequency of seizures other than tonic-atonic seizures, summary of aggravated subjects in tonic-atonic seizure frequency as well as subgroups analyses performed should be submitted.

Issue resolved after further clarification was provided (see section III)

## II.3 Safety evaluation

## 1. Patient exposure

The median duration of exposure to rufinamide was 818.00 days (range 13.5 to 1042.5 days), and 70.4% (38/54 subjects) received rufinamide for 2 years or more.

The median durations of exposure to rufinamide by treatment group in Study 304 were  888.50 days (range 139.0 to 1042.5 days) and 762.50 days (range 13.5 to 930.5 days) in rufinamide and placebo group, respectively.

## Assessor's comments:

The  MAH  did  not  transmit  a  summary  of  the  number,  age  and  sex  of  the  enrolled  paediatric patients for study 305. All the patients included in the study 305 had completed study 304 before. The population is slightly older as expected.

Of note, some demographics data were transmitted in Japanese language and with no synthetic table for study 305. In the next potential PAM, all the documents should be translated in English. Only English language is requested.

The MAH provided all safety analysis data into 3 categories of age: ≥4 - &lt;12, ≥12 - &lt;17 and ≥17. However paediatric population should have included all patients younger than 18 years. This data presentation risked to slightly underestimate the number of AEs in paediatric population.

The MAH should provide AEs experienced by patients between 17 and 18 years old in each arms and discuss the impact of these patients on the safety analysis.

Issue resolved after further clarification was provided (see section III)

## 2. Adverse events

Table  6  presents  an  overview  of  TEAEs.  All  of  the  54  subjects  who  received  rufinamide experienced TEAEs, and 38 subjects (70.4%) experienced TEAEs that were considered possibly or probably related to administration of study drug in study 304. Severe TEAEs were reported in 3 subjects (5.6%) and severe treatment-related TEAEs were also reported in the same subjects.

Adverse events occurred during the first dose of rufinamide (in Study 304 for rufinamide group and in Study 305 for placebo group) and the last visit were defined as TEAEs.

For each row category, a subject with 2 or more TEAEs in that category is counted only once.

b: Only includes TEAEs occurred after the first dose of rufinamide in Study 305.

a: Includes TEAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug.

c: Serious criterion was an adverse event which required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for all serious TEAEs.

Common TEAEs (≥5%) of total subjects and common treatment-related TEAEs are summarized by  MedDRA  SOC  and  PT  in  Table  7  and  Table  8,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported TEAEs  (≥30%)  in  total  subjects  (N=54)  were  nasopharyngitis  (29  subjects;  53.7%),  status epilepticus  (23  subjects;  42.6%),  and  somnolence  (18  subjects;  33.3%).  The  most  frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs (≥10%) in total subjects were somnolence (11 subjects; 20.4%), decreased appetite (9 subjects; 16.7%), status epilepticus (7 subjects; 13.0%), constipation, and vomiting (6 subjects each; 11.1%).

Serious  TEAEs  were  reported  in 9  subjects  (16.7%)  in  study  305.  No  cases  of  death  were reported in Study 305. The 9 TAES are summarised herafter and concern 2 cases of satus epilepticus,  one  case  of  dental  caries,  and  the  other  were  infection  cases  (pneumonia, influenza and gastroenteral viral) . TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were reported in 3 subjects (5.6%) in Study 305.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## - Subject ID10021002 9 yo Male

Treatment Group in Study 304: rufinamide

## Event (preferred term): status epilepticus (3 times)

On  15  Dec  2010,  informed  consent  for  rufinamide  double-blind  clinical  study  (Study  304)  was obtained and Observation Period started. Concomitant antiepilepsy drugs included 400 mg/day of

Selenica-R granules (sodium valproate) 40%, 140 mg/day of Excegran powder (zonisamide) 20%, and  70  mg/day  of  Phenobal  powder  10%.  Number  of  seizures:  tonic  seizure,  47  per  30  days; partial seizure, 170 per 30 days; atonic seizure, 28 per 30 days; myoclonic seizure, 7 per 30 days. On 12 Jan 2011, rufinamide was initiated. Number of seizures: tonic seizure, 4 per week; partial seizure, 18 per week; atonic seizure, 1 per week; myoclonic seizure, 1 per week.

On  06  Apr  2011,  informed  consent  for  rufinamide  long-term  study  (Study  305)  was  obtained. Number of seizures: tonic seizure, 5 per week; partial seizure, 2 per week; atonic seizure, 2 per week; myoclonic seizure, 6 per week.

The  1st  SAE  of  status  epilepticus  was  reported  on  August  2011,  8  months  after  the  start  of Rufinamide), recovered after treatment (midazolam). The investigator reported that the interaction between the study drug and the antiepilepsy drugs was believed to have increased PB (Phenobal) level  followed  by  decreased  VPA  (Selenica-R)  level,  resulting  in  atypical  absence  status epilepticus.

The second SAE of status epilepticus was reported on June 2012, 18 months after the start of rufinamide, recovered after treatment (midazolam).  According to the investigator, It was likely to be caused by the seasonal reason and the blood ammonia elevation caused by VPA. However, the possibility of the relationship with the study drug cannot be ruled out completely

The  third  SAE  of  status  epilepticus  was  reported  on  March  2014,  27  months  after  the  start  of rufinamide. The patient was not doing well after suffering from influenza type B which appeared on Mar 2013, a decreased blood concentration of VPA was observed at the time of the SAE.

- a:Mean daily dose (mg/day) of the prescription period in which the event occured (in case the event occuured after discontimuation of admimistration, the mean daily dose of the last prescription period).
- b: Ouset date of the event -- date of the first admimistration of nufinamide + 1 (day).

## Assessor's comments:

The most frequently reported TAES in total subjects (during both studies) were nasopharyngitis (29  subjects;  53.7%),  status  epilepticus  (23  subjects;  42.6%),  and  somnolence  (18  subjects; 33.3%).  The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  (≥10%)  in  total  subjects  were somnolence (11 subjects; 20.4%), decreased appetite (9 subjects; 16.7%), status epilepticus (7 subjects;  13.0%),  constipation,  and  vomiting (6 subjects  each;  11.1%). In  study  305  3  cases of status epilepticus were reported. Status epilepticus, constipation and nasopharyngitis are listed in the  Eu  Smpc.  Vomiting,  somnolence  and  Status  epilepticus  are  considered  important  identified risks under close monitoring in the PSUR.

No new safety concerns were emerged from this analysis.

## III. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED

## Efficacy

## Question 1

Tables of demographic and baseline characteristics of patient included should be submitted (age, sex, weight, duration of LGS, type and number of seizures during each phase).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH's response

Study  E2080-J081-305  (Study  305)  was  an  extension  study  of  Study  E2080-J081-304  (Study 304).

Therefore  demographic  information  was  not  newly  collected  at  the  start  of  Study  305.  Table  1 shows  summary  of  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  for  46  patients  in  Efficacy Analysis Set in Study 305. The paediatric population was reconsidered involving patients up to and including 18 years of age. There were 2 patients in the 17 and 18 years old group (both of them were in placebo group in Study 304). Table 2 shows summary of seizure frequency during the baseline phase and type of seizure in Efficacy Analysis Set in Study 305. There is no impact to the previous conclusion.

Sum of tonic seizures and atonic seizures

a

## Assessor's comments:

During the Observation Period slightly higher frequency were observed in the rufinamide group for tonic-atonic seizures and for tonic and atonic seizure frequency. The median frequencies of partial seizures and atypical absence seizure were higher in the placebo group. Overall, no imbalance in the frequency distribution between the 2 groups were observed in the median frequency (per 28 days) of other seizures.

Issue resolved.

## Question 2

Complete  results  of  primary  efficacy  outcomes  and  results  of  subgroups  analyses  performed should be submitted. Summary of percent change in the frequency of seizures other than tonicatonic  seizures,  summary  of  aggravated  subjects  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency  as  well  as subgroups analyses performed should be submitted.

## Assessor's comments:

As  observed  for  tonic-atonic  seizure,  the  median  percent  change  in  frequency  from  the Observation Period to the Treatment Period in the FAS for other types of seizure, the frequency decreased significantly in the rufinamide group compared to the placebo group.

50% responder rate in tonic-atonic seizure frequency is higher in the rufinamide group.

Increase in tonic-atonic seizure frequency is higher in the placebo group.

Issue resolved.

## Safety

The MAH should provide AEs experienced by patients between 17 and 18 years old in each arms and discuss the impact of these patients on the safety analysis.

## MAH's response

Table  5  shows  the  incidence  of  all  treatment-emergent  AEs  by  age  group.  The  paediatric population was reconsidered including subjects up to 18 years of age. There is no impact to the previous conclusion.

## IV. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The submitted efficacy results of this study provides some evidence of the long-term efficacy of rufinamide in japanese patients with LGS.

The safety data coming from assessment of the open-labelled Study 305 were consistent with the known  safety profile of rufinamide. Most  frequently reported  adverse  events  were comparable to the most frequent adverse reactions listed in the currently approved SmPC for INOVELON.
