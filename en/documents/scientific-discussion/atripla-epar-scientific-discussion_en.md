## 1. Introduction

Worldwide there are currently approximately 40 million persons living with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Of these, over 700,000 people are living within the EU, Norway and Iceland.

The applicant did apply for accelerated assessment of the application. The CHMP did not accept the request for accelerated assessment as the applicant's argumentation did not provide evidence that the triple combination meets an unmet medical need. The difference between two tablets once daily to one tablet daily was not necessarily regarded as clinically meaningful and none of the references provided by the applicant did investigate this issue hence the claimed impact could not be quantified in medical epidemiological terms. Furthermore, a bioequivalence trial, which was the pivotal basis of the initial application, could not be used to identify a clear advantage in terms of a clinically relevant benefit over  existing  therapies.  Based  on  the  claims  and  description  of  the  available  data  provided  by  the applicant, it was not possible to assume that the product will be of major public health interest.

The goal of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and increase the duration  of  survival  by  achieving  maximal  and  prolonged  suppression  of  HIV-1  replication.  The standard of care for treatment involves the use of a combination of antiretroviral agents, typically a combination  of  at  least  three  active  substances,  including  a  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) and two active substances from the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor class (NRTI/NtRTI). Antiretroviral  regimens  might  imply  a  high  pill  burden  and  a  frequency  of  administration  hardly compatible with the patient's daily life. Furthermore, to achieve successful long-term treatment, the prevention  of  drug  resistance  has  become  the  most  significant  challenge.  Incomplete  adherence  to antiretroviral regimens is an important factor contributing to the development of viral resistance and treatment failure. Therefore, there continues to be a need for new treatments that combine potent and sustained efficacy with acceptable tolerability and minimal long-term toxicity, as well as practical and convenient dosing regimens. Atripla contains a fixed-dose combination of three active substances: efavirenz (an NNRTI), emtricitabine (an NRTI), and tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, an NtRTI). It is intended to provide combination antiretroviral therapy for administration as a single, once-daily tablet for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. The  rationale  for  the  development  of  this  fixed-dose  combination  is  that  the  individual  active substances have shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and that  their  combined  use  is  recommended  in  national  and  international  HIV-1  infection  treatment guidelines (e.g. national European guidelines, US guidelines and WHO guidelines) due to a lack of cross-resistance,  dual  antagonism  and  significant  overlap  in  toxicities,  respectively.  The  fixed combination hence aims to simplify regimens and to improve adherence to therapy. A so-called 'application for fixed combination medicinal product' has been submitted for Atripla. All individual substances of Atripla are authorised in the EEA via a Community procedure: efavirenz as Sustiva/Stocrin (EU/1/99/110/001-009, EU/1/99/111/001-009), emtricitabine as Emtriva (EU/1/03/261/001-003),  and  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  as  Viread  (EU/1/01/200/001).  Moreover, the fixed-combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF has been approved as Truvada (EU/1/04/305/001). The Marketing Authorisation Holders for all above-mentioned medicinal products authorised  the  applicant  for  Atripla  to  make  cross-reference  to  data  previously  submitted  to  these Marketing Authorisations and authorised the EMEA and the CHMP including their experts to refer to and  review  any  data  previously  submitted  to  the  above-mentioned  Marketing  Authorisations  as required for the review of the Marketing Authorisation Application for Atripla.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Atripla is available in film-coated tablets containing 600 mg efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). The recommended dose is one tablet taken orally once daily on an empty stomach at bedtime.

The claimed indication read as follows: 'Atripla is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. It is indicated for use alone as a single tablet regimen or in combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults.'

Active Substances

<!-- image -->

The approved indication is: 'Atripla  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate.  It  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus-1  (HIV-1) infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months.  Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have  harboured  virus  strains  with  mutations  conferring  significant  resistance  to  any  of  the three components contained in Atripla prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The demonstration of the benefit of Atripla is primarily based on 24-week data from a clinical study  in  which  patients  with  stable  virologic  suppression  on  a  combination  antiretroviral therapy  changed  to  Atripla  (see section 5.1).  No  data  are  currently  available  from  clinical studies with Atripla in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients. No data are available to support the combination of Atripla and other antiretroviral agents.' 2. Quality aspects Introduction Atripla  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  a  fixed  combination  of  600  mg  of  efavirenz, 200 mg  emtricitabine  and  245  mg  of  tenofovir  disoproxil  (as  fumarate),  equivalent  to  136  mg  of tenofovir. The other ingredients include croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropylcellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauril sulphate, purified water and colorants. The film coat consists of black iron oxide, macrogol, polyvinyl alcohol, red iron oxide, talc and titanium dioxide. The  tablets  are  packed  in  an  HDPE  bottle  containing  silica  gel  desiccant  and  a  polypropylene continuous-thread child resistant cap with an induction activated aluminium foil. Three  active  substances  are  used  in  this  fixed  combination  product,  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and tenofovir disoproxil. Efavirenz Medicinal product no longer authorised

Its chemical name  is (S)-6-Chloro-4-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,1 benzoxazin-2-one  according  to  the  IUPAC  nomenclature.  Efavirenz  is  a  white  to  slightly  pink crystalline  powder  and  it  is  soluble  in  various  organic  solvents  but  insoluble  in  water.  The  abovementioned active substance has one chiral centre and is used as a single enantiomer (S).

## Manufacture

Efavirenz  can  be  synthesised  in  two  or  four  reactions  steps.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included. Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented.

Structure elucidation has been performed by 1 H-NMR  spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR  spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectroscopy. The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis of the (-)-camphanic imide derivative of efavirenz.

The molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis which is in agreement with the expected molecular weight. Specification The  efavirenz  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (UV,  IR,  HPLC),  assay, impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), Residue on ignition (Ph.Eur.), completeness and clarity of solution (Ph.Eur.), particle size, water content (Karl-Fisher), specific rotation (Ph.Eur.) and residual solvents (GC). It  was  verified  that  all  specifications  reflect  the  relevant  quality  attributes  of  the  efavirenz.  The analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch. Stability The stability results from long-term, accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  efavirenz.  This  active  substance  is  susceptible  to degradation under the influence of light since the discoloration of the surface of the active substance and  increase  of  an  impurity  was  observed  during  a  photostability  study.  Therefore,  the  active substance requires protection from light. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies fulfil the proposed specification and for that reason support the proposed retest period. Emtricitabine The  chemical  name  of  emtricitabine  is  5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5yl]cytosine according to the IUPAC nomenclature. It is a white to off-white powder and it is freely soluble  in  various  aqueous  solutions,  slightly  soluble  in  acetonitrile  and  very  slightly  soluble  in isopropyl acetate. · Manufacture Medicinal product no longer authorised

Emtricitabine can be synthesised in three reactions steps including two alternative options. Comparative batch analysis data for this active substance produced by the 2 processes show that the physical  properties  of  the  active  substance  remain  unchanged.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been adequately  described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls included. Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the impurity profile of emtricitabine synthesised by the both processes has been fully characterised.

Structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  infrared  absorption,  ultraviolet  spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The proposed molecular structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis.

## · Specification

The emtricitabine specification include tests for appearance, identification (IR and HPLC), clarity of solution, water content (Ph.Eur), enantiomeric purity, assay, impurities, heavy metals (PhEur), residue on ignition (PhEur), residual solvents and particle size.

It  was  verified  that  all  specifications  for  this  particular  active  substance  reflect  the  relevant  quality attributes of emtricitabine. The analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines.

Impurities  were  well  described,  classified  as  process  related  impurities  and  possible  degradation products,  and  qualified.  Residual  solvents  were  satisfactorily  controlled  in  the  active  substance according to  the  relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were provided.  Furthermore,  all  batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  specifications  and  show  a  good uniformity from batch to batch. · Stability The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of emtricitabine. It was confirmed that this active substance is  not  susceptible  to  degradation  under  the  influence  of  light.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that emtricitabine  is  not  sensitive  to  light  and  does  not  require  protection  from  light.  The  results  of  the long-term  and  accelerated  studies  fulfil  the  proposed  specification  and  for  that  reason  support  the agreed retest period. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is 9-[(R)-2[[Bis[(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy]methoxy]-phosphinyl]methoxy]propyl]adenine fumarate (1:1) according  to  the  IUPAC  nomenclature.  Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  is  a  white  to  off-white crystalline powder  and  it is freely  soluble  in  dimethylformamide,  soluble  in  methanol,  acid hydrochloride (0.1 N HCL), ethanol, sparingly soluble in acetone, isopropanol, water, slightly soluble in  acetonitrile,  ethyl  acetate,  insoluble  in  dichloromethane,  hexane,  diethyl  ether,  di-n-butyl  ether, isopropylether.  The  above-mentioned active substance has one chiral centre and is used as a single enantiomer (R). · Manufacture Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is synthesised in four reactions steps.

Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate.  The  results  of  the photostability  testing  confirm  that  the  active  substance  is  not  susceptible  to  degradation  under  the influence of light. In this context, no protection from light is needed. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies fulfil the proposed specification and for that reason support the agreed retest period and storage conditions.

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing processes such as wet granulation, dry granulation, milling, blending, compressing and film coating. Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. The  manufacturing  process  including  intermediate  products  and  critical  steps  were  adequately validated.

Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The proposed medicinal product combining the currently approved doses of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate into a single tablet to be administered once daily intends to support patient  adherence  to  treatment.  In  this  context,  the  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to develop a single formulation containing 600 mg efavirenz, 200 mg emtricitabine and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, such that the physical and chemical properties of each active substance could be accommodated. Furthermore, the objectives in the development of this formulation was to develop a formulation  with  high  drug  load,  minimize  physical  and  chemical  interactions,  ensure  adequate chemical stability of the drug product and of the active substances, develop a robust formulation and an efficient manufacturing process. In  this  context,  distinct  manufacturing  process  approaches  and  different  formulations  containing slightly different excipients were investigated and optimised. Having investigated different formulations  and  taken  into  account  the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  each  of  the  active substances,  the  manufacturing  process  selected  involves  the  preparation  of  a  wet  granulation  of efavirenz and a dry granulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The granulations are  blended separately with extra-granular magnesium stearate, compressed into bilayer tablets, and then  film-coated.  Process  optimization  studies  were  conducted  in  order  to  establish  critical  process parameters  for  the  wet  granulation  of  efavirenz,  dry  granulation  of  emtricitabine/tenofovir,  bilayer tablet compression, and aqueous film-coating operations. Furthermore, a particular challenge was to develop a suitable dissolution methodology which would be discriminatory for each active substance in the product, when linked to in vivo parameters taken from bioequivalence  studies  with  different  formulations.  Some  investigations  have  been  performed  to evaluate the discriminatory power of the dissolution method. However, the current dissolution method conditions  for  the  quality  control  of  the  drug  product  are  not  considered  as  sufficiently  suitable  to ensure batch to batch consistency and to ensure that future batches have the same quality in terms of dissolution  than  the  biobatch  used  in  the  relevant  bioequivalent  study.  The  conditions  of  the dissolution  method  for  routine  quality  control  should  be  improved  in  order  to  obtain  an  optimal discriminating in-vitro dissolution method for all of the three drug substances.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

## Product Specification

The proposed release and shelf life specifications provided contain the quality relevant characteristics required  for  this  pharmaceutical  form.  Furthermore,  they  were  established  according  the  ICH guidelines  and  include  the  following  tests:  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  TLC),  water  content (Karl Fischer), assay, degradation product content, content uniformity (HPLC) and dissolution.

All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  drug  product  were  properly  described. Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH guidelines.

The rationale  for  the  fixed  combination  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  is  to  simplify HIV-treatment regimens and to improve adherence to therapy by providing combination antiretroviral therapy for administration as a single, once-daily tablet. The individual active substances are already approved to be used together in combination therapy of HIV-1 infected patients. The Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products (CHMP/EMEA/CHMP/SWP/ 258498/2005,  draft)  recognises  the  principal  need  to  design  the  non-clinical  study  programme  for  a fixed combination depending on the available data for the compounds to be combined as well as the intended clinical use.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications. Stability of the Product The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. Three primary batches of  the  drug  product  have  been  stored  at  long  term,  intermediate  and  accelerated  conditions  in  the proposed market packaging. One  production  batch  was  stored  under  elevated  temperature  conditions  for  3  months  and  at  ICH conditions, another production batch was stored under high temperature and humidity conditions for 3 months and finally another production batch was stored for photostability at ICH conditions. Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months and the storage precautions 'Store in the original package. Keep the bottle tightly closed.' as stated in the SPC are acceptable. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Overall, information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the  finished  product.  A  particular  challenge  in  the  pharmaceutical  development  of  this  product  has been how to balance the different physicochemical attributes of three different active substances in one formulation. Furthermore, the development of a suitably-discriminating dissolution test for all active substances  has  presented  a  particularly  difficult  challenge.  At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  Opinion,  this methodology had not been completely  optimised  and  should  be  therefore  improved.  Therefore,  the applicant was required to give an assurance that the methodology would be optimised in a satisfactory manner  post-authorisation,  in  the  form  of  a  follow-up  measure,  to  be  resolved  within  an  agreed timeframe. 3. Non-clinical aspects Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comprehensive non-clinical study programmes have been performed for efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. The applicant claimed that all definitive non-clinical toxicity and toxicokinetic studies of  these  programmes  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  applicable  guidelines  and  under  GLP conditions.

No additional non-clinical safety studies have been performed that were relevant for the assessment of the  fixed-combination  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF.  The  above-mentioned  draft guideline on non-clinical development programmes for fixed combinations states that safety studies in animals  are  in  general  not  required  when  the  fixed  combination  under  development  includes compounds  for  which  there  is  sufficiently  documented  human  experience  of  their  individual  and combined  use.  Furthermore,  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Fixed  Combination  Medicinal  Products (CHMP/EWP/240/95) specifies that in the case of combinations for long term use safety studies in animals  will  not  be  required  when  safety  data  on  300-600  patients  for  six  month  or  longer  are available.

In national and international HIV-1 infection treatment guidelines (e.g. national European guidelines, US guidelines and WHO guidelines) efavirenz in combination with emtricitabine or lamivudine and tenofovir DF is recommended as a preferred regimen for initial therapy. Furthermore, data from the following clinical studies investigating the combined use of the three active substances is presented in the section 'Clinical aspects': · 144-week and 168-week data from study GS-01-934; · 24-week data from study GS-US-164-0107; · 24-week data from study AI266073. Furthermore,  supportive  data  from  the  clinical  study  GS-99-903  investigating  a  combination  of lamivudine  (which  in  principle  can  be  considered  very  similar  to  emtricitabine)  together  with efavirenz  and  tenofovir  DF  was  provided.  Also  there  is  post-marketing  data  from  the  individual components of the triple combination as well as from the fixed combination itself. Due  to  this  sufficiently  documented  clinical  evidence  of  the  use  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and tenofovir DF in combination for the treatment of HIV-1 infection the CHMP considered the lack of additional non-clinical safety studies for the fixed combination justified. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics / Secondary pharmacodynamics The  mechanisms  of  action  and  the  effects  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  have  been extensively investigated and are well-established. All three active substances are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1, weak inhibitors of human DNA polymerases, and show low potential to induce mitochondrial toxicity: · Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1. Its activity is mediated predominantly by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. HIV-2 and human cell polymerases α , β , γ , and δ are not inhibited by efavirenz. · Emtricitabine (FTC)  is  a  synthetic  nucleoside  analogue  of  cytidine  that  is  very  similar  in structure  to  lamivudine  (3TC).  After  phosphorylation  via  phosphorylases  in  T-cells  and  in non-dividing  monocytic  cells,  emtricitabine  triphosphate  (FTC-TP)  acts  to  competitively inhibit  HIV-1  reverse  transcriptase  and  functions  as  a  chain  terminator.  Emtricitabine triphosphate  is  able  to  inhibit  the  viral  polymerases  of  HIV-1,  HIV-2  and  hepatitis  B  virus (HBV). It has been investigated clinically for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Tenofovir is provided for clinical use as the fumaric acid salt of the disoproxil ester derivative of  tenofovir  (TDF).  Tenofovir  itself  is  an  acyclic  nucleoside  phosphonate  (nucleotide) analogue  of  adenosine  5'-monophosphate.  The  negative  charge  on  tenofovir  at  neutral  pH limits  its  oral  bioavailability,  hence  its  provision  as  a  pro-drug  that  is  rapidly  converted  to tenofovir after absorption. Tenofovir is metabolised intracellularly to the active diphosphate form, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The active moiety is also able to inhibit the viral polymerases of HIV-2 and HBV.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated intracellularly through non-overlapping pathways and in combination show no antagonism for the formation of their active metabolites. The combination of efavirenz with emtricitabine, efavirenz with tenofovir, and emtricitabine with tenofovir, respectively, all show additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro. With respect to the drug resistance aspects of the use of the triple combination product, in vitro studies have shown no cross-resistance between the  NRTI-associated  substitutions  M184V/I  and/or  K65R  and  efavirenz  nor  any  cross-resistance between efavirenz-associated substitutions and either emtricitabine or tenofovir. The clinical resistance data (see section 'Clinical aspects') correspond with the in vitro resistance selection data which  showed  selection  of  efavirenz  and  emtricitabine  resistance,  and  more  delayed  selection  of tenofovir resistance among the subset of patients with virologic failure.

In the light of this available knowledge as well as the sufficiently documented clinical experience with the combination of these active substances the CHMP considered it justified that no further pharmacodynamic data for the combination was provided. · Safety pharmacology programme Safety  pharmacology  studies  performed  for  the  individual  components  of  Atripla  did  not  show significant  unwanted  pharmacological  activity.  No  additional  safety  pharmacology  studies  were performed with the  combination of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF.  Due  to  the  available data  for  the  components  and  considering  the  extensive  clinical  use  of  this  combination,  this  was considered justified by the CHMP. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions A pharmacodynamic drug interaction study was conducted with efavirenz in MT-2 cells investigating the  in vitro  combination  of  efavirenz  with  12  approved  antiretroviral  substances  not  previously examined as well as the anti-HBV substance adefovir and anti-HCV substance ribavirin. The objective was to assess the antiviral effects and cytotoxicity of efavirenz when paired individually with these other substances. The results showed synergistic-to-additive effects of efavirenz with emtricitabine and tenofovir as well as  8  of  the  remaining  12  antiretrovirals  and  adefovir.  Data  with  ritonavir  and  abacavir  suggested potential  synergy  whereas  the  results  with  enfuvirtide  suggested  additivity.  Tests  with  ribavirin revealed no effect on the potency of efavirenz in HIV antiviral assays. No enhanced cytotoxic effects were observed in any of the combinations used for this study. The results of this  study  suggest  no antagonism  with  respect  to  antiviral  efficacy  for  combinations  of  efavirenz  with  the  antiretroviral substances  amprenavir, indinavir,  lopinavir,  ritonavir,  saquinavir,  abacavir,  emtricitabine,  stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, delavirdine and enfuvirtide, as well as with adefovir and ribavirin. Previous in  vitro studies  investigating  the  anti-HIV  activity  of  tenofovir  and  emtricitabine  in combination  have  shown  synergistic  anti  HIV-1  activity.  Using  the  LAI  strain  of  HIV-1  at  a multiplicity  of  infection  (MOI)  of  0.03  in  MT-2  cells,  there  was  demonstrable  synergy  between tenofovir  and  emtricitabine  in  an  isobologram  analysis;  using  the  LAI  strain  and  a  clinical  HIV-1 recombinant containing a wild-type RT and protease gene (MM-317) each at MOIs of 0.03 and 0.1, different analyses all showed that the combination was synergistic and the isobologram analysis gave p-values ≤ 0.0017 for all infections.

A  comprehensive  nonclinical  programme  investigating  the  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism, excretion  and  drug  interaction  potential  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine,  and  tenofovir/tenofovir  DF  has been conducted:

- Efavirenz (EFV):  Following  single  oral  administration  to  rats  (10,  40,  and  60  mg/kg)  and rhesus  monkeys  (2,  10,  40,  80  and  120  mg/kg)  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  efavirenz  is linear  in  terms  of  C max while  the  increase  in  AUC  is  more  than  dose-proportional.  The oral

bioavailability  calculated  in  rats  and  monkeys  is  16%  and  42%,  respectively.  Efavirenz  is highly bound to plasma proteins, with a mean free fraction of 0.58% in rat, 0.57% in rhesus monkey and 0.25-0.5% in human plasma. Efavirenz distributes rapidly and extensively in rats after  oral  dosing;  it  crosses  the  placenta  and  is  excreted  in  milk.  The  concentration  of efavirenz in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed dose-dependent increases in one monkey study. The  CSF/plasma  ratios  ranged  from  0.54%  to  0.96%,  which  are  comparable  to  the  free unbound  fraction  in  plasma  in  rat  and  rhesus  monkey.  The  metabolism  of  efavirenz  is extensive  through  cytochrome  P450  with  the  major  isoenzymes  being  CYP2B,  CYP3A, CYP2B6  and  CYP3A4. In  vivo and in  vitro metabolism  studies  have  shown  that  all  the efavirenz metabolites identified in humans are also found in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The major inactive metabolites identified in the three species are the 8-hydroxy efavirenz and its glucuronide conjugate. The plasma half-life of efavirenz in rats is approximately 0.8 to 1.9 hours compared to more than 40 hours in humans. Excretion in urine and faeces is comparable after  an  oral  dose  of  75  mg/kg  in  monkeys.  In  rats,  low  doses  of  10  mg/kg  were  primarily excreted in faeces, while after an oral dose of 250 mg/kg urinary excretion increased almost to the same levels as faecal excretion.

- Emtricitabine (FTC):  Emtricitabine  was  rapidly  and  extensively  absorbed  in  mice,  rats  and cynomolgus monkeys with oral bioavailability ranging from 58 % to 97 % and Tmax values of 0.5 to 2.5 hours over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic profile after repeated doses administration was similar to that after single dose administration without any sign  of  accumulation.  The  volume  of  distribution  were  high  and  similar  across  species. Binding to plasma proteins was low (4%). Emtricitabine showed limited penetration to central nervous system with levels reaching 5 to 10% those in the plasma. Studies in pregnant mice and rabbits demonstrated that it crossed the placenta barrier. Foetal/maternal exposure ratios were about 0.4 in both species. Elimination was nearly complete 72 hours after dosing. An average  of  67-79  %  of  the  dose  was  excreted  in  the  urine  after  oral  dosing  and  mainly  as unchanged parent compound (about 90 %). The metabolites appeared to be almost exclusively cleared by renal excretion since only trace (&lt;1% of the applied dose) were found in faeces. Metabolism  was  similar  across  species  and  the  principal  metabolite  identified  was  a  3'sulfoxide diastereomers, accounting for approximately 2% of the dose in mice, 2.6% in rats and 6-11% in monkeys. Emtricitabine is actively secreted by renal tubules into the urine. · Tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate (TDF):  Following  oral  administration,  rapid  absorption  of tenofovir DF was observed with a maximum tenofovir plasma concentration within 0.25 to 1.5 hours post dose. The observed terminal half-life values (biphasic elimination) were approximately 7, 9 and 60 hours in rats, monkeys and dogs respectively. The bioavailability of tenofovir DF was moderate and dependent of the species (10-20 % in rodents and 30-40 % in dogs and monkeys). It also depended on the co-administration of food as food increased the absorption, as well as partially on the dose as it decreased with increasing doses. The volume of  distribution  was  high  in  all  species  (more  than  1.0  l/kg),  suggesting  that  tenofovir distributes widely. Tenofovir did not appear to cross the brain barrier but crossed the placenta in  monkeys. The protein binding was not evaluated in animals, but was found to be low in human plasma. Tenofovir DF was rapidly converted into tenofovir in plasma and liver, much more slowly in intestine. Tenofovir was metabolised intracellularly to tenofovir diphosphate with a T1/2 over 50 hours in monkeys PBMCs. In vitro , tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir soproxil and  tenofovir  were  detected,  with  tenofovir  soproxil  being  the  major  metabolite  observed intracellular.  Following  oral  administration  of  tenofovir  DF  in  rats  and  dogs,  tenofovir disoproxil was metabolised by non specific esterases to tenofovir. No other metabolites than tenofovir  and  tenofovir  soproxil  were  detected. In  vitro ,  tenofovir  DF  did  not  have  any inhibiting or inducing effect on CYP3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 2E1 and 1A2. However it induced CYP 1A1 and 2B. In all species, the primary route of elimination was renal, mainly as unchanged substance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No additional formal nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were considered warranted by the CHMP with the combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF in view of the results of extensive non-clinical studies as well as the clinical pharmacokinetic data for all components.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Limited  pharmacokinetic  information  has  been  generated  as  part  of  a  study  investigating  the pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  various  formulations  of  the  fixed  combination,  which  was  part  of  the formulation  development.  In  this  non-GLP  study  the  tablets  were  administered  orally  to  non-naïve beagle dogs dosed approximately weekly for 60 weeks (Phase 1) or naïve beagle dogs for 19 weeks (Phase 2). Dogs in Phase 1 received varying combinations of prototype or commercial formulations containing  efavirenz  at  600  mg,  emtricitabine  at  200 mg,  and/or  tenofovir  DF  at  300  mg,  or  lower doses of the agents at 150 mg of efavirenz, 50 mg of emtricitabine and/or 75 mg tenofovir DF. Dogs in Phase 2 received only the lower dose formulations.

For  the  commercial  formulation,  maximal  plasma  concentrations  were  323 ± 166,  1790 ± 698,  and 423 ± 292 ng/mL  at  1.92 ± 2.13,  1.46 ± 0.78,  and  1.02 ± 0.43  hr,  respectively;  the  AUC0-last  was 1692 ± 895,  8295 ± 2714,  and  1622 ± 755  ng·hr/mL  for  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF, respectively. At the lower doses used in this study (150 mg of efavirenz, 50 mg of emtricitabine and 75  mg  of  tenofovir  DF),  the  exposure  in  dogs  to  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  was  similar  to  that  in patients while the exposure of efavirenz was ≥ 15-fold lower than that of human patients at steadystate. Toxicology The data of a comprehensive nonclincal programme characterising the toxicologic properties of the three  compounds  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  /  tenofovir  DF  has  been  provided.  No additional toxicology studies with the combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF were considered warranted by the CHMP in view of the results of extensive non-clinical studies as well as the available clinical data. · Single dose toxicity / Repeat dose toxicity The acute toxicity of all three active substances is low. The most prominent toxicologic findings for efavirenz were nephrotoxicity in rats and biliary changes in rats and monkeys. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values in individual animals that were 4 to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose. Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater  than  those  in  humans  given  the  recommended  dose.  The  biliary  hyperplasia  regressed  upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has been observed in rats. In addition, there were thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in monkeys, increases in serum transaminase values, without consistent occurrence of hepatocellular  necrosis,  in  monkeys  and  mice,  and  increased  coagulation  parameter  values,  without evidence of gross or microscopic bleeding in rats and monkeys. Effects associated with the administration of emtricitabine in the toxicology studies were confined to high-dose  groups.  Changes  in  RBC  parameters,  interpreted  as  mild  anemia  occurred  at  the  highest dose in several studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tenofovir and tenofovir DF administered in toxicology studies to rats, dogs and monkeys at exposures (based  on  AUCs)  greater  than  or  equal  to  6-fold  those  observed  in  humans  caused  bone  toxicity. Evidence of renal  toxicity  was  noted  in  4  animal  species  administered  tenofovir  and  tenofovir  DF. Increases  in  serum  creatinine,  BUN,  glycosuria,  proteinuria,  phosphaturia  and/or  calciuria  and decreases  in  serum  phosphate  were  observed  to  varying  degrees  in  these  animals.  These  toxicities were  noted  at  exposures  (based  on  AUCs)  2-20  times  higher  than  those  observed  in  humans.  The relationship of the renal abnormalities, particularly the phosphaturia, to the bone toxicity is not known.

Administration of the tenofovir DF/emtricitabine tablet did not exacerbate the known toxicities of the individual agents, as demonstrated in a 14-day rat toxicology study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Genotoxicity

The individual substances efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF have been sufficiently tested for genotoxicity in  vitro and in  vivo .  Efavirenz  and  emtricitabine  exhibit  no  indication  for  mutagenic potential.  Tenofovir  was  mutagenic  in  the in  vitro mouse  lymphoma  assay,  weakly  positive  in  an unscheduled DNA synthesis test and generally negative in in vitro bacterial mutagenicity tests (Ames test). In vitro testing of emtricitabine/tenofovir combinations in AMES and Mouse lymphoma assay revealed no evidence for additive mutagenic effects.

Additive mutagenic effects for the combination therapy are not expected and hence the lack of data specific for the fixed combination was considered acceptable. · Carcinogenicity In  long  term  carcinogenicity studies of emtricitabine, no drug-related increases in tumour incidence were found in rats and mice. Carcinogenicity studies have been performed in mice and rats with efavirenz. In rats, no increases in tumour incidence above control were observed. In female mice, incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and pulmonary alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were increased above background in all doses. The mechanism of the carcinogenic potential in female mice is unknown. Long term carcinogenicity study in rats with tenofovir DF did not show any carcinogenic potential. Mice  showed  a  low  incidence  of  duodenal  tumours,  considered  likely  related  to  high  local concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract at the highest dose of 600 mg/kg. Additional carcinogenicity studies with the fixed combination were not considered necessary by the CHMP due to the available non-clinical data for the individual compounds. These data are adequately described in section 5.3 of the SmPC. · Reproduction Toxicity Efavirenz induced fetal resorption in rats. Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 fetuses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one fetus, microophthalmia was observed in another fetus, and  cleft  palate  was  observed  in  a  third  fetus.  No  malformations  were  observed  in  fetuses  from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. There was no evidence of reproductive toxicity in the studies performed with emtricitabine. In a peri-natal study performed in rats with tenofovir DF, effects occurred at exposure levels above those likely to be achieved in humans. No adverse effects were seen in rabbits. The lack of specific studies with the fixed combination was considered justified by the CHMP as the reproductive  toxicity  profiles  of  the  single  substances  are  already  known  and  as  these  have  been adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. · Local tolerance Medicinal product no longer authorised

No specific studies were considered necessary by the CHMP in the light of the available nonclinical data as well as the clinical evidence submitted for the various components alone or in combination.

## · Other toxicity studies

Through the above-mentioned non-GLP study in the beagle dog to examine potential formulations of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (see section 'Pharmacokinetics') limited tolerability information has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been generated for dogs that were dosed approximately weekly for up to 60 weeks. This study was not intended to serve as a safety study hence data is only considered supportive. However, once weekly dosing of the combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF at the doses used in this study was generally well tolerated for periods of up to 60 weeks with no overt toxicity. At the lower doses used in this study (150 mg of efavirenz, 50 mg of emtricitabine and 75 mg tenofovir DF), the exposure in dogs to emtricitabine and tenofovir was similar to that in patients while the exposure of efavirenz was ≥ 15-fold lower than that of human patients at steady-state.

Impurities and degradation products of the fixed combination product have been evaluated and have been  toxicological  qualified.  There  are  no  new  impurities  or  degradation  products  for  the  fixed combination. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment has been performed according to the guideline on the applicable guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). At  phase  I,  the  estimate  values  of  predicted  environmental  concentrations  (PECSURFACEWATER)  were 0.0030 mg/L for efavirenz; 0.0010 mg/L for emtricitabine and 0.0012 mg/L for tenofovir disoproxil. As these values were above the action limit of 0.01 µ g/L a phase II was required, which comprises the following on-going programme: · Chronic ecotoxicity and environmental fate studies with efavirenz, to be reported as follow-up measures. · Studies  with  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  to  investigate  to  determine  PNEC  values  and PEC/NEC ratios, to be reported as follow-up measures. An  adsorption/desorption  study  for  efavirenz  showed  that  phase  II  tier  B  studies  are  not  required. Efavirenz  was  found  to  have  PEC/PNEC  ratios  with  respect  to  surface  water,  ground  water  and microorganisms less than 1. 4. Clinical aspects Introduction The  three  active  substances  in  the  fixed  combination  of  Atripla,  i.e.  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and tenofovir  DF,  are  already  approved  for  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  of  HIV-1  infection  (see details in section 'Introduction' to the Scientific Discussion). Comprehensive  clinical study programmes have been conducted for the individual compounds and the dual combination aimed at generating  data  on  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics,  as  well  as  establishing  safety  and efficacy. Therefore, the development programme for Atripla focused on the generation of additional clinical data required to support the approval of this triple combination and comprised the following studies: · five  bioequivalence  studies  establishing  the  formulation  for  the  fixed  dose  combination (GS-US-177-0101,  GS-US-185R-0102,  GS-US-177-0103,  GS-US-177-0104,  GS-US-1770105).  All  these  studies  were  identically  designed;  the  details  of  the  main  bioequivalence study GS-US-177-0105 are summarised in Table 1; Medicinal product no longer authorised

- efficacy and safety data from three clinical studies investigating the combination of the three active substances either as free combination or as fixed combination in the final formulation (GS-01-934, GS-US-164-0107, AI266073); the study details are summarised in Table 2.

In the initial MAA dossier the bioequivalence study GS-US-177-0105 was identified as the primary data  in  support  of  the  application.  However,  due  to  the  concerns  raised  by  the  CHMP  during  the review of the  application,  the  above-mentioned,  additional  efficacy  and  safety  studies,  in  particular study AI266073, became of particular importance for the assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant did not seek scientific advice from the CHMP for this development. The Guideline on the Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of HIV Infection (CPMP/EWP/633/02) recognises the development of fixed dose combinations to reduce pill burden and states that the clinical data will depend on the nature of the combination. In particular a potentially new posology for the fixed dose combination and the level of documentation of the free combination would  need  to  be  considered  to  define  the  extent  of  clinical  data  needed.  Due  to  the  change  of posology of one of the components, tenofovir DF (administered in fasting state instead of fed state), the CHMP confirmed the need to support the application with additional clinical efficacy data.

The  initial  application  claimed  the  use  of  Atripla  alone  or  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults; the approved indication  limits  its  use  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus-1  (HIV-1)  infection  in already  virologically  suppressed  adults.  The  concomitant  use  with  other  antiretroviral  agents  is  not supported  by  appropriate  data.  The  recommended  dose  is  one  tablet  taken  orally  once  daily  on  an empty stomach and preferably at bedtime. A  paediatric  development  is  not  planned  for  this  fixed  combination  medicinal  product.  Paediatric development programmes for the individual components including the dual combination have been or are being conducted. Due to the different dosing algorithm required for the individual compounds in the paediatric population the applicant claims that a fixed dose combination medicinal product is not suitable for this population.

GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. Pharmacokinetics The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  the  individual  components  have  been  subject  to  comprehensive development programmes to support Marketing Authorisations either alone or in dual combinations. The  pharmacokinetic  development  strategy  for  Atripla  focused  on  the  compatibility  of  the  active ingredients  with  each  other  and  with  the  other  excipients  of  the  formulation  to  demonstrate bioequivalence between this product and the concurrently administered individual dosage forms. Since adequate  two-way  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  for  all  three  individual  agents  and, moreover, extensive clinical evidence of the use of these substances as free combination is available, the CHMP in principle considered it acceptable that new pharmacokinetic data was only provided to address bioavailability aspects. The following provides a summary of the already available pharmacokinetic data on the individual active substances as well as details of the additional clinical studies specific for Atripla.

- Absorption
- Efavirenz: Peak  efavirenz  plasma  concentrations  of  1.6  -  9.1  µM  were  attained  by  5  hours following  single  oral  doses  of  100  mg  to  1,600  mg  administered  to  uninfected  volunteers. Time to peak plasma concentrations (3 - 5 hours) did not change following multiple dosing and steady-state plasma concentrations were reached in 6 - 7 days. In 35 patients receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady state Cmax was 12.9 ± 3.7 µM (29%) [ mean ± S.D. (% C.V.) ] , steady state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 µM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 µM·h (40%).
- Emtricitabine: Emtricitabine  is  rapidly  and  extensively  absorbed  following  oral  administration with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. In 20 HIV infected patients receiving  200  mg  emtricitabine  daily  as  hard  capsules,  steady-state  plasma  emtricitabine  peak concentrations (Cmax), trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) were 1.8±0.7 µg/ml, 0.09±0.07 µg/ml and 10.0±3.1 µg·h/ml, respectively. Steady-state trough plasma concentrations reached levels approximately 4fold above the in vitro IC90 values for anti-HIV activity.

Healthy  subjects  were  investigated  in  this  study  to  remove  the  confounding  effects  of  background antiretroviral  and  other  therapies  and  to  avoid  the  need  to  make  multiple,  short-term  changes  in treatment  regimens  of  HIV-infected  patients  for  the  purpose  of  examining  pharmacokinetic  (PK) parameters.  The  planned  enrolment  was  48  subjects  to  obtain  data  from  38  subjects  available  for pharmacokinetics  evaluation.  73%  of  the  participants  in  the  study  were  female,  and  90%  were  of hispanic origin.

· Tenofovir DF: Following oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to HIV infected patients,  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate  is  rapidly  absorbed  and  converted  to  tenofovir. Maximum tenofovir concentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two hours when taken with food. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in fasted patients was approximately 25%. Administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a high fat meal enhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax by approximately 14%. Bioequivalence Reports of  the  five  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  submitted.  Studies  GS-US-177-0101,  GS-US185R-0102  and  GS-US-177-0103  failed  to  show  bioequivalence  between  the  fixed  dose  triple combination  product  Atripla  as  compared  to  the  concurrently  administered  individual  medicinal products  containing  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF,  and  led  to  further  pharmaceutical development  to  identify  the  appropriate  formulation  composition.  Studies  GS-US-177-0104  and GS-US-177-0105  demonstrated  bioequivalence  between  the  formulations  tested  and  the  individual dosage forms of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF; study GS-US-177-0105 used the intended commercial formulation of Atripla. Study no. GS-US-177-0105 STUDY DESIGN This  was  a  randomized,  single-dose,  open-label,  two-way  crossover,  Phase  1  study  to  assess  the bioequivalence of a fixed-dose triple-combination tablet of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF (EFV/FTC/TDF, test treatment) compared with concurrent administration of individual dosage forms of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF (EFV+FTC+TDF, reference treatment) to healthy adults under fasting conditions. The crossover study consisted of two periods, Period 1 (Day 1 to 28) and Period 2 (Day 29 to 50). Subjects were considered to have completed a period if they completed the last day of pharmacokinetic sampling within that period (i.e. Day 22 or 50). Subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the study within 30 days before randomisation. TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS Atripla (600 mg efavirenz, 200 mg emtricitabine, 300 mg tenofovir DF) in the intended commercial formulation  was  used  as  the  test  product.  The  reference  products  were  commercially  available formulation  of  Sustiva  (600  mg  efavirenz),  Emtriva  (200 mg  emtricitabine)  and  Viread  (300  mg tenofovir DF), all from the United States of America. The identity of these commercial formulations with the medicinal products approved in the EU/EEA has been confirmed by the applicant. POPULATION(S) STUDIED Medicinal product no longer authorised

## ANALYTICAL METHODS

Plasma samples were analysed using LC/MS/MS. Two bioanalytical methods were employed for the active pharmaceutical ingredients, one of which was used for the determination of emtricitabine and tenofovir  and  the  other  one  for  efavirenz.  Validations  have  been  performed  according  to  current standards, and clinical compliance audit certificates were provided.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The primary pharmacokinetic parameters for assessing bioequivalence between the fixed dose triplecombination tablet and the individual dosage forms administered concurrently were AUC0-last, AUCinf, and  Cmax.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  estimated  by  application  of  a  non-linear  model  using standard noncompartmental methods. The linear/log trapezoidal rule was used in conjunction with the appropriate noncompartmental model, with input values for dose, time of dose, plasma concentration, and corresponding real time values based on drug dosing times. STATISTICAL METHODS The comparison of the pharmacokinetic values between the test and reference treatments was made by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means (test / reference) fell within 80% to 125% for the primary pharmacokinetic parameters, Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUCinf for each analyte. RESULTS The results of the pharmacokinetic evaluation are presented in Table 3. These  data  demonstrate  bioequivalence  of  Atripla  with  the  respective  co-administered  individual products. It was noted though that the resulting pharmacokinetic data of efavirenz differs considerably from historical data with regard to the half life; additional analyses requested by the CHMP indicated that  this  effect  is  mainly  due  to  differences  in  the  study  populations  (gender  and  ethnicity)  with  a considerable proportion of females and non-Caucasians known to have a prolonged half life. Special consideration was given to the fact that the study was conducted under fasting conditions, which is not in accordance with the posology of the currently approved SmPC of tenofovir-containing products in the EU/EEA.

## Influence of food

Administration  of efavirenz tablets  with  a  high-fat  meal  increased  the  mean  AUC  and  Cmax,  of efavirenz  by  28%  and  79%,  respectively,  compared  with  administration  in  the  fasted  state  (Study DMP266-110).  The  approved  SmPCs  for  the  respective  medicinal  products  (Sustiva,  Stocrin) recommend  administration  of  efavirenz  on  an  empty  stomach,  preferably  at  bedtime,  because  the increased exposure to efavirenz when administered with food may lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of adverse events.

Compared  with  fasted  administration,  dosing  of  a  fixed-dose  combination  of tenofovir DF  and emtricitabine with either a high-fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of tenofovir by 35% and 15%, respectively, with no effect on emtricitabine exposure (Study GS-US-104-172). The lack of a food effect with emtricitabine in this study is consistent with the results of the previous food effect  study  with  the  single  agent  (Study  FTC-111)  and  the  approved  SmPC  for  Emtriva,  which indicates that emtricitabine may be taken with or without food. The increased  exposure  to tenofovir when  administered  with  food  is  consistent  with  findings  from previous  food  effect  studies  of  the  single  agent  (Studies  GS-00-914  and  GS-00-903).  As  a consequence the approved SmPCs  for the respective medicinal products (Viread, Truvada) recommend administration of tenofovir DF with food. No  studies  on  the  influence  of  food  have  been  conducted  with  the  fixed  triple  combination  tablet Atripla. Additional data to support the applicant's claim that tenofovir DF may be administered with or without food was provided. This included a historical comparison of two steady-state interaction studies (GS-01-932 [light meal] and GS-00-909 [fasted]), resulting in a comparable bioavailability of tenofovir irrespective of food intake. However, necessary data for the assessment of the relevance of this  comparison  were  missing.  Moreover,  the  CHMP  considered  that  data  from  other  studies  (e.g. GS-US-104-172  and  GS-00-914)  provided  conflicting  results  thus  questioning  the  validity  of  the applicant's approach. In addition it was claimed that a possible decrease in plasma exposure due to the effect of intake without food on tenofovir DF would not be of clinical relevance, as the active moiety, tenofovir diphosphate, acts intracellularly and exhibits a protracted half-life, however no substantiating pharmacokinetic data was submitted. Reference was also made to the efficacy data from study GS-01-934 showing no difference in virologic response between patients taking their medication with or without food; this data is presented in the section 'Clinical efficacy'. · Distribution · Efavirenz: Efavirenz  is  highly  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins  (approximately  99.5  99.75%), predominantly to albumin. In HIV-1 infected patients (n = 9) who received efavirenz 200 to 600 mg once daily for at least one month, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 1.19% (mean 0.69%) of the corresponding plasma concentration. This proportion is  approximately  3-fold  higher  than  the  non-protein-bound  (free)  fraction  of  efavirenz  in plasma. · Emtricitabine: In  vitro binding  of  emtricitabine  to  human  plasma  proteins  was  &lt;  4%  and independent of concentration over the range of 0.02-200 µg/ml. The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was approximately 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. The apparent volume of distribution after intravenous administration of emtricitabine was  1.4±0.3 l/kg, indicating that emtricitabine is widely distributed throughout the body to both intracellular and extracellular fluid spaces. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Tenofovir: Following  intravenous  administration  the  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  of tenofovir was estimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg. After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil  fumarate,  tenofovir  is  distributed  to  most  tissues  with  the  highest  concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the intestinal contents (preclinical studies). In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/ml.

## · Metabolism

- Efavirenz: Studies  in  humans  and in  vitro studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  have demonstrated  that  efavirenz  is  principally  metabolised  by  the  cytochrome  P450  system  to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These  metabolites  are  essentially  inactive  against  HIV-1.  The in  vitro studies  suggest  that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it  inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1  and  inhibited  CYP2D6  and  CYP1A2  only  at  concentrations  well  above  those achieved  clinically.  Efavirenz  has  been  shown  to  induce  P450  enzymes,  resulting  in  the induction of its own metabolism.

•

· Emtricitabine: There  is  limited  metabolism  of  emtricitabine.  The  biotransformation  of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). Emtricitabine did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by  the  following  human  CYP450  isoenzymes:  1A2,  2A6,  2B6,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6  and  3A4. Also,  emtricitabine  did  not  inhibit  uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl  transferase,  the  enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. · Tenofovir: Following  intravenous  administration  the  steady-state  volume  of  distribution  of tenofovir was estimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg. After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil  fumarate,  tenofovir  is  distributed  to  most  tissues  with  the  highest  concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the intestinal contents (preclinical studies). In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/ml. Tenofovir is converted intracellularly to tenofovir monophosphate and to the active component, tenofovir diphosphate · Excretion · Efavirenz: Efavirenz  has  a  relatively  long  terminal  half-life  of  52  to  76  hours  after  single doses  and  40 - 55  hours  after  multiple  doses  (see  also  results  of  study  GS-US-155-0105). Approximately 14 - 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. · Emtricitabine: Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the  dose  achieved  in  urine  (approximately  86%)  and  faeces  (approximately  14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 307 ml/min (4.03 ml/min/kg). Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. · Tenofovir: Tenofovir  is  primarily  excreted  by  the  kidney  by  both  filtration  and  an  active tubular transport system with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous administration. Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230  ml/h/kg  (approximately  300  ml/min).  Renal  clearance has been  estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately 210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration  rate.  This  indicates  that  active  tubular  secretion  is  an  important  part  of  the elimination  of  tenofovir.  Following  oral  administration  the  terminal  half-life  of  tenofovir  is approximately 12 to 18 hours. Dose proportionality and time dependencies Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Efavirenz: Dose related increases in Cmax and AUC were seen for doses up to 1,600 mg; the increases  were  less  than  proportional  suggesting  diminished  absorption  at  higher  doses.  In HIV infected patients at steady state, mean Cmax, mean Cmin, and mean AUC were linear with daily  doses  of  200  mg,  400  mg,  and  600  mg.  Efavirenz  has  been  shown  to  induce  P450 enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism. In uninfected volunteers, multiple doses  of  200  -  400  mg  per  day  for  10  days  resulted  in  a  lower  than  predicted  extent  of accumulation  (22  -  42%  lower)  and  a  shorter  terminal  half-life  as  compared  to  single  dose half-life.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Emtricitabine: The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are proportional to dose over the dose range of 25-200 mg following single or repeated administration. No time dependency has been described for emtricitabine.
- Tenofovir: The  pharmacokinetics  of  tenofovir  were  independent  of  tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate dose over the dose range of 75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. No time dependency has been described for tenofovir.
- Special populations

•

Impaired renal function · Efavirenz: The  pharmacokinetics  of  efavirenz  have  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of efavirenz is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal. · Tenofovir  and  Emtricitabine: Two studies  in  non-HIV-1 infected  subjects  determined  the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (Study GS-01-919) and emtricitabine (Study FTC-107) in the presence of varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring  haemodialysis.  The  pharmacokinetic  data  for  both  tenofovir  and  emtricitabine indicate that dose interval adjustment is necessary for subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 50 ml/min) and those with ESRD requiring hemodialysis. In subjects with mild renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir and emtricitabine are not substantially altered to warrant dose adjustment. The fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 50 ml/min) because these patients require dose  interval  adjustment  of  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir DF,  which  cannot  be  achieved  with  this fixed-dose  combination  tablet.  Increasing  the  dosing  interval  for  renally  impaired  patients,  as instructed  in  the  approved  SmPCs  for  Viread,  Emtriva  and  Truvada,  would  reduce  exposure  to efavirenz because its elimination is not affected by renal impairment. Impaired hepatic function · Efavirenz: The  pharmacokinetics  have  not  been  adequately  studied  in  patients  with  hepatic impairment. In the single patient studied with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C, Study AI266033), half life was doubled indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. · Emtricitabine: Emtricitabine is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes ( &lt; 13% of oral dose, Study FTC-106); therefore, the impact of liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine should be limited for this agent. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in hepatically impaired subjects. In patients infected with HBV,  the pharmacokinetics  of  emtricitabine  was  similar  to  those  determined  previously  in  other populations, i.e., HIV-1 infected patients and healthy volunteers (FTCB-101). In addition, the safety profile of emtricitabine in a Phase 3 HBV trial (FTCB-301) was similar to the placebo arm of the study Tenofovir: The  pharmacokinetics  of  tenofovir  after  a  300-mg  dose  of  tenofovir DF  were studied in non-HIV-1 infected patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, according to CPT classification (Study GS-01-931 A/B). Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in patients with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired patients, suggesting that no dose adjustment of tenofovir DF is required in these subjects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because efavirenz undergoes extensive cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism and because there is limited  clinical  experience  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  the  fixed-dose  combination  of efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  must  not  be  administered  to  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment (CPT Grade C).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gender

The  pharmacokinetics  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine,  and  tenofovir DF  are  similar  in  male  and  female patients. Although limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz.

Clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  of  efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF with respect to demographic variables are not anticipated based on data available for the individual agents.

Elderly The  pharmacokinetics  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine,  or  tenofovir  have  not  been  evaluated  in  patients &gt; 65 years old. The fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF should be administered with caution  to  elderly  patients,  keeping  in  mind  the  greater  frequency  of  decreased  hepatic,  renal,  or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this subpopulation. Children The fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF is not recommended for use in children and adolescents ( &lt; 18 years). The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of efavirenz and emtricitabine  have  been  investigated  in  HIV-1 infected  children;  however,  efavirenz  has  not  been studied in pediatric patients who are less than 3 years old or weigh less than 13 kg. In general, the pharmacokinetics  of  efavirenz  and  emtricitabine  in  pediatric  patients  are  similar  to  those  seen  in adults. Only preliminary data are available on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in pediatric patients and its safety and effectiveness in this population has not been established. · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies In vitro · Efavirenz has  been  shown in vivo to  cause  hepatic  enzyme  induction,  thus  increasing  the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  and  CYP3A4  isozymes  may  result  in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity would  be  expected  to  increase  the  clearance  of  efavirenz,  resulting  in  lowered  plasma concentrations. · Both emtricitabine and tenofovir DF are  considered  to  have  a  low  potential  for  CYP450 mediated  interactions  based  on  the  results  of in vitro experiments  and  the  known  renal elimination pathways of both agents. Since both agents are primarily renally excreted, there is potential  for  interaction  with  other  drugs  that  are  similarly  eliminated.  Drugs  that  decrease renal function may also increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine and tenofovir. Concomitant use of the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF together with nephrotoxic agents must be avoided. In vivo Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  specific  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  fixed  combination product, and the information described in the SmPC is based on extrapolation from data conducted with the individual agents. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP due to the extensive clinical evidence of the use of these active substances as free combinations. The following is a summary of the information most relevant to this combination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Because efavirenz has been shown in vitro to induce CYP3A4, and to inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 isozymes, the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids because inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening adverse events. The fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF must not be administered  concurrently  with  voriconazole  because  efavirenz  significantly  decreases  voriconazole plasma concentrations, and voriconazole increases efavirenz exposure.

Plasma  levels  of  efavirenz  can  be  reduced  by  concomitant  use  of  St. John's  wort  (Hypericum perforatum).  This  is  due  to  induction  of  drug  metabolizing  enzymes  and/or  transport  proteins  by St. John's wort. Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort must not be used concomitantly with the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. Special precautions should be followed for stopping St. John's wort when initiating treatment with efavirenz. The  effects  of  efavirenz  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  clarithromycin,  methadone,  ethinyl  estradiol, rifabutin, and sertraline have been established. The SmPC for the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  provides  appropriate  guidance  for  the  management  of  patients administered  these  concomitant  medications  in  conjunction  with  the  combination  tablet.  Since rifampicin  reduced  efavirenz  AUC  and  Cmax  by  26%  and  20%  when  coadministered,  an  additional 200 mg/day  of  efavirenz  is  recommended  when  rifampicin  is  administered  with  the  fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. Drug interactions have also been established between efavirenz and the PIs, ritonavir, atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir,  saquinavir,  indinavir,  and  amprenavir  and  are  adequately  described  in  the  SmPC. Additionally,  coadministration  of  efavirenz  with  the  HMG CoA  reductase  inhibitors  atorvastatin, pravastatin,  or  simvastatin  has  been  shown  to  substantially  reduce  the  plasma  concentration  of  the statins in uninfected  volunteers.  Cholesterol  levels  should  be  periodically  monitored.  Dosage adjustments  of  statins  may  be  required  when  coadministered  with  the  fixed-dose  combination  of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. Similarly dose adjustment of the calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, should be considered based on clinical response when administered with the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir  DF  due  to  decreased  plasma  levels  of  diltiazem  when  coadministered  with  efavirenz. Although the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz were slightly increased (11% to 16%) when coadministered with diltiazem, these changes are not considered clinically significant. No  dose  recommendation  can  be  made  for  the  use  of  the  fixed-dose  combination  of  efavirenz, emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  with  carbamazepine  because  of  a  two-way  interaction  resulting  in decreased  concentrations  of  both  efavirenz  and  carbamazepine.  Carbamazepine  levels  should  be periodically monitored. An alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be considered. Coadministration of tenofovir DF with efavirenz did not influence plasma efavirenz concentrations. Furthermore, administration of efavirenz with tenofovir DF had no effect on plasma concentrations of tenofovir. No  clinically  relevant  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  identified  between  emtricitabine  and  the coadministered drugs investigated (i.e., indinavir, famciclovir, stavudine, zidovudine, and tenofovir DF). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Interactions  between  tenofovir DF  and  other  antiretroviral  drugs  were  observed  for  didanosine (exposure  increase)  and  atazanavir  (without  ritonavir,  exposure  decrease).  No  clinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed for abacavir, adefovir dipivoxil, efavirenz, emtricitabine, indinavir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, or saquinavir/ritonavir. After multiple dosing to HIV-negative subjects receiving either chronic methadone maintenance therapy, oral contraceptives, or single doses of ribavirin, steady-state tenofovir pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in previous studies, indicating a lack of clinically significant drug interactions between these agents and tenofovir DF.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interactions between PIs and efavirenz and tenofovir DF require guidance for concomitant use with the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF.

The  fixed-dose  combination  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  should  not  be  coadministered with related drugs that contain the same active components (i.e., efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF). Because of similarities with emtricitabine, the fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF should not be coadministered with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine

The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture were L100I (17 to  22-fold  resistance)  and  K103N  (18  to  33-fold  resistance).  K103N  was  also  the  most  frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who experienced a significant rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz in combination with indinavir or zidovudine + lamivudine. This  mutation  was  observed  in  90%  of  patients  receiving  efavirenz  with  virological  failure. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. The pattern of amino acid substitutions in RT associated  with  resistance  to  efavirenz  was  independent  of  the  other  antiviral  medications  used  in combination with efavirenz. However, cross resistance with other NNRTIs is extensive

All relevant information on pharmacokinetic interactions is adequately reflected in the SmPC. Pharmacodynamics Comprehensive programmes investigating the intracellular metabolism, mechanism of action, and in vitro activity  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine,  and  tenofovir  have  been  conducted  and  the  data  has  been assessed.  No  further  supportive  clinical  pharmacology  studies  were  considered  warranted  by  the CHMP on the basis of available clinical pharmacology data and the sufficiently documented clinical experience with the use of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF, both alone and in combination, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The following summarises the available evidence with regard to pharmacodynamic data: · Mechanism of action Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 (NNRTI) and thus acts via noncompetitive  inhibition  of  the  HIV  reverse  transcriptase.  Emtricitabine  is  a  nucleoside  analogue  of cytidine  (NRTI)  and  tenofovir  is  a  nucleotide  analogue  of  adenosine  (NtRTI);  both  function  as competitive inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase. · Primary and Secondary pharmacology In vitro studies have demonstrated potent antiviral activity of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF against laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1. The findings of in vitro pharmacodynamic  investigations  suggest  a  low  potential  for  intracellular  drug  antagonism  between tenofovir or emtricitabine and other antiretroviral compounds. The dual combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine showed additive anti-HIV-1 activity in PBMCs and synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in the leukemic  MT-2  cell  line.  The  additive-to-synergistic  anti-HIV-1  activity  observed  with  two  drug combinations of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir in multiple in vitro assay systems supports the use of these agents in combination in HIV-1 infected patients. Furthermore, the antiviral effects and cytotoxicity of efavirenz when paired individually with 12 other marketed antiretrovirals and the antiHBV drug adefovir against HIV-1 in MT-2 cells was investigated (see section 'Non-clinical aspects / Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions').  The  relevant  data  from  this  body  of  evidence  is  adequately described in the SmPC. Resistance Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development of the M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine and the K65R mutation with tenofovir. No other pathways of resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir have been identified. Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to tenofovir. The K65R mutation  can  also  be  selected  for  by  abacavir,  didanosine  or  zalcitabine  and  results  in  reduced susceptibility  to  these  agents  plus  lamivudine,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir.  Tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation.

Resistance data generated in study GS-01-934 through 144 weeks were in agreement with previous results. The proportion of patients who developed any resistance in the AZT/3TC group by Week 96 (20/243,  8%)  was  double  that  observed  in  the  emtricitabine  +  tenofovir  DF  group  (10/244,  4%); however, the difference was not statistically significant  (p  =  0.06).  Resistance  to  efavirenz  was  the most common form of resistance that developed with the K103N mutation being the most common mutation.  Noteworthy,  no  patient  in  the  emtricitabine  +  tenofovir  DF  group  developed  the  K65R mutation selected by tenofovir DF. Clinical efficacy The clinical efficacy data of Atripla is focussed on the one hand on the demonstration of an overall positive benefit risk ratio of the triple combination and on the other hand on demonstrating that intake of tenofovir DF in the fasting state (deviating from the currently approved recommendation) does not impair the clinical efficacy of the drug. · Dose response studies Comprehensive  data  on  dose  response  studies  with  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  or  tenofovir  can  be summarised as follows: · Efavirenz: Initially,  the  dose  of  200  mg  was  selected  based  on  preclinical  and  clinical pharmacokinetic data obtained from the early studies. Considering the long half life of 40-55 hours, once daily dosing regimen was considered possible. Since efavirenz administered at the dose of 200 mg has shown a good tolerability, doses of 400 mg and 600 mg were evaluated in terms  of  efficacy  and  safety.  The  600  mg  dose  proved  superior  in  terms  of  maintained suppression  of  HIV-RNA  levels  below  the  limit  of  quantification;  the  rate  of  CNS  adverse events  was  increased,  but  still  considered  to  be  at  a  tolerable  level.  Based  on  this  data  the 600 mg dose was selected for further clinical development. · Emtricitabine: In  a  dose  escalation  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and antiviral activity of multiple repeated doses median changes in HIV-1 RNA from baseline to Day 15 increased with the dose and reached an apparent plateau at doses between 200 mg qd and  200  mg  bid.  In  a  monotherapy  study  comparing  emtricitabine  (at  25  mg,  100  mg  and 200 mg q.d.) with lamivudine monotherapy (at 150 mg b.i.d.) over 10 days, a dose response relationship  was  observed  for  viral  suppression  as  analysed  by  AAUCMB  through  Day  12. There was a statistically significant difference between the emtricitabine 200 mg q.d. and the lamivudine groups with respect to AAUCMB through Days 11 and 12. These results, along with the pharmacokinetic data and anti-viral activity of emtricitabine, supported the choice of 200 mg once daily as the recommended dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Tenofovir: Dose-proportional  pharmacokinetics  of  tenofovir  following  oral  administration were observed and the long terminal half life supported a once daily dosage regimen. The dose of 245 mg daily was supported by a significant viral load decrease compared to placebo with an acceptable safety profile.
- Main studies

Study data on the triple combination efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF from studies GS-01-934 (week-144  and  week-168  reports),  study  GS-US-164-0107  (week-24  report)  and  study AI266073 (week-24 interim report) is summarized in the following paragraphs:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study GS-01-934

## METHODS

Open-label,  parallel,  multicenter,  active-controlled  study  with  1:1  randomization;  patients  were stratified  on  the  basis  of  screening  CD4+  cell  count  (&lt;  or ≥ 200  cells/mm3);  emtricitabine  and tenofovir DF are dosed as the emtricitabine/tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination tablet during weeks 96 through 144. After completing 144 weeks of treatment with study drug, patients from both study arms were given the option to roll over into a 96-week protocol extension and switch their treatment regimen to a fixed-dose, triple-combination formulation of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir DF 300 mg. Total duration of the study is 240 weeks.

Efficacy : The primary efficacy endpoint was the achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA concentrations &lt; 400  copies/ml  through  Week  48,  as  defined  by  the  TLOVR  algorithm.  The modified  intent-to-treat  (MITT)  analysis  set,  which  excluded  patients  with  baseline  nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance, was used in this analysis.

Study Participants Antiretroviral-naive,  HIV-1  infected  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  concentrations &gt; 10,000 copies/ml and any CD4+ cell count. Treatments Test product, dose, and mode of administration: · Efavirenz 600 mg once daily, orally, without regard to meals, · Emtricitabine 200 mg once daily, orally, without regard to meals, and · Tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily, orally, without regard to meals. Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily orally (according to the nevirapine prescribing information) could replace efavirenz in the event of efavirenz-associated central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration: · Efavirenz 600 mg once daily, orally, without regard to meals and · Lamivudine/zidovudine (Combivir) 150 mg/300 mg twice daily, orally, without regard to meals. Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily orally (according to the nevirapine prescribing information) could replace efavirenz in the event of efavirenz-associated CNS toxicity. Objectives The primary objective was to assess noninferiority of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir  DF)  in  combination  with  efavirenz  relative  to  lamivudine/zidovudine  (Combivir)  in combination with efavirenz in the treatment of HIV-1  infected antiretroviral-naive patients, determined by the achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml through Week 48, as defined by the time-to-loss-of-virologic-response (TLOVR) algorithm. Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  and  to  assess  non-inferiority  of emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  in  combination  with  efavirenz  relative  to  lamivudine/zidovudine  in combination with efavirenz in the treatment of HIV-1 infected antiretroviral-naive patients. Outcomes/endpoints Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  achievement  and  maintenance  of  confirmed  HIV-1 RNA  concentrations &lt; 50  copies/ml  through  Week  48  and  the  achievement  and  maintenance  of confirmed  HIV-1  RNA  concentrations &lt; 400  copies/ml  and &lt; 50  copies/ml  through  Week  96  and through  Week  144,  as  defined  by  the  TLOVR  algorithm.  In  addition  to  excluding  patients  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline  NNRTI  resistance  (MITT),  the  Week  96  efficacy  analysis  set  excluded  Week  48  TLOVR responders who did not consent to continue the study after Week 48. Further evaluations:

- genotypic and phenotypic resistance,
- effect of dosing emtricitabine and tenofovir DF without regard to meals.

Safety: Adverse events, clinical laboratory tests.

## Sample size

The  study  was  started  with  administration  of  all  three  active  substances  as  separate  medicinal products.  From  week  96  to  144,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  were  administered  as  dual  fixed combination. Through 144 weeks study drugs (FTC and TDF) were administered without regard to food. After completing 144 weeks of treatment with study drug, patients from both treatment groups were  given  the  option  to  roll  over  into  a  protocol  extension  and  switch  their  treatment  regimen  to Atripla, dosed on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime.

A total of 517 patients were randomized, 258 patients to the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group and 259 patients to the lamivudine/zidovudine group. Statistical methods The primary safety and efficacy analysis was conducted upon completion of 48 weeks on study by the last  enrolled  patient.  This  interim  synopsis  report  presents  results  of  safety  and  efficacy  analyses conducted  after  the  last  enrolled  patient  completed  96  weeks  on  study.  The  Week  144  analysis  of efficacy and safety was conducted after the last patient completed 144 weeks on study, and the Week 240 analysis of efficacy and safety will be conducted after the last patient completes 240 weeks on study. Efficacy: The non-inferiority of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF in combination with efavirenz relative to lamivudine/zidovudine in combination with efavirenz through 144 weeks was assessed using a twosided  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  baseline  CD4+  cell  count  stratum-weighted  difference  in  the proportions of patients who achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml and &lt; 50 copies/ml at Week 144 (emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group minus lamivudine/zidovudine group). The emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group was declared noninferior to the lamivudine/zidovudine group if the lower confidence bound was ≥ -0.13.  Randomisation  was  stratified  according  to  baseline  CD4  cell count (&lt;200 / ≥ 200 cells/ml) and HIV RNA (&lt;100,000 / ≥ 100,000 copies/ml). RESULTS Participant flow By  week  48,  487  patients  were  available  for  the  MITT  analysis  (of  the  initially  randomised  517 patients). By week 144, 161 (63%) patients in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group and 126 (50%) lamivudine/zidovudine group remained on study. The most common  reasons for premature discontinuation were 'patient lost to follow up' and 'subject withdrew consent'. More patients in the lamivudine/zidovudine  group  withdrew  for  adverse  events  (11%  vs.  5%).  Between  week  144  and week 168, nine patients discontinued the study regimen, mostly for withdrawal of consent (n = 6), and one  each  for  adverse  event,  death  (cardiac  arrest  due  to  cardiac  dysfunction  NOS,  (considered  not related to Atripla) and subject lost to follow-up).

## Baseline data

Demographics  as  well  as  baseline  disease  characteristics  appear  well  balanced  between  the  two treatment groups with the majority of patients being white males. Noteworthy, 40% of this ART naïve treatment population present with an advanced disease stage, i.e. AIDS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes and estimation

At week 48 superiority of the FTC/TDF regimen with respect to the primary variable was shown.



Through 144 weeks of this study, in which study drugs (FTC and TDF) were administered without regard  to  food,  treatment  response  rates  among  patients  who  responded  to  a  dosing  questionnaire (N=164/227  in  FTC/TDF-group)  were  numerically  slightly  different  between  those  who  reported routinely dosing the regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF with food, and those who reported routinely dosing without food, i.e., at least 1 hour before or after a meal (see Table 4). Table 4 Effect of dosing with or without food on treatment outcomes at week 144 NA, not applicable a Routinely took one daily dose of AZT/3TC with food and one daily dose of AZT/3TC without food The  duration  of  Study GS-01-934  was  further  extended  from  144  to  240 weeks.  An  analysis  was performed 24 weeks after initiation of Atripla (Week 168); the efficacy data is presented in Table 5. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  the  secondary  efficacy  analyses  at  week  144  (efficacy  analysis  set,  N  =  456  for  HIV-1  RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL),  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  emtricitabine  +  tenofovir  DF group  compared  with  the  lamivudine/zidovudine  group  achieved  and  maintained  confirmed  HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400  copies/mL  through  Week  144,  as  defined  by  the  TLOVR  algorithm.  The  difference  in proportions, weighted by baseline CD4+ cell count stratum, between the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group and the lamivudine/zidovudine group was 13%, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 4% to 22%. The proportion of patients who achieved and maintained plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml was similar between the treatment groups and met the pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority.

Treatments a p-values are calculated using McNemar test The statistically significant difference in subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml may be driven by 8 subjects with missing data, all of whom had HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 50 copies/ml at their last available measurement. Nevertheless, this statistically significant difference, especially together with a statistically  significant  decrease  in  CD4-cell  counts  between weeks 144 and 168 (overall median of -14 cells; p=0.03), is noteworthy. Study GS-US-164-0107 (COMET Study) METHODS A  prospective, single-arm, open-label, switch study in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed patients on a stable regimen of efavirenz taken with lamivudine/zidovudine, who had evidence of adverse clinical or laboratory effects associated with lamivudine/zidovudine or who might benefit from a simplified, once-daily antiretroviral regimen, regardless of lamivudine/zidovudine tolerability status. Study Participants HIV-1 infected,  virologically  suppressed  patients  on  a  stable  regimen  of  efavirenz  taken  with lamivudine/zidovudine (&gt; 18 years, on a stable regimen consisting of EFV (QD) and lamivudine/zidovudine (BID) for ≥ 8 weeks) Subjects were instructed to take one tablet of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF and one tablet of efavirenz, at the same time, once daily, without regard to meals.

The planned enrolment was 400 patients. Statistical power calculation was not considered for sample size determination. The sample size was based on the feasibility of conducting such a trial. Statistical methods Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the observed results and changes from baseline for each of the endpoints. Appropriate tests of significance, paired-tests for assessing observed changes from baseline were used to assess the statistical significance. RESULTS Participant flow A total number of 411 patients were enrolled, of which 372 completed the study. Baseline data The majority of participants were male (83%), White (76%), and switched because they 'might benefit from  simplified  regimen'  (84%).  Mean  prior  antiretroviral  therapy  was  4.9  years  with  a  mean  of 4 years on lamivudine/zidovudine.

Objectives a p-values are calculated using McNemar test Ancillary analyses A total of 348 subjects (87%) had ≥ 95%  adherence with study drug. Of those, mean emtricitabine/tenofovir DF treatment adherence calculated by pill count was 98%. By questionnaire, (answered by 318 patients for weekly recall, and 322 for monthly recall), 86% of subjects reported taking study drugs for the previous week and month before the visit. Study AI266073 METHODS An  ongoing,  Phase 4,  randomized,  open-label,  clinical  study  comparing  the  single  tablet  regimen Atripla  to  unmodified  HAART  in  HIV-1  infected  patients  who  have  achieved  stable  virologic suppression (&lt; 200 copies/ml on two consecutive measurements) for at least 3 months on their current HAART regimen. Study Participants Patients must be on their first HAART regimen or have documented viral suppression on a previous PI-based regimen at the time of prior change in therapy. HAART must consist of either a PI (with or without ritonavir) + at least 2 NRTIs (alternatively 1 NRTI/1 NtRTI) or an NNRTI + at least 2 NRTIs (alternatively 1 NRTI/1 NtRTI). Patients on a HAART-regimen containing TDF, FTC and EFV and patients who have known resistance to any of the study agents at any time in the past were excluded from the study. Treatments Subjects  randomized  to  receive  Atripla  were  instructed  to  take  one tablet  once  daily  on  an  empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Subjects randomized to continue on their HAART regimen (stayed on baseline regime = SBR) were instructed to continue the regimen according to the product labelling. To  compare  the  effectiveness  (efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability)  in  subjects  on  the  fixed  dose combination  to  that  of  subjects  continuing  unmodified  HAART  as  measured  by  the  proportion  of patients who maintain HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL on their original assigned regimen at Week 48 using the time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) analysis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint is the proportion of  patients who maintain  HIV-1  RNA &lt;200 copies/mL on their originally  assigned  regimen  at  Week  48  using  the  time  to  loss  of  virologic  response  (TLOVR) analysis. Among several secondary endpoints there are the proportions of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48, the safety and tolerability of each treatment arm, the change from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline  in  absolute  CD4  cell  count,  viral  genotypic  analysis  at  time  of  virologic  rebound  and  the change in treatment adherence.

Sample size

A total of 300 patients were enrolled.

## Randomisation

Randomization was equally stratified by the use of Protease Inhibitor (PI) or Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) in the treatment regimen at study entry. Each stratum was planned to enrol  approximately  150  patients  and  was  randomized  (2:1)  to  receive  treatment  arm  1  (switch  to Atripla) or treatment arm 2 (SBR=unchanged HAART). Statistical methods A two-sided 95% confidence interval based on the difference in treatment group response rate (SBR minus continue unmodified HAART) was constructed. The confidence interval was stratified by PI- or NNRTI-based therapy. The definition of non-inferiority was employing a delta of 0.15. The Atripla arm was declared non-inferior to the SBR arm if the lower confidence limit is greater than -15%. A superiority test was performed if the lower bound of the stratified confidence interval was greater than 0. The time to event analysis was also estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment groups were tested for a group difference using the log-rank test. The 95% CI was calculated for the difference in proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL &amp; &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 (NB: 48-week data to be reported as follow-up measure). RESULTS Baseline data The patient population was balanced for baseline characteristics, with the majority of patients being male (88%) and having a mean age of 43 years. 67% of the patients are white, 29% black and 23.3% have a hispanic/Latino origin. Although the inclusion criterion was HIV1-RNA ≤ 200 copies/ml, the vast majority of patients (96%) had &lt; 50 copies/ml at baseline and can thus be considered virologically suppressed  also  in  a  strict sense. The HAART regimens at study randomization are displayed in Table 8. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For none of the analyses presented in table 10 the lower boundary of the 95%CI exceeds 7%. This data tend  to  show  that  Atripla's  efficacy  at  24  weeks  can  be  considered  non-inferior  to  SBR  in  patients being virologically suppressed on their baseline regimen. Analyses applying HIV1-RNA thresholds of 200 and 400 copies/ml support this conclusion. · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) For  substantiating  tenofovir's  efficacy  irrespective  from  its  instruction  for  use  (either  with  food  or without  food)  a  cross-study  comparison  between  studies  GS-01-934  and  study  GS-99-903  was performed. The latter was a phase 3, randomized, double blind, multicenter study of the treatment of antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected patients comparing tenofovir DF administered in combination with lamivudine  and  efavirenz  versus  stavudine,  lamivudine,  and  efavirenz  (each  taken  according  to  the instructions  for  use  as  detailed  in  the  respective  SmPCs).  Since  lamivudin,  in  principle,  can  be considered  very  similar  to  emtricitabine,  the  results  of  this  study  could  be  compared  to  study GS-01-934.

Clinical safety

*MITT-analysis set, excluding patients with baseline NNRTI resistance and week 48 responders who did not consent to continue the study after week 48. · Clinical studies in special populations In Studies GS-99-903 and GS-01-934, a subset of patients who had mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min  to  &lt; 80 ml/min)  at  baseline  was  identified:  Response  rates  (proportions  of patients  who  achieved  and  maintained  confirmed  HIV-1 RNA  &lt; 400 copies/ml  and  &lt; 50 copies/ml (TLOVR algorithm) through Weeks 48, 96, and 144) as well as mean increases in CD4+ cell count were similar for tenofovir DF and control regimens in patients with mild renal impairment or normal renal function. Limited data are available for patients with HBV co-infection. In study GS-01-934, no emergence of HBV mutations that could be associated with emtricitabine + tenofovir DF therapy or lamivudine/zidovudine  therapy  was  observed  through  week 48  in  the  small  subset  of  patients  coinfected with HIV and HBV. In Study GS-99-903, 11 patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV (5 in the tenofovir DF group and 6 in the control group) with baseline serum HBV DNA ≥ 6 log10 copies/ml and with Week 48 data were analyzed. Of the 11 co-infected patients, 2 of 5 in the tenofovir DF group and 4 of 6 in the active control group discontinued prior to Week 144. One co-infected patient in the active  control  group died before Week 144. All patients (5/5) in the control group with HBV DNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml developed lamivudine-resistance mutations by week 96. · Supportive study Study GS-98-902 was a dose-finding study for Viread comparing the efficacy of a 150 mg and 300 mg dose of TDF. The study was provided to substantiate the lack of a clinical relevant effect when the bioavailability of tenofovir DF is reduced by 35%. However, this study - also considering additional post-hoc hoc analysis - could not support the intended claim. · Patient exposure Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  single-dose  bioequivalence  trial  GS-US-177-0105  in  healthy  volunteers  and  the  uncontrolled extension  phase  of  study  GS-US-01-934  in  HIV-infected  patients  have  been  performed  with  the intended commercial formulation of Atripla. Moreover, limited safety information is available from an ongoing  study  in  about  200  patients  being  treated  with  Atripla  (AI266073,  24-week  limited  data presented). Other safety data on the co-administration of the three drugs have been collated in study GS-01-934, where efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF have been administered as single agents (week-144 study report) and in the uncontrolled 'switch' study' GS-164-0107. The following summarises the safety data from study GS-US-01-934 which is considered as the most relevant for the specific assessment of the fixed dose combination and its use in the intended patient population. This safety data is therefore also presented in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

In addition to the events summarized in Table 15, acute renal failure was reported for one patient in the lamivudine/zidovudine group. The event began on Day 6, while the subject was hospitalized for an SAE of cryptococcal meningitis and was resolved on Day 13 without any change in study regimen dosing. The event was Grade 1 in severity, was not reported as an SAE, and was considered by the

investigator as unrelated to study regimen. No subject in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group had acute renal failure.

Statistically significant differences for mean changes from baseline in calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault method) were reported for the two treatment groups at week 144 (-8.29 [TDF/FTC] vs.  -0.56  [lamivudine/zidovudine]).  Also  the  comparison  of  the  glomerular  filtration  rate  (MDRDequation) disfavoured the TDF/FTC-group.

Other events Bone  fractures  were  generally  trauma-related  and  occurred  less  commonly  in  the  emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group (6 events) compared with the lamivudine/zidovudine group (8 events). They were thus not indicative of bone toxicity associated with tenofovir DF. Skin hyperpigmentation was reported in 15 patients in the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group and in 9 patients  in  the  lamivudine/zidovudine  group.  All  hyperpigmentation  events,  except  one  Grade 2 event in each treatment group, were of Grade 1 severity. Numbers of patients with AEs related to mitochondrial toxicity are small showing no clear difference in reporting rates in either group (Table 16). Treatment effects on body composition favoured the emtricitabine + tenofovir DF group, as evidenced by  increases  in  mean  body  composition  in  limb  fat  (+1.13 kg  change  from  Week 48  to  Week 144, p &lt; 0.001)  compared  with  decreases  in  the  lamivudine/zidovudine  group  (-1.09 kg  change  from Week 48 to Week 96, p = 0.001). Five deaths occurred; however, none was reported as being related to study drug.

The statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, reported up to week 96 were no longer present at week 144.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Discontinuation  for  adverse  events  occurred  in  13  patients  in  the  TDF/FTC  group  (mainly  for psychiatric disorders, drug eruption, nausea) and in 29 in the lamivudine/zidovudine group (in most cases for anaemia).

Available safety data from the other clinical studies can be summarised as follows: Study GS-US-177-0105 The most frequently reported adverse reactions from study GS-US-177-0105 are displayed in table 19. Table 19 Treatment-emergent adverse events reported for at least 5% of subjects by treatment (safety analysis set) Medicinal product no longer authorised

a Each subject is counted only once for each system organ class and adverse event preferred term. Adverse events mapped according to MedDRA version 8.1.

b Test Treatment = EFV/FTC/TDF fixed-dose triple-combination tablet

c Reference Treatment = EFV + FTC + TDF taken concurrently under fasted conditions

Two pregnancies (i.e. serious adverse events) occurred during the study; they were detected during period 1 (both in reference group) and ended in spontaneous abortions. The abortions were considered related to study drug by the investigators.

Several laboratory values were outside the normal range. Clear differences between the dosing groups occurred with respect to ALT (&gt;ULN), glucose (&gt;ULN), sodium (&lt;LLN), and haemoglobin (&lt;LLN), each with higher rates in the test group.

Study GS-164-0107 Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 49% of subjects. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported by 4% of subjects (17/402), none of which was reported for more than 1 subject. Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported for 1 subject each (&lt; 1%) were thrombocytopenia, adrenal mass, pyrexia,  appendicitis,  injection-site  cellulitis,  penile  abscess,  pneumonia,  alcohol  poisoning,  joint injury, meniscus lesion, multiple-drug overdose, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, flank pain, renal  cell  carcinoma,  cerebral  sarcoidosis,  peripheral  neuropathy,  spontaneous  abortion,  anxiety disorder, depression. One SAE (Grade 3 thrombocytopenia) was reported as related to study drug. The patient was hospitalized and received a platelet transfusion. Change from baseline to Week 24 for median serum creatinine concentration was 0.1 mg/dl and for median  calculated  creatinine  clearance  (Cockcroft-Gault  formula)  was -7  ml/min,  which  was statistically  significant  (&lt;  0.001).  None  of  these  changes  were  reported  as  an  AE,  and  no  subject discontinued or interrupted study drug because of a renal event. Graded serum creatinine laboratory abnormalities (Grade 1 or 2) were recorded for 5 subjects. Three subjects reported a single bone fracture, all of which were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drugs. Treatment-emergent AEs were the cause of study drug discontinuation for 2% of subjects. One death occurred during the study. The patient committed suicide by multiple drug overdoses. The subject had pre-existing depression, which was contributory. Study AI266073 24-week interim data is available for this study. 12 subjects have experienced serious adverse events (SAEs)  after  randomization  in  this  study  (two subjects  have  had  two  separate  SAEs  reported). Two SAEs  were  considered  related  to  study  drug  (Atripla:  acute  hepatitis  and  acute  pancreatitis). Nine subjects (Atripla group) have experienced 19 adverse events (AEs) related to study drug that led to study discontinuation. No further structured safety data have been provided.

Clinical  studies  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine,  or  tenofovir DF  did  not  include  sufficient  numbers  of elderly  subjects  (i.e.,  aged ≥ 65 years)  to  allow  evaluation  of  efficacy  and  safety  in  this  population. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF has not been evaluated in  patients ≥ 65 years.  Since  elderly  patients  are  more  likely  to  have  decreased  renal  function,  the EFV/FTC/TDF fixed dose combination tablet should be used with caution when treating patients over the age of 65 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  EFV/FTC/TDF  fixed-dose  combination  tablet  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  or adolescents (&lt; 18 years) due to insufficient efficacy and safety data in this population, and the inability to adjust dose or dose interval.

Tenofovir and emtricitabine pharmacokinetics were substantially altered in subjects with moderate and severe  renal  impairment.  Patients  with  creatinine  clearance &lt; 50 ml/min  should  not  receive  the EFV/FTC/TDF fixed-dose combination tablet. Patients with this degree of renal impairment require dose  interval  adjustment  of  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir DF  that  cannot  be  achieved  with  the EFV/FTC/TDF  fixed-dose  combination  tablet.  Increasing  the  dosing  interval  for  renally  impaired patients, as instructed in the Viread and Truvada SmPCs, would reduce exposure to efavirenz because its elimination is not affected by renal impairment.

· Post marketing experience Postmarketing  safety  data  indicate  that  tenofovir DF  therapy  may  cause  renal  adverse  reactions, including renal failure, Fanconi syndrome, and other proximal tubulopathies. The risk of such events may  be increased in patients with underlying renal impairment. Moreover, the use of the EFV/FTC/TDF fixed-dose combination tablet should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Although  the  postmarketing  data  are  limited,  hepatitis  flares,  or  possible  signs  and  symptoms  of hepatitis flares, have been observed following withdrawal of treatment with tenofovir DF in patients coinfected  with  HBV  (8  cases).  Four  of  these  occurred  in  HIV  and  HBV  coinfected  patients;  one resulted in a fatal outcome. The remaining four cases involved off-label use for HBV mono-infection. There  have  been  no  reports  of  post-treatment  flares  during  the  post-marketing  experience  with emtricitabine. 5.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3. 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated  and are controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  At  the time of the CHMP opinion, the development of a suitably-discriminating dissolution test for all active substances  was  considered  to  require  further  improvement.  This  issue  together  with  a  few  minor unresolved quality issues, which all do not have any impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product, will be addressed as part of the follow-up measures to be addressed post-authorisation. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The non-clinical study programme for the fixed combination reflects that all individual components are already approved for antiretroviral combination therapy. Due to the available non-clinical data for the  individual  compounds  and  the  dual  combination  emtricitabine  /  tenofovir  DF,  as  well  as  the sufficiently  documented  human  experience  of  the  combined  use  of  all  compounds,  the  lack  of additional  nonclinical  studies  for  the  fixed  combination  product  was  considered  justified  by  the CHMP. Further toxicological investigations with the triple combination are unlikely to yield new data relevant  to  humans  given  that  the  preclinical  toxicology  profile  of  the  individual  agents  is  well established and no synergistic toxicities are predicted.

The pharmacodynamic assessment of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF appears to support the use of these 3 agents together in combination therapy for HIV-1 disease. Regarding the potential for drug resistance the use of the triple combination product, in vitro studies have shown neither crossresistance  between  the  NRTI-associated  substitutions  M184V/I  and/or  K65R  and  efavirenz  nor  any cross-resistance between efavirenz-associated substitutions and either emtricitabine or tenofovir. With the exception of the limited findings from Study AD-177-2001, no new pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted or reported that are relevant  to  EFV/FTC/TDF  film-coated tablets.  The  toxicologic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

profiles of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir are well characterized in multiple animal species and with the exception of the limited findings from Study AD-177-2001, no other new toxicology studies have been conducted or reported that are relevant to fixed combination. All impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and qualified. There are no new impurities or degradation products. An environmental  risk  assessment  was  provided  in  support  of  the  application  and  studies  have  been performed or are on going with the latter to be submitted as follow-up measure.

## Efficacy

In the bioequivalence study (GS-US-177-0105) it was demonstrated that the commercial formulation of Atripla is bioequivalent to the respective co-administered individual medicinal products. However, this  study  was  conducted  in  fasting  conditions.  According  to  the  currently  approved  SmPCs  for tenofovir-containing  medicinal  products  these  should  be  taken  with  food;  this  is  because  available pharmacokinetic data unequivocally demonstrates a reduction in bioavailability of tenofovir by 35% when administered without food. The  fixed  dose  combination  Atripla,  however,  is  recommended  to  be  taken  without  food,  since otherwise  exposure  to  efavirenz  would  increase  and  thus  potentially  negatively  impact  the  safety profile of the drug. The applicant claims the absence of a clinically relevant food effect on tenofovir exposure based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data as well as efficacy data. However, the arguments were either not  appropriately  substantiated  or  the  data  provided  was  not  considered  sufficient.  Therefore,  the CHMP  raised  concerns  regarding  the  lack  of clinical data to demonstrate  that the  reduced bioavailability of tenofovir DF has no impact on the clinical effect of the combination. In study GS-01-934, the once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir  DF administered without regard to food demonstrated durable antiviral efficacy comparable to that of a regimen containing lamivudine/zidovudine + efavirenz as well as immunological benefit in antiretroviral  treatment-naive  HIV-1  infected  patients  at  week  144.  The  extension  study  post  week 144, in which patients of both treatment groups completing 144 weeks were rolled-over to Atripla, was not considered appropriate for the demonstration that the reduced bioavailability of tenofovir DF when administered without food does not translate into a clinically relevant effect due to the lack of a control group, the highly pre-selected patient population, the lack of administration guidance before week  168,  the  short  duration  of  therapy  with  Atripla  as  well  as  the  lack  of  appropriate  statistical analyses. Of note is that in this extension statistically significant differences in virologic response and CD4  cell  count  between  week  144  and  week  168  were  observed.  Data  on  'study  drug  intake with/without food' was collected from the participants. However, since a protocol for this part of the study was not submitted, the validity of the data has to be questioned. Similarly,  results  of  study  GS-US-164-0107  could  be  interpreted  that  in  virologically  controlled, treatment-experienced patients, switching  from  the  twice-daily  regimen  of  lamivudine/zidovudine  + efavirenz to a once-daily (two-tablet) regimen  of  emtricitabine/tenofovir DF + efavirenz  was associated with maintenance of virologic suppression and immune function. However, also this study presents with major deficiencies in its design, in particular the lack of a control group. The medicinal products  could  be  taken  without  regard  to  food;  however,  no  data  has  been  submitted  on  the proportions of patients taking it in either way. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Study GS-98-902 clearly shows that the study data does not allow concluding on non-inferiority of the two  doses.  The  data  from  study  GS-99-903  could  be  regarded  as  supportive  at  best  based  on  the similarities between lamivudine and emtricitabine. In neither study data was collected on the actual dosing of the study drugs, i.e. if the three APIs, efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF were all taken at the same time.

Finally, study AI266073 may not serve as a proof for non-inferiority of Atripla as compared with the individuals agents due to the exclusion of patients with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF in their  current  antiretroviral  regimen  with  the  consequence  that  this  study  may  not  contribute  to clarification of the issue whether the intake of tenofovir DF without food (when given as Atripla) will

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impact  the  efficacy  of  this  triple  combination  therapy.  However,  when  specifically  considering  a switch in virologically suppressed patients then the study results appear promising. The vast majority of patients had a successful virologic suppression at baseline and maintained it, even when applying the threshold of 50 copies/ml. The lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval did not exceed -5% in  any of the main analyses. Overall, at 24 weeks the results are compatible with the hypothesis of non-inferiority between Atripla and continuing HAART, when applying a non-inferiority margin of 7%.

Atripla is a fixed-dose combination of the non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, the nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  emtricitabine,  and  the  nucleotide  reverse  transcriptase inhibitor  tenofovir  disoproxil  fumarate.  The  combination  of  these  antiretroviral  substances  for  the treatment of HIV-1 infection has shown good and durable antiretroviral efficacy in terms of virologic as  well  as  immunologic  parameters  and  a  satisfactory  safety  profile  in  antiretroviral  therapy  naïve patients through 144 weeks of therapy as compared to lamivudine/zidovudine + efavirenz. It is thus generally recommended as one option in 'first-line' therapy in these patients.

Safety Extensive post-marketing data has been collated for the three active substances contained in Atripla. Limited safety data for the fixed combination itself in patients has been presented (clinical studies, post-marketing experience). In principal, the reported types and rates of adverse events from these data sets are compatible with the already known adverse event profiles of the individual components, also with respect to the adverse events of special interest. Special safety concerns known for the individual active  substances  are  CNS  toxicity  and  rash  (efavirenz),  renal  and  bone  toxicity  (tenofovir  DF),  as well as hyperpigmentation and mitochondrial toxicity (emtricitabine). In the bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers, more adverse reactions were reported for the test group, with some types of adverse reactions occurring only in subjects having taken the test formulation, e.g. hypoaesthesia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, myalgia, and dyspnoea. Also, the documented differences in the laboratory findings between test and reference group (alterations in ALT, glucose, Na, Hb, and urinalysis) after intake of only one single dose of Atripla are noteworthy . This study did include by majority healthy women of child-bearing potential; two pregnancies (and abortions) have been reported during this study of less than two months duration. Pregnancies with the use  of  Atripla  are  of  concern  given  that  efavirenz  is  an  agent  with  marked  teratogenic  effects  in animals hence an additional pregnancy warning was added to the product information including the recommendation to use effective dual contraceptive measures not only during therapy but also for up to 12 weeks after cessation of therapy. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. User consultation A readability testing (user consultation) of the package leaflet for Atripla 600 mg/ 200 mg/ 245 mg film-coated  tablets  has  been  conducted  on  the  English  language  version  of  the  proposed  package leaflet submitted in the initial application. The results of this user testing are considered acceptable and in accordance with the relevant guideline. Risk-benefit assessment Benefits Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  individual  substances  as  well  as  a  dual  combination  of  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  DF  have already been licensed for combination antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the benefit for Atripla rests on the convenience of taking a single tablet once daily that combines three agents instead of taking two or three  tablets  that  also  have  to  be  taken  once  daily,  however,  not  at  the  same  time  due  to  different instructions for use (i.e. with/without food).

## Risks

The development of this triple combination encounters a conflict regarding the instructions for use. While tenofovir DF is to be administered with food to increase bioavailability, it is recommended to take  efavirenz  on  an  empty  stomach,  since  food  would  increase  the  bioavailability.  An  increase  in systemic exposure of efavirenz, however, is considered critical especially in light of its CNS toxicity. Due to the safety concerns with efavirenz it is recommended to follow for the fixed dose combination Atripla the same administration schedule, i.e. on an empty stomach ideally at bedtime. However, the available pharmacokinetic data on tenofovir DF demonstrates that this would reduce its bioavailability by 35%. It would hence need to be shown that this reduction in exposure does not hamper the clinical efficacy of the triple combination. No adequate clinical data was provided to support this change of the instructions for use tenofovir DF in general. The only study which allows drawing conclusions on the efficacy of the fixed combination given  on  an  empty  stomach  investigates  the  switch  of  existing  HAART  regimens  in  patients  with adequate virological response to their prior treatment to Atripla. Balance Acknowledging the efficacy and safety of the combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, the CHMP nevertheless did not consider that the convenience of 'one tablet once daily' would outweigh the risk of lower efficacy due to reduced bioavailability of one  of  the  components  of  the  fixed  dose  combination.  Adequate  data  to  demonstrate  the  lack  of clinical relevance of the unavoidable change of the administration of tenofovir TD in the fixed dose combination has not been provided. In order to confirm the assumption of a negligible impact of the food influence on the efficacy of tenofovir within the fixed dose combination, a comparative study would be needed to allow for a comparison between Atripla at fasting conditions and the individual substances administered according to their currently approved SmPCs. In the absence of this study the general  use  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  for  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  was  not  considered sufficiently justified. However, the CHMP considered the available data for the switch in virologically suppressed patients from their successful antiretroviral combination therapy to Atripla as sufficient for concluding on noninferiority of Atripla as compared to other continued HAART regimens in this patient population. The resulting  increase  in  convenience  due  to  the  simplified  dose  regimen  would  constitute  an  adequate benefit  in  this  case;  additional  data  on  maintenance  of  the  virologic  response  over  48  weeks  was requested to be provided as follow-up measure. A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that: · pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Atripla in the therapeutic indication

'Atripla  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  efavirenz,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate.  It  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus-1  (HIV-1) infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months.  Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have  harboured  virus  strains  with  mutations  conferring  significant  resistance  to  any  of  the three components contained in Atripla prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

The demonstration of the benefit of Atripla is primarily based on 24-week data from a clinical study  in  which  patients  with  stable  virologic  suppression  on  a  combination  antiretroviral therapy  changed  to  Atripla  (see section 5.1).  No  data  are  currently  available  from  clinical studies with Atripla in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients. No data are available to support the combination of Atripla and other antiretroviral agents.' was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
