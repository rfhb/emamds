There is no specific (causally acting) therapy available for Japanese encephalitis infection. IXIARO has an established positive benefit risk profile shown both in clinical trials (high seroconversion rates, significant lack of serious adverse reactions) as well as in post-marketing (no confirmed cases of vaccination failure, limited number of serious reactions not affecting the safety profile). However, the post-marketing exposure of IXIARO to pediatric population is very small to date. This limited exposure, together with fewer than 2,000 pediatric subjects exposed in clinical trials, form a safety database that is too small to characterize rare or very rare adverse events, including the important identified and potential risks mentioned in the Risk Management Plan. Hence, the CHMP recommends one additional 5-year renewal of the   |

| II/0039/G   | This was an application for a group of variations. The MAH proposed the extension of indication of Ixiaro to the paediatric segment (2 months of age and older) in line with approved PIP EMEA -000559- PIP01-09-M03. Modification of syringe label to include \"half dose mark\" for administration of a 0.25 ml nominal dose for the paediatric sub-segment 2 months to below 3 years of age in line with the aforementioned PIP. The latter is grouped with the indication extension as direct result of the proposed extension. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to be updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.2.

| II/0005     | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC based on the 24 and 36 months immunogenicity and safety data from studies IC51-303, -305, and -311 in line with follow-up measures 016 and 018. The PL was updated accordingly. The MAH also took this opportunity to add the approved EU numbers in section 8 of the SPC and to amend the instructions for disposal in section 6.6 of the SPC. Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to correct a minor spelling mistake in the address of the manufacturer in Annex II and to update the European Medicines Agency web site address. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/02/2010   | 23/03/2010 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The data demonstrate that for the antibody response following primary immunisation regimen of 2x 6µg is long- lasting and clearly boosterable after 11 or 23 months. This is further corroborated by immunogenicity data on a booster dose given 15 months after the primary immunisation. Therefore, subjects with a continuously high risk of exposure to Japanese encephalitis should receive a booster dose within a time interval of 1 to 2 years after the primary immunisation series to ensure optimal protection. Moreover the data indicate that subjects, who received only a single dose of 1x 6µg respond effectively to a booster dose given 11 months after the first dose. This information is deemed to be important for travellers which are in urgent need to be at least partly protected within a short time frame and are not able to complete the primary immunisation series (e.g. last minute travellers). In addition the list of adverse events was updated to reflect the safety data from the studies submitted. |
