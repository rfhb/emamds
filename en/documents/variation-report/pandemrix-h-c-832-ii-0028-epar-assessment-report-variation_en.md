## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisation in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  phase  6  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for  Pandemrix  H1N1 to  reflect  newly  available  post-dose  2-  results  from  a  clinical  study  in children 6 -35 months of age (D-PAN-H1N1-009, called 'H1N1-009' in this report). Furthermore,  preliminary  safety  data  from  study  D-Pan-H1N1-010  in  3-17  year  old  children  and available post-marketing spontaneous reporting data were assessed for this variation. This  variation  has  been  submitted  to  fulfil  the  specific  obligation  SOB  056.1  for  which  the  MAH committed to provide safety and HI immunogenicity data (uncleaned) post dose 2 (half dose) from this study to CHMP. Further data will be submitted from this study at intervals as committed in the Letter of Undertaking for the pandemic strain variation (PU-017) and described in Annex II to the Opinion. 1.2 Clinical aspects FLU D-PAN H1N1-009 This is a phase II, randomised, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1 following a homologous prime-boost schedule in children aged 6 to 35 months. The study was initiated in September 2009 and is ongoing at five study sites in Spain. The study planned to enrol 204 children aged 6 to 35 months with allocation to two parallel vaccine groups  in  a  ratio  of  1:1  (i.e.  to  receive  the  full  3.75 μ g/AS03A  or  half  1.9 µg/AS03B  adult  dose). Subjects  were  to  be  stratified  into  three  age  strata  (6 to 11 months,  12  to  23  months,  and  24  to  35 months) with a ratio of 1:1:1. Enrolment was to occur in three steps: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- o Step  1:  Open  enrolment  of  51  subjects  into  vaccine  group  1.9 µg/AS03B.  There  were  to  be  17 enrolled into each age stratum.
- o Step 2: Open-label, randomised enrolment of 102 subjects in a 1:1 randomisation ratio between vaccine group 1.9 μ g/AS03B and vaccine group 3.75 μ g/AS03A
- o Step 3: Open enrolment of 51 subjects into vaccine group 3.75 μ g/AS03A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The sequential co-primary objectives are:

- o To  evaluate  superiority  in  terms  of  vaccine  homologous  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI) antibody response after a booster dose of Pandemrix administered at 6 months following a twodose primary series with 3.75 µg/AS03A vaccine compared to the response after the first dose.
- o To  evaluate  superiority  in  terms  of  vaccine  homologous  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI) antibody response after a booster dose of Pandemrix administered at 6 months following a twodose primary series with 1.9 µg/AS03B vaccine compared to the response after the first dose.

## The secondary objectives are:

## Immunogenicity

- o To assess HI responses at 21 days after the 1st and the 2nd dose primary vaccinations and after the booster at Month 6 in each vaccine group.
- ¾ Data after the second dose are now reported from this initial cohort (N=51).

o To assess HI GMTs, SCRs, SPRs and SCFs seven days, six months and one year after the booster dose. o To describe the antibody responses in the three age strata used for enrolment in this study. o To describe the neutralising antibodies at each time point in a subset of sera. Safety o To  evaluate  safety  in  terms  of  selected  biochemistry  safety  parameters  (ALT,  AST,  BILI, BUN and CREA) on Day 0, Day 21, Day 42, at Month 6 and Month 6+7 Days. o To evaluate post-primary and post-boost safety and reactogenicity in terms of 7-day solicited local and general symptoms and the 21-day post Dose 1, 62-day post Dose 2 and 30-day postbooster dose unsolicited AEs. o To describe medically-attended events (MAEs), adverse events of specific interest (AESIs) or potential Immune-Mediated-Diseases (pIMDs) and SAEs during the whole study period. Exploratory o To evaluate the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response in terms of the expression of T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) markers in a sub-cohort of 60 subjects at each time point. o To  describe  immunogenicity  to  any  emergent  drifted  variant  from  A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like  antigen  in  terms  of  HI  on  Day  0,  Day  21  and  Day  42  in  all  subjects  and neutralising antibodies on Day 0, Day 21 and Day 42 in a subset of subjects. This analysis will depend on the emergence of such a drifted strain and on the availability of adequate testing reagents. Vaccination was to occur on Day 0 and Day 21 with administration IM into the anterolateral part of the thigh for subjects below 12 months of age at entry and into the deltoid for older children. Results The data that triggered this variation application refer to children from Step 1 and 2. Safety data are now available from children as shown in the table. The total available safety data now comprise: i) Administration of one and two doses of 1.9 µg/AS03B (i.e. half the adult dose of HA and of AS03 in 0.25 ml volume) ¾ Data after the first dose in the initial cohort were already reported (N=51; see II/025). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- ¾ Data after a first dose are also reported for a second cohort (N=53).
- ii) Administration of the first dose of 3.75 µg/AS03A (i.e. one adult dose in 0.5 ml volume) to a third  cohort  of  children  (N=53).  The  plan  to  administer  a  second  dose  is  on  hold  for  the present time.

Immunogenicity data from the additional children enrolled since the data from the first cohort of 51 were reported are not yet available. However, the MAH has submitted HI data post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 from the 51 children in the initial  cohort  plus  neutralising  antibody  (NA)  data  from  a  subset  of  the  sera  obtained  after  the  first dose in this initial cohort of 51 children. Immunogenicity data The table below summarises the immunogenicity data overall and by age strata as reported from the first  cohort  of  51  subjects,  assessed  in  variation  II/025  and  already  included  in  section  5.1  of  the SmPC. At Day 0 only three subjects (all in the 6-11 month stratum) were seropositive and 2/3 were seroprotected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40;

2 seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4fold increase in titre;

3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the prevaccination GMT.

4 all subjects seronegative prior to vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  November  27 th the  MAH  officially  filed  this  variation  with  inclusion  of  statistical  tables  that compare the HI responses in the initial cohort of 51 subjects after doses 1 and 2. Tables are provided for the total cohort and for the three age strata.

The GMTs showed very marked increases overall and in each of the three age strata from D21 to D42.

Seroprotection rates were already 100% in each age stratum at D21 and therefore also at D42 in each age stratum. The single child who had not seroconverted at D21 had done so by D42. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Following the increments observed in the GMTs the SCFs exceeded at least 200 at D42 in each age stratum. As with the GMTs the increments increased with increasing age.

The MAH does not yet have an in-house neutralising antibody (NA) assay up and running. Post-dose 1 sera (N=36) from the first cohort of 51 children to receive a half adult dose in this study were sent to CDC (Atlanta,  USA)  for  determination  of  neutralising  antibody  titres.  It  should  be  noted  that  this assay is not of the same general design as that used by the MAH to determine NA against H5N1 in previous  studies  and  therefore  the  titres  obtained  cannot  be  compared  with  results  from  the  H5N1 studies in any age group. The number of sera tested from each age stratum and the NA seroconversion rates are shown below. As  shown  in  the  figure  below  no  children  aged  12  months  or  above  were  seropositive  before vaccination while 2/12 (17 %) were seropositive in the 6-11 months age group, probably reflecting maternal antibody. Seroconversion rates (defined as a 4-fold rise and reaching at least 1:40) were from 66.7% (8/12) in the 6-11 months age stratum to 91.7% (11/12) and 83.3% (10/12) in the two older strata. The GMTs were comparable across the three age strata. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The safety analysis based on the initial cohort after the first half adult dose provided the summary data shown in the two tables below. It should be noted that no child over 2 years of age had a fever and no child  had  a  fever  over  39 0 C while only 3/51 had a fever  over  38 0 C.  The  risk  of  fever  appeared  to decrease with increasing age.

Discussion on immunogenicity The immunogenicity data show a very marked increment in HI GMT after the second half adult dose. However, with all children already seroprotected and all but one seroconverted after the first half adult dose there was no discernible effect of the second half adult dose on SPR or SCR at D42. As already pointed out in II//025 it is not known if the CHMP criteria are of any relevance to this age group and therefore the potential benefits of a very large increase in GMT with a second half adult dose cannot be interpreted in terms of what this may mean for protective efficacy. The limited NA data, based on the CDC assay, indicate that at least 2/3 children seroconverted after a first half adult dose and all were seropositive at D21. The response was lowest in the children aged 611 months. These data support a conclusion that there is a marked immune response to a first half adult dose but suggest that a second half adult dose may potentially provide a major increment in NA. On the  basis  of  these  data  alone  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  that  a  single  half  adult  dose  would provide optimal protection against clinical disease in children aged 6-35 months but at the same time it cannot be ruled out that a single half adult dose may be sufficient. Clinical safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

These  results  should  be  viewed  in  the  light  of  the  fact  that  the  diary  cards  indicated  that  no prophylactic antipyretics were administered for the first dose.

After the second half adult dose in the initial 51 subjects the rates of each of pain, redness and swelling (all  and  Grade  3)  were  higher  compared  to  the  first  half  adult  dose  based  on  a  total  dataset  of  104 subjects (51 from the initial cohort and 53 from the second cohort).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  figure  below  also  shows  the  post-dose  1  data  for  the  53  subjects  who  have  received  a  first vaccination with the full adult dose. This was associated with higher rates of pain than after the first or second of the half adult doses but the rates of redness and swelling were comparable with the second half adult dose. Administration of a second adult dose to these 53 subjects is currently on hold.

The MAH also compared local reactogenicity between the initial and second cohorts after the first half adult dose and in the same figure below these rates are compared with the data after the second half adult dose. These data show that after the first half adult dose the rate of pain was anyway higher in the second cohort  compared  to  the  initial  cohort  but  comparable  with  that  after  the  second  half  adult  dose.  In contrast  the  rates  of  redness  and  swelling  were  slightly  lower  after  the  first  half  adult  dose  in  the second cohort to be vaccinated compared with the initial cohort and lower than rates reported after the second half adult dose.

In the statistical tabulations of safety the rates of local reactions are shown after the first and second doses by age stratum. The most comparable data are those for the 51 subjects who have received two half adult doses. The three tables below show the data for this initial cohort after the first and second half adult doses. The MAH also provided data for the total after a first and total after second half adult doses plus the data by age stratum after a first full adult dose. For local reactions (first table below) the rates of pain must be interpreted in the ability of subjects to express pain as opposed to parents suspecting pain. That is, reporting rates go up with age, which may correlate with ability of subjects to verbalise complaints. Redness  and  swelling  are  more  objective  and  after  the  first  dose  it  was  mainly  those  aged  12-23 months who were affected but rates went down in this age group after the second dose while they increased in the other two strata. In the additional 53 children who received a half adult dose and the 53 that received a full adult dose in  step  2  the  rates  of  local  reactions  were  highest  in  the  12-23  month  group  and,  as  shown  in  the figures above, higher after a full adult dose. The second and third tables below show the general symptoms after first and second half adult doses in the initial cohort of 51 children. After the first dose drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite were reported most often in the youngest cohort. There were 8 children with any fever of which 5 were aged 6-11 months and 3 were aged 12-23 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As shown in the figures that follow, the rates of all general symptoms increased after the second dose and the tables demonstrate that this was observed in each age stratum such that rates of drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite were not only higher but more comparable across the age strata after the second half adult dose. Fever rates were highest in the youngest cohort, in which 15/17 children had any fever compared to 10/17 in each of the other two cohorts. In addition, the rate of fever ≥ 38.5 0 C was highest in the 6-11 months stratum (6/17; 4/17 in each of the other age cohorts). There were only three children with fever ≥ 39 0 C, one aged 6-11 months and two aged 24-35 months.

On  comparing  the  total  cohort  results  between  doses  and  recruitment  cohorts,  again  the  greatest concern is clearly the rate of fever (and especially fever based on axillary temperature ≥ 38.5 0 C) after the second half adult dose compared to the first half adult dose. The rate of any fever increased from 16% after the first to 69% after the second half adult dose in the initial cohort of 51 subjects. Rates for other general symptoms showed smaller and less worrying increases. Nevertheless, rates of Grade 3 general symptoms (including Grade 3 fever defined as axillary temperature &gt; 39 0 C) remained low.

The figure also demonstrates that rates for general symptoms after the first full adult dose in the third additional cohort of 53 subjects resembled those observed after the first half adult dose in the total 104 subjects for which data are now available. Therefore the rate of fever after the second half adult dose stands out as a problematic finding.

In the next figure the MAH again compares symptom reporting rates between the initial and second cohorts after the first half adult dose with those after the second half adult dose in the initial cohort. While rates of reporting for each general symptom were higher in the second cohort there was still a very marked difference in the rate of reporting any fever between the first and second doses.

A  further  breakdown  of  the  fevers  reported  shows  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  post-dose  2 reports  concerned  Grade  2  fevers,  which  are  in  the  range  associated  with  triggering  of  febrile convulsions in this at-risk age group.

The MAH points out that the post-dose 2 safety data observed with Pandemrix H1N1 in children aged 6-35 months were not expected based on the data observed with administration of two half adult doses of H5N1 AS03-adjuvanted vaccine in children aged 3-5 years.

The figure below usefully summarises these data for Part A (two half adult doses) and Part C (two full adult doses) of the study of H5N1/AS03 in children aged 3-5 years and 6-9 years. It will be observed that the post-dose 2 fever rates even after two adult doses of H5N1/AS03 were lower than reported after the second half adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 in study H1N1-009 in younger children, although in  both  cases  the  proportion  with  higher  fevers  increased.  Also,  that  after  two  half  adult  doses  of H5N1/AS03 there was no increment in the rate of any fever in the children aged 3-5 years and only a modest increment in children aged 6-9 years.

This figure also demonstrates that rates of any fever after the first half adult dose or first full adult dose of H5N1/AS03 in children aged 3-5 or 6-9 years were slightly lower than observed after the first half  adult  dose  of  Pandemrix  H1N1  in  children  aged  6-35  months.  This  could  reflect  a  difference between age groups or could represent a difference between H1N1 and H5N1 strains or both.

The  table  below  compares  the  rates  of  adverse  reactions  (i.e.  data  are  based  only  on  symptoms considered vaccine-related by investigators) after two half adult doses of H5N1/AS03 in children aged 3-5 years and after each half adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 in children aged 6-35 months. This table demonstrates the clear differences between the two studies in the most closely comparable subgroups according to dose and age.

The table also demonstrates that the rates of Grade 2 fever were very much higher after the second dose of Pandemrix H1N1 compared to the first dose or to two doses of half dose H5N1/AS03 in older children  but  the  per-dose  rates  of  Grade  3  fever  were  comparable  between  the  H5N1  and  H1N1containing vaccines.

However, the MAH has preliminary safety data after the first and second adult doses administered to children aged from 3-17 years in study H1N1010.  The  data  for  fevers  are  summarised  in  the  figure  below,  which  compares  the  findings  to administration of two full doses of  H5N1/AS03 as previously reported from study 023. These data clearly show that there is an increment in fever rates after the second dose of Pandemrix H1N1 in each age group but fever rates after the second dose decrease with increasing age.

The  table  on  the  next  page  provides  the  solicited  general  symptom  rates  considered  related  to vaccination and by age strata from study H1N1-010. There is a clear trend for increases for most symptoms with the second dose. Rates for any related fever  are  lower  and  more  comparable  across  age  strata  after  the  first  dose  compared  to  the  second dose,  where  there  is  a  trend  to  decreasing  fever  rates  with  increasing  age.

## Post-Marketing experience

## MAH data - spontaneous reports

As of 23rd November 2009, the MAH had received 54 spontaneous reports corresponding to one event coding to a MedDRA PT containing the word 'fever' in subjects ≤ 12 years old for which Pandemrix was a suspected drug. As of 20 th November 2009, an estimated 206,900 children had received at least one dose of Pandemrix in post-marketing use.

Because mass vaccination campaigns are in progress, it was deemed important to include all available data.  Therefore,  unverified  cases  and  cases  in  which  data  entry  is  in  progress  (n=8;  15%)  were included in this analysis.

A third report from Norway included convulsion, pyrexia, restlessness and injection site swelling in a 9-year-old female. Concurrent medical conditions included epilepsy, panhypopituitarism and psychomotor retardation. On 28 October 2009 she subject received the 1st dose of Pandemrix H1N1. Two hours  later,  she  experienced  'one  convulsion  followed  by  a  series  of  seizures.'  She  slept  for several  hours  and  the  next  morning  she  experienced  4  seizures  in  10  minutes.  The  seizures  were treated with diazepam. The mother reported that the seizures were different from usual. On 29 October 2009, the subject experienced restlessness, fever (38 0 C) and injection site swelling.

The 54 reports describe 26 (49%) females, 27 (51%) males and one subject of unspecified gender. The median age was 8 years (range, 11 months - 11 years). Sixteen (30%) of the reports were serious and 38 (70%) were non-serious. Two reports of febrile convulsions were received but three additional reports included the terms fever and convulsion. The five cases are summarised by the assessor as follows: A febrile convulsion was reported in a 5-year-old male from Norway who had had a previous febrile convulsion and had asthma. Sometime in October 2009, the subject developed an upper respiratory tract  infection,  which  was  reported  as  'ongoing'  after  the  febrile  convulsion  had  resolved  but  the timing of the onset of this event in relation to the vaccination or the seizure was not elucidated. On 26 October 2009, the subject received the 1st dose of Pandemrix H1N1. Two hours after he developed a fever (39.9 0 C) and one hour later he experienced a febrile convulsion that lasted 15 minutes. On 27 October 2009, the fever had resolved. A  second  report  from  Norway  concerned  febrile  convulsion,  cyanosis,  musculoskeletal  stiffness, foaming at the mouth, pyrexia and crying in a 14-month-old male. The parents stated he had chronic otitis since the age of 4 months and recurrent fevers &lt; 38 0 C. Three weeks before vaccination, the child had an episode of fever and otitis. He received unspecified antibiotics until 21 October 2009 and had 'high fever' from 22 - 24 October 2009. On 26 October 2009 he received the 1st dose of Pandemrix H1N1. Eight hours later, he had fever  (39.4  -  39.9 0 C),  which  was  treated  with  ibuprofen.  Two  hours  later  (i.e.  10  hours  after vaccination) he had a febrile convulsion with stiffness, froth from mouth and unresponsiveness for 15 minutes.  There  was  also  facial  cyanosis  (gray  colour)  and  abnormal  crying.  The  events  resolved spontaneously before the ambulance arrived but he was still hospitalised.

A report from the UK concerned convulsion, pyrexia, lethargy, and somnolence in a male child of unspecified age. The  medical  history was  not reported but concurrent medications included fluticasone,  salbutamol,  montelukast  and  prednisolone.  On  05  November  2009,  the  patient  received Pandemrix  H1N1.  The  next  day,  she  experienced  convulsion,  fever,  lethargy  and  drowsiness  on waking. No additional details were provided.

A report from Sweden concerned convulsion, loss of consciousness, dyspnoea, lethargy and pyrexia in a 6-year-old female. There was no history of febrile convulsions. On 4 November 2009 she received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pandemrix  H1N1.  Two  days  later  she  reportedly  fell  in  a  doorway  and  seemed  to  have  breathing difficulties. A teacher found the girl in a 'fainted state,' but observed neither convulsions nor urinary incontinence. An ambulance was called and during the transport to the hospital, the girl was indolent but had normal respiration and circulation. Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted to be febrile (38.8 0 C). Neurological status was normal. No treatment was given. On 07 November 2009, she had recovered and was discharged.

Assuming  that  all  54  reports  of  fever  are  valid  and  that  206,700  children  were  vaccinated,  the reporting rate for fever in children is 1 report per 3828 children vaccinated, or 0.03%. This is rare, by CIOMS IV criteria.

| Event              |   Number of cases | EB05 EB95   |   EBGM |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Pyrexia            |               285 | 1.287 1.563 |  1.42  |
| Febrile convulsion |                 2 | 0.367 1.614 |  0.816 |

Vaccination with Pandemrix H1N1 started in on Sweden 12 th October 2009 in risk groups at all ages ≥ 6  months,  pregnant  women  and  health  care  personnel.  As  of  25 th November 3,798,000 doses had been distributed and more than 3 million people (i.e. one third of the Swedish population) had been vaccinated. Children aged from 6 months to 12 years receive two half adult doses of Pandemrix. A total of 1000 ADRs reports had been received by the MPA from Health Care Professionals and around 1300 reports from consumers.

Assuming that the number of reported febrile convulsions could be as few as two or as many as five, and  that  206,700  children  were  vaccinated,  the  reporting  rate  for  febrile  convulsions  in  children  is between 1 report per 41,340 and 1 report per 103,350 children vaccinated. These are very rare, by CIOMS IV criteria. The  MAH's  disproportionality  analysis  considers  SAEs,  all  spontaneous  reports  and  all  postmarketing surveillance in age groups. The results of the most recent weekly analysis show that neither pyrexia nor febrile convulsions have been reported disproportionately often after immunisation with Pandemrix compared to all other GSK vaccines. Disproportionality analysis The MAH discusses that the ACIP has reported in 2009 that in a study of 791 healthy children aged 115 years post-vaccination fever following administration of a single dose of unadjuvanted, trivalent influenza vaccine was noted among 12% of those aged 1-5 years, 5% among those aged 6-10 years and 5% among those aged 11-15 years. The  MAH considers  that  spontaneous  reports  of  fever  do  not  indicate  an  increased  incidence  with Pandemrix  compared  to  unadjuvanted  seasonal  influenza  vaccine.  However,  because  of  the  known limitations of passive reporting, relatively frequent events, like fever, are better studied in randomised, controlled trials. In contrast, spontaneous reporting is often useful for yielding information about less frequent events, such as febrile seizures. Other sources of relevant safety information The  following  data  from  post  authorisation  spontaneous  reporting  in  Sweden  and  the  Netherlands became available during the procedure and were considered supportive for this variation: Swedish data Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  MPA  has  further  published  recommendations  on  the  website  regarding  vaccination  in  young children &lt; 3 years including use of antipyretic treatment in case of high fever.

## Data from The Netherlands

Around  350,000-400,000  children  received  a  first  half  adult  dose  of  Pandemrix  during  the  week commencing  November  23  in  The  Netherlands.  The  second  doses  will  be  given  in  the  week commencing 14 December. An overview on adverse reactions experiences in The Netherlands can be found here:  http://www.lareb.nl/kennis/signalen.asp

## Discussion on safety

There  seem  to  be  at  least  four  febrile  convulsions  known  to  the  MAH  that  are  very  likely  due  to vaccination with a half adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 and it is clear that this can occur even after the first  dose. Children &lt; 3 years are in the highest risk group for febrile convulsions although feverish illnesses are very common in this age group and relatively few are reported to result in convulsions. Febrile convulsions have therefore been included in the adverse events section under the sub-section on experience with Pandemrix (H1N1) vaccine.

Clinical data The data from study H1N1- 009 show that the reactogenicity of the second half adult dose is greater than the first within the initial cohort and also when comparing the total 104 who have received a first half adult dose with the 51 who have received a second half adult dose. The patterns of reporting by age stratum indicate that local and general reactogenicity is higher after the second half adult dose for most individual symptoms and in all age strata. The major concern is the rate of fever after the second half adult dose in children aged 6-35 months, which would not be predicted from the prior experience with H5N1/AS03 vaccine in older children aged 3-5 years. Nevertheless, it is clear that fever may also occur after the first half adult dose and febrile convulsions have been reported in association. As the CHMP considered that these data should be added to the SPC along with a warning regarding fever rates, the PI was updated to reflect this. In addition, and not proposed by the MAH, section 4.8 was  updated  to  clarify  that  febrile  convulsion  has  been  reported  specifically  in  association  with Pandemrix H1N1 (the current wording indicates convulsion only with seasonal vaccine experience). The additional data from H1N1-010 also show higher rates of fever after the second full adult dose in children  aged  from  3  years  upwards  but  with  decreasing  rates  with  increasing  age.  It  would  be expected that rates after a second half adult dose in this age group would be lower. Nevertheless, the warning  in  section  4.4  could  prudently  avoid  a  strict  upper  age  cut-off,  especially  in  light  of  the additional data reported. Post marketing experience With regard to the spontaneous reporting of ADRs in this age group thus far it can only be stated that fever has certainly prompted ADR reports from health care professionals and consumers. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There  are  no  data  known  so  far  regarding  any  possible  effect  of  prophylactic  or  early  post-dose paracetamol on immune responses to influenza vaccines. Therefore it is considered appropriate for the SPC and PL to suggest that antipyretic medication is given at the first sign of increasing temperature to  over  38  degrees  Celsius.  Taking  into  account  the  available  data  in  3-6  year-olds,  the  CHMP recommended that this warning should not just apply to those aged &lt; 3 years.

## 1.3 Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

In variation II/025 the MAH provided an abridged study report describing safety and immunogenicity data following vaccination with one half of the adult dose of Pandemrix (i.e. 1.9 µg HA +AS03B) in 51 children aged 6-35 months. The safety and HI immune response data were reported according to the three pre-defined age strata with 17 subjects per stratum. These data raised no particular concerns and have already been summarised in the SPC. The CHMP did not feel able to recommend the option of a single half adult dose in this age group based only on the HI data available.

This  variation  is  based  on  further  information  sent  from  the  MAH  to  the  Rapporteur  between November 20 th and  December  2 nd ,  including  the  data  filed  in  the  variation  received  27 th November 2009.

The HI data after each half adult dose demonstrate a marked immune response to the second dose in terms of increments in GMTs in each of the three age strata. The limited post-dose 1 NA data from CDC support a conclusion that there is a good response to a first half adult dose but likely leave room for a marked increment in NA also to occur after a second dose. The available data are insufficient to indicate  whether  a  single  half  adult  dose  in  this  age  group  would  be  sufficient  but  this  hypothesis cannot be ruled out. The  available  data  clearly  indicate  increased  reactogenicity  with  the  second  half  adult  dose  of Pandemrix H1N1 in children aged 6-35 months but the major concern is the increase in rate of fever, including Grade 2/3 fever, with the second dose. The post-dose 2 findings were unexpected based on the observations made in 3-5 year-old children who received H5N1/AS03 vaccine in the previously reported  study.  Post-marketing  data  seem  to  confirm  that  fevers  are  very  common  after  the  second dose.  Fever  also  seems  to  occur  commonly  or  very  commonly  after  the  first  dose  and  febrile convulsion has been reported even after the first dose. However, the MAH's assessment suggests that the rate of febrile convulsion may not be unusually high. Children aged 6-35 months mounted a good immune response to the first half adult dose based on HI and NA data available. It is not known at this time whether the increment in HI antibody observed after the second half adult dose will confer added protection. However, the new safety data post dose 2 throw some doubt on the benefit-risk relationship for a second dose. At this time the CHMP proposes that SPC section 4.2 should reflect the data, with appropriate cross references, to leave the selection of one or two half adult doses in this age group open. The option to administer a second dose should take into consideration the safety and immunogenicity information provided in the SPC sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. 1.4 Changes to the Product Information The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- o Annex  II  was  updated  to  reflect  the  status  of  the  specific  obligation  to  submit  safety  and immunogenicity data from Study D-Pan H1N1-009.
- o Section  4.2  of  the  SPC  was  amended  to  reflect  that  preliminary  immunogenicity  data  in  a limited number of children aged 6-35 months show that there is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three weeks. It was further added that the use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in the relevant SPC sections.
- o SPC Section  4.4  was  further  revised  to  point  out  that  not  only  fever  is  increased  after  the second  dose,  but  to  indicate  an  increase  in  the  rates  of  injection  site  reactions  and  general symptoms. Furthermore, a recommendation to use measures to lower fever, such as antipyretic

- medication after each vaccination are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age).
- o The wording in section 4.8 was revised to provide more clarity, and the adverse reaction 'febrile convulsions' was moved to the sub-section on post marketing experience with Pandemrix (H1N1) due to the available data from spontaneous reporting.
- o In addition, post-dose 2 HI data and post-dose 1 NA have been added to section 5.1.

The PL was updated accordingly
