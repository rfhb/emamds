## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Tritanrix HepB. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 November 2002. For information on changes after 1 November 2002 please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Tritanrix HepB is a tetravalent vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals S.A. on the basis of the combination of the existing active ingredients  in  their  diphtheria-tetanus-inactivated  whole  cell  pertussis  vaccine  (DTPw)  and  their recombinant yeast-derived hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B). Both the DTPw vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine have been licensed and used successfully as separate vaccines in EU member states (and in a number of non-EU countries) for a number of years.

This  tetravalent  vaccine  contains  not  less  than  30IU  of  adsorbed  D  toxoid,  not  less  than  60  IU  of adsorbed T toxoid, not less than 4 IU of Pw and 10 µ g of r-HBsAg protein/0.5ml equivalent to one dose.  The  company  applied  for  two  presentations:  a  3ml  monodose  vial  containing  one  dose  of vaccine and a 10ml multidose vial containing ten doses of vaccine.

The diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids are prepared from the toxins of cultures of Corynebacterium  diphtheriae and Clostridium  tetani by  formalin  inactivation  using  established technology.  The  pertussis  (PW )  component  is  obtained  by  heat  inactivation  of  phase  1  culture  of Bordetella  pertussis bacteria.  The  surface  antigen  of  the  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBsAg)  is  produced  by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus.

The following indications are claimed for Tritanrix HepB:

'Tritanrix  HepB  is  indicated  for  active  immunisation  against  diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis  and hepatitis B (HB) in infants from 6 weeks of age onwards.

The  rationale  for  the  production  of  this  new  combination  is  established  within  the  context  of  the universal  vaccination  of  infants  against  hepatitis  B,  as  recommended  by  the  WHO  EPI  (Expanded Program on Immunisation), for simplifying vaccine delivery and reducing the costs. The incorporation of  the  hepatitis  B  vaccine  in  a  multivalent  formulation  with  DTPW is  appropriate  and  technically feasible because both DTPw and hepatitis B vaccines are adsorbed products that are administered by the intramuscular route and also because their administration schedules includes multiple doses during the first year of life.

The results of pharmacology (potency and immunogenicity) and toxicology tests and the results of the relevant clinical trials needed for the review of this application have been submitted.

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological aspects

The data submitted were in compliance with the current requirements.

During the CPMP discussions particular attention was given to the following quality aspects:

## Dosage form

The  DTPWHB  vaccine  contains  merthiolate  as  preservative  in  both  the  monodose  and  multidose preparations. This preservative has been used in DTP vaccines for years, and has been shown to be efficacious.  The  SB  hepatitis  B  vaccine  also  contains  merthiolate.  The  combined  DTPWHB vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

also contains 2-phenoxyethanol as a residual. The possibility of using 2-phenoxyethanol as the only preservative was discussed.

The  possibility  of  removing  the  preservative  altogether  from  the  single  dose  presentation  was  also discussed. Its use was justified by the fact that this preparation is not terminally sterilised and that its intrinsic  cloudy  appearance  (because  of  the  presence  of  adjuvant)  carries  the  potential  to  mask evidence of microbial contamination.

## Method of preparation

The completeness of adsorption of D, T and Hbs antigens has been demonstrated. Furthermore the Company  commits  to  testing  each  final  bulk  for  completeness  of  adsorption  as  an  additional specification.

## Control of starting materials

An updated list of specifications for the bulk purified D and T toxoids was considered necessary and has been provided by the company.

## Control of the finished product

As  to  the  specifications  for  the  Hepatitis  B  component,  they  have  been  brought  in  line  with  those agreed for the company's hepatitis B vaccine Engerix B as presented in the renewal dossier which was reviewed by the CPMP in 1994. An updated list of specifications was considered necessary and was provided  by  the  company.  The  specification  for  the  potency  of  the  HBsAg  on  mice  is  expressed relative to the reference Engerix B; the upper fiducial limit (P=0.95) of the estimated relative potency is  reported  to  be  not  less  than  1.0.  The  amount  of  unbound  HBsAg  is  less  than  1%  of  the nominal value according to the updated specification.

The limit for residual ethylene oxide in the Terumo syringes has been set according to the Note for Guidance as published in Volume III of The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union.

The  final  potency  specifications  of  the  PW  component  meet  EP  (European  Pharmacopoeia) requirements.  Data  from  the  company  provided  evidence  of  the  conformity  of  batches  of  Tritanrix HepB with EP and WHO requirements.

## Stability

The stability parameters for the final product were shown to be complete and stability data after 36 months storage at 2-8C have been provided, including pH and sterility. Data presented on batches of the D, T and HB components stored for 36 months at 2-8 ºC, show that there is no release from the adjuvant (desorption) during storage. The stability parameters for the final product also includes tests for the completeness of adsorption. A shelf-life of 24 months for the finished product was accepted at the time of approval. The shelf-life of 24 months was recently extended to 36 months following the submission of additional supporting data.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The active ingredients of the vaccine are well known. The excipients used in this combined vaccine are  well  known  and  the  amounts  are  within  the  limits  used  for  other  vaccines.  Toxicological  tests (which  follow  the  requirements  of  WHO  and  the  EP)  were  performed  on  5  lots  of  the  combined vaccine DTPW -HB.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These tests include:

- specific toxicity in guinea pigs for diphtheria and tetanus
- general safety tests in mice and guinea pigs.
- mouse weight gain test for pertussis toxicity

The 5 lots tested were found to comply with the specifications.

As  to  the  potency  of  this  combined  vaccine,  5  lots  were  tested  using  methods  in  accordance  with Ph.Eur. and the WHO requirements for DTPW and the mouse potency test developed by the company for lot release of hepatitis B vaccine.

The vaccine was first released for clinical trials on the basis of specifications set up at 2 IU as a mean potency for the pertussis component. The final potency specifications of the PW component meet EP (European Pharmacopoeia) requirements. This was referred to in the clinical assessment of the dossier.

No other data were submitted or considered necessary.

## 1. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## Clinical trials

The complete results of 6 clinical trials performed by 3 groups in 3 European countries were presented in  this  application.  A  total  of  872  subjects  aged  7  to  20  weeks  were  included.  One  study  was performed using a pilot lot on a small number of children, the 5 others, for part or all subjects using three production lots of the vaccine .

These  clinical  trials  demonstrate  the  production  of  protective  levels  of  antibodies  after  the  primary vaccination series against diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B in ≥ 98% of the vaccinees and a response against pertussis in ≥ 92%. These results were considered convincing.

The following trials were provided to address outstanding questions.

- Study  DTPW  HB-038;  an  open  randomised study comparing the immunogenicity and reactogenicity  of  the  combined  DTPW  -HB  vaccine  with  that  of  simultaneously  administered DTPW and HB vaccines (different sites).  Although  this  trial  was  not  a  double  blind  study,  it nevertheless  provides  convincing  evidence  that  the  combined  vaccine  is  as  immunogenic  as DTPW  for  each  of  the  3  components  of  this  vaccine  and  more  immunogenic  with  respect  to hepatitis  B  than  the  HB  vaccine  administered  at  a  different  site.  In  this  single  comparative clinical  study  the  combined vaccine was more reactogenic (see Table of results in SPC) than DTPW and HB vaccines administered at different sites.
- Study DTPW HBV-023; an interim report of a double-blind randomised study to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of combined tetravalent DTPW -HB vaccines administered at 1.5, 3.5 and 6 months of age primed at birth with hepatitis B 10 mg component. This study was performed to investigate the use of the vaccine in children younger than 8 weeks of age. It shows  that  local  and  general  reactogenicity  is  similar  to  that  observed  with  the  combined vaccine in study DTPW HB-038.
- Study DTPW HB-Hib-003; an open randomised trial; sub-analysis of the immunogenicity data for  infants  who  received  the  first  dose  of  vaccine  at  5-6  weeks.  The  immunogenicity  of  the DTPW HB vaccine was considered to be adequate when the first dose is administered at 6 weeks.
- Two additional studies were performed to document the persistence of antibodies after the 3 dose primary vaccination.

These studies suggest that the persistence of antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis after DTPW HB vaccine is not different from that after DTPW and show that at least 80% of the vaccinees with the combined vaccine have protective levels of anti-Hbs antibodies during the second year of life. This suggests that a booster dose during the second year of life is warranted at least for the diphtheria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tetanus and pertussis components, as it is current practice, but it does not give sufficient evidence as to the necessity of a booster dose for the hepatitis B component.

The limited experience with DTPW HB as a booster indicates adequate immunogenicity. However, the reported experience is insufficient to evaluate the reactogenicity of a booster. This point is made clear in the SPC.

During the CPMP meeting on 19-20 December 1995, a number of outstanding clinical issues were addressed and oral explanations were given by the company. These explanations were also provided in writing and were found to be acceptable by the Rapporteur. The main issues which were discussed can be summarised as follows:

- Evaluation  of  the  protective  efficacy  of  the  pertussis  component:  a  summary  of  a  study  was submitted to demonstrate the efficacy of the SB vaccine DTPW.
- A higher incidence of reactions following administration of the combined vaccine as compared to  administration  of  DTPW  and  hepatitis  B  vaccines  separately  was  reported  in  one  clinical study. A revised statement and a table in the SPC reflect this clearly.
- The balance between this aspect and the operational benefits gained by using the combination has been considered in the light of the proceedings of the WHO Task Force which convened in 1992 and concluded that there was 'an important need for a DTPW-HB vaccine'.
- Possible interaction with other routine childhood vaccines: Study DTPW HB-Hib-003; an open randomised study to evaluate the tolerability and immunogenicity of the DTPW HB vaccine and the SB tetanus-conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine injected either simultaneously at different sites or mixed, showed that there was no interference in the immune response to any of the components.
- Another study showing a lack of interference between Engerix B and OPV is also supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services - ACIP recommendations on Immunisation (MMWR January 28, 1994, vol., 43 no. RR1).

During the CPMP meeting break-out session on 13 February 1996, a representative from the WHO presented  an  overview  comparing  the  reactogenicity  of  other  existing  DTP  vaccines  with  the combined  DTPWHB  vaccine  and  it  was  observed  that  the  profile  of  side  effects  were  reasonably comparable. In conclusion it was noted that although DTPWHB was slightly more reactogenic than the SB Biologicals  DTPW  vaccine  in  Study  038,  its  reactogenicity  in  general,  was  within  the  range  of other DTP vaccines currently available.

In addition to the post marketing surveillance mentioned in Council Regulation 2309/93, the company will initiate outside the EU additional surveillance in accordance with the involved authorities.

Finally the SPC was revised taking into account the following points:

- The insufficient experience with respect to the immunogenicity of the combined vaccine DTPW HB as a booster
- Vaccination with the combined DTPW and HB vaccine in children born to HB carrier mothers.
- The a.m. revised statement on the reactogenicity profile of this vaccine.

## 5. Conclusions

During its meeting on 12-13 March 1996 the CPMP considered satisfactory data on quality, safety and efficacy  have  been  submitted  by  the  company to  support  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Tritanrix HepB.

Although  the  CPMP  recognised  that  Tritanrix  HepB  is  more  reactogenic  than  the  DTPw  vaccine manufactured  by  the  same  company,  the  company  provided  sufficient  evidence  in order to demonstrate that the reactogenicity of this combined vaccine is within the range observed for other DTPw vaccines currently used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consequently the CPMP has come to the conclusion that the overall benefit/risk analysis was positive and  adopted  two  favourable  opinions  to  accommodate  for  the  monodose  and  the  multidose presentations.

Since  the  Marketing  Authorisation  was  granted,  the  CPMP  considered  at  the  time  of  the  5-year renewal that the benefit/risk profile of Tritanrix continued to be favourable and therefore, recommended the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation.
