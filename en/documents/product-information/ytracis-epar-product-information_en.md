<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The content of the vial of YTRACIS is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for  the  radiolabelling  of  carrier  molecules,  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies,  peptides  or  other substrates.

Radioactive medicinal products should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in  designated  clinical  settings  and  receipt,  storage,  use,  transfer  and  disposal  are  subject  to  the regulations and appropriate licences of the competent authorities.

Radioactive  medicinal  products  should  be  prepared  by  the  user  in  a  manner  which  satisfies  both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements.

Before administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should  be  given  to  whether  the  administration  could  be  reasonably  delayed  until  the  mother  has ceased breastfeeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to stop breastfeeding.

For  information  concerning  special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use  of  Yttrium  ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Particular  care  should  be  taken  when  administering  radioactive  medicinal  products  to  children  and adolescents. 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation YTRACIS is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3 Contraindications). When it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, information should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has missed a period should be  assumed  to  be  pregnant  until  proven  otherwise.  Alternative  techniques  which  do  not  involve ionising radiation should always be considered. Radionuclide procedures carried out in pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. The  absorbed  dose  to  the  uterus  following  administration  of  Yttrium  ( 90 Y)-labelled  medicinal products is dependent on the specific medicinal product being radiolabelled and is to be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For  information  concerning  the  use  of  Yttrium  ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and lactation refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

Effects on ability to drive or use machines following treatment by Yttrium ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.8 Undesirable Effects

Possible  side  effects  following  the  intravenous  administration  of  Yttrium  ( 90 Y)-labelled  medicinal products  prepared  by  radiolabelling  with  YTRACIS,  will  be  dependent  on  the  specific  medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package  leaflet  of  the  medicinal  product  to  be  radiolabelled.  For  each  patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself. Exposure  to  ionising  radiation  is  linked  with  cancer  induction  and  a  potential  for  development  of hereditary defects. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It allows  continued  monitoring  of  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose The presence of free Yttrium ( 90 Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Ytracis will lead to increase bone marrow toxicity and haematopoetic stem cell damage. Therefore, in case of an  inadvertent  administration  of  Ytracis,  the  radiotoxicity  for  the  patient  must  be  reduced  by immediate (i.e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca- EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. The  following  preparations  must  be  available  in  medical  institutions,  which  use  Ytracis  for radiolabelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) Medicinal product no longer authorised

These chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the yttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA). These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.

1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3-4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100-250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline).

The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval &gt;1 hour does  not  preclude  the  administration  and  effective  action  of  chelator  with  reduced  efficiency. Intravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow.

The toxicity of the free Yttrium ( 90 Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Not applicable ATC code: Not applicable Yttrium ( 90 Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium ( 90 Sr). It decays by emission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98 %) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium ( 90 Zr). 90 Y-yttrium has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours). The pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling  with  YTRACIS,  prior  to  administration,  will  be  dependent  on  the  nature  of  the medicinal  product  to  be  radiolabelled.  Refer  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling  with  YTRACIS,  prior  to  administration,  will  be  dependent  on  the  nature  of  the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. In  the  rat,  following  intravenous  administration,  Yttrium  ( 90 Y) chloride  is  rapidly  cleared  from  the blood.  At  1  and  24  hours,  blood  radioactivity  decreases  from  11 %  to  0.14 %  of  the  administered activity. The two main organs where Yttrium ( 90 Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones. In the liver, 18 % of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection. Liver uptake decreases then to 8.4 % 24 hours after injection. In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1 % at 5 min to 18 % at 6 hours and then decreases with time. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 13 % of the administered activity is eliminated in 15 days. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The toxicological properties of Yttrium ( 90 Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. There are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium ( 90 Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction in animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

Radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with Yttrium ( 90 Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. It  is  important  that  all  glassware,  syringe  needles  etc,  used  for  the  preparation  of  the  radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe  needles  (for  example  non-metallic)  with  proven  resistance  to  dilute  acid  should  be  used  to

See section 12, for detailed instructions of product preparation.

minimise trace metal impurity levels. 6.3 Shelf life 7 days from the date/hour of manufacture. 6.4 Special precautions for storage Store in the original package. Storage should be in accordance with local regulations for radioactive substances. 6.5 Nature and contents of container Colourless  Type  I  glass  2-ml  vial,  closed  with  Teflon-coated  bromobutyl  rubber  stopper  and aluminium overseal. 1 vial contains 0.5 to 2 ml (corresponding to 0.925 to 3.700 GBq calibrated three or four days after the manufacturing date) depending on the ordered radioactivity. The vial is supplied in a lead pot of appropriate thickness. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling The  administration  of  radioactive  medicinal  products  creates  risks  for  other  persons  from  external radiation  or  contamination  from  spills  of  urine,  vomiting,  etc.  Radiation  protection  precautions  in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Before  use,  packaging  and  radioactivity  should  be  checked.  Activity  may  be  measured  using  an ionisation chamber. Yttrium ( 90 Y) is a beta pure emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation chamber  are  very  sensitive  to  geometric  factors  and  therefore  should  be  performed  only  under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.

Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.

The vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The product should be aseptically  withdrawn  through  the  stopper  using  sterilised  single  use  needle  and  syringe  after disinfection of the stopper.

<!-- image -->

Appropriate  aseptic  precautions  should  be  taken,  complying  with  the  requirements  of  Good Pharmaceutical  Manufacturing  Practice,  in  order  to  maintain  the  sterility  of  YTRACIS  and  to maintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
