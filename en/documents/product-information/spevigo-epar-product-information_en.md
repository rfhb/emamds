## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Spevigo 450 mg concentrate for solution for infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each vial contains 450 mg spesolimab in 7.5 mL.

Each mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 60 mg spesolimab.

After dilution, each mL of the solution contains 9 mg spesolimab (see section 6.6).

Spesolimab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology.

## Excipients with known effect

Each vial contains 3 mg polysorbate 20 (E432).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate)

Clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly brownish-yellow solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Spevigo is indicated for the treatment of generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP) flares in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age as monotherapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the management of patients with inflammatory skin diseases.

Treatment can be initiated with the pre-filled syringe as a subcutaneous injection to prevent GPP flares (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Spevigo 150 mg and 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe) or with an intravenous dose of spesolimab to treat a GPP flare.

## Posology

The recommended dose for GPP flare treatment in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg is a single dose of 900 mg (two vials of 450 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion. If flare symptoms persist, an additional 900 mg dose may be administered 1 week after the initial dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Spevigo has not been studied in patients weighing less than 40 kg. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, the recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg is a single dose of 450 mg (one vial of 450 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion (see section 5.2). If flare symptoms persist, an additional 450 mg dose (one vial of 450 mg) may be administered 1 week after the initial dose.

Clinical data for treatment of subsequent flares is very limited (see section 4.4).

Clinical data for concomitant use of other GPP treatments with spesolimab is limited. Spesolimab should not be used in combination with other GPP treatments, e.g. systemic immunosuppressants, to treat a flare (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Spesolimab has not been formally studied in these patient populations. These conditions are generally not expected to have any clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are considered necessary.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of spesolimab in children less than 12 years of age has not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

This medicinal product is for intravenous infusion only. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

Following dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, it is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micron) over 90 minutes. No other infusion should be administered in parallel via the same intravenous access.

In the event that the infusion is slowed or temporarily stopped, the total infusion time (including stop time) should not exceed 180 minutes (see section 4.4).

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4).

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

Spesolimab may increase the risk of infections (see section 4.8).

In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, the potential risks and expected clinical benefits of treatment should be considered prior to prescribing spesolimab. Treatment with spesolimab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important infection occur after treatment with spesolimab.

## Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis

Prior to initiating treatment with spesolimab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Spesolimab is contraindicated to patients with active TB infection (see section 4.3).

Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating spesolimab treatment in patients with latent TB, a history of TB or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. After spesolimab treatment, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.

## Hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions

Hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions may occur with monoclonal antibodies such as spesolimab. Hypersensitivity may include immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis and delayed reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with spesolimab (see section 4.8).

If a patient develops signs of anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity, spesolimab treatment should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be initiated (see section 4.3).

If a patient develops mild or moderate hypersensitivity during an intravenous infusion or other infusion-related reactions, treatment should be stopped and appropriate medical therapy should be considered (e.g., systemic anti-histamines and/or corticosteroids). Upon resolution of the reaction, the infusion may be restarted at a slower infusion rate with gradual increase to complete the infusion (see section 4.2).

## Use in patients with an immediate, life-threatening GPP flare

There is no experience from the use of spesolimab in patients with an immediate, life-threatening flare of GPP or a flare requiring intensive care treatment.

## Concomitant use with other GPP treatments

The safety and efficacy of spesolimab in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, have not been evaluated systematically (see section 4.5). In the GPP flare treatment clinical study, there was a washout period for most other treatments (biologics, other systemic immunomodulating treatments), while some treatments were discontinued before initiation of spesolimab treatment with no washout period required (methotrexate, cyclosporine, retinoids, topical treatments) (see section 5.1).

Concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and spesolimab is not recommended. At initiation of spesolimab treatment, other GPP treatments should be stopped and other treatments (e.g. with systemic immunosuppressants) should not be used concomitantly to treat the flare.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Re-treatment

Very limited efficacy and safety data are available for re-treatment with spesolimab for a subsequent new flare. In Effisayil 1, five patients received re-treatment for a subsequent new flare and were followed up for a minimum of 8 weeks.

## Immunisations

It is unknown whether spesolimab affects the efficacy of vaccines.

No data are available on the potential secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving spesolimab (see section 4.5). The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of spesolimab therapy should be at least 4 weeks. Live vaccines should not be administered for at least 16 weeks after treatment with spesolimab.

For additional information regarding immunisation prior starting the treatment for preventing GPP flares, see Spevigo 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Peripheral neuropathy

The potential for peripheral neuropathy with spesolimab is unknown. Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in clinical trials with spesolimab. Physicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset peripheral neuropathy.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbates

This medicine contains 3 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 7.5 ml vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. In GPP patients, spesolimab is not expected to cause cytokine-mediated CYP interactions as a perpetrator.

Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with spesolimab (see section 4.4).

There is limited experience from the concomitant use of spesolimab with immunosuppressants in GPP patients (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited data from the use of spesolimab in pregnant women. Non-clinical studies using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL36R monoclonal antibody do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of spesolimab during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

No data are present on excretion of spesolimab in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk occurs during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. Consequently, transfer of IgG antibodies to the newborns through milk, may happen during the first few days. In this short period, a risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, spesolimab can be used during breastfeeding if clinically needed. If treatment was discontinued before the last trimester of pregnancy, breastfeeding can be started immediately after birth.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of spesolimab on human fertility. Studies in mice using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL36R monoclonal antibody, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility from antagonism of IL36R (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Spevigo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are infections (17.1%) with urinary tract infection reported as serious in 1 patient (2.9%) (see Description of selected adverse reactions).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 provides a list of the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials as well as in the postmarketing setting. The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency category using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Table 1: Adverse reactions

| System organ class                     | Adverse reactions        | Frequencies    |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Infections and infestations            | Infection a)             | Very common    |
| Immune system disorders                | Hypersensitivity b)      | Not known      |
| Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders | Pruritus                 | Common         |
| General disorders and                  | Injection site reactions | Very common c) |
| administration site conditions         | Fatigue                  | Common         |

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

During the 1-week placebo-controlled period in Effisayil 1, infections were reported in 17.1% of patients treated with spesolimab compared with 5.6% of patients treated with placebo. In Effisayil 1, serious infection (urinary tract infection) was reported in 1 patient (2.9%) in the spesolimab group and no patient in the placebo group. During the placebo-controlled period of up to 48 weeks in Effisayil 2, infections were reported in 33.3% of patients treated with Spevigo and 33.3% of patients treated with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo. In Effisayil 2, serious infections were reported in 3 patients (3.2%) in the Spevigo group and no patient in the placebo group.

Infections observed in clinical trials with spesolimab were generally mild to moderate with no distinct pattern regarding pathogen or type of infection.

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity comprises immediate systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction. Immediate systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in open-label extension trials and the post-marketing setting.

## Injection site reactions

Injection site reactions include erythema, swelling, pain, induration, warmth, exfoliation, papule, pruritus, rash, and urticaria at the injection site. Injection site reactions were typically mild to moderate in severity.

## Paediatric population

The available data for adolescents are limited. 8 adolescent patients with GPP, 14 to 17 years of age, were enrolled in trial Effisayil 2 (see section 5.1). Overall, the safety profile in adolescents treated with spesolimab (n = 6) was consistent with the safety profile in adults and no new safety concerns have been identified.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The highest dose of spesolimab administered in clinical trials was 1 200 mg intravenously or subcutaneously. Adverse reactions observed in subjects receiving single or repeated doses up to 1 200 mg were consistent with the known safety profile of spesolimab.

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and symptomatic treatment be instituted as appropriate.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC22

## Mechanism of action

Spesolimab is a humanised antagonistic monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody blocking human interleukin 36 receptor (IL36R) signalling. Binding of spesolimab to IL36R prevents the subsequent activation of IL36R by its ligands (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream activation of proinflammatory pathways.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Following treatment with intravenous spesolimab in patients with GPP, reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL6, T helper cell (Th1/Th17) mediated cytokines, keratinocyte-mediated inflammation markers, neutrophilic mediators, and proinflammatory cytokines were observed in serum and skin at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

week 1 compared to baseline and were associated with a decrease in clinical severity. These reductions in biomarkers became more pronounced at the last measurement at week 8 in Effisayil 1.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Effisayil 1 (1368-0013)

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Effisayil 1) was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of spesolimab in adult patients with flares of Generalised Pustular Psoriasis (GPP), as diagnosed per European Rare And Severe Psoriasis Expert Network (ERASPEN) criteria, regardless of IL36RN mutation status. Patients were randomised if they had a flare of GPP of moderate-to-severe intensity, as defined by a Generalised Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) total score (which ranges from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]) of at least 3 (moderate), presence of fresh pustules (new appearance or worsening of pustules), GPPGA pustulation sub score of at least 2 (mild), and at least 5% of body surface area covered with erythema and the presence of pustules. Patients were required to discontinue systemic and topical therapy for GPP prior to randomisation (see Table 2). Patients with an immediate life-threatening flare of GPP or requiring intensive care treatment were excluded from the study.

* No treatment initiation 1 week prior to randomisation: phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB), topical treatment for psoriasis or any other skin condition (e.g. topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues, tar, anthralin, topical retinoids); no treatment initiation 2 weeks prior to randomisation, no dose escalation within 2 weeks prior to randomisation, and had to be discontinued prior to receiving the first dose: methotrexate, cyclosporine, retinoids.

** No restriction on inhaled corticosteroids to treat asthma or corticosteroid drops administered in the eye or ear.

The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with a GPPGA pustulation sub score of 0 (indicating no visible pustules) at week 1 after treatment. The key secondary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with a GPPGA total score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) at week 1. For the GPPGA pustulation sub score of 0 and the GPPGA total score of 0/1, non-responder imputation was used to handle the occurrence of escape (treatment at the investigator's choice if the disease worsened) and rescue (single 900 mg dose of intravenous spesolimab) medication use and missing data.

A total of 53 patients were randomised (2:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of 900 mg spesolimab (n = 35) or placebo (n = 18). Patients in either treatment arm who still experienced flare symptoms at week 1 were eligible to receive a single intravenous dose of open-label 900 mg spesolimab, resulting in 12 patients (34%) in the spesolimab arm receiving a second dose of spesolimab and 15 patients (83%) in the placebo arm receiving one dose of spesolimab on day 8. In addition, 6 patients (4 spesolimab arm; 2 placebo arm) received flare treatment with a single 900 mg dose of intravenous spesolimab for reoccurrence of a flare after day 8.

The study population consisted of 32% men and 68% women. The mean age was 43 (range: 21 to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

69) years; 55% of patients were Asian and 45% were Caucasian. Most patients included in the study had a GPPGA pustulation sub score of 3 (43%) or 4 (36%), and patients had a GPPGA total score of 3 (81%) or 4 (19%). 24.5% of patients had been previously treated with biologic therapy for GPP.

## Primary and key secondary efficacy

At week 1, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving a GPPGA pustulation sub score of 0 (indicating no visible pustules) and GPPGA total score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) in the spesolimab arm compared with placebo (see Table 3).

For both the primary and the key secondary endpoint, treatment effect was observed for all patients regardless of the IL36RN mutation status.

## Effisayil 2 (1368-0027)

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II b study (Effisayil 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of spesolimab for subcutaneous administration in adult and adolescent patients with a history of GPP, as diagnosed per ERASPEN criteria, regardless of IL36RN mutation status, and with at least two GPP flares of moderate-to-severe intensity in the past. Patients were randomised if they had a GPPGA total score of 0 or 1 at screening and randomisation. Patients were required to discontinue systemic and topical therapy for GPP prior to or at randomisation. These patients must have had a history of flaring while on concomitant treatment for GPP or a history of flaring upon dose reduction or discontinuation of these concomitant medications.

The primary endpoint of the study was the time to the first GPP flare up to week 48 (defined by a GPPGA pustulation subscore of ≥ 2 and an increase in GPPGA total score by ≥ 2 from baseline). The key secondary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of at least one GPP flare up to week 48. Additional secondary endpoints at week 48 were the time to the first worsening of Psoriasis Symptom Scale (PSS) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) defined as a 4-point increase in total score from baseline.

A total of 123 patients were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive one of the four treatments (see Table 4).

Table 4: Treatment arms in Effisayil 2

|            | Loading dose           | Subsequent doses                     |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| spesolimab | 600 mg subcutaneously  | 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks  |
| spesolimab | 600 mg subcutaneously  | 300 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks |
| spesolimab | 300 mg subcutaneously  | 150 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks |
| Placebo    | subcutaneous treatment | subcutaneous treatment every 4 weeks |

The study population consisted of 38.2% men and 61.8% women. The mean age was 40.4 (range: 14 to 75) years with 8 (6.5%) adolescent patients (2 per treatment arm); 64.2% of patients were Asian and 35.8% were Caucasian. Patients included in the study had a GPPGA pustulation sub score of 1 (28.5%) or 0 (71.5%), and patients had a GPPGA total score of 1 (86.2%) or 0 (13.8%). At the time

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of randomisation, 74.8% of patients were treated with systemic therapy for GPP, which was discontinued at the start of the randomised study treatment.

While 3 dosing regimens were studied in Effisayil 2, the recommended dosing regimen for GPP flare prevention is a subcutaneous loading dose of 600 mg spesolimab followed by 300 mg subcutaneous treatment administered every 4 weeks (see section 4.2). The results summarised below are those for the recommended dosing regimen.

Patients who experienced a flare were eligible to receive up to two open-label, intravenous doses of 900 mg spesolimab (see section 4.2). 2 (6.7%) patients in the spesolimab arm for the recommended dose and 15 (48.4%) patients in the placebo arm received intravenous flare treatment.

Treatment with the recommended spesolimab dose compared to placebo resulted in statistically significant improvement based on the primary and key secondary endpoint (see Table 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1: Time to the first GPP flare up to week 48 (Effisayil 2)

<!-- image -->

For both primary and key secondary endpoint, treatment effect was observed for all patients regardless of the IL36RN mutation status.

One adolescent patient in the placebo arm received investigator-prescribed standard of care to treat GPP worsening and was considered to have a GPP flare. No adolescent patient in the recommended spesolimab dose arm experienced a GPP flare.

The prevention of GPP worsening in terms of PSS, and DLQI was also observed, as shown by the hazard ratios for PSS 0.42 (95% CI 0.20, 0.91) and for DLQI 0.26 (95% CI 0.11, 0.62).

## Immunogenicity

In patients with GPP treated with intravenous spesolimab in Effisayil 1, 46% of patients developed ADAs. A majority of ADA-positive subjects also developed neutralising antibodies. In Effisayil 2, following multiple subcutaneous doses of spesolimab, 41% of the patients developed ADAs. A majority of ADA-positive subjects also developed neutralising antibodies.

Clearance of spesolimab increased along with increasing ADA titers.

As the majority of patients did not experience a subsequent new flare in Effisayil 1, the data on re-treatment of patients with ADA (n = 4) is limited. It is currently unknown if there is a correlation between the presence of ADA to spesolimab and maintenance of efficacy for flare treatment. After subcutaneous administration of spesolimab in Effisayil 2, there was no apparent impact of ADA presence on efficacy or safety.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Spevigo in the paediatric population younger than 12 years of age in the treatment of generalised pustular psoriasis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Conditional approval

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on data collected from healthy subjects, patients with GPP and patients with other diseases. After a single intravenous dose of 900 mg, the population PK model-estimated AUC0-∞ (95% CI) and Cmax (95% CI) in a typical ADA-negative patient with GPP were 4 750 (4 510, 4 970) µg·day/mL and 238 (218, 256) µg/mL, respectively. After a 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose of spesolimab followed by 300 mg spesolimab subcutaneously every 4 weeks, the mean (CV%) steady-state trough concentration ranged from 33.4 µg/mL (37.6%) to 42.3 µg/mL (43.0%).

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous single dose administration of spesolimab in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 5.5 to 7.0 days after dosing. After subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, absolute bioavailability was slightly higher at higher doses with estimated values of 58%, 65%, and 72% at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg, respectively. Based on limited data, absolute bioavailability in the thigh was approximately 85% following a subcutaneous dose of 300 mg spesolimab.

## Distribution

Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the typical volume of distribution at steady state was 6.4 L.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of spesolimab has not been characterised. As a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody, spesolimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

In the linear dose range (0.3 to 20 mg/kg), based on the population PK model, spesolimab clearance (95% CI) in a typical ADA-negative patient with GPP, weighing 70 kg was 0.184 L/day. The terminal-half-life was 25.5 days.

## Linearity/non-linearity

When administered intravenously, spesolimab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with doseproportional increase in exposure across single dose ranges of 0.3 to 20 mg/kg. Both clearance (CL) and terminal half-life were independent of dose. Following subcutaneous single dose administration, spesolimab exposure increased slightly more than dose-proportionally across the dose range of 150 mg to 600 mg due to slightly increased bioavailability at higher doses.

## Body weight

Spesolimab concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight and higher in subjects with lower body weight. Spesolimab has not been studied in patients with GPP weighing more than 164 kg. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, the recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg is half the recommended dose than for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg (see section 4.2).

The exposure in patients weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg receiving the reduced dosing regimen is expected to be comparable with those observed in GPP studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly / gender / race

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, gender and race do not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of spesolimab.

## Hepatic and renal impairment

As a monoclonal antibody, spesolimab is not expected to undergo hepatic or renal elimination. No formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of spesolimab was conducted.

Population PK analysis did not identify mild hepatic impairment or mild or moderate renal impairment as having an influence on the systemic exposure of spesolimab.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of spesolimab in paediatric patients below the age of 14 years have not been studied.

The plasma pharmacokinetics of spesolimab observed in adolescents were consistent with that observed in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity studies.

## Developmental and reproductive toxicity

Non-clinical studies conducted in mice using a surrogate antibody directed towards murine IL36R do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development or fertility.

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with spesolimab.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with spesolimab.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Spevigo is indicated for the prevention of generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP) flares in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the management of patients with inflammatory skin diseases.

Treatment can be initiated with the pre-filled syringe as a subcutaneous injection to prevent GPP flares or with an intravenous dose of spesolimab to treat a GPP flare (see Spevigo 450 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

The recommended dose for GPP flare prevention in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg is a subcutaneous loading dose of 600 mg (either four 150 mg injections or two 300 mg injections), followed by 300 mg (either two 150 mg injections or one 300 mg injection) administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks.

Spevigo has not been studied in patients weighing less than 40 kg. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, the recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg is a subcutaneous loading dose of 300 mg (either two 150 mg injections or one 300 mg injection), followed by 150 mg (one 150 mg injection) administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (see section 5.2).

Clinical data on concomitant use of other GPP treatments with spesolimab is limited. Spesolimab is not recommended for use in combination with other GPP treatments, and tapering of previous GPP treatments should be considered at initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## GPP flare treatment during subcutaneous GPP prevention treatment

If a patient experiences a GPP flare while receiving subcutaneous Spevigo, the GPP flare may be treated with intravenous Spevigo (see Spevigo 450 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics).

## Initiating or reinitiating subcutaneous GPP prevention treatment after intravenous GPP flare treatment

Four weeks after treatment with intravenous Spevigo, subcutaneous Spevigo can be initiated or reinitiated. A subcutaneous loading dose is not required.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be resumed at the regular scheduled time.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Spesolimab has not been formally studied in these patient populations. These conditions are generally not expected to have any clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are considered necessary.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of spesolimab in children less than 12 years of age has not been established.

## Method of administration

The injection should be administered subcutaneously in the upper thighs or abdomen. The pre-filled syringe should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated, or scarred. If multiple injections are required one right after the other, a different injection site should be chosen for each injection, at least 2 cm away from the other injection site.

## Adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg

The 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose (see section Posology) should be administered by a healthcare professional.

For subsequent subcutaneous 300 mg doses, if the healthcare professional determines that it is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

appropriate, patients may self-inject or caregivers may administer the pre-filled syringe after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique.

For a complete 300 mg dose, either two 150 mg pre-filled syringes are required to be injected, one right after the other or one 300 mg pre-filled syringe is required to be injected.

Detailed instructions for use are provided in the respective package leaflet.

## Adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt;40 kg

Spevigo should be administered by a healthcare professional.

For the 300 mg subcutaneous loading dose (see section Posology) either two 150 mg pre-filled syringes are required to be injected, one right after the other or one 300 mg pre-filled syringe is required to be injected.

For a subsequent 150 mg dose, one 150 mg pre-filled syringe is required to be injected.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4).

Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Spesolimab may increase the risk of infections (see section 4.8).

In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, the potential risks and expected clinical benefits of treatment should be considered prior to prescribing spesolimab. Treatment with spesolimab should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important infection occur during or after treatment with spesolimab.

If a patient is on treatment with Spevigo subcutaneous injection for GPP flare prevention, and develops a clinically important active infection, treatment with Spevigo should be stopped. Reinitiation can be considered once the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

## Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis

Prior to initiating treatment with spesolimab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Spesolimab is contraindicated to patients with active TB infection (see section 4.3).

Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating spesolimab treatment in patients with latent TB, a history of TB or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. During and after spesolimab treatment, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with monoclonal antibodies such as spesolimab. Hypersensitivity may include immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis and delayed reactions such as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with spesolimab (see section 4.8).

If a patient develops signs of anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity, spesolimab treatment should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be initiated (see section 4.3).

## Use in patients with an immediate, life-threatening GPP flare

For the treatment of GPP flares, see Spevigo 450 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics.

There is no experience from the use of spesolimab in patients with an immediate, life-threatening flare of GPP or a flare requiring intensive care treatment.

## Concomitant use with other GPP treatments or immunosuppressants

The safety and efficacy of spesolimab in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, have not been evaluated systematically. In the GPP flare prevention clinical study, other GPP treatments had to be stopped before initiation of spesolimab treatment, with a washout period for most other treatments (biologics, other systemic immunomodulating treatments), or a stop at the day of randomisation (the day of starting the spesolimab prevention treatment) (see section 5.1).

Spesolimab is not recommended for use in combination with other GPP treatments. To prevent the risk of GPP flares, tapering of previous treatments should be considered at initiation of spesolimab GPP prevention therapy. If needed, other GPP treatments may be used occasionally during treatment (e.g. in case of worsening or after a flare) at the discretion of the treating physician.

## Immunisations

It is unknown whether spesolimab affects the efficacy of vaccines.

No data are available on the potential secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving spesolimab (see section 4.5). The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of spesolimab therapy should be at least 4 weeks. Live vaccines should not be administered during and for at least 16 weeks after treatment with spesolimab.

Prior to initiating spesolimab for GPP flare prevention, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered according to current immunisation guidelines.

## Peripheral neuropathy

The potential for peripheral neuropathy with spesolimab is unknown. Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in clinical trials with spesolimab. Physicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset peripheral neuropathy.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbates

This medicine contains 0.4 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1 ml pre-filled syringe and 0.8 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 2 ml pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. In GPP patients, spesolimab is not expected to cause cytokine-mediated CYP interactions as a perpetrator.

Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with spesolimab (see section 4.4).

There is limited experience from the concomitant use of spesolimab with immunosuppressants (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited data from the use of spesolimab in pregnant women. Non-clinical studies using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL36R monoclonal antibody do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of spesolimab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are present on excretion of spesolimab in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk occurs during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. Consequently, transfer of IgG antibodies to the newborns through milk, may happen during the first few days. In this short period, a risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, spesolimab can be used during breastfeeding if clinically needed. If treatment was discontinued before the last trimester of pregnancy, breastfeeding can be started immediately after birth.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of spesolimab on human fertility. Studies in mice using a surrogate, mouse specific anti-IL36R monoclonal antibody, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility from antagonism of IL36R (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Spevigo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are infections (33.3%) with serious infections in 3 patients (3.2%) (see Description of selected adverse reactions).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 1 provides a list of the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials as well as in the postmarketing setting. The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency category using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

During the 1-week placebo-controlled period in Effisayil 1, infections were reported in 17.1% of patients treated with spesolimab compared with 5.6% of patients treated with placebo. In Effisayil 1, serious infection (urinary tract infection) was reported in 1 patient (2.9%) in the spesolimab group and no patient in the placebo group. During the placebo-controlled period of up to 48 weeks in Effisayil 2, infections were reported in 33.3% of patients treated with Spevigo and 33.3% of patients treated with placebo. In Effisayil 2, serious infections were reported in 3 patients (3.2%) in the Spevigo group and no patient in the placebo group.

Infections observed in clinical trials with spesolimab were generally mild to moderate with no distinct pattern regarding pathogen or type of infection.

## Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity comprises immediate systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reaction. Immediate systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in open-label extension trials and the post-marketing setting.

## Injection site reactions

Injection site reactions include erythema, swelling, pain, induration, warmth, exfoliation, papule, pruritus, rash, and urticaria at the injection site. Injection site reactions were typically mild to moderate in severity.

## Paediatric population

The available data for adolescents are limited. Eight adolescent patients with GPP, 14 to 17 years of age, were enrolled in trial Effisayil 2 (see section 5.1). Overall, the safety profile in adolescents treated with spesolimab (n=6) was consistent with the safety profile in adults and no new safety concerns have been identified.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The highest dose of spesolimab administered in clinical trials was 1 200 mg intravenously or subcutaneously. Adverse reactions observed in subjects receiving single or repeated doses up to 1 200 mg were consistent with the known safety profile of spesolimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and symptomatic treatment be instituted as appropriate.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC22

## Mechanism of action

Spesolimab is a humanised antagonistic monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody blocking human interleukin 36 receptor (IL36R) signalling. Binding of spesolimab to IL36R prevents the subsequent activation of IL36R by its ligands (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream activation of proinflammatory pathways.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Following treatment with intravenous spesolimab in patients with GPP, reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL6, T helper cell (Th1/Th17) mediated cytokines, keratinocyte-mediated inflammation markers, neutrophilic mediators, and proinflammatory cytokines were observed in serum and skin at week 1 compared to baseline and were associated with a decrease in clinical severity. These reductions in biomarkers became more pronounced at the last measurement at week 8 in Effisayil 1.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Effisayil 2 (1368-0027)

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II b study (Effisayil 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of spesolimab for subcutaneous administration in adult and adolescent patients with a history of GPP, as diagnosed per ERASPEN criteria, regardless of IL36RN mutation status, and with at least two GPP flares of moderate-to-severe intensity in the past. Patients were randomised if they had a GPPGA total score of 0 or 1 at screening and randomisation. Patients were required to discontinue systemic and topical therapy for GPP prior to or at randomisation. These patients must have had a history of flaring while on concomitant treatment for GPP or a history of flaring upon dose reduction or discontinuation of these concomitant medications.

The primary endpoint of the study was the time to the first GPP flare up to week 48 (defined by a GPPGA pustulation subscore of ≥ 2 and an increase in GPPGA total score by ≥ 2 from baseline). The key secondary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of at least one GPP flare up to week 48. Additional secondary endpoints at week 48 were the time to the first worsening of Psoriasis Symptom Scale (PSS) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) defined as a 4-point increase in total score from baseline.

A total of 123 patients were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive one of the four treatments (see Table 2).

Table 2: Treatment arms in Effisayil 2

|            | Loading dose           | Subsequent doses                     |

| spesolimab | 300 mg subcutaneously  | 150 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks |
| Placebo    | subcutaneous treatment | subcutaneous treatment every 4 weeks |

The study population consisted of 38.2% men and 61.8% women. The mean age was 40.4 (range: 14 to 75) years with 8 (6.5%) adolescent patients (2 per treatment arm); 64.2% of patients were Asian and 35.8% were Caucasian. Patients included in the study had a GPPGA pustulation sub score of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 (28.5%) or 0 (71.5%), and patients had a GPPGA total score of 1 (86.2%) or 0 (13.8%). At the time of randomisation, 74.8% of patients were treated with systemic therapy for GPP, which was discontinued at the start of the randomised study treatment.

While 3 dosing regimens were studied in Effisayil 2, the recommended dosing regimen for GPP flare prevention is a subcutaneous loading dose of 600 mg spesolimab followed by 300 mg subcutaneous treatment administered every 4 weeks (see section 4.2). The results summarised below are those for the recommended dosing regimen.

Patients who experienced a flare were eligible to receive up to two open-label, intravenous doses of 900 mg spesolimab (see section 4.2). 2 (6.7%) patients in the spesolimab arm for the recommended dose and 15 (48.4%) patients in the placebo arm received intravenous flare treatment.

Treatment with the recommended spesolimab dose compared to placebo resulted in statistically significant improvement based on the primary and key secondary endpoint (see Table 3).

The efficacy of the subcutaneous recommended spesolimab dose compared with placebo was observed shortly after randomisation and was maintained up to week 48 (see Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1: Time to the first GPP flare up to week 48 (Effisayil 2)

<!-- image -->

For both primary and key secondary endpoint, treatment effect was observed for all patients regardless of the IL36RN mutation status.

One adolescent patient in the placebo arm received investigator-prescribed standard of care to treat GPP worsening and was considered to have a GPP flare. No adolescent patient in the recommended spesolimab dose arm experienced a GPP flare.

The prevention of GPP worsening in terms of PSS, and DLQI was also observed, as shown by the hazard ratios for PSS 0.42 (95% CI 0.20, 0.91) and for DLQI 0.26 (95% CI 0.11, 0.62).

## Immunogenicity

In patients with GPP treated with intravenous spesolimab in Effisayil 1, 46% of patients developed ADAs. A majority of ADA-positive subjects also developed neutralising antibodies. In Effisayil 2, following multiple subcutaneous doses of spesolimab, 41% of the patients developed ADAs. A majority of ADA-positive subjects also developed neutralising antibodies.

Clearance of spesolimab increased along with increasing ADA titers.

As the majority of patients did not experience a subsequent new flare in Effisayil 1, the data on re-treatment of patients with ADA (n = 4) is limited. It is currently unknown if there is a correlation between the presence of ADA to spesolimab and maintenance of efficacy for flare treatment. After subcutaneous administration of spesolimab in Effisayil 2, there was no apparent impact of ADA presence on efficacy or safety.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Spevigo in the paediatric population younger than 12 years of age in the treatment of generalised pustular psoriasis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on data collected from healthy subjects, patients with GPP and patients with other diseases. After a single intravenous dose of 900 mg, the population PK model-estimated AUC0-∞ (95% CI) and Cmax (95% CI) in a typical ADA-negative

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient with GPP were 4 750 (4 510, 4 970) µg·day/mL and 238 (218, 256) µg/mL, respectively. After a 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose of spesolimab followed by 300 mg spesolimab subcutaneously every 4 weeks, the mean (CV%) steady-state trough concentration ranged from 33.4 µg/mL (37.6%) to 42.3 µg/mL (43.0%).

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous single dose administration of spesolimab in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 5.5 to 7.0 days after dosing. After subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, absolute bioavailability was slightly higher at higher doses with estimated values of 58%, 65%, and 72% at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg, respectively. Based on limited data, absolute bioavailability in the thigh was approximately 85% following a subcutaneous dose of 300 mg spesolimab.

Following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 300 mg spesolimab in the abdomen, either as one 300 mg injection or as two 150 mg injections, bioavailability was similar in both treatments.

## Distribution

Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the typical volume of distribution at steady state was 6.4 L.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of spesolimab has not been characterised. As a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody, spesolimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

In the linear dose range (0.3 to 20 mg/kg), based on the population PK model, spesolimab clearance (95% CI) in a typical ADA-negative patient with GPP, weighing 70 kg was 0.184 L/day. The terminal-half-life was 25.5 days.

## Linearity/non-linearity

When administered intravenously, spesolimab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with doseproportional increase in exposure across single dose ranges of 0.3 to 20 mg/kg. Both clearance (CL) and terminal half-life were independent of dose. Following subcutaneous single dose administration, spesolimab exposure increased slightly more than dose-proportionally across the dose range of 150 mg to 600 mg due to slightly increased bioavailability at higher doses.

## Body weight

Spesolimab concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight and higher in subjects with lower body weight. Spesolimab has not been studied in patients with GPP weighing more than 164 kg. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, the recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg is half the recommended dose than for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg (see section 4.2). The exposure in patients weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg receiving the reduced dosing regimen is expected to be comparable with those observed in GPP studies.

## Elderly / gender / race

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, gender and race do not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of spesolimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic and renal impairment

As a monoclonal antibody, spesolimab is not expected to undergo hepatic or renal elimination. No formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of spesolimab was conducted.

Population PK analysis did not identify mild hepatic impairment or mild or moderate renal impairment as having an influence on the systemic exposure of spesolimab.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of spesolimab in paediatric patients below the age of 14 years have not been studied.

The plasma pharmacokinetics of spesolimab observed in adolescents were consistent with that observed in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeated dose toxicity studies.

## Developmental and reproductive toxicity

Non-clinical studies conducted in mice using a surrogate antibody directed towards murine IL36R do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development or fertility.

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with spesolimab.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with spesolimab.

4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Spevigo
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Spevigo is and what it is used for

## What Spevigo is

Spevigo contains the active substance spesolimab. Spesolimab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL36R, which is involved in inflammation.

## What Spevigo is used for

Spevigo is used alone in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age to treat flares of a rare inflammatory skin disease called generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP). During a flare, patients may experience painful skin blisters that develop suddenly over large areas of the skin. These blisters, also called pustules, are filled with pus. The skin may become red, itchy, dry, cracked or scaly. Patients may also experience more general signs and symptoms, such as fever, headache, extreme tiredness, or a burning sensation of the skin.

Spevigo improves skin clearance and reduces symptoms of GPP during a flare.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Spevigo

A doctor experienced in treating patients with inflammatory skin diseases will start and supervise your treatment.

## You must not receive Spevigo if you:

- are allergic to spesolimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see 'Warnings and precautions').

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Spevigo if you:

- currently have an infection or have an infection that keeps coming back. Fever, flu-like symptoms, tiredness or shortness of breath, a cough which will not go away, warm, red and painful skin, or a painful rash with blisters can be signs and symptoms of an infection.
- have, have had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis.
- have recently had a vaccination or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after being given Spevigo.

- experience symptoms like weakness in your arms or legs that was not there before or numbness (loss of sensation), tingling or a burning sensation in any part of your body. These might be signs of peripheral neuropathy (damage of the peripheral nerves).

## Infections

Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any signs or symptoms of an infection after you have been given Spevigo, see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Allergic reactions

Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction while or after you are given this medicine. You can also have allergic reactions some days or weeks after receiving Spevigo. For signs and symptoms see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Children and adolescents

Spevigo is not recommended for children under 12 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Spevigo

Tell your doctor if you are:

- taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including any other medicines to treat GPP.
- going to have or have recently had a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after receiving Spevigo.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine will affect the baby.

It is therefore preferable to avoid the use of Spevigo during pregnancy.

If you are pregnant, you should only receive this medicine if your doctor has clearly recommended it.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether Spevigo passes into breast milk. Spevigo may pass into breast milk in the first days after birth. You should therefore tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, so you and your doctor can decide if you can be given Spevigo.

## Driving and using machines

Spevigo is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## Spevigo contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 3 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 7.5 mL vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## Spevigo contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## 3. How Spevigo will be given

The recommended dose for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg is 900 mg (two vials of 450 mg).

The recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing 30 to less than 40 kg is 450 mg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(one vial of 450 mg).

Your doctor or nurse will give you this medicine by infusion (drip) into a vein. It will be given over a period of 90 minutes, up to a maximum of 180 minutes if the infusion is slowed down or stopped temporarily.

If you still experience flare symptoms your doctor can decide to give you a second dose of Spevigo one week after the first.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

## If you are given more Spevigo than you should

This medicine will be given to you by your doctor or nurse. If you think you have been given too much Spevigo, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

- severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps, that is different from your GPP symptoms
- feeling faint.

You can also have allergic reactions some days or weeks after receiving Spevigo.

Seek medical help immediately if you develop any widespread skin rash that was not there before, fever, and/or facial swelling 2-8 weeks after receiving the medicine. These might be signs of a delayed allergic reaction (hypersensitivity).

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Posology and method of administration

The recommended dose for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg is a single dose of 900 mg (2 vials of 450 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion. If flare symptoms persist, an additional 900 mg dose may be administered 1 week after the initial dose.

The recommended dose for adolescents from 12 years of age weighing ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 kg is a single dose of 450 mg (1 vial of 450 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion. If flare symptoms persist, an additional 450 mg dose may be administered 1 week after the initial dose.

Spevigo must be diluted before use. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.

Following dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, Spevigo is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micron) over 90 minutes. No other infusion should be administered in parallel via the same intravenous access.

In the event that the infusion is slowed or temporarily stopped, the total infusion time (including stop time) should not exceed 180 minutes.

## Handling instructions

- •
- The vial should be visually inspected before use.
- -Spevigo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution.
- -If the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains large or coloured particulates, the vial should be discarded.
- Spesolimab sterile concentrate is for single use only.
- Aseptic technique must be used to prepare the solution for infusion:
- o For the recommended dose of 900 mg, draw and discard 15 mL from a 100 mL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

container of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and replace slowly with 15 mL spesolimab sterile concentrate (two vials of 450 mg/7.5 mL).

- o For the recommended dose of 450 mg, draw and discard 7.5 mL from a 100 mL container of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and replace slowly with 7.5 mL spesolimab sterile concentrate (one vial of 450 mg/7.5 mL).
- o Mix gently before use. The diluted spesolimab infusion solution should be used immediately.
- Spevigo must not be mixed with other medicinal products. A pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of the diluted spesolimab infusion solution. The line must be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection prior to and at the end of infusion. No other infusion should be administered in parallel via the same intravenous access.
- Spevigo is compatible with infusion sets composed of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polybutadiene and polyurethane (PUR), and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES, neutral and positively charged) and positively charged polyamide (PA).

## 1. What Spevigo is and what it is used for

## What Spevigo is

Spevigo contains the active substance spesolimab. Spesolimab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL36R, which is involved in inflammation.

## What Spevigo is used for

Spevigo is used in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age to prevent flares of a rare inflammatory skin disease called generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP). During a flare, patients may experience painful skin blisters that develop suddenly over large areas of the skin. These blisters, also called pustules, are filled with pus. The skin may become red, itchy, dry, cracked or scaly. Patients may also experience more general signs and symptoms, such as fever, headache, extreme tiredness, or a burning sensation of the skin.

Spevigo clears pustules and other skin manifestations and can therefore help to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Spevigo

A doctor experienced in treating patients with inflammatory skin diseases will start and supervise your treatment.

## Do not use Spevigo if you:

- are allergic to spesolimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

- currently have an infection or have an infection that keeps coming back. Fever, flu-like symptoms, tiredness or shortness of breath, a cough which will not go away, warm, red and painful skin, or a painful rash with blisters can be signs and symptoms of an infection.
- have, have had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- have recently had a vaccination or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after being given Spevigo. Your doctor will check if you need any vaccines before you start using Spevigo.
- experience symptoms like weakness in your arms or legs that was not there before or numbness (loss of sensation), tingling or a burning sensation in any part of your body. These might be signs of peripheral neuropathy (damage of the peripheral nerves).

## It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Spevigo.

Every time you get a new pack of Spevigo, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.

## Infections

Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any signs or symptoms of an infection while you are using Spevigo, see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Allergic reactions

Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction while you are using or after you have used this medicine. You can also have allergic reactions some days or weeks after starting the use of Spevigo. For signs and symptoms see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Children and adolescents

Spevigo is not recommended for children under 12 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Spevigo

Tell your doctor if you are:

- taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
- going to have or have recently had a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after receiving Spevigo.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine will affect the baby.

If you are pregnant, you should only receive this medicine if your doctor has clearly recommended it.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether Spevigo passes into breast milk. Spevigo may pass into breast milk in the first days after birth. You should therefore tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, so you and your doctor can decide if you can use Spevigo.

## Driving and using machines

Spevigo is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## Spevigo contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.4 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 1 mL pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## Spevigo contains sodium

## Instructions for use

## Spevigo 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe

This 'Instructions for use' contains information on how to inject Spevigo if the prescribed dose for you or your child requires 2 pre-filled syringes of Spevigo 150 mg .

## Getting to know Spevigo

The pre-filled syringe contains the active substance spesolimab in a solution for subcutaneous injection that helps to deliver a fixed dose of spesolimab.

Before you start using this medicine on your own or your child, first make sure that you get trained by your doctor or nurse. Then read the package leaflet and these instructions for use to make sure you get the correct dose. If you are visually impaired and cannot see well, you must be assisted by a trained caregiver.

If you have further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Spevigo is for single use. Do not reuse the pre-filled syringe.

## This is what Spevigo pre-filled syringe looks like

Spevigo is a pre-filled syringe with a safety cover. The needle is pulled back into the safety cover after injection.

The following picture shows Spevigo before use and after use with the activated safety cover.

<!-- image -->

Your healthcare professional has prescribed a dose of Spevigo for you or your child that requires two injections to deliver a complete dose. You must inject the contents of both pre-filled syringes that come in the carton to deliver the complete dose.

## Important information you need to know before injecting Spevigo

- Do not use the pre-filled syringe until you have been shown the right way to give the injection and have read and understood these handling instructions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Inspect the carton that the product comes in to be sure that you have the correct medicine, the correct number of pre-filled syringes for your or your child's prescribed dose, for any damage, and the expiry date.
- Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject.
- Do not use Spevigo:
- if the liquid is cloudy or contains flakes or large particles.
- if the expiry date (EXP) has passed.
- if the pre-filled syringes have been dropped or look damaged.
- It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Spevigo. Every time you get a new pack of Spevigo, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.
- Inject Spevigo under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in either the upper thighs or stomach area (abdomen). Do not inject Spevigo into any other area of the body.
- If you have any problems with your injection, do not repeat the injection steps with Spevigo pre-filled syringe. Call your doctor for help.
- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | • Take the Spevigo carton out of the refrigerator and remove the pre-filled syringes from the carton. • Gather supplies listed on the left side and place them on a clean, flat work surface in a well-lit area. • If you do not have all the supplies listed, contact your pharmacist. • For disposal, see step 10: 'Disposing of the used pre-filled |

## STEP 3

<!-- image -->

## Preparing for your first injection

<!-- image -->

## STEP 4

<!-- image -->

## STEP 5

<!-- image -->

## Inspecting the pre-filled syringes

## Check both pre-filled syringes now:

- Check to make sure the medicine name and dose on the prefilled syringes match your or your child's prescription.
- Check the expiry date (EXP) on both pre-filled syringes. Do not use if the expiry date has passed.
- Check both pre-filled syringes for damage, cracks, and leakage. Do not use if any part of the pre-filled syringes appears cracked, broken, or is leaking.
- Make sure the medicine in both pre-filled syringes is colourless to slightly yellow. It may contain tiny white or clear particles. Do not use if the medicine is cloudy or has flakes or large particles in it.
- It is normal to see air bubbles, they do not need to be removed.
- Do not use if the Spevigo pre-filled syringes have been dropped.

## Prepare for the first of two injections.

Remember, you will repeat the following steps with the second pre-filled syringe right away after your first injection.

Two injections are needed for a complete dose.

## Choosing the injection site

Choose an injection site.

- You may use an area on your:
- o upper thighs or
- o stomach area (abdomen) , except for an area 5 cm around your navel (belly button).
- Choose a different injection site each time you inject, at least 2 cm away from the last injection site.
- Do not inject into an area near your waistline or belly button.
- Do not inject into areas that are tender, bruised, red, hard, or scarred.
- Do not inject through clothes.

## Cleaning the injection site

- Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe and let air dry.
- Do not touch this area again before injecting.
- Do not fan or blow on the clean area.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## STEP 6

<!-- image -->

## STEP 7

<!-- image -->

## STEP 8

## Removing the cap

- Hold the pre-filled syringe by the finger grip with one hand. With the other hand, pull the cap straight off.
- o Do not pull on or hold the plunger rod.
- o Do not twist the cap. Twisting the cap could damage the needle.
- o Do not use the prefilled syringe if the needle is bent or damaged. If you accidentally bend the needle, do not attempt to straighten it.
- Put the cap aside.
- Use right away after removing the cap.
- o Do not try to recap the needle. Re-capping can lead to needle-stick injury.
- o Do not touch the needle or let the needle touch anything before injecting.

## Pinch the skin

- Gently pinch the area of cleaned skin around your injection site and hold it firmly.
- Keep the skin pinched during the entire injection. You will inject into the pinched skin.
- Do not let go until you have removed the needle from your skin at the end of the injection.

## Before injecting, review steps A, B, and C to learn the correct way to inject

## Important: Do not move the pre-filled syringe when inserting the needle into your skin, while injecting, or when removing the needle from your skin.

<!-- image -->

## A Inserting the needle

<!-- image -->

- B    Injecting the medicine
- Hold the pre-filled syringe by the blue finger grip. Avoid touching the blue thumb pad.
- Using a quick, 'dart-like' motion, insert the needle into the pinched skin at about a 45-degree angle .
- Do not move the needle while inserting or during the injection.

## To inject Spevigo:

- Use your thumb to slowly press down on the blue thumb pad to push the plunger rod down inside the syringe body.
- Continue pressing on the blue thumb pad until the plunger rod has moved all the way down.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

## C    Checking injection is complete

## STEP 9

<!-- image -->

## STEP 10

<!-- image -->

- Slowly remove your thumb from the blue thumb pad, to move the needle out of your skin and up into the safety cover.
- o Check that the thumb pad springs back and that the needle is inside the safety cover.
- o If the needle is not inside the safety cover call your doctor. You may not have received a full dose.
- If there is bleeding, press a cotton ball or gauze on the site for a few seconds.
- Do not rub the injection site.
- Apply a plaster if needed.

## Second injection

- Choose a different injection site.

The new injection site should be at least 2 cm away from last injection site.

- Take the second pre-filled syringe.
- Repeat steps 4 through 8 right away.
- Then continue to step 10.

Important: You must inject the contents of both Spevigo pre-filled syringes to give a complete dose.

## Disposing of the used pre-filled syringes and caps

- Put the used pre-filled syringes and caps in a sharps disposal container right away after use.
- Do not throw away the pre-filled syringes in the household waste.

## 1. What Spevigo is and what it is used for

## What Spevigo is

Spevigo contains the active substance spesolimab. Spesolimab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL36R, which is involved in inflammation.

## What Spevigo is used for

Spevigo is used in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age to prevent flares of a rare inflammatory skin disease called generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP). During a flare, patients may experience painful skin blisters that develop suddenly over large areas of the skin. These blisters, also called pustules, are filled with pus. The skin may become red, itchy, dry, cracked or scaly. Patients may also experience more general signs and symptoms, such as fever, headache, extreme tiredness, or a burning sensation of the skin.

Spevigo clears pustules and other skin manifestations and can therefore help to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Spevigo

A doctor experienced in treating patients with inflammatory skin diseases will start and supervise your treatment.

## Do not use Spevigo if you:

- are allergic to spesolimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- have active tuberculosis or other severe infections (see 'Warnings and precautions').

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before and during the use of Spevigo if you:

- currently have an infection or have an infection that keeps coming back. Fever, flu-like symptoms, tiredness or shortness of breath, a cough which will not go away, warm, red and painful skin, or a painful rash with blisters can be signs and symptoms of an infection.
- have, have had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone with tuberculosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- have recently had a vaccination or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after being given Spevigo. Your doctor will check if you need any vaccines before you start using Spevigo.
- experience symptoms like weakness in your arms or legs that was not there before or numbness (loss of sensation), tingling or a burning sensation in any part of your body. These might be signs of peripheral neuropathy (damage of the peripheral nerves).

## It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Spevigo.

Every time you get a new pack of Spevigo, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after 'Lot') and keep this information in a safe place.

## Infections

Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any signs or symptoms of an infection while you are using Spevigo, see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Allergic reactions

Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction while you are using or after you have used this medicine. You can also have allergic reactions some days or weeks after starting the use of Spevigo. For signs and symptoms see section 4 'Possible side effects'.

## Children and adolescents

Spevigo is not recommended for children under 12 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Spevigo

Tell your doctor if you are:

- taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
- going to have or have recently had a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) for at least 16 weeks after receiving Spevigo.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before and during the use of Spevigo.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine will affect the baby.

It is therefore preferable to avoid the use of Spevigo during pregnancy.

If you are pregnant, you should only receive this medicine if your doctor has clearly recommended it.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether Spevigo passes into breast milk. Spevigo may pass into breast milk in the first days after birth. You should therefore tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, so you and your doctor can decide if you can use Spevigo.

## Driving and using machines

Spevigo is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## Spevigo contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.8 mg of polysorbate 20 in each 2 mL pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## Spevigo contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>
