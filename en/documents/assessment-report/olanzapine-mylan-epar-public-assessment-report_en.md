<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Olanzapine  Mylan  2.5  mg,  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg,  and  20  mg  Film-coated  tablets  is  a  generic medicinal product containing olanzapine as the active substance. The reference product Zyprexa 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 mg coated tablet has been centrally authorised on 27 September 1996.

Olanzapine,  a  thienobenzodiazepine  derivative,  belongs  to  class  of  second  generation  derivative antipsychotic agents, the so-called atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics have greater affinity for  serotonin  5-HT2A  receptors  then  for  dopamine  D2  receptors  and  cause  fewer  extrapyramidal symptoms  (EPS) and improve negative symptoms  in contrast to classical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol).

The  efficacy  and  safety  of  olanzapine  has  been  demonstrated  in  randomised,  placebo-controlled  and comparative trials in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and also as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers  in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A summary of these studies may be found in the EPAR of Zyprexa.

The indication  proposed for Olanzapine Mylan is the same as for the authorized Reference medicinal product Zyprexa.

Before the adoption of the opinion the Applicant decided to change the name of the medicinal product from Olanzapine Merck Generics to Olanzapine Mylan and this was endorsed by the CHMP and the Name Review Group.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Olanzapine Mylan is presented as film-coated tablets containing 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg  of olanzapine as active substance. The other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, maize starch, pregelatinised maize starch, crospovidone and magnesium stearate.

The film consists of polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, talc, lecithin soya and xanthan gum. The filmcoated tablets are marketed in aluminium/aluminium blisters packed in cartons or in polypropylene tablet containers with polyethylene caps.

## Drug Substance

The  drug  substance  is  olanzapine  and  its  chemical  name  is  2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10Hthieno[2,3-b][1,5] benzodiazepine according to the IUPAC nomenclature.

Olanzapine is pale yellow to yellow crystalline powder. Olanzapine shows polymorphism. However, only one form  will be used in this medicinal product. Olanzapine is freely soluble in chloroform and sparingly soluble  in  acetic  acid.  The  above-mentioned  active  substance  does  not  contain  chiral  centres  and therefore, does not exhibit stereoisomerism.

## · Manufacture

Olanzapine  is  synthesised  in  three  reactions  steps.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately described in an active substance master file. Critical parameters have been identified and adequate inprocess  controls  included.  Specifications  for  starting  materials,  reagents,  and  solvents  have  been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented. The purified active substance is finally packed in primary bag of transparent polythene closed with a plastic tag. The primary bag is placed in a secondary opaque polythene bag tied using a plastic tag.

Structure elucidation has been performed by ultraviolet spectroscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR  spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR  spectroscopy  and  mass  spectroscopy.  The  molecular  weight  was determined by elemental analysis.  The polymorphic form was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The active substance specifications include tests for appearance (yellow crystalline powder) solubility, identification (IR/XRD), loss on drying, residue on ignition, heavy metals, Impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC), and particle size.

It  was verified that all specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines.

Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, and specified.  Residual  solvents  were  satisfactorily  controlled  in  the  active  substance  according  to  the relevant ICH requirements. Certificates of analyses for the active substances were provided and all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

## · Stability

The stability results from long-term, intermediate and accelerated studies were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. The following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: description, identification by IR and XRD, loss on drying, chromatographic purity by HPLC and assay on dried basis by HPLC. It is important to underline that the test methods applied are those used for release of the drug substance. It was noticed that no tendencies for increases in impurities were seen during storage. Furthermore stress studies were also performed under UV, water, oxidation, acid, base, thermal and light conditions.

It can be concluded that the proposed re-test period is justified based on the stability results when the active substance is stored in the original packing material.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the drug substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The main aim of the applicant was to develop a medicinal product bioequivalent to the reference product (Zyprexa). Taking into account the rapid dissolution characteristics exhibited by the originator Zyprexa tablets, the objective was to develop generic tablets that had immediate release properties. It was concluded that in order to achieve a rapid and complete dissolution of the medicinal product, the active substance would need to be fine and therefore the particle size of the active substance is suitably controlled. A wet granulation process was considered the most appropriate in order to avoid segregation during manufacturing. Nevertheless, direct compression process was attempted , but the results confirmed that wet granulation was the best option.

Pilot batches of all tablet strengths were manufactured in order to  optimise the formulation via a wet granulation method.

Data presented for the physical characteristics of the generic tablets and the originator Zyprexa tablets show that they are similar in physical appearance. Comparative dissolution profiles in three different media were provided. The results demonstrated that the generic batches used for the bioequivalence studies, generic stability batches and the EU brand leader batches are similar with respect to dissolution rate.

All the excipients used are well known and commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Statements from  the suppliers of lactose and magnesium stearate on the risk of BSE/TSE were provided and found to be acceptable.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The proposed commercial manufacturing process involves standard technology using standard manufacturing processes such as mixing, blending, wet granulation, compressing and coating. Furthermore,  the  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  was demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It was noticed that the manufacturing process has been adequately validated for one pilot scale batch of each strength and the results of the manufacturing validation reports were considered satisfactory.

## · Product Specification

The drug product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, uniformity of weight (BP), average tablet weight, identification, thickness, hardness, disintegration (Ph Eur), dissolution, uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), impurities (HPLC), assay  and microbial limits (Ph Eur).

It  was  verified  that  no  new  impurities  have  been  arising  compared  to  the  active  substance  and  the specifications have been justified

All analytical procedures that were used for testing the drug product were properly described. Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.

The  batch  analysis  data  for  two  pilot  scale  batches  of  each  strength  confirm  that  the  tablets  can  be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of the finished product.

## · Stability of the Product

The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. Two pilot scale batches of each strength have been stored at long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions. It was verified that the  following  parameters  were  controlled:  appearance,  average  tablet  weight,  identification,  thickness, hardness, disintegration, dissolution, chromatographic purity, assay and microbial purity.

One production batch per strength was examined for photostability at ICH conditions and the results obtained justify, that no labelled storage condition concerning exposure to light is required. Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture, control of the active substance and the finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the finished product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. Dissolution results indicate comparability with the reference product (Zyprexa) and this is confirmed by in-vivo bioequivalence results (see the clinical part of the report). At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues. Therefore, it can be concluded that the quality characteristics of the finished product are adequate and should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

This application is being made under Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Olanzapine  Mylan  film-coated  tablet  is  a  generic  medicinal  product,  having  the  same  qualitative  and quantitative  composition  in  active  substance  (olanzapine)  and  the  same  pharmaceutical  form  as  the reference medicinal product Zyprexa. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of  olanzapine  are  well  characterised.  The  excipients  used  in  drug  formulation  are  conventional,  well known  and  broadly  used  in  other  medicinal  products.  Declared  impurities  in  amounts  present  in  the formulation do not require additional safety studies. No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Applicant  addressed  pharmacokinetic  data  in  respect  of  bioequivalence  studies.  Two  single  dose bioequivalence studies, one with the 10 mg film-coated tablets (Study BS590) and one with the 15 mg film-coated tablets (Study BS591) were submitted to support this application.

## GCP aspects

Clinical bioequivalence studies were performed in healthy volunteers. In these studies the compliance to regulatory, ethical and GCP requirements of clinical phases can be recognized.

In accordance to Art 8 (ia) of the amended Directive, Art 9.4(c) and Art 127 (a) of the new Regulation, the Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Exemption

The applicant submitted a marketing authorisation application for 6 different strengths (i.e. 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20mg) of the film-coated tablets, for which only two bioequivalence studies in the strengths 10 mg and 15 mg were provided.

However, the requirements indicated in chapter 5.4 of the Guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 'NfG on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence' were fulfilled. As a result, the extrapolation of  the  results  of  the  10  mg  Olanzapine  Mylan  film-coated  tablet  to  the  2.5,  5,  7.5  tablets  and  the extrapolation of the results of the 15 mg Olanzapine Mylan film-coated to the 20 mg tablet was justified.

## Clinical studies

This application refers to the immediate release tablet olanzapine 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 mg.

To support this application the applicant has submitted the following two bioequivalence studies:

Study BS590 was a randomised, open-label, 2- way crossover, bioequivalence study of Olanzapine 10 mg tablet and Zyprexa (reference) following a 10 mg dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions.

Study BS591 was a randomised, open-label, 2- way crossover, bioequivalence study of Olanzapine 15 mg tablet and Zyprexa (reference) following a 15 mg dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions.

The  objective  of  these  studies  was  to  compare  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  of  olanzapine  from Generics  [UK]  Ltd  (United  Kingdom)  and  Eli  Lilly  Nederland  BV  (The  Netherlands)  Zyprexa, administered as a 1 x 10 and 1 x 15 mg tablet respectively, under fasting conditions.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Methods

## STUDY DESIGN

The  study  number  BS590  was  a  randomised,  open-label,  2-  way  crossover,  bioequivalence  study  of Olanzapine  10  mg  tablet  and  Zyprexa  (reference)  following  a  10  mg  dose  in  healthy  subjects  under fasting conditions. The study took place at a Contract Research Organisation in Quebec, Canada and was carried out over the period 2007-05-14 to 2007-06-11.

In each period subjects were housed at the Clinical Research Facility from at least 10 hours prior to the drug  administration  until  after  72  hour  post  dose  draw,  in  each  period.  The  treatment  phases  were separated by a wash out period of 21 days.

All included susbjects received a single oral dose of 1 x 10 mg tablet in each study period.

During  each  study  period,  blood  samples  were  taken  pre-dose  and  at  different  time-points  up  to  168 hours after  drug  administration.  Plasma  was  harvested from these samples and assayed for olanzapine using a validated HPLC method.

## TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS

Test (A): Olanzapine, 10 mg, Company Responsible for Marketing: Generics [UK] Ltd. Reference (B): Olanzapine (Zyprexa.), 10 mg, Company Responsible for Marketing: UK Eli Lilly Nederland BV, The Netherlands.

## POPULATION(S) STUDIED

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Twenty-two healthy adult subjects (12 males and 10 females) aged between 22 and 53 years (mean 40 ± 10), with a body mass index (BMI) between 20.8 and 29.5 (mean 25.7 ± 3.2) and a weight range of 52.2 to 105.5kg (mean 75 ± 14.1) participated in the study. Twenty subjects were Caucasian and 2 were American Hispanic. All female subjects were taking adequatecontraceptive precautions.

## ANALYTICAL METHODS

The plasma samples were analyzed by LC/MS-MS method for detection of olanzapine. The method has been validated with respect to specificity, sensitivity, between-batch and within-batch accuracy and precision and linearity.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in this study: AUC0-t, AUC0inf, Cmax, Cmax/AUC0-t, T1/2 el , T max, Residual area and Kel.

Pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma olanzapine were calculated as follows:

AUC0-t: The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method.

AUCinf: The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity. AUCinf was calculated  as  the  sum  of  the  AUC 0-t plus  the  ratio  of  the  last  measurable  plasma  concentration  to  the elimination rate constant.

Cmax: Maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified.

tmax: Time of the maximum measured plasma concentration.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

Pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations were summarized by treatment.

The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  test  formulation  over  the  reference  formulation  were calculated for ln-transformed Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-inf) by ANOVA.

Bioequivalence was declared when the 90% CI of the ratio of the means (Test/Reference) for olanzapine AUC and Cmax was within 80-125% range. Furthermore it was examined non-parametric test (Wilcoxon) and 90% non-parametric CI calculated for Tmax; inter- and intra-subject coefficient of variation (ISCV%); and power values calculated for Cmax and AUC0-t.

SAS  (release  8.02)  and  other  software  were  used  to  calculate  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  and perform non-compartmental analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters and statistical analyses.

Adverse  events, vitals signs measurements,  and  standard  laboratory evaluations were  evaluated descriptively only.

## · Results

There were no drop-outs from the study, so that all 22 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.

There  was  no  detectable  pre-dose  concentration  at  any  of  the  study  periods.  ANOVA  for  olanzapine showed no significant effect of period or treatment on all primary parameters.

Secondary  pharmacokinetic  parameters:  For  Tmax  and  t1/2  no  statistically  significant  differences  were found between the two formulations.

## Protocol deviations

Three deviations from study protocol requirements have been registered.

1. Storage of the study medication; the humidity of the facility storage fell beneath the acceptance range (to 25.77%RH) from 13 May 2007 until 15 May 2007.
2. Subject no 15 walked for approximately 2 minutes
3. Subject no 9 the post dose blood sample in period 1 was not filled enough, so it could not be analysed.

Furthermore some blood draw time deviations occurred; these times were adjusted in the data sets to reflect the actual times at which the samples were obtained.

## Adverse events

No serious adverse events occurred during the conduct of the study. Safety data have been evaluated on 22 subjects for the Test formulation and on 22 subjects of the Reference formulation. A total of 99 adverse events occurred 56 reported by 22 subjects who received treatment A and 43 of the 22 subjects who received treatment B. The most commonly reported adverse event was 'Somnolence'. 34 of the 99 adverse events were graded as mild and 65 as moderate.

*ln-transformed values

Plasma concentration-time curves of each subject (linear-linear and log/linear scale) are presented. The  mean  extrapolated  AUC  is  below  20%  for  all  subjects  and  treatments  (Residual  area  mean Reference: 4.09 Test:4.43).

No statistical significant period effect was detected for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax.

The 0.00 sample (pre-dose concentration) of subject no. 17 was analysed three times and in all cases it showed  an  unacceptable  internal  standard  response.  Ultimately,  the  pre-dose  concentration  of  subject no.17  was  not  reportable  (NRV).  Apart  from  this  missing  value  there  was  no  detectable  pre-dose concentration at any of the study periods.

For subject no 8 several values could not be reported. Because these missing values the characterization of the pharmacokinetic parameters may be non robust. Therefore an additional statistical analysis without subject no 8 was performed. If the data of subject no 8 are excluded from the analysis the 90% CI for olanzapine AUC and Cmax still are within the accepted range.

## Protocol deviations

4 subjects withdrew from the study. Two subjects withdrew due to adverse events (vomiting subject 3 and  fainting  intermittent  subject  7.  The  other  two  subjects  (no  5  and  12)  withdrew  due  to  personal reasons.

Seven deviations from the study protocol requirements have been registered; post-study procedures (vital signs) were performed 17 days too late, documentation of exclusion criteria was missing at the beginning of the study but they were answered at the end of the study, consumation of coffee of one subject, only 21  subjects  instead  of  22  received  the  study  medication,  the  question  whether  the  subjects  consumed pomelo products within 7 days prior to the study drug was not asked.

## Adverse events

92 post-dose adverse events were reported by 20 of the 21 subjects received at least one of the study medication.  52  adverse  events  reported  by  18  of  the  20  subjects  who  received  treatment.  A  and  40 adverse events reported by 16 of the 19 subjects who received treatment B. The most commonly reported adverse event was 'Somnolence'. All adverse events were not serious and recover before the end of the study.

## Additional data

## In vitro dissolution profiles

Dissolution comparisons of products used in the BE studies are included in this application and are used to support the exemption for studies in each of the submitted strengths of the product.

Dissolution rates of olanzapine from Olanzapine Mylan tablets and ZYPREXA tablets were determined. Different dissolution media were used, i.e. 0.1 M Hydrochloric acid, Acetate buffer solution pH 4.5 and Phosphate buffer solution pH 6.5.

In all investigated media the dissolution of olanzapine from Olanzapine Mylan tablets in all strengths was fast and complete. The in vitro dissolution of olanzapine of Olanzapine Mylan tablets is faster than the dissolution of Zyprexa.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market. The company should ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities are in line with the current safety measures applied to the reference medicinal product.

##  Risk Management Plan

A  Risk  Management  Plan  was  not  submitted.  Since  the  application  concerns  a  generic  of  reference medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk  minimization  activities  have been identified, a Risk Management Plan was not required.

##  PSUR

The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Olanzapine  Mylan  tablets  should  follow  the  PSURs  submission schedule for the reference product Zyprexa.

## · User consultation

The results of user consultation provided indicates that the Package leaflet is well structured and organized, easy to understand and written in a comprehensible manner. The test shows that the leaflet is readable in patients /users are able to act upon the information that it contains.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

The  efficacy,  safety  and  clinical  pharmacology  of  the  active  ingredient  olanzapine  are  already  wellestablished and documented for the original medicinal product Zyprexa. The submitted bioequivalence studies were designed and reported in accordance with the relevant EU note for guidance. The data of this study sufficiently demonstrate that the tested formulation intended for marketing is bioequivalent to the innovator product. The bioequivalence demonstrated for tablets of the strength 10mg and 15mg may be extrapolated also to strengths 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 20 mg.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Olanzapine  is  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia.  Olanzapine  is  effective  in  maintaining  the clinical  improvement  during  continuation  therapy  in  patients  who  have  shown  an  initial  treatment response.  Olanzapine  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  manic  episode.  In  patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder.

Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Olanzapine Mylan in the above mentioned indication was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
