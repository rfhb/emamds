## Annex I

## Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for somatropin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on risk(s) from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between somatropin and acute pancreatitis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concludes that Section 4.4 of the SmPC of products containing somatropin should be amended to add a warning on pancreatitis.

Additionally, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between somatropin and gynecomastia is established and concludes that section 4.8 of the SmPC of products containing somatropin should be amended, to add the adverse reaction gynecomastia with a frequency uncommon.

The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for somatropin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing somatropin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
