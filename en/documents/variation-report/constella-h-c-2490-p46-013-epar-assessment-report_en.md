## 1. Introduction

On 13 th March, 2019, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric  study for Constella, in accordance with Article  46 of Regulation  (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical  expert overview, dated 26 th February 2019 has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that LIN-MD-62 (A Multicenter,  Randomized, Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group,  Safety and Efficacy Study of a Range of Linaclotide  Doses Administered  Orally  to Children,  Ages 6 to 17 Years, Who Fulfill  Modified Rome III  Criteria for Child/Adolescent  Functional Constipation is a standalone study.

LIN-MD-62 is Measure 3 of the agreed PIP EMEA-000927-PIP01-10-M03. The PIP consists of 9 measures in total, of which 7 concern clinical  measures. The measure 3 is the first step mentioned in the PIP.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The pharmaceutical  formulation used in the study were either capsules for oral administration  which contain 28, 36, 72, or 145 µg linaclotide  or oral solution containing  9 or 36 µg linaclotide  per ml, used in doses of 9, 18, 72, or 145 µg linaclotide  (=doses up to 4 ml).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Marketing authorization for Constella was granted by the EMA on 26 Nov 2012 for the treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults.  The indication  functional  constipation is licensed  in other regions of the world, but not in the EU. The only pharmaceutical  form and strength available  are capsules with a content of 290 µg linaclotide.

The applicant  states that there are no regulatory consequences identified  by the MAH with this study.

There are no new data that change or result in a new benefit/risk  evaluation.  Consequently, no changes were made to the PI.

## Assessor's comment:

The submitted report appears to have limited  importance for the current license of the substance of the product Constella, which is licensed for a different  indication  (IBS-C instead of FC), as well as a higher  dose (290 µg instead of 145 µg, as licensed for FC in other regions of the world).

The PIP EMEA-000927-PIP01-10-M03 did indeed only include  measures and studies to develop the compound in the treatment of FC for children,  but not in IBS.  Consequences with regard to labelling the product currently  licensed  in the EU would therefore be rather guided  by results on the safety, but not by results on efficacy. This AR therefore includes  only the most important features and results of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The conclusion of the applicant  is therefore agreed with from a formal point of view, pending  the evaluation of safety from the submitted study (see below).

The MAH submitted one final  report(s) for:

- LIN-MD-62: A Multicenter,  Randomized, Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, Safety and Efficacy Study of a Range of Linaclotide  Doses Administered  Orally  to Children,  Ages 6 to 17 Years, Who Fulfill  Modified Rome III  Criteria for Child/Adolescent  Functional  Constipation.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study LIN-MD-62

## Clinical study number and title

Study LIN-MD-62 is termed: A Multicenter,  Randomized, Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled, Parallelgroup, Safety and Efficacy Study of a Range of Linaclotide  Doses Administered  Orally to Children,  Ages 6 to 17 Years, Who Fulfill  Modified Rome III  Criteria  for Child/Adolescent  Functional Constipation (FC).

## Description

This was a multicenter,  randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  safety and efficacy dose-ranging  study in pediatric  participants  with chronic constipation.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of treatment with 1 of 3 linaclotide  doses (A, B, or C) or 145 μg (as an explorat ory objective in adolescent participants  12 to 17 years of age using the approved adult dose) compared with placebo in pediatric participants  6 to 17 years of age who fulfill  modified Rome III  criteria  for pediatric  FC.

## Assessor's comment:

No specific comment on objectives, which appear adequate. This is obviously an explorative study, and a treatment duration of 4 weeks in children  with FC can thus be considered adequate.

## Study design

This clinical  study was a multicenter,  randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel-group, safety and efficacy study comparing 1 of 3 linaclotide  doses (A, B, and C) or linaclotide  145 μg (only participants  12 to 17 years of age) with placebo in pediatric  participants  6 to 17 years of age with a diagnosis of FC based on modified Rome III  Child/Adolescent  Criteria (ie, who fulfill  modified Rome III criteria  for pediatric  FC). The study was to include  a total of 6 visits and was approximately 9 to 12 weeks in duration.

The study included  a 2-week screening  period, which tested evavluated the eligibility  criteria,  and tested the ability  of the potential participants  (those in the age 12-17 years) to swallow the capsule formulation. During  the screening period, the participants  and all  caregivers also received information about lifestyle  modifications (increased water and fiber  intake, increased physical  activity, and consistent toileting  habits). A minimum of a 2-week interval  between discussing  the lifestyle modifications during  the Screening  Period and the participant's  entry into the Pretreatment Period was required.  The following pre-treatment period of 1 week mainly consisted of making participants  and cargivers familiar  with the use and handling  of the e-diary (including  clarification  if the patient or the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

caregiver would handle the device). Additionally,  caregivers of participants  6 to 11 years of age were trained on completing the observer-completed global items once weekly on the e-diary. Participants and caregivers were provided instructions regarding  fasting to ensure the participants  had fasted for at least 2 hours before receiving  their first dose of study treatment at the study site during  the Randomization Visit (Visit  3/Day 1).

The double blind  treatment period was of 3 weeks duration and included  3 study visits (one visit at first drug intake, one after two weeks, and one after the end of treatment).

A post-treatment period of at least 1 week duration followed with the fainal  end-of-study visit scheduled  at least 7 days after the week 4 visit.

Randomization was stratified  by age group (6 to 11 or 12 to 17 years of age) with a minimum of 40% of participants  within  each age group. Participants  6 to 11 years of age were randomized to linaclotide doses (A, B, or C) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 allocation.  Participants  12 to 17 years of age were randomized to linaclotide  doses (A, B, or C, or the approved adult dose, 145 μg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 allocation.

Dosages were given as follows:

```
-Participants  6 to 11 years of age (weight 18 to < 35 kg) o Dose A: 9 μg o Dose B: 18 μg o Dose C: 36 μg -Participants  6 to 11 years of age (weight ≥ o Dose A: 18 μg o Dose B: 36 μg o Dose C: 72 μg
```

- -Approved adult dose: 145 μg (for participants  12 to 17 years of age only)

## Study population  /Sample size

Approximately 160 participants  were planned  to be enrolled  with a minimum of 40% of participants  per age group (6 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years). A total of 173 were enrolled and randomized to receive 1 of the 3 linaclotide  doses. All  were included  in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations. The following table shows the distribution  of the patients in the different  dosing groups:

## Treatments

Patients received identically  appearing  bottles containing  18 μg, 26 µg, 72 µg, or 145 µg capsules, and 9µg/ml or 36 µg/ml oral solution or matching placebo capsules or oral solution. For the doses administered:  See above.

Rescue medication was provided with senna or bisacodyl (oral or rectal). The dosing scheme is again shown in the following table:

Table 2: Double-blind  dosing regimen:

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy assessments used to determine the change from baseline  in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate during  the Treatment Period (primary efficacy endpoint) were the occurrences of 'Satisfactory Bowel Movements' (SBMs) based on the assessment of overall BM frequency and rescue medication use as recorded in the e-diary. A SBM was defined as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative,  suppository, or enema use on the calendar day of the BM or the calendar  day before the BM. Participants  reported their BM frequency (the number of BMs during  the corresponding e-diary interval period) and their  use of rescue medication by responding  to corresponding questions in the morning and evening  e-diary. The submitted study report also states that the e-diary was developed and validity  for content validity  in the anticipated  age group.

The following 6 secondary endpoints were evaluated:

1. Abdominal  Pain - Daytime: Participants  rated their abdominal pain  in the evening  eDiary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. Stool Consistency (Pediatric  Bristol Stool Form Scale [p-BSFS]): Stool consistency of each BM was based on the p-BSFS. Participants  used the p-BSFS 7-point ordinal  scale to rate their stool consistency for each BM in the morning and evening  eDiary.
3. Straining  With Bowel Movement: Participants  assessed the degree of straining  for each BM in the morning and evening eDiary .
4. Abdominal  bloating  - Daytime: Participants  recorded their  assessment of abdominal bloating  in the evening eDiary.
5. CSBM/Incomplete Evacuation: A CSBM was an SBM that was associated with a sense of complete evacuation. Participants  recorded their assessment of the sensation of incomplete evacuation for each BM in the morning and evening eDiary .
6. Fecal Incontinence  - Daytime: Participants  recorded their episodes of fecal incontinence  in the evening eDiary  following the implementation  of Protocol Amendment 3.

A number of additional  efficacy assessments were also included,  assessing night-time  abdominal pain, abdominal bloating,  Quality of Life, global assessments (caregiver and patients), and responders.

The study also included  the collection of blood samples at the randomisation visit (3 blood draws at 1-2 hours post-dose, at 3-4 hours post-dose, and at 6-8 hours post-dose) and at the two-week visit (one blood draw 8-24 hours post-dose).

## Assessor's comment:

No further statements on the validation  of the e-diary and the endpoint used (especially  for the smaller children)  are included.  Usually,  it would be expected that validation  data on the methods used to assess the primary endpoint would be fully  submitted. However, due to the limited  relevance with regard to the current EU MA of the trial  submitted, this is considered a minor issue.

Overall,  the primary and secondary endpoints used appear to be adequate for the population envisaged.

## Statistical Methods

For the primary efficacy endpoint,  comparison between each linaclotide  dose (Dose A, B, and C) and placebo was performed using an ANCOVA model with treatment and age group (6 to 11 or 12 to 17 years of age) as factors and baseline  value as a covariate. Least squares means (LSMs) for each treatment group, differences in LSMs between each linaclotide  treatment group (Dose A, B, and C) versus placebo, associated 2-sided 95% CIs) for these differences in LSMs, and the corresponding statistical  test p-values were reported. Treatment-by-age group interaction was investigated  as an exploratory analysis  to assess the homogeneity of treatment effects across age groups. Sensitivity analyses (missing  at random, not missing  at random, imputing  worse response for postbaseline missing  response, and excluding  participants  impacted by e-diary malfunction  issue  to assess robustness of the primary analysis ANCOVA in the presence of missing data were performed

To understand the dose-response relationship,  a test for linear  dose-response trend was explored for the primary efficacy endpoint based on the ordinal  dosing for the placebo and linaclotide  Dose A, B, and C groups using orthogonal polynomial  contrast. Further, dose-response trend (eg, quadratic  trend) was explored if the linear  trend was not clearly indicated.  Cumulative distribution  function plots were provided for primary efficacy endpoint by treatment group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary efficacy endpoint was also summarized descriptively  within  each age group by treatment group. For the summaries of the 6 to 11 years of age group, linaclotide  doses (A, B, and C) and placebo were included.  For the summaries of the 12 to 17 years of age group, linaclotide  doses (A, B, and C), the adult approved dose 145 μg, and placebo were included. The planned  sample size was designed  for the overall analysis  of the placebo and the linaclotide  A, B, and C dose groups, with 35 participants  per treatment group (140 participants  in total for the overall analysis).  With inclusion  of 14 to 19 participants  who were 12 to 17 years of age for the linaclotide approved adult dose (145 μg), the planned  sample size was approximately 160 participants.  Based on the analyses of each previous linaclotide  adult study (ie, including  the 72, 145, and 290 μg doses in MCP-103-201, 145 and 290 μg in LIN-MD-01 and MCP-103-303, and 145 and 290 μg in LIN-MD-04) in CIC with the change from baseline  in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate during  the Treatment Period as the efficacy endpoint, the range of mean treatment differences between pooled linaclotide  doses and placebo was 1.7 to 2.6 (approximately). The standard deviations were between 3.0 and 3.5 in those studies. Assuming the SBM response in the 6- to 17-year-old population was to be similar  to the adult population,  it was assumed that the treatment effect in this study would fall  around the middle  of the range (approximately 2.2) observed in the adult population.  With a standard deviation of 3.2, the planned  sample size of 35 participants  per treatment group in this study would have had 80% power to detect treatment difference  of 2.2 in the primary efficacy endpoint at the 5% level of significance  (2sided). With the observed common standard deviation of 3.2, the minimum  observed treatment difference  to achieve statistical  significance  would be about 1.5 (at 2-sided 5% level of significance with 35 participants  per treatment group). There were 4 populations used for analyses of data from this study as follows: - The screened population included  all  participants  who underwent the Screening  visit  (Visit 1) and received a participant  identification  number. - The randomized population  included  all participants  in the screened population who were randomized to a treatment group in the study. - The safety population included  all  participants  in the randomized population  who took at least 1 dose of doubleblind  study treatment. postbaseline entry on BM characteristic  assessments that determined occurrences of SBMs (ie, BM

- The ITT population consisted of all participants  in the safety population who had at least 1 frequency and rescue medication use).

## Assessor's comment:

The analysis was appropriate to compare the three dose groups to placebo. However, no multiplicity adjustment was used. In any case, this appears irrelevant  since no significant  difference to placebo could be found. Furthermore, and this may be seen as more relevant in a pure dose finding  study, a linear  trend test based on the ordinal dosing was performed, with further  testing of an additional quadratic  term which investigates  a potential deviation from the linear  model. Another dose response model or the suitability  on a linear  model based on the ordinal  dosing was not investigated  or discussed. Although  due to the results of the trend test and that on the quadratic  term a different conclusion does not appear to be likely,  the use of a different  dose-response model (e.g. incorporating the age and weight group and other functional  dose response relationship)  may have been suited for further investigation.  None of the secondary endpoint were investigated  with respect to a linear  dose response, which also does not appear to be relevant due the lack of a significant  trend in the primary endpoint.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

471 participants  were screened at 52 study centres (all in the United States). 97.7% of these entered the pre-treatment period after completion of the scrrening.  Of the participants  who entered the pretreatment period, over 50% discontinued  during  the pre-treatment period. The most frequent reason for discontinuation  during  the pre-treatment period was screen failure  (214 participants  (45.4%)). The following table shows the numbers of patients screened, included  in pre-treatment and reasons for exclusion, according to age range:

The overall recruitment and conduct of the trial was taking place between 3 rd Novfembrer 2015 (first patient screened) and 29 th May 2018 (last patietn completed).

As already displayed  above, 173 participants  were finally  included,  of which 93.6% completed thet traetment period. The most frequent reason for discontinuation  durign  the treatment period was withdrawal of consent (2.3%). 3 participants  discontinued  due to AEs. The overview on subject dispostions is shown in the following  table:

## Baseline  data

Across the placebo and linaclotide  Dose A, B, and C treatment groups in the safety population, the mean age was 11.0 years. Overall  (not including  linaclotide  dose 145 μg), 54.1% of participants  were female and 45.9% of participants  were male, and the majority were white (76.4%) and not Hispanic  or Latino (77.1%). Mean body weight was 50.32 kg and mean BMI was 22.40 kg/m2.

In the 6 to 11 years of age group, mean weight was 37.01 kg and mean BMI was 20.03 kg/m2, with 57.8% of participants  weighing  between 18 to &lt; 35 kg and 42.2% of participants  weighing ≥ 35 kg at the Randomization visit  (Visit 3). In the 12 to 17 years of age group, mean weight was 68.97 kg and mean BMI was 25.81 kg/m2 (Table 10-7). In both age subgroups, the other baseline  characteristics (sex, race, and ethnicity)  were similar  to that observed for the overall safety population.

The baseline  demographics in the different  dose groups (with the exception o fthe 145 µg dose group) are displayed  in the following table:

The 16 patients included  into the 145 µg dose group had a mean age of 14.7 years, of which 6 were aged 12-13, and 10 aged 15-17. Both genders were represented by 50% of the participants,  and the majority of the patients were white (68.8%), and 'not Hispanic  or latino' (75%). The mean weight was 72.2 kg, and the mean BMI 26.8 Kg/m2. No relevant difference  could be detected in comparison to the other dose groups when restricting  these to those aged 12-17 (data not shown separately).

Across all  of the treatment groups, mean study treatment compliance was ≥ 96.46% during  the4-week Treatment Period. Results were similar  across the treatment groups in the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 years of age groups within  the safety population.

Across all  of the treatment groups, mean compliance with completing the e-diary was ≥ 83.91% during the pre-treatment period, ≥ 72.62% in the Treatment Period, and ≥ 65.50% during  the post-treatment Period. There was an issue with the e-diary malfunction  at a certain time-point during  the trial: A total of 14 randomized participants  who had eligibility  reports were impacted by this issue. Participants  who were impacted by the e-diary malfunction  issues and were not able to complete the evening  eDiary during  the affected period were considered noncompliant for the days that were impacted.

A second issue with the e-diary malfunction  was due to incorrect programming by e-diary vendor. wherein weekly participant-completed  questions were not available  for 51 participants  in the 6 to 11 years of age group if the sites selected the interviewer  administered  format mode of e-diary administration.  In addition,  interviewer-completed  weekly questions were made available  to 5 participants  in the 12 to 17 years of age group, which was inconsistent with the protocol.

## Efficacy results

For the primary and key secondary endpoints, none of the 3 linaclotide  doses  indicated  clear improvement over placebo (p-value ≥ 0.1502) based on the ITT population.  However, a numerical trend toward efficacy at the higher  doses was observed for the primary endpoint of change from

In the linaclotide  145 µg group (which only included  participants  12 to 17 years of age), change from baseline  in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate was 2.623 SBMs/week (SD = 4.108) compared to 1.788 SBMs/week (SD = 2.891) for participants  12 to 17 years of age in the placebo group.

The treatment effects in the difernt  age groups was not relevantly  different  based on exploratory analysis of treatment-by-age group interaction.

Similar  results for the change from baseline  in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate were observed in 4 sensitivity  analyses using different  methods of missing  data imputation (missing  at random, not missing  at random, imputing  based on worst response, and excluding  participants  impacted by e-diary malfunction  issue). Similar  results for the change from baseline  in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate were also observed in an analysis using  an alternative SBM definition  (defined  as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use in the current and previous 4 scheduled  e-diary intervals)  based on the ITT population.

The results of further secondary endpoints are shown in the following table:

The evaluation of the number of patients with such a response in 3 of the 4 weeks of treatment resulted in responder rates of 36.6% for placebo, and 30.6%, 43.9%, and 38.5% for the dose groups A,B, and C.

Overall,  the proportion of participants  in the ITT population who reported using per-protocol rescue medicines or any other laxative, suppositories, or enemas during  the 4-week treatment period was numerically  lower in each linaclotide  dose groups (A, B, and C) than in the placebo group.

Further analyses are not included  in this AR, due to missing  relevance.

## Assessor's comment:

No evaluation has done within the EU of the efficacy of linaclotide  in the adult population for the treatment of FC. However, from the data known in the literature  (e.g. Lembo et al NEJM 2011; reporting results of two studies), where a clear difference  was shown in relatively  'hard endpoints' (response based on 'at least 3 CSBMs per week with an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline  for 9 of the 12 weeks treatment', which showed rates of 21% and 16% for the 145 µg dose, and 19.4% and 21.3% for the 290 µg dose; while  placebo response rates were 3.3% and 6.0%), the results reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

here for the paediatric  population appear disappointing.  In consequence, it would appear reasonable to analyse the reasons for the failure  of this study to show relevant effects. However, the applicant  has not included  any reasoning,  neither in the study report, nor in the clinical  overview. Questions to be answered could be, whether the trial  setting, with potentially  insufficient  inclusion  criteria,  could have favoured the inclusion  of a less severely diseased population, favouring  a lower response in active treatment, and a higher  response in placebo-treated patients.  Also, the effectiveness of the instructions  for life-style  modifications could play a role here. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the doses could be debated: A adult person with a weight of 75 kg receives approx. 1.9 µg/kg b.w. when given the adult dose for the treatment of FC. The dose groups in this study received in dose group A of 9 or 18 µg depending  on weight and age, which results in a b.w.-related  dose of 0.36 µg/kg (assuming a mean weight of 25 kg in the younger age group with a weight below 35 kg, and a weight of 50 kg in the young age group with a weight of &gt;35 kg, and adolescents). This would mean a dose of 0.72 µg/kg in group B, and 1.44 µg/kg in group C, which is below the 'usual' adult dose. Therefore, the cautious dosing could also play a role for these results, although the overall results in those receiving  the adult dose did  also not clearly show efficacy. However, the analysis of the causes for the failure  of the study to show effects (including  the explorative application  of another dose-response model) could help to modify the further paediatric  studies to be conducted.

The statistical  evaluation of the dose-response was not discussed in the main body of final  study report, but displayed  in tables in the appendix showing that a significant  dose-response could not be seen, when applying  a linear  trend test. Also, a test on an additional  quadratic  term investigating  a deviation from the linear  model was not significant.  Other dose response models were not discussed or applied.  Hence, using  the pre-specified  methods no significant  dose response could be shown.

However, study LIN-MD-63 for FC in the paediatric  population  aged 6-17 is already ongoing at the time of submission of study LIN-MD-62 using similar  doses as LIN-MD-62.

For the currently  EU license,  however, the results of the efficacy analysis do not have any consequences.

## PK analysis:

Similar  to adult data, due to limited  absorption, the plasma concentrations of linaclotide  and its active metabolite MM-419447 were below the limit  of quantitation  in most of the pediatric  participants enrolled  in this studyThus, no PK parameters were calculated.  However, 4 participants  in the 6 to 11 years of age group had quantifiable  plasma concentrations of linaclotide  and/or its active metabolite (1 each in dose groups A and B, and 2 in dose group C). The concentrations determined were between 0.107 ng/ml and 1.26 ng/ml, with the exception of a value of 300 ng/ml in one patient in dose group A. This is considered 'theoretically  impossible' by the applicant  (even if the dose would have given intravenously,  the calculated  plasma concentration would be 4.79 ng/ml), and a suspicion  on contamination of the plasma sample was brought forward by the applicant.

## Assessor's comment:

These results are in line  with the results from adult PK studies, although the number of samples with measurable concentration appears somewhat higher  than in adult PK studies, where usually  for none of the participants  any measurable concentration was detected. The exceptionally high  value of 300 ng/ml remains somewhat obscure, because, although the study report ascribes this to potential contamination, the analytical  report rather considers this to be highly  unlikely.  Of note, is the fact that the LLoQ has been set to 0.1 ng/ml, and this has previously  (in the adult PK programme been at 0.2 ng/ml. There were - in addition - a couple of issues reported in the validation  report, which should

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

give rise to caution when looking at the PK results. However, the overall conclusion that linaclotide  is minimally  or not at all absorbed in children  and adolescents aged 6-17 is clearly  supported.

## Exposure:

There were 21 patients receiving  the 9/18 µg dose in the two weight groups (10 between 18 and 35 kg, and 11 above 35 kg), and 26 receiving  18/36 µg with 13 and 13 in the two weight groups, ans finally  20 patients receiving  36/72 µg with 12 and 8 in the higher  and lower weight groups. There were 16 patients receiving  the 145 µg dose. All  patients 6-11 years of age received the oral liquid formulation, and 90% of the older age group received the capsule formulation.

The final  treatment durations are shown in the following table:

There were no AEs of special  interest (ie, significant  volume depletion  and/or significant  electrolyte abnormalities  and/or ECG abnormalities  that were considered by the investigator orsponsor to be related to diarrhea)  or deaths reported.

The majority of treatment-emergent AEs reported were considered mild  or moderate in severity. One participant  in the placebo group and one participant  in the linaclotide  Dose A group experienced severe TEAEs during  the study.

Severe TEAEs of tooth impacted, toothache, post-procedural swelling,  ALT increased,  and AST increased were reported in the placebo participant.  Severe TEAE of suicidal  ideation was reported in the linaclotide  Dose A group participant.  None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

The majority of the TEAEs of diarrhea  among participants  6 to 17 years of age, across all doses, were mild,  and none were severe

## Serious events and deaths:

There were not deaths in the study.

Overall,  a total of 2 participants  (both in the 12 to 17 years of age group) experienced SAEs, neither  of which were considered related to study drug (suicidal  ideation  in the linaclotide  Dose A group and vomiting in the linaclotide  145 µg group).

Laboratory values and vital  signs:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no unexpected changes of clinical  relevance in the study. The most frequent potentially clinically  (PCS) significant  values were observed for albumin  (&gt; 1.1 × ULN) and BUN (&gt; 1.2 × ULN), neither  of which was associated with concomitant reports of diarrhea.  The overall evaluation of PCS cases in laboratory values are shown in the following table:

## Assessor's comment:

The overall conclusions on safety are of course hampered by the fact that the numbers in the different dose groups are small, and the treatment duration was limited.  However, as an overall conclusions, it appears that the adverse effects to be deduced from the study are clearly related to the pharmacodynamics activity of the compound, with diarrhea  being  the only events occurring  in clearly higher  rates, and in dose dependent manner in the active treatment groups. The further analysis  could not reveal any clinically  relevant consequences of the diarrhea  events (e.g. related to electrolyte, blood pressure, occurrence of syncope, etc.).

It is concluded that the known safety profile  of the compound in adults is confirmed in children  and adolescents aged 6-17 years. There appears to be no obvious increased risk of adverse effects in the paediatric  population  down to the age of 6 as compared to an adult population.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The applicant  has presented the first study which was part of the agreed PIP, in this Article  46 procedure. Whereas all  studies agreed in the PIP will  be conducted in the indication  functional constipation, the product is currently  licensed  in the indication  IBS only. The results of any of these studies will  therefore be of limited  relevance for the product licensed  in the EU.

The study LIN-MD-62 was an explorative PK- dose-finding,  and safety study in patients aged 6-17 in patients with functional  constipation. Whereas - as an overall result - the known properties of the substance with regard to PK and safety can be considered to have been confirmed with this study, the results with regard to efficacy do not show clinically  relevant differences  in comparison to the placebo treatment in any of the dose levels studied.

However, due to the different  patient population,  the different  indication,  and the potential  use of relatively  low doses in the trial,  the results with regard to efficacy are not considered to have any repercussion on the existing  license  for adults with IBS-C.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The applicant  has submitted the results of study LIN-MD-62 being  the first of a series of studies to be conducted in the paediatric  population.  However, this study was conducted in patients suffering  from functional  constipation, an indication  for which the compound is currently  not licensed  in the EU. While

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the results with regard to efficacy are therefore not relevant, the results with regard to safety do confirm the known safety profile  of linaclotide,  with the majority of effects restricted to the gastrointestinal  effect and the 'laxative' effects induced.

Therefore, the proposal of the applicant,  that no changes to the PI should be implemented,  and that the trial has no impact on the overall conclusion on benefit risk, is supported.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
