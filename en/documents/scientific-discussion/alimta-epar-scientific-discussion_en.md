## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Alimta. For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## Introduction

## Malignant pleural mesothelioma

Malignant mesothelioma is a rare tumour affecting mesodermal tissue and whose origin has generally been  linked  to  asbestos  exposure.  The  incidence  of  malignant  pleural  mesothelioma  has  increased steadily  since  the  1950s  and  coincides  with  both  the  widespread  industrial  use  of  asbestos  in developed countries and with a highly increased incidence of pleural mesothelioma in men, in Canada [1], the United Kingdom [2], and the United States [3]. Before this time, the incidence was similar in men  and  women  [2].  In  addition,  asbestos  exposure  occurs  environmentally  in  certain  regions  of Turkey, where it is used extensively in building materials [4]. In Turkey, the disease tends to be more equally distributed by gender.

Pleural mesothelioma usually becomes clinically evident by symptoms such as dyspnoea or chest pain from the pleura, chest wall, or mediastinum .  At  the  time  such  symptoms occur, the disease is often locally  advanced.  The  most  common  sites  of  origin  are  the  pleura,  accounting  for  80%  of  cases, followed by peritoneum , pericardium , and tunica vaginalis testis [5]. Survival of untreated patients is poor, with a median survival time ranging from 6 to 8 months, though the range may be much wider, depending  on  the  characteristics  and  selection  of  the  population  of  mesothelioma  patients  [6].  A number  of  factors,  including  histological  subtype  (epithelial  origin  as  a  good  prognostic  factor), performance status, disease extent at baseline, presence of chest pain, gender, and white blood cell count (WBC), among others, have been suggested as predictors of outcome [7, 8].

Neither surgery nor radiotherapy generally results in increased survival [6]. At the time of submission of  the  marketing  authorization  application  for  Alimta,  no  approved  systemic  therapy  existed  for malignant pleural mesothelioma. In single agent Phase 2 studies response rates seldom exceed 20% [918]. Single-arm Phase 2 studies of different combination regimens have demonstrated large variations in response rates [19]. Randomized studies have shown that systemic combination therapy results in somewhat  higher  response  rates  than  single  agent  therapy.  No  significant  differences  in  survival, however, have been observed [20, 21].

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and continues to rise in incidence. One million new cases and over 900,000 lung cancer-related deaths are reported each year worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the third leading cause in women [22]. Almost 80% of lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with 65% to 75% of cases presenting as locally advanced (stage III) or metastatic disease (stage IV) [23-25].

Inoperable  patients  diagnosed  with  stage  III  NSCLC  generally  receive  chemotherapy  as  part  of standard multimodality treatment. stage IIIb and IV patients typically receive chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy. The consensus of chemotherapy in these patients is a platinum-containing regimen. However,  the  median  survival  in  first-line  therapy  is  approximately  7.9  months,  with  a  12-month median survival proportion of 33% [26].

Approximately half of the patients treated with a first-line combination regimen will receive singleagent  chemotherapy  as  second-line  treatment.  Several  chemotherapeutic  agents  were  evaluated  in phase 2 trials in the second-line setting. Tumour response rates vary from study-to-study.  New agents, such  as  gemcitabine,  showed  tumour  response  rates  ranging  from  0  to  21%  [27],  while  paclitaxel showed a tumour response rate ranging from 0 to 25% depending on various doses, schedules, and patient characteristics [21, 28].  Docetaxel has the largest Phase 2 and Phase 3 experience as a singleagent in second-line NSCLC. In different Phase 2 trials, single-agent docetaxel was given as secondline  treatment  to  215  patients,  and  tumour  response  rate  ranged  from  10%  to  25%  with  a  median survival time from 7.0 to 9.7 months [27].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two randomized Phase 3 studies of docetaxel were completed.  The first trial compared docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 or 75 mg/m 2 with best supportive care (BSC) [29]. Five deaths in the first 49 enrolled patients in the 100 mg/m 2 arm led to discontinuation of this treatment arm.  In the 75 mg/m 2 arm docetaxel arm, 7% of the patients had a partial response, with a median survival time of 7.5 months compared with a median survival time of 4.6 months for the patients in the BSC arm (log rank, P =0.010).  The second trial  compared  docetaxel  with  vinorelbine  or  ifosfamide  [30].    A  total  of  373  patients  were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 or 75 mg/m 2 compared with a control regimen of vinorelbine or ifosfamide.  The overall response rate was 10.8% with 100 mg/m 2 docetaxel and 6.7% with  75 mg/m 2 docetaxel.  These  response  rates  were  each  significantly  higher  than  treatment  with vinorelbine  or  ifosfamide  (0.8%).  The  1-year  survival  rate  in  the  docetaxel  arm  was  significantly better at 32% compared with 19% in the ifosfamide/vinorelbine arm.  However, overall survival time was not significantly different among the groups.

## About the product

Pemetrexed disodium (pemetrexed, also referred to during the development as LY231514, multitargeted  antifolate,  MTA,  or  Alimta),  is  a  novel  pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based  folic  acid analogue (temporary ATC code: L01BA04). In in vitro studies, pemetrexed inhibited multiple folatedependent  enzymes  (thymidylate  synthase,  dihydrofolate  reductase,  and  glycinamide  ribonucleotide formyltransferase)  crucial  in  the  de  novo  biosynthesis  of  thymidine  and  purine  nucleotides.  Once transported  into  cells,  pemetrexed  is  rapidly  polyglutamated  by  folylpolyglutamate  synthetase,  a process that appears to occur more readily in tumour cells than in normal cells. Polyglutamate forms of pemetrexed are retained longer in cells and are more potent inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase than the base compound.

## 1. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Alimta is presented as a sterile single use powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. Each vial contains 500 mg of pemetrexed as pemetrexed disodium. It must be reconstituted with 20 ml sodium chloride  9 mg/ml  (0.9 %)  solution  for  injection  without  preservative.  The  appropriate  volume  of required dose is removed from the vial and further diluted to 100 ml with the same diluent.

The  other  ingredients  include  mannitol,  hydrochloric  acid,  sodium  hydroxide,  and  nitrogen,  lowoxygen.

Alimta is packed in type I clear glass vial closed with a rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with flip-cap.

## Active substance

Pemetrexed, N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl) ethyl]benzoyl]L-glutamic acid disodium salt, is a white to almost white freely water soluble solid. It contains a single chiral centre, and is synthesised as the single L-isomer.

Two crystalline hydrate forms of pemetrexed have been identified.

Stress stability studies have shown that the two main degradation pathways for pemetrexed in solid state and in solution are oxidation and hydrolysis.

## · Manufacture

Pemetrexed  is  synthesised  from  commercially  available  starting  materials.  The  starting  material introducing the active substance chiral centre is controlled for chirality and adequate conditions for the subsequent steps have been set up in order to avoid racemization. Satisfactory in process controls and controls  on  key  intermediates  have  been  established  in  order  to  ensure  production  of  an  active substance of consistent quality.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The  active  substance  specification  include  tests  for  appearance,  identity,  assay,  impurities,  chiral purity,  residual  solvents,  heavy  metals,  bacterial  endotoxins  (PhEur),  total  aerobic  microbial  count (PhEur),  mold-yeast  count  (PhEur),  water  content,  pH,  colour  of  solution  (PhEur)  and  clarity  of solution (PhEur).

The hydrate form is controlled by water control determination. The formation of the desired isomer of pemetrexed is ensured through chirality control of the key starting material and through the route of synthesis. Moreover, there is a specific limit for the D-isomer.

The specification limits have been adequately justified based on the physico chemical properties of the drug substance and based on batch analysis and stability data of pemetrexed lots used in non-clinical and clinical studies. The analytical methods used in routine controls have been suitably described and validated.

Batch analysis data provided for 5 full-scale batches confirm satisfactory compliance and uniformity with the proposed specifications.

## · Stability

Stability  data  have  been  provided  for  3  full-scale  primary  stability  batches  synthesised  at  the commercial sites. Under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH - commercial packaging) and longterm  conditions  (25°C/60%%  RH    -  commercial  packaging),  respectively  6-month  and  3-year  data have been provided. The photostability study performed did not show any significant change in the main stability indicating parameters.

A retest  period  of  36  months  is  supported  by  the  presented  data  when  pemetrexed  is  stored  in  the commercial packaging

## Product development and finished product

A dry powder formulation has been chosen. The pH of the in-process solution was selected based on solubility and stability data. Pemetrexed water solubility is greater than 90 mg/ml at 20°C in pH range of 6.0-10.0.

All the excipients selected are of PhEur quality. Mannitol is present in the formulation as a bulking agent to produce an elegant lyophilisate. Compatibility and acceptability for its use in the drug product has been satisfactorily demonstrated. The pemetrexed filling overage included to compensate vial and syringe retentions is suitable to allow withdrawal and delivery of the labeled dose. Regarding the TSE risk, Alimta does not contain any component of ruminant origin.

The  type  I  glass  vials  and  the  rubber  stopper  used  as  primary  packaging  material,  as  well  as  the dimethicone  used  to  treat  the  stoppers,  meet  the  PhEur  requirements.  Before  reconstitution,  no incompatibility  between  the  stopper  and  the  finished  product  has  been  reported  during  stability studies.  After  reconstitution,  compatibility  of  the  stopper  with  the  finished  product  has  been satisfactorily addressed from primary stability studies (vials stored in upright and inverted positions). In addition, development studies have evaluated potential extractable from the stopper.

Compatibility of pemetrexed with common i.v. solutions, i.v. bags and administration sets has been evaluated. The drug product is compatible with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection without  preservative,  but  it  is  incompatible  with  diluents  containing  calcium  including  Ringer's Injection  or  Lactated  Ringer's  Injection.  The  drug  product  reconstituted  and  further  diluted  with sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml  (0.9 %)  solution  for  injection  without  preservative  is  compatible  with polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags.

The rationale for a sterile filtration followed by an aseptic process has been satisfactorily discussed; the product is sensitive to terminal sterilisation methods.

The manufacturing process was developed to minimize oxidative degradation by reducing exposure of pemetrexed solution to oxygen and upon completion of lyophilization cycle the vacuum is neutralized with sterile filtered nitrogen thus controlling the oxygen level in the drug product vial headspace.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Different variants of a terminally sterilised solution formulation and of the dry powder formulation have been used in clinical trials.  They can be all considered as bioequivalent.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process involves the following operations: preparation of the bulk solution, sterile filtration, aseptic filling in vials, lyophilization, stoppering and sealing.

Satisfactory in-process controls and holding times/conditions for specific phases of the process have been defined in order to ensure control of the microbiological, chemical and physical attributes of the product.

Process validation data have been provided for three full-scale consecutive batches manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site.

## · Product Specification

The  product  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identity, assay,  impurity  content,  uniformity  of  mass  (PhEur),  particulate  matter  (PhEur),  pH  (PhEur),  water content, reconstitution time, colour of solution (PhEur), clarity of solution  (PhEur), oxygen headspace content, sterility (PhEur) and bacterial endotoxins (PhEur).

Batch analysis data provided for one full-scale batch and four half-scale batches manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site comply with the specifications and indicate consistent and reproducible manufacture.

## Stability of the product

Stability  of  the  Product  before  reconstitution:  Stability  data  under  long-term  (25°C/60%RH  packaging  intended  for  commercialisation)  and  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC/75%RH  -  packaging intended for commercialisation) have been provided for three primary stability batches manufactured at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site.  Supporting  stability  studies  have  been  provided  for  seven batches under long term and under accelerated conditions. Samples have also been stored under stress conditions (excessive heat and humidity, temperature cycling). Photostability studies have shown that the  drug  product  is  non-light  sensitive.  The  results  presented  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and storage conditions defined in the SPC.

Stability of the reconstituted solution and of the diluted infusion solution: Reconstituted pemetrexed solutions and diluted infusion solutions have been examined for chemical, physical, and microbiological  stability,  including  photostability  and  in-use  compatibility.  The  results  presented support the proposed reconstitution recommendation and storage conditions defined in the SPC.

## · Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The drug substance is well characterised and documented. The drug substance synthesis process as well as the pharmaceutical development has been designed in order to minimize oxidation degradation to which pemetrexed is susceptible. The pharmaceutical form selected is adequate taking into account the  properties  and  stability  of  pemetrexed.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in  this  kind  of formulation  and  the  packaging  is  well  documented.  The  manufacturing  process  was  developed  and optimized to obtain reproducible finished product batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions support the proposed shelf life, storage conditions defined in the SPC. At the time of the CHMP opinion there were  some  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  which  had  no  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  profile.  The applicant  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as  follow-up  measures  within  an  agreed timeframe, and to submit variations if required following the evaluation of this additional information.

## 2. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Introduction

The  pivotal  toxicology  and  toxicokinetic  studies,  as  well  as  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Other pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies do not fall under these regulations. Applicable International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and EMEA guidance documents were referred to during the development of the compound.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro/in vivo)

The activity of pemetrexed against a broad range of human tumours was evaluated in two separate colony-forming  assays.  In  the  first,  dose-dependent  responses  were  observed,  including  in  tumour types  generally  considered  to  be  chemoresistant.  The  activity  of  pemetrexed  was  similar  to  that  of other agents evaluated concurrently (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and paclitaxel) and was not completely cross-resistant with that of the other agents tested [31]. The applicant presented the results of a second test using a panel of 71 specimens of slightly different tumour spectrum from the first test. At 10 µ g/ml, responding tumour types included colon cancer at 21% (3/14), NSCLC at 57% (8/14), breast  cancer  at  47%  (7/15),  and  ovarian  cancer  at  18%  (3/17).  Cisplatin  and  paclitaxel-resistant mesothelioma and NSCLC were sensitive to pemetrexed.

The activity of pemetrexed against a diverse group of tumour cell lines was tested in 72-hour growth inhibition studies using media that typically contained 1 to 3 µ M of folic acid. The IC50 values were found to range from 4 to 220 nM [32-38]. Similar results were reported using a panel of unselected colorectal carcinoma cell lines [39].

According to a study conducted by the applicant, tumour growth inhibition was demonstrated against breast,  pancreas,  lung,  and  colon  tumour  xenografts  in  mice  following  10  daily  treatments  by pemetrexed  at  300  mg/kg,  the  MTD  for  this  dosing  schedule  in  these  animals.  Intraperitoneal treatment  of  a  colorectal  carcinoma  xenograft  in  CD1  nude  mice  resulted  in  &gt;70%  tumour  growth inhibition  measured  5  days  after  the  end  of  treatment  and  about  17  days  tumour  growth  delay, compared to vehicle-treated control mice [34].

Against  established  tumours,  the  activity  of  pemetrexed  was  minimal  at  doses  below  200 mg/kg, especially  when  given  less  frequently  than  ten  daily  injections.  No  antitumour  effect  was  observed when  three daily  intraperitoneal  injections  of  pemetrexed  at  100 mg/kg  were  administered  to  mice bearing  HT-29  colorectal  carcinoma  xenograft  of  about  300 mg  size  [40].  In  contrast,  antitumor activity could be demonstrated when mice were only given two biweekly intraperitoneal injections of pemetrexed at 500 mg/kg when tumours became palpable (~19 mm 3 )[41].

The high circulatory levels of folate and thymidine in murine plasma, which are about 10 and 5 times, respectively, greater than those found in human plasma, can adversely affect the activity of antifolate compounds [34, 35, 42]. Mice fed a low folate diet were also much more sensitive to the toxic effects of pemetrexed, with the MTD being 60- to 250-fold (depending on mouse strain) less than that in mice maintained on a normal (high-folate) diet [35, 42]. In mice on a low-folate diet, the authors found that dietary  folic  acid  protected  mice  from  toxicity  without  negative  influence  on  the  efficacy  of pemetrexed [35].

## Pharmacodynamic mechanisms

Pemetrexed is a structural analogue of folic acid and uses the same biochemical machinery as natural folates  for  membrane  transport  and  intracellular  polyglutamation.  Similar  to  the  natural  folates, polyglutamated forms of pemetrexed are better retained in the cell and have higher affinity than parent compound  for  certain folate-dependent enzymes.  Inhibition of several of these  enzymes  by pemetrexed and its polyglutamates causes depletion of nucleotide pools that is associated with growth inhibition and possibly cell death.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uptake

The uptake of natural folates into the cell is known to involve several protein carriers, including the reduced folate carrier (RFC), membrane folate binding protein (FBP, also known as folate receptor). RFC is believed to be the major route by which folates and many antifolates gained entry into the cell [32].  Pemetrexed  interacted  equally  well  with  RFC  and  FBP  compared  to  their  respective  cognate folates.  However,  because  of  better  transport  efficiency,  RFC  is  likely  to  be  the  main  carrier  for pemetrexed, as in the case for natural folates. [32]. Studies on the uptake of pemetrexed in NCI-H28 mesothelioma line  inferred  the  existence  of  an  additional  novel  transport  system  that  was  different from  both  RFC  and  FBP.  The  prevalence  and  significance  of  this  transport  system  are  being investigated  [43].  The  relative  importance  of  ATP-dependent  transporters  and  RFC  in  affecting pemetrexed sensitivity is also being investigated [44].

## · Polyglutamation

RFC is a bidirectional carrier with substrate specificity mainly for the parent compounds of folates and antifolates  that  contain  a  single  glutamyl  residue.  Thus,  folates  and  certain  antifolates  that  can  be polyglutamated by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) are trapped inside the cell. The rate constant (Vm/Km) for pemetrexed in the FPGS catalyzed reaction is about 100 to 400 times greater than for methotrexate [45, 46]. When L1210 murine leukemia cells with functional FPGS were exposed to 1 µ M radiolabeled pemetrexed or methotrexate for 2 hours, intracellular radiolabeled compounds were more than two times higher for pemetrexed than for methotrexate [46].

Apart  from  dihydrofolate  reductase  (DHFR),  polyglutamated  forms  of  pemetrexed  were  bound significantly more tightly by thymidylate synthase (TS), glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT),  and  aminoimidazocarboxamide  formyltransferase  (AICARFT)  [33,  47].  Pemetrexed polyglutamates were an efficient  substrate  for  the  lysosomal  enzyme, γ -glutamyl  hydrolase  (GGH), and  were  slightly  better  substrates  than  the  corresponding  polyglutamates  of  methotrexate  [48]. Pemetrexed and its polyglutamated metabolites were found to be competitive inhibitors of multiple folate dependent enzymes, including TS, DHFR, GARFT, and, additionally, AICARFT, with respect to the folate cofactor [33].

## · Effects of natural folate cofactors

The total intracellular folate concentrations and polyglutamation are key factors affecting the potency of  an  antifolate.  The  sensitivity  of  pemetrexed  followed  an  inverse  relationship  with  the  size  of intracellular folate pool [46]. Changes in the folate source, such as from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to folic acid, or its corresponding concentration, resulted in various effects depending on the cell lines tested [35].

## · Multiple target inhibition inferred from metabolic end product protection studies

In vitro , pemetrexed can assert both antithymine (by inhibition of TS and DHFR) as well as antipurine effects (by inhibition of GARFT). TS is the primary target, while DHFR and GARFT are secondary targets for pemetrexed [33, 34, 49, 50].

## · Changes in metabolite pools induced by pemetrexed

In vitro , pemetrexed induced a rapid depletion in dTTP together with an accumulation of dATP, which is consistent with TS inhibition, and additional effect on GARFT [50]. The inhibition of GARFT by pemetrexed in intact cells was also assessed by direct measurement of the metabolic flux across the purine biosynthesis pathway. According to a report submitted by the applicant, albeit weaker than the GARFT inhibitor LY309887, pemetrexed did cause a decrease in cellular incorporation of radiocarbon from [ 14 C]-formate into purine bases, consistent inhibition on GARFT.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Cell-cycle effects of pemetrexed

The sensitivity to pemetrexed in vitro was not completely dependent on p53 status, although it could be favoured by the presence of functional p53 in some cell lines [36]. Exposure to pemetrexed resulted in cell arrest at the G1/S-phase boundary, followed by a synchronous entry into S-phase at 24 hours, and apoptosis and cell disintegration completed by 48 hours [40]. The cell-cycle effects of pemetrexed were  thought  to  contribute  to  the  synergistic  interaction  observed  when  pemetrexed  was  combined with certain DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin [38] and doxorubicin [37].

## · Resistant cell studies

In cells cultured for several weeks in the presence of pemetrexed, resistant phenotypes emerge with alteration in the levels of the certain enzymes and a decrease in sensitivity to the drug [51].

## Secondary pharmacodynamics

No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with pemetrexed.

## Safety pharmacology

The  applicant  conducted  studies  to  assess  the  potential  of  pemetrexed  to  elicit  secondary  receptormediated  autonomic  pharmacology  by  smooth  and  cardiac  muscle  tissue  bath  preparations. In  vivo assessments included a battery of central nervous system (CNS) and behavioural function tests and a gastrointestinal  transit  evaluation  in  mice,  a  renal  assessment  in  rats,  and  a  cardiovascular  and respiratory assessment in anesthetized dogs.

## · Cardiovascular and respiratory effects

Pemetrexed was administered as a single dose by a 10-minute i.v. infusion at doses of 0, 32, or 105 mg/kg to anesthetized male beagle dogs. Administration of 105 mg/kg produced a mild decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in stroke volume; however, there were no effects seen on conductivity, as assessed by quantitative electrocardiography. Administration of the 32-mg/kg dose of pemetrexed did not alter any of the cardiovascular parameters.

No  statistically  significant  blockade  of  the  human  ether-a-go-go-related  gene  (HERG)  ion  channel current was observed at any of the concentrations of pemetrexed tested (up to 300 µ M) in an in vitro study at near physiological temperature conducted by the applicant.

## · CNS effects

In CD-1 mice following i.v. administration of pemetrexed of 60, 200, or 600 mg/kg, no overt clinical signs were observed.

## · Renal effects

Pharmacologic effects on renal function were evaluated in female Fischer 344 rats given a single i.v. dose of 0, 60, 200, or 600 mg pemetrexed/kg. Overall renal function was not adversely affected.

## · Gastrointestinal effects

Pemetrexed did not alter basal gastrointestinal function at doses up to 600 mg/kg.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

A  variety  of in  vitro and in  vivo studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  anti-tumour  activity  of combinations of pemetrexed with cisplatin, as well as other cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy.

The  interaction  of  pemetrexed  with  cisplatin  was  studied  in  the  MSTO-211H  cell  line,  which  was established from the pleural effusion of a patient with biphasic mesothelioma of the lung [52]. Cells were exposed to pemetrexed or cisplatin as single agents either for the entire culture time of 72 hours, or  for  24  followed  by  72  hours  of  drug  free  incubation  for  a  total  culture  time  of  96  hours.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

simultaneous exposure of both compounds  was  carried out for 72 hours. The pemetrexed concentration  range  for  each  combination  assay  was  10  nM  to  50  nM.  The  cisplatin  concentration range was 4 or 8 times the pemetrexed levels. The results showed that when the cell fraction affected was greater  than  0.5,  the  interaction  of  pemetrexed  with  cisplatin  was  synergistic  regardless  of  the sequence of exposure.

The applicant conducted a study on the interaction of pemetrexed with cisplatin using the NCI-H23 lung carcinoma cell line. Cells were exposed to pemetrexed or cisplatin as single agents for 24 or 168 hours during a total culture time of 168 hours. Simultaneous combinations of both drugs were carried out for 168 hours. The pemetrexed concentration range for each combination assay was 48 nM to 12 µ M.  The  cisplatin  concentration  range  was  0.08  to  1.3 µ M.  The  interaction  of  pemetrexed  with cisplatin,  evaluated  using  the  Pritchard-Shipman  drug-drug  interaction  model,  was  found  to  be additive regardless of the sequence of exposure.

Other studies demonstrated that the interaction of pemetrexed and cisplatin could be dependent on the sequence of addition as well as the cell line used [38]. In these studies, tumor cells were exposed to pemetrexed and cisplatin either individually or simultaneously for 24 hours, or with one agent for 24 hours followed by the other agent for 24 hours. Simultaneous exposure to pemetrexed and cisplatin produced antagonistic effects in A549 lung and MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, but additive effects in PA1 ovarian and WiDr colon carcinoma cells. In contrast, pemetrexed followed by cisplatin produced synergistic  effects  in  MCF7  cells,  greater  than  additive  effects  in  A549  as  well  as  PA1  cells,  and additive  effects  in  WiDr  cells.  However,  cisplatin  followed  by  pemetrexed  produced  antagonistic effects  in  A549,  MCF7,  and  PA1  cells  but  additive  effects  in  WiDr  cells.  From  these  data,  the applicant concluded that the addition of pemetrexed prior to cisplatin would be the preferred sequence.

The  applicant  reviewed  available  pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  using in  vitro and in  vivo colorectal  cancer  models,  including  the  combination  of  pemetrexed  with  5-fluorouracil,  oxaliplatin, and SN38 [41], the combination of pemetrexed and gemcitabine in  vitro [53,  54]  and in  vivo [40], double  and  triple  combinations  of  pemetrexed,  oxaliplatin,  and  gemcitabine in  vitro ,  pemetrexed combined  with  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel  [38],  5-FU  [55],  SN38  [41],  CPT11  (conducted  by  the applicant), and with radiation in vitro [56] and in vivo [57] (data not shown). The activities of certain of the combinations regimens investigated were characterized as being equal or greater than additive.

## Pharmacokinetics

Absorption, distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  studies  for  pemetrexed  have  been  conducted  in CD-1 mice and beagle dogs. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed after a single i.v. or intraperitoneal dose are summarized in Table 1.

## · Methods of analysis

High  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  ultraviolet  detection  or  tandem  mass  spectrometric detection  was  used  for  determination  of  pemetrexed  in  mouse  or  dog  plasma.  The  limit  of quantification and inter assay precision was 41 ng/ml and 2.6-5.5%, and 10 or 1000 ng/ml, and 2.38.2 %,  respectively.  [ 14 C]-pemetrexed was used in studies  to  evaluate  metabolism,  distribution,  and excretion of pemetrexed.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

Absolute bioavailability following 20 and 200 mg/kg dose by the IP route in mice was significant, thus supporting the comparability of IP and i.v. routes in the toxicology programme. Oral absortion was limited in mice, but at least 13 % of the oral dose was absorbed after oral administration of 20 mg/kg.

## · Distribution

Plasma levels were measured in Beagle dogs after i.v. administration of single doses of 7.5 or 100 mg/kg  pemetrexed.  Plasma  levels  decreased  like  in  a  biphasic  first  order  model.  No  difference between male and female dogs was observed. The AUC levels were proportional to the administered doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following a single i.v. dose of 20 mg/kg in male CD-1 mice, radioactivity was rapidly distributed to tissues  and  excreted  via  renal  and  biliary  elimination.  Within  1  hour,  highest  concentrations  of radioactivity were present in urine, bile within the gall bladder, feces, intestinal contents, kidney, and liver. Radioactivity was detected only in kidney and liver at times greater than 3 hours after dosing.

Protein binding of [ 14 C]-pemetrexed in plasma was estimated at 2 concentrations (500 and 5000ng/ml) using an ultracentrifugation method. Percentage protein binding was approximately 46%, 53% to 57%, and 81% in dog, mouse, and human plasma, respectively. No dependence of binding on concentration was noted, which is consistent with the magnitude of protein binding.

## · Metabolism

Metabolism studies of pemetrexed were performed only in urine in female beagle dogs and male CD-1 mice. The dogs were administered a single 7.5-mg/kg i.v. dose of [ 14 C] pemetrexed, and urine was collected for 168 hours as the part of excretion study. The pooled urine from 0 to 24 containing 65.1% of the actual dose of total radioactivity was profiled for identification of metabolites. The mice were given  a  single  20-mg/kg  i.v.  dose  of  [ 14 C]  pemetrexed,  urine  was  collected  over  0  to  7  hours  and 24.7% of the actual dose of total radioactivity was recovered.

The majority of urinary radioactivity found in both species was parent drug, constituting approximately 44% of the total dose in dog (approximately 68% of the [ 14 C] found in the 0- to 24-hour fraction) and approximately 22% in mouse (approximately 90% of the [ 14 C] found in the 0- to 7-hour fraction).

Two minor metabolites were observed, which together accounted for less than 1% (mice) or less than 6% (dog) of the  total  dose  in  these  urine  samples.  One  of  the  minor  metabolites  was  identified  as compound 338979. Both diastereomers of compound 338979 were observed. In a subsequent study, the other minor metabolite was identified as compound 368962. Unchanged pemetrexed  (70% to 90% of the administered dose) and metabolite 338979 were also detected in human urine, but metabolite 368962 could not be detected.

Since pemetrexed is largely excreted unchanged in human urine, and metabolism plays a minor role in clearance of pemetrexed, studies to determine whether pemetrexed is a substrate for CYP450 enzymes have not been carried out (70% to 90% of the administered dose).

## · Excretion

Half  life  was  7.0  h  in  male  mice  following  20  mg/kg  i.v.  and  3.7  to  4.4  h  in  female  beagle  dogs following 25 mg/kg i.v. Balance studies after administration of [ 14 C] pemetrexed disodium by i.v. to male mice and  female beagle dogs demonstrated that feces and urine were major routes of elimination in mice while urine was the major route of elimination of radioactivity in dogs, as in human. In male mice, urine,  and  feces  accounted  for  34.9  %  and  57.4  %  respectively  of  the  recovered  radiactivity. Almost 90% was excreted within 24 hours The residual amount in mice 96 hours after dosing was 0.150% ± 0.024%.

In  female  beagle  dogs  almost  90%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  was  excreted  within  24  hours. From 0 to 168 h, 99.2 % of the radioactivity was recovered,  68.8 % in the urine and 30.6 % in feces.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

See discussion on non-clinical aspects, pharmacokinetics.

## Toxicology

Pemetrexed was evaluated in single-dose studies in mice, rats and dogs, and in repeat-dose studies up to 6 weeks in mice, and up to 6 months in dogs using daily, twice weekly, once weekly, or once every 3 week schedules. Reproductive and developmental studies were conducted in mice. Special studies were conducted in dogs to evaluate potential rescue agents.

## Single-Dose Toxicity

The i.v. median lethal dose (MLD) for female and male CD-l mice was &gt;1574 mg/kg (4722 mg/m 2 ) and the i.v. MLD for female and male Fischer 344 rats was &gt;1574 and 1332 mg/kg (approximately 9444 and 7992 mg/m 2 ), respectively.

In a dose-ranging study, beagle dogs, 1/sex/group, were given a single i.v. dose of 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg (200, 500, 1000, 2000 mg/m²). Dogs were observed for 2 weeks and no animal died within that time. Clinical signs of toxicity were decreased food consumption, emesis, and runny stools in the 50 and 100 mg/kg groups. Also, modest reversible decreases in total leukocyte count were seen in dogs of these groups.

## Repeat-Dose Toxicity

In  a  pilot  toxicity  study,  mice  were  given  daily  intraperitoneal  doses  of  0  to  150  mg/kg  (0  to  450 mg/m 2 )  for  2  weeks.  All  mice  survived  to  study  termination.  Effects  on  bone  marrow,  testes,  and thymus were observed. In a longer duration study, mice were given intraperitoneal doses of 0, 10.6, or 26.2 mg/kg daily, 105 mg/kg twice weekly, or 314.8 mg/kg once weekly for 6 weeks. These doses were equivalent to 31.8, 78.6, 315, or 944.4 mg/m 2 . The mice tolerated all doses and dose schedules with no compound-related mortality. In males given daily doses, there was a partially compensated decrease  in  circulating  erythrocytes  that  was  compatible  with  erythrocyte  fragmentation  in  the microvasculature. In males, mean testes weights from all pemetrexed-treated groups were decreased approximately  70%.  Histologically,  hypospermatogenesis  accompanied  these  decreases  in  organ weight. Intestinal necrosis was slight, and was limited to male and female mice treated daily with 10.6 or 26.2 mg pemetrexed/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies up to 6 months duration with pemetrexed were conducted in dog.

In  a  6-week  study,  6  dogs/dose  group  were  given  slow-bolus  i.v.  doses  of  0,  0.11,  or  0.53  mg pemetrexed/kg daily, 3.15 or 7.87 mg/kg twice weekly, or 104.96 mg/kg once weekly (equivalent to 0, 2.2, 10.6, 63, 157.4, or 2099.2 mg/m 2 ). In contrast to what seen in the pilot studies, after about 1 week it was apparent that dogs could not tolerate the higher daily (0.53 mg/kg) or the weekly dose (104.96 mg/kg). Dogs in these two groups had their dose lowered to 0.37 and 26.24 mg/kg, respectively (7.4 and  524.8  mg/m 2 ,  respectively).  Of  the  4  dogs  given  26.24  mg  pemetrexed/kg  once  per  week, septicemia, secondary to mucositis or pneumonia, was the cause of death in the 2 dogs. One out of 6 dogs administered daily doses of 0.11 mg/kg experienced irreversible toxicity (progressive anorexia, hypoactivity, leukopenia) and death after 4 weeks of treatment. Only 2 of the 6 dogs given 3.15 mg/kg twice  weekly  completed  6  weeks  of  treatment.  The  remaining  dogs  completed  only  3  weeks  of treatment.

A one-month study with 3-week reversibility phase in dog was conducted to assess the toxicity of four weekly doses of pemetrexed in beagle dogs. Doses of 0, 10, or 25 mg/kg (0, 200, or 500 mg/m 2 ) were administered  i.v.  to  6  dogs/sex/group.  The  doses  of  10  and  25  mg/kg  produced  measurable hematologic effects, but minimal gastrointestinal effects. All changes, except for the decreased platelet count in the high-dose dogs (25 mg/kg), fully or partially reversed within the 3-week recovery period.

A six-month study in dog was initially conducted to assess the toxicity of weekly doses of pemetrexed in beagle dogs. Doses of 0, 10, or 25 mg/kg (0, 200, or 500 mg/m 2 , respectively) were used in the 6month  study  and  were  administered  i.v.ly  to  4  dogs/sex/group.  However,  after  approximately  3 months, the dosing frequency was changed to once every 3 weeks and dosing was discontinued for the 25-mg/kg group due to hematotoxicity. Pemetrexed given once per week or once 3 weeks caused the expected  alterations  in  clinical  observations,  hematology  parameters,  and  histopathology:  abnormal faeces (watery, mucoid, or soft), decreased food consumption, and skin lesions (erythema, desquamation, excoriation, and exudate or crusts), decreases in neutrophil, platelet, reticulocyte, and lymphocyte  counts,  non  dose-responsive  bone  marrow  hypocellularity  and  testicular  degeneration. Hematotoxicity was the dose-limiting effect and neither 10 nor 25 mg/kg was tolerated when given once per week for more than 7 weeks. Hematologic changes in the 25-mg/kg dogs were reversible, and 10 mg/kg was tolerated for approximately 3 months after the dosing frequency was reduced to once every 3 weeks.

Toxicokinetics were investigated only in the dog. Plasma concentrations increased with the dose, and the increase was proportional to the dose. No gender-effect was observed.

## Genotoxicity

Pemetrexed  was  not  mutagenic  in Salmonella  typhimurium and Escherichia  coli ,  either  with  or without metabolic activation, using the Ames test. There was no evidence that pemetrexed induced mammallian cell mutations in  the HGPRT+ Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell assay, either with or without metabolic activation. Pemetrexed did not produce an increase in chromosomal aberrations in vitro  in  CHO  cells,  either  with  or  without  metabolic  activation,  using  the  chromosome  aberration assay.

The potential of pemetrexed to induce micronuclei in vivo was investigated in bone marrow of ICR mice. The incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in male and female mice treated with pemetrexed was significantly increased compared to that of animals receiving vehicle control, using the mouse micronucleus test.

## Carcinogenicity

Studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted.

## Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity

In a segment I reproductive toxicity study in male CD-1 mice, pemetrexed by repeated intraperitoneal injection at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg for 6-weeks resulted in male reproductive toxicity characterised by slightly reduced fertility rates, testicular atrophy and epididymal hypospermia. The no-observedeffect level (NOEL) for these effects was &lt; 0.1 mg/kg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the definitive study, pemetrexed was given by injection into one of the caudal veins to mated mice (30 mice/group) at doses of 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg (0.6, 3, or 15 mg/m 2 ,  respectively). All treated mice survived until live-phase termination. Foetal weights were reduced from control in the 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg groups in a dose-responsive manner. The incidences of foetuses with incomplete ossification of several  skeletal  structures  were  higher  in  the  1-  and  5-mg/kg  litters  relative  to  controls.  The malformation, cleft palate, was observed in approximately 85% and 97% of the 5-mg/kg foetuses and litters, respectively. In this definitive study, the NOEL for maternal toxicity was 1 mg/kg (3 mg/m 2 ), based  on  decreased  body  weight  gain.  A  NOEL  for  developmental  toxicity  was  not  established, because foetal growth retardation was observed at all doses. Foetal malformations were evident only in the group given 5 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.

Studies to assess the prenatal and postnatal toxicity of pemetrexed have not been conducted.

## Local tolerance

Specific parenteral tolerance studies were not conducted with pemetrexed. No evidence of irritation was identified at the sites of i.v. and intraperitoneal injection in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. There was  no  chemical-induced  peritonitis  in  the  abdominal  cavity  of  mice  following  intraperitoneal injection.

Ocular and dermal tolerance tests showed that pemetrexed was considered to be a mild irritant to the ocular tissue of rabbit, and a moderate irritant to the dermal tissue of the rabbit.

## Other toxicity studies

## Rescue studies

In a folinic acid rescue study in dogs given a potentially lethal dose of pemetrexed (50 mg/kg, or 1000 mg/m 2 , × 2,  3  days  apart)  followed  by  parenteral  folinic  acid,  the  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  and haematological  alterations  induced  by  pemetrexed  treatment  were  reversed  within  4  days  after initiation of folinic acid therapy, and leukocyte counts had returned to normal range after 6 days.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  amount  of  pemetrexed  that  was  estimated  to  be  used  and  excreted  did  not  warrant  a  full environmental  analysis.  Information  was  gained,  though,  as  part  of  the  development  of  waste containment guidelines for manufacturing facilities. In this regard, pemetrexed was found to have high water solubility and a wide safety margin for aquatic species.

The  Kow  of  pemetrexed  also  indicates  a  low  potential  for  bioaccumulation  in  aquatic  organisms. Further, due to the anticipated volume and usage, substantive excretion of pemetrexed from humans is not  expected.  The  maximum  predicted  concentration  of  pemetrexed  in  the  influent  of  sewage treatment facilities that may be discharged into the aquatic environment is &lt; 0.03 µg/L.

Pemetrexed  is  highly  biodegradable  in  sewage  treatment  sludge.  Less  than  1000  kg  of  the  active ingredient in pemetrexed is expected to be used within a year in Europe, resulting in concentrations in the  influent  of  sewage  treatment  facilities  less  than  0.03  µg/L.  For  these  reasons,  exposure  to concentrations of pemetrexed in the environment would not pose an environmental concern.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Nonclinical reports and bibliographic references, a comprehensive factual synopsis of findings and the implications for the safe use of pemetrexed have been provided following agreed Common Technical Document recommendations [58].

## Pharmacodynamics

Pemetrexed was found to have activity against a broad range of tumor cells, including tumor types generally  considered  to  be  chemoresistant.  In  combination  with  cisplatin  a  synergistic  effect  was shown  in  vitro  when  given  simultaneously.  Tumour  growth  inhibition  was  demonstrated  against breast,  pancreas,  lung,  and  colon  tumour  xenografts.  No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  have been performed with pemetrexed, which is considered acceptable, as the mechanism of action seems to be specific. Overall, adequate information about the pemetrexed-specific activity profile has been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

obtained using well-characterised cell lines and compared with that of standard anticancer agents, in agreement with relevant guidance [59].

The safety pharmacology of pemetrexed was assessed with a limited number of in vitro and in vivo studies.  No  reference  compounds  have  been  used.  However,  the  models  used  were  all  well characterized, and the lack of concurrent positive and negative controls can be justified in agreement with current guidance [59a]. Overall, there were no effects seen in the safety pharmacology studies that  would  be  of  concern.  From  a  preclinical  perspective,  pemetrexed  has  no  effect  on  QTc prolongation.

Pemetrexed was evaluated in combination with a variety of other anti-tumor agents including platinum compounds, antitubulin  agents,  and  other  antimetabolites.  The  resulting  growth  inhibitory  activities were generally additive or synergistic. From non-clinical results, a clear justification of the sequence of  an  efficient  treatment  combination is difficult,  due  to  the  wide  range  of  compounds,  models and sequence administration used. The pharmacodynamic drug interaction of pemetrexed and cisplatin is of  particular  interest,  and  is  prompted  by  indications  of  therapeutic  effect  in  the  treatment  of mesothelioma. One in vitro investigation showed that simultaneous administration of the combination has synergistic effects on growth inhibition of the mesothelioma tumour cell line. No in vivo studies with the cisplatin combination have been submitted. Since extensive clinical data have been available, further animal studies to justify the combination, as generally required [60], are not expected to bring any essential new information on the effects of the combination in humans.

## Pharmacokinetics

The oral absorption in mice was very limited. Therefore, the i.v. route of administration was chosen for  clinical  development.  The  Beagle  dog  was  found  to  be  an  appropriate  animal  for  pharmacotoxicological studies since the pharmacokinetic parameters of Beagle dogs and humans were in the same order of magnitude. Pemetrexed was rapidly distributed, followed by rapid urinary and biliary elimination. The latter is pronounced in mice whereas urinary excretion is preferred in Beagle dogs and  humans.  The  long  retention  in  liver  observed  in  mice  could  possibly  be  due  to  tissue-specific uptake and retention of polyglutamylated forms of this close folate analog. Metabolism contributed minimally towards the clearance of pemetrexed in mice, dogs, and humans.

The applicant has justified the details of the methods used, their validity and reproducibility, including the specificity, precision and accuracy. The animal species in these studies are those normally used in the  laboratory  for  pharmacological  and  toxicological  investigations.  Doses  and  routes  of  drug administration are related to the proposed clinical use of the substance. Overall, adequate information has  been  presented  allowing  comparison  and  extrapolation  between  animal  and  human,  and appropriate conclusions have been drawn from these studies about the time course of the absorption, distribution and excretion of pemetrexed.

Aspirin and ibuprofen are commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cancer patients and occasionally fatal adverse events have been reported with the anti-folate methotrexate in combination with NSAIDs. In vivo interaction studies were conducted with aspirin and ibuprofen to determine  if  single  or  repeated  oral  doses  of  these  agents  would  alter  the  pharmacokinetics  of pemetrexed. No substantive pharmacokinetic interactions were observed, but this may also be due to the small number of animals studied, and the lack of power of the studies detect any effect (data not shown).

Preclinical toxicology studies using concomitant administration of pemetrexed and cisplatin were not conducted, although such studies are  encouraged [59].  For  combinations  involving  pemetrexed  and cisplatin, preclinical toxicity testing was not considered essential by the applicant because each agent has been fully evaluated for safety in humans, and because of the lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction in  humans.  It  is  agreed  that  coadministration  with  cisplatin  did  not  alter  pemetrexed  clearance  and pemetrexed did not alter total platinum clearance in the Phase III trial JMCH. Further animal studies to describe  any  collateral  effects  of  the  combination  are  not  expected  to  bring  any  essential  new information on the effects of the combination in humans. Given the documentation and justifications provided, the toxicology requirements are considered fulfilled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

The number and types of species studied in single-dose tioxicity studies were adequate and the list of tissues examined was extensive and consistent with GLP. In agreement with applicable requirements and guidelines [59-61], adequate presentation of the results and conclusions have been provided. Dogs were more sensitive to the toxic effects of pemetrexed than were mice. This finding was expected, as mice  have  a  'self-rescue'  mechanism  in  a  circulating  thymidine  moiety  that  can  serve  as  a replacement source in folate-antagonized cells [62]. Additionally, dogs are generally more predictive of systemic toxicity in man than are mice [63, 64]. Despite the rescue mechanism, identification of target  organs  in  the  toxicity  studies  in  mice  was  not  confounded  by  this  phenomenon  and  was confirmed by the findings in the dog. In addition, NOAELs found in the mice were similar to those found in the dog. Thus, the choice of the mouse in pilot toxicology studies is acceptable.

Pemetrexed was administered by the route intended for use in man and the rationale on which the dose levels were selected was presented. Adequate presentation of the results and conclusions have been provided. The duration of the long-term repeat-dose studies is adequate for the conditions of clinical use, and has been adequately justified in view of applicable requirements and guidelines [59, 60, 65].

The  main  limiting  toxicity  of  pemetrexed  following  repeated  dosing  was  haematological  toxicity followed by necrotising enteropathy. This toxicologic profile is consistent with the antiproliferative activities  of  folate  antimetabolites  [66].  Lesions  of  mucositis,  enteropathy,  and  lymphoid  and  bone marrow  hypocellularity  are  commonly  encountered  with  folate  antimetabolites  and  other  oncolytic agents [66, 67]. Skin, especially the mucosa of the mouth cavity, were affected leading to ulceration of mucosa  and  sometimes  followed  by  bacterial  inflammation.    Hypospermatogenesis  with  necrotised spermatocytes  were  also  seen  in  pathological  investigations  at  the  end  of  the  study.  Usually  these effects were reversible, however, this is not clear with regard to hypospermatogenesis.

Due to the extreme toxic effects in beagle dogs it was not possible to determine safety margins which were comparable to humans. Doses of 25 mg/kg (500 mg/m²) every 3 weeks seemed to be tolerated in dogs poorly but the same dose of pemetrexed is given to humans.

Pemetrexed was clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. This finding might be explained by the TS inhibition caused by pemetrexed. TS methylates uridine to thymidine and is dependent on folate  metabolism. TS inhibition by pemetrexed will result in accumulation of uridine along with a decrease in thymidine levels. Absence of folic acid and thymidine in the medium, greatly enhanced micronucleus formation in proliferating lymphocyte cultures from normal individuals [68]. Increased levels  of  uridine  with  decreased  levels  of  thymidine  also  result  in  cycles  of  urdine  insertion  and excision  into  the  DNA,  eventually  leading  to  DNA  strand  breakage  and  cell  death  [69,  70]. Pemetrexed  was  not  mutagenic  in  the  Ames  test  and  tested  negative    in  the in  vitro chromosome aberration test in CHO cells. The clastogenic potential of pemetrexed is adequately described in the SPC (Section 5.3).

Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Adequate warnings have been included in the SPC (Section 4.4, and 4.6). Sexually mature males are advised not to father a child during the treatment and up  to  6  months  thereafter.  Contraceptive  measures  or  abstinence  are  recommended.  Women  of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed.

Overall, the genotoxicity of pemetrexed has been adequately investigated and standard test have been conducted and described in compliance with regulatory guidance and requirements [58-61, 71].

Carcinogenicity studies with pemetrexed have not been conducted. Such studies are not needed with unequivocally genotoxic compounds, as they are presumed to be transspecies carcinogens, implying a hazard  to  humans.  No  long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  are  required  taking  into  account  the  life expectancy  of  patients  with  unresectable  malignant  pleural  mesothelioma  or  locally  advanced  or metastatic  NSCLC after  prior  chemotherapy  [58-61].  The  lack  of  such  studies  has  been  adequately reflected in the SPC (Section 5.3).

Although  generally  not  required  for  anticancer  agents  (these  products  are  are  assumed  to  cause reproductive disturbances), studies elucidating the potential for reproductive toxicity are encouraged [59].  Administration  of  pemetrexed  to  male  mice  resulted  in  reproductive  toxicity  suggesting  that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. The applicant did not conduct any female fertility study as the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results obtained from such a study with pemetrexed would not provide any additional insights given the magnitude of embryolethality already described in the pregnant mouse. The reproductive toxicity observed  is  consistent  with  the  known  antiproliferative  activities  of  folate  antimetabolites.  These observations are not unexpected findings for a drug that affects rapidly dividing cells, are commonly seen  with  anticancer  drugs,  and  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  SPC  (Section  5.3).  Owing  to  the possibility of pemetrexed  treatment causing irreversible infertility, men  are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment, and this has been reflected in the SPC (Section 4.4).

Pemetrexed, like other anti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy (see SPC, section 4.6). Administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and  cleft  palate.  As  a  class,  folic  acid  antimetabolites  have  been  demonstrated  to  produce  three manifestations  of  developmental  toxicity:  growth  retardation,  embryolethality,  and  malformations [72]. Exencephaly, omphalocele, ectrodactyly, and cleft palate have been observed in mouse fetuses exposed to methotrexate during organogenesis [73]. Based on the pilot and the definitive developmental  toxicity  studies  with  pemetrexed,  growth  retardation  was  observed  at  doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg, malformations at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg, and embryolethality at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg. Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus. Adequate warnings are provided in the SPC (Section 4.6 and 5.3)

Studies to assess the prenatal and postnatal toxicity of pemetrexed have not been conducted. Lack of these  studies  has  been  justified  in  view  of  the  nature  of  the  disease,  cyclic  nature  of  pemetrexed administraton, duration of treatment, and poor life expectancy of the proposed patient population.

In summary, the developmental toxicity profile of pemetrexed and the types of foetal effects observed are consistent with effects reported in rodents for other folic acid anti-metabolites [63]. A nonrodent species was not tested in a segment II study based on the significant positive findings observed in the mouse  study.  Female  fertility  studies  were  not  conducted  as  such  a  study  would  not  provide  any additional insights given the magnitude of embryolethality observed. Studies to assess the prenatal and postnatal  toxicity  of  pemetrexed  have  not  been  conducted,  in  view  of  nature  of  the  disease,  cyclic nature of pemetrexed administration, duration of treatment, and poor life-expectancy of the proposed patient  population.  Overall,  the  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  of  pemetrexed  has  been adequately  investigated  and  reported,  and  the  omission  of  further  reproductive  and  developmental toxicity  studies  has  been  adequately  justified,  in  line  with  applicable  guidelines  and  regulatory requirements [59, 60, 74].

The lack of local tolerance testing has been justified based on the findings of other toxicity studies, in line with applicable guidance [59]. It is unlikely that the formulated pemetrexed would pose a risk for reaction  at  the  site  of  injection.  Pemetrexed  has  potential  to  be  an  ocular  and  dermal  irritant. Appropriate cautionary statements and preparation and administration precautions are included in the SPC (Section  6.6).  Extravasation  should  be  managed  by  local  standard  practice  as  with  other  nonvesicants.

The mechanism of reversal of antifolate toxicity by the active folates at the cellular level is complex and is the subject of continuous research (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). In vitro studies have confirmed that the toxic effect of pemetrexed can be reversed efficiently by folinic acid [75]. According to a study conducted by the applicant, leucovorin was able to rescue dogs from lethal acute toxicity. Folinic acid should be considered as an antidote for overdose (see SPC Section 4.9).

## 3. Part IV: Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Efficacy data are presented by indication. Based on the information provided, all trials were conducted according to the principles of GCP. In MPM one pivotal Phase 3 study was performed comparing the test  regimen of pemetrexed plus cisplatin with cisplatin monotherapy.  Supporting studies include a Phase 1 dose-finding study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin, a Phase 1 dose-finding study of pemetrexed plus  carboplatin,  and  a  Phase  2  study  of  single-agent  pemetrexed  in  chemotherapy-naive  MPM

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients (Table 2A). In NSCLC after prior chemotherapy, one pivotal Phase 3 study was performed. This study compared the test regimen of pemetrexed with docetaxel, the only drug currently approved for  second-line  treatment  of  NSCLC.  Supporting  studies  include  Phase  2  studies  of  single-agent pemetrexed  in  previously  treated,  or  untreated,  NSCLC  patients  (Table  2B).  Scientific  Advice  was sought  from  the  Committee  for  Proprietary  Medicinal  Products  (CPMP)  in  2000.  Pemetrexed  is currently under development for several oncology indications.

ALIMTA must  only  be  administered  under  the  supervision  of  a  physician  qualified  in  the  use  of anti-cancer  chemotherapy  (see  section  4.2  of  the  SPC).  In  patients  treated  for  malignant  pleural mesothelioma,  the  recommended  dose  of  ALIMTA  is  500 mg/m 2 of  body  surface  area  (BSA) administered  as  an  i.v.  infusion  over  10  minutes  on  the  first  day  of  each  21-day  cycle.  The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m 2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after  completion  of  the  pemetrexed  infusion  on  the  first  day  of  each  21-day  cycle.  Patients  must receive  adequate  anti-emetic  treatment  and  appropriate  hydration  prior  to  and/or  after  receiving cisplatin (see SPC section 4.2). In patients treated for NSCLC, the recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m 2 BSA administered as an i.v. infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle.

Since  December  1999,  folic  acid  and  vitamin  B12  supplementation  have  been  introduced  for  all patients treated with pemetrexed, to reduce toxicity (see SPC section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to 1000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing  must  continue  during  the  full  course  of  therapy  and  for  21  days  after  the  last  dose  of pemetrexed.  Accordingly, patients  must  also  receive  an  intramuscular  injection  of  vitamin  B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed.

## Pharmacology

## · Analytical methods

For  the  measurement  of  pemetrexed  concentrations  in  plasma  and  urine,  a  reverse-phase  HPLC method  using  electrospray  tandem  mass  spectrometry  detection  was  primarily  employed.  For  the measurement  of  total  platinum  (for  cisplatin  and  carboplatin)  concentrations  in  plasma,  a  standard graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopic method was used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  pemetrexed  following  single-agent  administration  have  been evaluated  in  426  cancer  patients  with  a  variety  of  solid  tumours  at  doses  ranging  from  0.2  to 838 mg/m 2 infused over a 10-minute period.

Pemetrexed was administered as a single agent in Phase 1 dose-escalation studies JMAA, JMAB, and BP001. Pemetrexed was administered as a 10-minute i.v. infusion every 21 days over a dose range of 50 to 700 mg/m 2 in Study JMAA, once weekly (every 7 days) for 4 weeks followed by two weeks of rest  over  a  dose  range  of  10 to  40  mg/m 2 in  Study JMAB,  and  once  daily  for  5  consecutive  days followed by 16 days of rest to complete a 21-day cycle over a dose range of 0.2 to 5.2 mg/m 2 in Study BP001.  Clinical evaluation demonstrated that the once every 21-day dosing regimen (Study JMAA) was the most promising dosing regimen to explore for subsequent development.

In Study JMAA, dose escalation was performed using the modified continual reassessment method. Only 1 or 2 patients were assigned to each dose until the presence of toxicity was observed.  More patients  were  enrolled  at  the  three  highest  doses  (525,  600,  and  700 mg/m 2 ).    The  MTD  from  this dosage regimen was determined to be 600 mg/m 2 . The main DLTs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic fatigue.  Doses of 500 and 600 mg/m 2 were evaluated in a variety of subsequent Phase 2 studies in various solid tumor types. The pharmacokinetic parameters for study JMAA  are  summarized  in  Table  2C.  Pemetrexed  total  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  and  maximum plasma  concentration  increase  proportionally  with  dose.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  pemetrexed  were consistent over multiple treatment cycles.

## · Absorption - Bioavailability

Alimta is intended for i.v. administration, and absorption studies are not relevant.

## · Distribution

In Study JMAA, mean plasma concentration-time profiles at the three highest doses (525, 600 and 700 mg/m 2 ) demonstrated a sharp decline of approximately three orders of magnitude from the maximum over a 24-hour period. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) occurred at or near termination of the infusion and ranged from 67.4 to 251.3 µ g/ml at a 600 mg/m 2 dose. Total plasma clearance (CL p ) and steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) were consistent across the dose range and ranged from 52.3 to 136 ml/min and 8.5 to 23.0 L at 600 mg/m 2 , respectively.  Inter-patient variability of CL p  and V ss was moderate at 23% and 26%, respectively.  The apparent t 1/2  was short, ranging from 2 to 7 hours for all doses. Within each of the three Phase 1 studies there were no clinically significant deviations from dose proportionality for both AUC and C max .

Pemetrexed  demonstrated  a  relatively  small  volume  of  distribution  in  both  noncompartmental pharmacokinetic  evaluations  based  on  data  from  Phase  1  studies,  and  population  pharmacokinetic analyses based on data from Phase 2 and 3 studies, suggesting that the compound has limited tissue distribution.  In  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses,  distribution  volume  at  steady  state  (V ss )  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

16.1 L, or approximately 9 L/m 2 (based on median BSA of 1.74 m 2 ). Of this volume, approximately 80% was associated with the volume of the central compartment (V 1 ).  Body size as quantified by body surface area (BSA) was identified in the population pharmacokinetics analyses to be the only significant predictor of V 1  as described by the relationship V 1  = 6.13 · BSA1.32 .  Because V 1  probably represents a combination of total blood volume and well-perfused organs, it is reasonable that larger individuals have greater blood volume and organ size and thus a larger volume of distribution.  The relationship identified between V 1  and BSA is consistent with this assumption.  No relationships were established between distribution volume of the second (that is, peripheral) compartment (V 2 ) and the potential covariates investigated.

The protein binding of [ 14 C] pemetrexed in plasma was estimated using an ultracentrifugation method. In vitro pemetrexed protein binding at concentration of 0.5, 100 and 200 µ g/ml  was assessed in predose  human  plasma  samples  from  Study  JMAW  using  ultracentrifugation.  Subjects  were  classified into  treatment  groups  according  to  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment  as  measured  by  GFR.  In  a concentration range from 0.5 to 200 µg/ml, pemetrexed was approximately 80.3% to 83.9% bound to plasma  proteins.  No  notable  differences  were  observed  for  different  degrees  of  pemetrexed  plasma concentration and of renal impairment.

## · Metabolism

Non-clinical  studies  revealed  minimal  metabolism  of  pemetrexed.  Two  minor  metabolites  were observed  from  non-clinical  studies  but  neither  metabolite  is  pharmacologically  active.  Unchanged pemetrexed  and  metabolite  LY338979  were  also  detected  in  human  urine  collected  from  subjects participating in the renal insufficiency Study JMAW using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC/MS/MS).  Unchanged  pemetrexed  accounted  for  the  majority  of  the  drug-related material in urine. Metabolite LY368962 could not be detected in human urine samples.

The ability of pemetrexed to inhibit the metabolism of marker catalytic activities for the cytochromes P450 CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2 was examined. Slight inhibition by pemetrexed of the form-selective biotransformation for CYP3A, the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam, was observed. At a midazolam concentration of 5 µ M, 21% inhibition of CYP3A mediated midazolam metabolism was  observed  at  the  highest  concentration  of  pemtrexed  (885 µ M)  examined.  At  a  bufuralol concentration  of  5 µ M,  little  change  in  CYP2D6  mediated  bufuralol  metabolism  was  observed  at concentrations of pemetrexed ranging from 400 to 1000 µ M. At a diclofenac concentration of 2.5 µ M, slight  inhibition  of  the  CYP2C9  mediated  metabolism  was  observed  at  the  highest  pemetrexed concentration (1000 µ M) examined. Metabolism of phenacetin to acetaminophen, the form-selective biotransformation for CYP1A2 catalytic activity, was slightly inhibited in the presence of up to 1000 µ M pemetrexed when a 12.5 µ M phenacetin concentration was used. Since peak circulating levels of pemetrexed approach 200 µ g/ml (468 µ M) in humans, these in vitro studies predict that pemetrexed would not cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2.

## · Excretion

Study JMAA showed that pemetrexed is eliminated primarily by urinary excretion of unchanged drug. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose being recovered  unchanged  in  urine  within  the  first  24  hours  following  administration.  Urinary  excretion started to reach a plateau at approximately 12 hours after start of infusion, consistent with the short elimination half-life (t1/2).

The fraction excreted unchanged into urine appeared to decrease progressively with severity of renal insufficiency  (see  also  pharmacokinetics  in  special  populations).  Indeed,  a  positive  correlation between  pemetrexed  CLp  and  estimated  creatinine  clearance  was  observed  for  Studies  JMAA  and JMAB.  Plasma  clearance  increased  with  improved  renal  function,  as  expected  for  a  drug  that  is eliminated primarily by urinary excretion.

Pemetrexed  total  systemic  clearance  was  estimated  to  be  91.8  ml/min  and  the  elimination  half-life from plasma was 3.5 hours for a 'typical' patient with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90  ml/min  calculated  using  the  standard  Cockcroft  and  Gault  formula  or  measured  GFR  using  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method). Active tubular secretion contributes significantly to the renal elimination  of  pemetrexed.  The  product  of  the  fraction  unbound  (f u )  and  GFR  (f u · GFR; 0.19 · 120 ml/min  =  23  ml/min),  represents  the  filtration  capacity  of  the  kidney  to  eliminate  pemetrexed. Therefore,  the  estimate  of  pemetrexed  clearance  (CL)  (91.8 ml/min)  is  approximately  4  times  the estimated clearance by filtration (23 ml/min). Between patient variability in clearance was moderate at 19.3 % in cancer patients receiving single-agent pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m 2 .

## Population pharmacokinetics

## Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using data from 8 of 10 Phase II studies (Studies JMAC, JMAD, JMAG, JMAH, JMAI, JMAJ, JMAK, JMAM, construction set). The predictive ability of  the  model  was  then  evaluated  using  the  data  from  the  remaining  2  studies  (JMAL  and  JMBR, validation  set).  The  primary  objective  for  each  of  the  nonrandomized  single-arm  studies  without controls was to determine the response rate in each tumor type for patients treated with pemetrexed. In each of the studies, pemetrexed was administered as a 10-minute i.v. infusion every 21 days.  Initial doses (Cycle 1) were 500 to 600 mg/m 2 . Dose adjustment (reduction) at the start of subsequent courses of therapy were based on nadir counts or maximal nonhematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. The studies were prospectively designed to include a sparse blood sampling strategy for evaluation using population pharmacokinetic  techniques. Plasma  concentration-time data  were analyzed by population pharmacokinetic methods using the NONMEM software [76].

## Results

The  analyses  included  data  from  287  (209  and  78  for  the  construction  and  validation  sets, respectively) patients receiving pemetrexed as a 10-minute continuous infusion every 21 days. A total of  1596  observations  from  287  patients  receiving  pemetrexed  and  441  treatment  cycles  with  doses ranging from 244 mg to 1494 mg were collected at various times during Cycles 1 and 3 for analysis of pemetrexed  concentrations  in  plasma  to  cover  the  entire  plasma  concentration-time  profile.  The pharmacokinetics  of  pemetrexed  were  best  characterized  using  an  open  two-compartment  model parameterized  in  terms  of  clearance  (CL),  central  volume  of  distribution  (V 1 ),  intercompartmental clearance (Q), and peripheral volume of distribution (V 2 ).

Various patient demographic and physiologic factors were evaluated with respect to each pharmacokinetic  parameter.  The  final  population  pharmacokinetic  model  indicated  that  pemetrexed clearance was dependent on creatinine clearance as estimated by the standard Cockcroft-Gault formula (CrCl CG,std )  incorporating  age,  body  weight,  and  serum  creatinine  concentration.  The  volume  of distribution of the central compartment was dependant on body surface area (BSA). Between-patient variability in CL, Central Volume of Distribution (V1), and Peripheral Volume of Distribution V2 in the final population model are summarised in Table 3.

The  'typical  value'  (population  central  tendency)  for  pemetrexed  CL  was  90.2 ml/min,  and  for pemetrexed V ss  was 16.1 L.  The apparent t 1/2  of pemetrexed from plasma for the typical patient was determined  to  be  approximately  3.5  hours.    Each  of  these  values  are  consistent  with  the  results obtained  from  the  Phase  1  study,  JMAA.    Similarly,  estimates  of  between-patient  variability  were consistent with those obtained from Study JMAA and were well-characterized based on precision of variance parameter estimates (19.3% [14.1 %SEE] for CL, 16.6% [29.3 %SEE] for V 1 , 24.5% [24.6 %SEE] for V 2 , and 28.4% [8.22 %SEE] residual variability).

Dose proportionality was also evaluated using population pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 244 to  1494  mg  (126  to  838  mg/m 2 ).    Results  from  this  analysis  demonstrated  that  pemetrexed pharmacokinetics  were  linear  (that  is,  dose-independent  over  the  range  of  doses  studied).    This indicates that pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increase proportionally with dose.

The influence of duration of therapy was evaluated and indicated that pemetrexed clearance decreased 4.3% and V 1  increased 10% for later treatment cycles (Cycle 3 or 4) relative to Treatment Cycle 1. These differences, although statistically significant, are small (not clinically relevant) and are much less than within-patient variability.

## Special populations

## Impaired renal function

Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 47 patients who had varying degrees of renal function (Study JMAW). Glomerular filtration rate, measured by Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance, varied from 19 ml/min to 151 ml/min. The study was initiated without vitamin supplementation; the protocol was amended during the study to include folic acid and vitamin B 12  supplementation. Creatinine clearance calculated by the standard Cockcroft-Gault method (CrCl CG,std ) [77] was found to provide a better approximation to the measured renal function using Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance than compared to lean body  mass  formula  (CrCl CG,LBM ).  A  proportional relationship  was  observed  between pemetrexed plasma clearance and renal clearance with measured GFR and CrCl CG,std  in patients with renal  impairment  (GFR  19  to  79  ml/min).  No  statistically  significant  relationship  was  observed  for patients  with  normal  renal  function  (GFR  &gt;80  ml/min).  Mean  plasma  and  renal  clearance  values exhibited over a 2-fold decrease in patients with moderate renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function. Additionally, the ratio of mean renal clearance to the product of the fraction of drug  unbound  in  plasma  (f u )  with  GFR  (f u · GFR)  values  increased  from  1.5  to  2.1  with  an improvement in renal function in patients with moderate renal impairment to the lower limit of normal renal function. Therefore, it appears that tubular secretion became more prominent as renal function improved  or  the  contribution  of  reabsorption  decreased  as  renal  function  improved.  Mean  percent bound ranged from 73.4% to 81.0%. Although pemetrexed clearance varied almost 10 fold over the range of renal function, pemetrexed given at the recommended clinical dose of 500 mg/m 2 was welltolerated in patients with GFR as low as 40 ml/min.

The final population pharmacokinetic model indicated that pemetrexed clearance was dependent on creatinine  clearance  as  estimated  by  the  CrCl CG,std   incorporating  age,  body  weight,  and  serum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

creatinine  concentration.  A  combined  evaluation  of  pemetrexed  pharmacokinetics  in  patients  with renal insufficiency included 127 patients with reduced renal function from the 10 single-agent Phase 2 studies,  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  in  combination  with  cisplatin  (JMCH),  and  the  Phase  1  renal impairment  study  (JMAW).  Estimates  of  pemetrexed  CL  and  total  systemic  exposure  (AUC) following a 500 mg/m 2 dose for the 'typical' patient (population average; creatinine clearance based on the CrCl CG,std  90 ml/min) and a renally impaired (CrCl CG,std  45 ml/min) patient are provided in Table 4. A patient with a creatinine clearance of 45 ml/min would be expected to have 36% lower pemetrexed  clearance  relative  to  the  population  average,  which  would  result  in  a  56%  increase  in overall exposure.

a Estimated creatinine clearance using standard Cockcroft-Gault method (Cockcroft and Gault 1976).

## Impaired liver function

Because the drug is eliminated primarily by renal excretion of unchanged drug, and metabolism plays a  negligible  role  in  clearance  of  the  drug,  no  specific  study  was  performed  in  patients  with  hepatic dysfunction. The relationships between ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), and total bilirubin as indicators of hepatic dysfunction, and pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were evaluated in the population pharmacokinetics  analyses.  No  association  was  observed  between  pemetrexed  disposition  and  ALT over a range from 5 to 495 upper limit (U/L), AST over a range from 5 to 204 U/L, or total bilirubin over a range of 3 to 34.2 µ mol/L (data not shown).

## Gender, race, weight, age

No  important association between gender or age (range 26 to 80 years) and pemetrexed pharmacokinetics  was  observed.  No  data  in  children  are  available.  The  index  dataset  consisted  of predominantly Caucasian 160 (77%) patients with 35 (11%) of African descent, 2 (1%) Asian, 2 (1%) Hispanic,  and  10  (11%)  having  undefined  ethnic  origin.  No  important  association  between  ethnic origin  and  pemetrexed  disposition  was  observed.  Pemetrexed  central  volume  of  distribution  is dependant  on  body  surface  area  in  an  exponential  fashion  (see  Clinical  aspects,  Pharmacokinetics, Distribution ).  Because BSA is a predictor of V1 and not CL, the effect of BSA is reflected in peak pemetrexed concentration and not on overall exposure to the drug (AUC).

## Extrinsic factors, and interaction studies

No associations between smoking or self-reported alcohol consumption and pemetrexed disposition were observed.

Studies to determine whether pemetrexed is a substrate for CYP450 enzymes have not been carried out.  The  ability  of  pemetrexed  to  inhibit  the  metabolism  of  marker  catalytic  activities  for  the  main cytochrome P450 isoenzymes was performed in vitro with human liver microsomes (see Metabolism).

The  effect  of  aspirin  and  non  steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  on  pemetrexed  clearance  were investigated because of the established interaction between aspirin/NSAIDs and methotrexate, and due to the structural similarity of pemetrexed with methotrexate. Study JMAW was a phase I dose-finding study  in  patients  with  advanced  cancers  of  various  types  having  varying  degrees  of  renal  function. Pursuant  to  Protocol  Addendum  JMAW2b,  additional  patients  (24)  with  glomerular  filtration  rate (GRF ≥ 60ml/min) received pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 alone and in combination with aspirin (325 mg orally  every  6  hours  )  or  ibuprofen  (2 × 200mg  orally  every  6  hours).  Aspirin  and  ibuprofen  were administered  2  days  prior  to  pemetrexed  administration  and  the  last  dose  given  1  hour  prior pemetrexed administration. The assessment of the influence of pemetrexed on aspirin and ibuprofen was not performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No significant association between co-administration of aspirin 325mg  every 6 hours and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed was observed. Interactions between pemetrexed and aspirin administered at high doses have not been investigated.

When  pemetrexed  is  administered  concomitantly  with  ibuprofen  1.6  mg  daily,  a  statistically significant increase in pemetrexed AUC (20%) and Cmax, (15%) occured as well as a a statistically significant reduction in clearance (CL) (17%).

## Discussion on pharmacokinetics

Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics are linear. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose.

Pemetrexed is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins. The binding of pemetrexed to individual components of plasma such as albumin, alpha-1 glycoprotein, etc. was not evaluated. Pemetrexed did not appear to influence total platinum plasma clearance (CL p ) and steady state volume of distribution (Vss ),  Nevertheless,  since  cisplatin  is  98%  bound  to  albumin  in  plasma,  there  is  a  concern  that  if pemetrexed  is  also  bound  to  albumin  and  has  a  high  affinity  for  this  protein,  a  displacement  of cisplatin  to  albumin  may  occur  and  lead  to  an  increase  of  cisplatin  exposure  and  toxicity.  The applicant  has  committed  to  evaluate  the  protein  binding  of  pemetrexed  to  individual  principal components of human plasma such as albumin and p-alpha glycoprotein.

Pemetrexed  is  mainly  eliminated  unchanged  renally  by  tubular  secretion  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by glomerular  filtration.  Caution  should  be  used  with  concomitant  administration  of  pemetrexed  and nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.  aminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds,  cyclosporin) or substances  that  are  also  tubularly  secreted  (e.g.  probenecid,  penicillin).  If  necessary,  creatinine clearance should be closely monitored. Adequate warnings have been included in the SPC (see section 4.5).

The fraction excreted unchanged into urine appeared to decrease progressively with severity of renal insufficiency.  Renal  function  is  the  best  predictor  of  overall  systemic  exposure.  Prior  to  each chemotherapy administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal (and hepatic) function. No dosing adjustments are required as long as patients have creatinine clearance of at least 45  ml/min.  Due  to  the  gastrointestinal  toxicity  of  pemetrexed  given  in  combination  with  cisplatin, severe  dehydration  has  been  observed.  Therefore,  when  pemetrexed  is  combined  with  cisplatin, patients  must  receive  adequate  antiemetic  treatment  and  appropriate  hydration  prior  to  and/or  after receiving  cisplatin. There are insufficient  data  on  the  use  of  pemetrexed  in  patients  with  creatinine clearance below 45 ml/min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended. These recommendations  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  SPC  (see  section  4.2).  Overall,  pemetrexed pharmacokinetics  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function  have  been  adequately  investigated,  and reported [78].

Pemetrexed  undergoes  limited  hepatic  metabolism.  Results  from in  vitro studies  with  human  liver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition of  the  metabolic  clearance  of  drugs  metabolised  by  CYP3A,  CYP2D6,  CYP2C9,  and  CYP1A2,  as reflected in the SPC (section 4.5). Enzyme induction studies with pemetrexed have not been carried out. Lack of specific pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic dysfunction has been adequately justified  because pemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion, and metabolism plays a negligible role. No relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed  pharmacokinetics  were  identified.  However  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  such  as bilirubin  &gt; 1.5  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal  and/or  transaminase  &gt; 3.0  times  the  upper  limit  of normal  (hepatic  metastases  absent)  or  &gt; 5.0  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (hepatic  metastases present) have not been specifically studied. This has been reflected in the SPC (see section 4.2).

It is known that the combination of methotrexate with aspirin or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as ibuprofen, decreases the renal clearance of methotrexate, and  consequently,  increases the haematoxicity of methotrexate.

In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg/day) and aspirin at higher dosage (&gt; 1.3  g  daily)  may  decrease  pemetrexed  elimination  and,  consequently,  increase  the  occurrence  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pemetrexed adverse events. Therefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or aspirin at higher dosage, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min). In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) or aspirin at higher dosage should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following  pemetrexed  administration.  In  the  absence  of  data  regarding  potential  interaction  with NSAIDs  having  longer  half-lives  as  piroxicam  or  rofecoxib,  the  concomitant  administration  with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to, on the day, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see SPC section 4.4 and 4.5).

European PK Guidelines recommend to assess the absence of interaction between two drugs indicated to be used in association [79]. Pharmacokinetics analyses of pemetrexed and cisplatin were performed in  the  Phase  I  study  JMAP,  and  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  from  the  phase  III  study JMCH  in  MPM.  No  significant  influence  of  concomitant  cisplatin  administration  on  pemetrexed clearance was observed (data not shown). The pharmacokinetics of total platinum were consistent with published  literature  values  for  single-agent  cisplatin  administration  [80-82].  However,  a  specific analysis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  ultrafilterable  platinum  allowing  to  predict  a  potential interaction between the two agents was lacking.

No  significant  influence  of  folic  acid  or  vitamin  B 12   administration  on  pemetrexed  clearance  was identified (data not shown).

In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed have been adequately investigated and reported, in agreement  with  applicable  guidelines  and  requirements  [60,  83].  Potential  pharmacokinetic  drug interaction have been adequately investigated and reported [79].

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic analyses for pemetrexed focused on exploring relationships between measures of hematologic toxicity (nadirs of neutrophil counts) with indices of systemic drug exposure (Cmax and AUC0-∞ ).  In  8  Phase  2  studies  included  in  the  population  pharmacodynamic  analyses,  pemetrexed was administered as a 10-minute i.v. infusion every 21 days. Initial doses (Cycle 1) were 500 to 600 mg/m 2 . Dose adjustment (reduction) at the start of subsequent courses of therapy were based on nadir counts or maximal nonhematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. The time course of ANC was adequately characterized by a seven-compartment semi-physiologic mechanistic pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic model [84].

Between-patient  variability  was  adequately  characterized  based  on  precision  of  variance  parameter estimates (30.3% with 32.7 %standard error of the estimate, SEE for BAS, 9.85% with 28.7 %SEE for MTT, 45.6% with 29.0 %SEE for the DS parameter, and 27.6%  with 38.4 %SEE for the FP). The 'typical' patient receiving 500 mg/m 2 pemetrexed was predicted to have a nadir absolute neutrophil count (NANC) of 1.77 · 10 9 /L and had approximately 50% probability of remaining at CTC Grade 0 toxicity  (above  2 · 10 9 /L)  following  pemetrexed  administration.  Systemic  drug  exposure  was  the dominant  predictor  of  absolute  neutrophil  response  to  pemetrexed.  Increased  homocysteine  and cystathionine were associated with lower NANC. There appeared to have been no change in the effect of pemetrexed on NANC following multiple treatment cycles.

Gender had no significant effect on absolute neutrophil response to pemetrexed administration. Age (range  26  to  79  years)  had  no  significant  effect  on  absolute  neutrophil  response  to  pemetrexed administration. Caucasians and patients of African descent had similar absolute neutrophil response to pemetrexed administration. Insufficient data were available to generalize for other ethnic groups (for example,  Asian,  Hispanic).  Alcohol  consumption  did  not  affect  absolute  neutrophil  response  to pemetrexed  administration.  Smoking  did  not  affect  absolute  neutrophil  response  to  pemetrexed administration.

## Discussion on pharmacodynamics

Systemic drug exposure was the dominant predictor of absolute neutrophil response to pemetrexed. Dosing  based  on  renal  function  (creatinine  clearance)  has  been  considered.  Safety  results  from  the clinical  studies  (See  Clinical  Safety)  have  shown  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  decreasing  renal function  was  associated  with  increasing  toxicities  when  pemetrexed  was  administered  alone  or  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination  with  cisplatin.  Hence,  no  dosing  adjustments  are  required  as  long  as  patients  have creatinine  clearance  of  at  least  45  ml/min.  A  minimum  CrCl  of  45  ml/min  is  recommended  before pemetrexed  administration  for  all  patients  (including  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  due  to age). Adequate dosing recommendations and warnings have been provided in the SPC (see Section 4.2 and 4.4)

Increased homocysteine and cystathionine, which are predictive of vitamin B 12  and folate deficiency [85,  86],  were  associated  with  lower  nadir  absolute  neutrophil  count  (NANC)  with  pemetrexed.  A correlation between high serum homocysteine and increased risk of Grade 4 neutropenia with Grade 3 or 4 infection, and Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea for pemetrexed has been reported [87]. Exploratory analyses of  study  JMCH  showed  that  overall  Grade  3/4  toxicities  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the  fully supplemented  patients  than  the  non-supplemented  patients  with  statistically  significant  differences occurring  for  leukocytes,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  febrile  neutropenia.  Integrated  safety  analyses  of single-agent pemetrexed showed significanct differences in Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia when supplemented patients are compared with nonsupplemented patients at either 500 or 600 mg/m 2 dose of pemetrexed.

In conclusion, the results from these analyses support the use of vitamin supplementation to ensure normal  vitamin  B 12   and  folate  status  to  control  hematologic  toxicity  secondary  to  pemetrexed administration. Folinic acid and folic acid are both systemically metabolized to active folate cofactors. Folinic acid, or folic acid in high doses, result in supranormal plasma concentrations of active folate cofactors  that  can  cause  the  displacement  of  accumulated  antifolate  compounds  from  tissues. Conversely,  low-dose  folic  acid  supplementation  providing  adequate  pools  of  active  cofactors  in tissues can prevent uptake, polyglutamation and target interaction of antifolates. Low-dose supplementation  has  been  shown  to  reduced  pemetrexed  toxicity  with  preservation  of  pemetrexed antitumor  activity  [88].  Normal  tissues  have  lower  folate  requirements  than  tumor  tissues  [89,  90]. Vitamin supplementation might satisfy the need in normal tissue but not in tumor tissue. This theory might explain how dose limiting toxicity of pemetrexed can be reduced by folic acid while at the same preserving pemetrexed efficacy.

## Clinical efficacy

Dose-finding studies, and the clinical studies submitted to support the demonstration efficacy in the MPM and NSCLC indications are reviewed and discussed separately in the following sections.

## Dose finding studies

## Single-agent pemetrexed

Three  Phase  1  dose-escalation  studies  were  conducted  (JMAA,  JMAB,  BP-001)  The  initially recommended  dose  of  pemetrexed  for  Phase  2  trials  was  600 mg/m 2 on  Day 1  every  21  days  was based on study JMAA [91]. Pemetrexed was administered as a 10-minute i.v. infusion every 21 days over a dose range of 50 to 700 mg/m 2 ,   without folic acid and vitamin B 12  supplementation. The MTD from this dosage regimen was determined to be 600 mg/m 2 . The main dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic fatigue.

Doses of 500 and 600 mg/m 2 were evaluated in a variety of subsequent Phase 2 studies in various solid tumor  types.  However,  toxicities  observed  in  a  Phase  2  colorectal  study  led  to  a  decrease  in  the pemetrexed  dose  to  500 mg/m 2 on  Day  1  every  21  days.  Initial  analyses  using  a  multiple  logistic regression model were able to quantify the relative risk of developing toxicities with pemetrexed and generated a validated clinical hypothesis on ways to improve the safety profile of pemetrexed.  Levels of  pretreatment  total  plasma  homocysteine  and  methylmalonic  acid  significantly  predicted  Grade  4 neutropenia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3/4 diarrhea, and Grade 3/4 mucositis.  Thus, it was postulated that reducing homocysteine levels with folic acid and vitamin B 12  supplementation would reduce severe toxicities. Further prospective trials with vitamin supplementation demonstrated that the pemetrexed safety profile was improved [87].

Study JMAB was a Phase 1 study in patients with various solid tumors of pemetrexed administered as a  bolus  intravenously  every  7  days,  over  a  dose  range  of  10  to  40  mg/m 2 ,   without  folic  acid  and vitamin B 12  supplementation. The MTD was determined to be 30 mg/m 2 . Inability to maintain weekly treatment due to neutropenia limited dose escalation in this study. Study BP001 was a Phase 1 study in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients with various solid tumors of pemetrexed administered as a 10-minute i.v. infusion once a day for 5 consecutive days, followed by 16 days of rest, to complete a 21-day cycle, over a dose range of 0.2  to  5.2  mg/m 2 .  The  MTD  was  determined  to  be  4.0  mg/m 2 ,  with  neutropenia  as  the  most predominant DLT. This dosing regimen was not studied further due to lack of efficacy.

## Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin

H3E-MC-JMAP was a single-center Phase 1 study of pemetrexed and cisplatin on Day 1 every 21 days  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumors  who  could  have  received  prior chemotherapy. The study was extended and additional patients were enrolled in order to collect data regarding  the  administration  of  pemetrexed  on  Day  1  and  cisplatin  on  Day  2.  Pemetrexed  was administered at dose levels ranging from 300 mg/m 2 to 600 mg/m 2 in conjunction with varying dose levels of cisplatin (from 60 mg/m 2 to 100 mg/m 2 ). A total of 54 patients were enrolled in the study and of these 51 patients received study drug. The majority of patients were male and had a Performance Status of 1. In the initial treatment schedule (both pemetrexed and cisplatin administered on Day 1), the  MTD-defining  toxicity  of  CTC  Grade  4  thrombocytopenia  was  at  Dose  Level  6  (600  mg/m 2 pemetrexed and 100 mg/m 2 cisplatin). Dose Level 5 was initially chosen for Phase 2 studies. However, due to toxicities observed in two National Cancer Institute Canada Clinical Trials Group single-agent Phase  2  studies  (H3EMC-JMAO  and  H3E-MC-JMAN),  the  recommended  Phase  2/3  dose  for  this combination became 500 mg/m 2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin. In the study extension segment (pemetrexed  administered  on  Day  1  and  cisplatin  administered  on  Day  2),  the  MTD  and  the recommended Phase 2 dose for the study extension segment is Dose Level 4 (500 mg/m 2 pemetrexed and  75  mg/m 2 cisplatin).  Myelosuppression  was  noted  at  all  dose  levels  and,  in  all  cases,  was considered to be possibly or probably related to study therapy but not dose-related. One study drugrelated death occurred at each of the 2 levels tested in this extended cohort compared with no study drug-related deaths in the original cohort. Thus, the schedule investigated in Cohort 2 - pemetrexed on Day 1 and cisplatin on Day 2 - was concluded to be more toxic. Therefore, the recommended schedule for further studies was administration of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin on Day 1. Of the 51 patients who received study drug, 1 patient experienced a complete response, 14 patients had a partial response, 21 patients had stable disease, and 10 patients had progressive disease as their best response. In  11  patients  with  MPM  evaluable  for  response,  5  partial  responses  were  observed.  Plasma concentration data were collected on 15 patients (10  males and  5 females) in this study. 4 patients received initial treatment schedule and 11 patients received extended treatment schedule. Although the sample  size  was  small,  the  applicant  claimed  that  concomitant  administration  of  pemetrexed  and cisplatin regimen did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics profile of each drug.

H3E-MC-JMAU was a dose-finding Phase 1 study of pemetrexed in combination with carboplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma [92-96].

## Main studies (malignant pleural mesothelioma)

Study  JMCH  ('EMPHACIS'),  was  an  international,  multicenter,  single-blind,  randomized  Phase  3 trial of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin monotherapy in patients with MPM who had received no prior chemotherapeutic regimens [97].

## Patients and methods

- Study participants - eligibility criteria

Patients with histologically proven pleural mesothelioma who were not candidates for curative surgery were  assessed  for  eligibility.  Histological  diagnosis  was  based  on  local  pathology;  however, independent centralized pathology review was carried out on all patients, if feasible.

Eligibility requirements included uni- or bidimensionally measurable disease, age ≥ 18 years with life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks, and a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70, signed informed consent from the patient. Patients were not eligible if they had prior chemotherapy, a second primary malignancy, or brain metastases, or if they were unable to interrupt nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients had to  have  adequate  organ  function  (ANC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L,  platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9 /L,  hemoglobin ≥ 9  g/dL, bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the ULN, alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 times the ULN, or ≤ 5 times the ULN if there was tumor involvement in the liver, albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL, CrCl ≥ 45 ml/min by using

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the lean body mass formula only) [98]. Patients with reproductive potential must have been using an approved contraceptive method if appropriate during and for 3 months after the study.

## · Treatments

Pemetrexed  was  administered  i.v.  at  500  mg/m 2 over  10  minutes,  followed  30  minutes  later  by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 i.v. over 2 hours on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Patients assigned to the cisplatin arm were  treated  likewise,  except  normal  saline  was  given  in  the  place  of  pemetrexed  at  equivalent volume. For both arms a regimen was defined as six cycles of therapy. In response to an unacceptable level  of  toxicity  (particularly  Grade  4  neutropenia  with  Grade  3  or  4  infection,  and  Grade  3  or  4 diarrhea)  and  pemetrexed-related  death,  the  applicant  conducted  several  analyses  to  illustrate  the relationship  between  folate  status  and  severe  pemetrexed-related  toxicity  [87].  Using  homocysteine level as a marker for folate deficiency, the applicant showed this marker to be highly correlated with several key toxicities. The applicant then decided, with the guidance of experts in folate metabolism, to  require  all  patients  in  pemetrexed  trials  to  take  folic  acid  and  vitamin  B12  for  supplementation (JMCH protocol amendment C). Folic acid 350 to 1,000 µ g was taken orally daily beginning 1 to 3 weeks before the first chemotherapy doses, continued throughout study and for 1 to 3 weeks after the patient  discontinued  the  treatment.  Vitamin  B12  1,000 µ g  was  given  intramuscularly  1  to  3  weeks before the first dose of study therapy and repeated every 9 weeks until the patient discontinued the study  therapy.  In  addition,  based  on  the  early  clinical  experience  with  pemetrexed  and  reported cutaneous toxicity, dexamethasone was chosen as primary prophylaxis for skin rash. Dexamethasone (4 mg orally twice a day) was given the day before, day of, and day after pemetrexed dosing to reduce the risk of severe skin rash. Both vitamin supplementation and dexamethasone were given to patients in both arms to maintain patient blinding to study therapy. Other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or hormonal therapy was not permitted. Supportive care therapies were allowed per protocol during the study.

Dose adjustments for hematologic toxicity were based on a stepwise reduction schedule. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis, diarrhea requiring hospitalization, or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic effects also resulted in dose reduction for subsequent doses. Dose escalations were not allowed.

## · Objectives / Endpoints

The primary objective of this study was to compare survival in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural  mesothelioma  (MPM)  when  treated  with  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  combination  therapy  to survival in the same patient population when treated with cisplatin alone. Survival was defined as the time from randomization to time of death from any cause.

The  secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  tumor  response  rate,  duration  of  response,  time  to progressive  disease,  time  to  treatment  failure  between  treatment  arms.  The  response  criteria  were define  using  a  combination  of  modified  Southwest  Oncology  Group  (SWOG)  [99]  criteria  and RECIST  [100]  response  criteria,  for  bidimensionally  and  unidimensionally  measurable  lesions, respectively. A responder was defined as any patient who had a complete response (CR) or a partial response  (PR).  All  responses  were  documented  by  using  appropriate  diagnostic  tests  that  were repeated approximately  every  6 weeks  to continue evaluation using consistent  methods  and independent response review. The duration of response was defined as the time from first objective assessment of response to disease progression, or death because of any cause.

Other  secondary  endpoints  were  clinical  benefit  (CB)  response  rate  was  evaluated  by  using  an algorithm of performance status, analgesic consumption, patient-reported pain intensity, and dyspnea. Lung  Cancer  Symptom  Scale  (LCSS),  pulmonary  function  test  scores  (forced  vital  capacity,  vital capacity,  forced  expiratory  volume),  lung  density,  toxicity.  Additional  secondary  objectives  of  this study were to assess toxicity between patients who  received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation and patients who did not, to assess PK effects, and to collect information regarding vitamin deficiency markers (homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, cystathionine)

## · Sample size and Interim analysis

The sample size indicated in the first protocol is 150 total patients (75 per treatment arm) with tumour response as primary endpoint. Thereafter, prior to enrollment of the first patient, the primary endpoint was  amended  to  overall  survival.  The  sample  size  was  changed  to  ensure  80%  power  to  detect  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hazard ratio of .67 (a 33% reduction in the hazard ratio) based on a two-sided log rank test ( α = 0.05). The number of deaths required is 197, and an enrolment of 280 patients (140 patients per arm) was planned.  Supplementation  was  implemented  after  118  patients  had  been  randomized,  of  these  117 were treated. After supplementation was implemented, enrollment was extended to ensure that at least 280  fully  supplemented  (FS)  patients  were  included,  allowing  adequate  power  for  a  secondary subgroup analysis (the population for the interim and final analysis remained the entire population, regardless of supplementation status). For this purpose, two distinct patient groups were defined. One group of patients was classified as FS if they were randomized to a treatment group on or after 02 December 1999. The intent was that these patients would begin supplementation during the baseline period and continue during their entire course of treatment. The second group included patients who were partially supplemented (PS) and who were never supplemented (NS); this group was classified as non supplemented (PS+NS) if they were randomized to a treatment group before 02 December 1999.

A prospectively planned interim analysis of survival was conducted and presented on 23 July 2001 to the  Data  Monitoring  Board  (DMB). This analysis was based on 296 patients who received therapy (FS, PS, and NS patients).

## · Randomization

Randomization was dynamically balanced [101] for the following factors: performance status (KPS ≥ 90 v. &lt;90),  degree  of  measurability  of  disease  (unidimensional v. other),  histologic  subtype (epithelial v. other),  baseline  WBC  (WBC ≥ 8.3  10 9 /L v. &lt;8.3  10 9 ),  pain  intensity  at  entry  (baseline score  &lt;20  mm  on  the  visual  analog  scale  of  Question  6  in  the  LCSS  patient  scale v. ≥ 20  mm), analgesic consumption at entry (baseline score &lt;60 mg morphine equivalents per day, only NSAIDs, or  no  analgesic  consumption v. ≥ 60 mg), dyspnea at entry (baseline score &lt;20 mm on the VAS of Question 4 in the LCSS  patient scale v. ≥ 20 mm),  baseline homocysteine  levels (baseline homocysteine ≥ 12 µ mol/L v.&lt;12 µ mol/L), gender, country, and treatment center. It was anticipated that most patients enrolled into study JMCH would be stage III/IV patients. Therefore, stratifying at randomisation for stage I/II versus stage III/IV was not considered useful.

## · Methods of efficacy analyses / statistical analysis

The primary analysis was comparison of survival time between the study arms in the RT population. The RT population was defined as all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm and who started to  receive at  least  one  dose  of  study  therapy.  Differences  were assessed using a two-sided log rank test.  Because  an  interim  analysis  of  efficacy  ( α =  0.01)  was  conducted  (resulting  in  a  decision  to continue the trial to planned completion), the comparison of survival was tested at the α =0.0476 level.

## Results

## · Participant flow and numbers analysed

Study JMCH included 88 investigational sites. The majority of patients enrolled into this study were from the United States, Germany, France, and Australia. Of the 456 patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm, 448 (98.2%) received LY/cis (n=226) or cisplatin monotherapy (n=222) (Figure 1).

These  patients  constitute  the  RT  population.  Treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to baseline characteristics. Patients were predominantly male and white, with a median age of 61 years (range,  19  to  85  years).  Approximately  two  thirds  of  the  patients  had  epithelial  histology,  whereas 78%  had  stage  III  or  stage  IV  disease  (Table  5).  The  most  common  site  of  disease  included  was pleural rind (98.3% in the tested arm and 97.8% in the control arm).

## · Efficacy results

At the cut-off for the primary analysis for survival, the median follow up was 9.3 months (range 0.129.2 months). The median overall survival time was 12.1 months versus 9.3 months, for pemetrexed/cisplatin versus cisplatin,  respectively  in  the  RT  population.  A  statistically  significant difference in the distribution of survival times was observed abetween the two treatments (log-rank P =0.020).

Cox regression  was  used  to  perform  a  secondary  analysis  of  survival  time,  adjusting  for  important prognostic  factors.  As  per  protocol,  14  baseline  variables  were  considered  as  potential  prognostic factors.  After  model  selection  based  on  likelihood  testing,  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect was shown ( P =0.002). Other factors significantly ( P &lt;0.05) associated with increased survival time were supplementation (fully or partially), good KPS (KPS 90 or 100), early disease stage (stage I or II), and epithelial histological subtype. Baseline factors associated with decreased survival time were elevated  WBC,  and  elevated  cystathionine.  No  important  association  between  homocysteine  and survival was observed. The size of the treatment effect was consistent across levels of homocysteine (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.46-1.15 and 0.65 95%CI: 0.49-0.87, for the ≥ 12 µ mol/L and &lt;12 µ mol/L groups, respectively).

Efficacy results for primary and selected secondary analyses are summarised in Table 6 and Figure 2. Two  assessments  of  tumor  response  rate  were  conducted,  one  on  the  basis  of  the  investigators' determination  and  the  second  on  the  basis  of  an  independent  peer  review.  The  results  of  the investigator  assessment  are  consistent  with  those  for  the  independent  reviewer  assessment.  The median duration of response for responders in the RT population (n=130) was 5.75 versus 4.7 months, for pemetrexed+cisplatin v. cisplatin, respectively. The duration of investigator-determined responses was used for this analysis.

The analysis of individual parameters and especially for dyspnea and pain, showed that dyspnea was relatively unchanged in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm, but increased in the cisplatin alone arm. This difference reached statistical significance at Cycle 6 in the RT population. A similar pattern was also seen in the FS groups. Pain decreased in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm and increased in the cisplatin alone arm. From Cycle 3 through Cycle 6, scores were significantly different. A similar pattern was seen in the FS subgroup, although differences in scores did not reach statistical significance between arms.  In  the  PS+NS  subgroup,  the  cisplatin  alone  arm  had  a  greater  increase  in  pain  with  scores statistically  different  from  the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  arm  at  Cycles  4  and  5.  Concerning  pulmonary function test, for each parameter (SVC, FVC, and FEV1), averaging over the entire treatment period, the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  arm  had  statistically  significantly  greater  pulmonary  function  for  all  three parameters.

## Supportive studies (malignant pleural mesothelioma)

H3E-MC-JMDR was a Phase  2  study  of  single-agent  pemetrexed  in  patients  with  MPM  who  had received  no  prior  chemotherapeutic  pemetrexed  [102,  103].  Pemetrexed  was  administered  as  a  10minute  i.v.  infusion  at  500  mg/m 2 on  Day  1  of  a  21-day  period.  Prophylactic  dexamethasone  was administered.  In  order  to  improve  patient  safety  the  applicant  amended  the  study  protocol  to  add supplementation  with  low-dose  folic  acid  (350 µ g  to  1000 µ g)  and  vitamin  B12  (1000 µ g).  As  a consequence,  the  protocol-specified  sample  size  was  increased  from  41  to  61  qualified  patients.  A total of 64 patients were enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of the study drug. The median age of patients enrolled was 65 years, and 82.8% of the patients were male. Most patients had a  Karnofsky  Performance  Status  of  90,  a  diagnosis  of  epitheloid  pleural  mesothelioma,  and  either stage III or stage IV disease. According to investigator assessment the overall tumor response rate was 9 / 64 (14.1% 95% CI: 6.6% to 25.0%), with 7 responders among patients who were enrolled in the study and assigned to receive low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12. The response rate was 17.9% (95% CI  8.9%,  30.4%),  according  to  independent  response  review.  Supplemented  patients  completed  a median of 6 cycles of therapy, compared with a  median of 2 cycles for nonsupplemented  patients. Fever and leukopenia were the most commonly reported adverse events that led to reduction in the dose of pemetrexed. Supplementation was associated with less severe hematologic toxicity, particularly  a  lower  incidence  of  Grade  4  neutropenia  and  leukopenia.  Furthermore  the  trend suggested that supplementation may be associated with some improvement in Grade 3 and Grade 4 nonlaboratory toxicity.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy in MPM

The MPM indication is supported by one phase III study, JMCH. This study was the first large trial performed in MPM which included more than 400 patients. The observed hazard ratio of 0.77, and a median difference in survival of 2.8 months in favour of pemetrexed in addition to cisplatin is of great clinical  relevance  in  a  disease  for  which  currently  no  life  prolonging  treatment  is  known.  In  the subgroup of fully supplemented patients, the survival advantage was equally relevant. The effect of pemetrexed on survival can be explained by its outstanding antineoplastic activity against malignant mesothelial  tumours  when  added  to  cisplatin.  The  effect  was  consistent  across  secondary  efficacy endpoints such as objective response rate and progression-free survival. The effect was comparable across subgroups with different supplementation status.

The  primary  objective  of  this  study,  overall  survival,  is  adequate  in  such  a  disease  when  expected overall survival is short. Concerning secondary objectives, the difficulties with assessing response and progression objectively are well known in this disease. The sample size is adequately justified after the protocol amendment requiring vitamin supplementation.

Baseline patient characteristics reflect what one would expect in the general MPM population i.e. most patients are male, had epithelial histology, a pleural mesothelioma localisation, and stage III or IV for their disease. The dynamic randomisation used was efficient in balancing the marginal distribution of important prognostic factors between treatment arms.

The  conduct  of  the  trial  was  complex,  with  several  protocol  amendments  including  changes  from tumor response rate to a hard primary endpoint of survival, more than doubling of the sample-size due to  the  addition  of  vitamin  supplementation. Although such changes would generally have prompted the conduct of a different trial, in the context of a rare disease such as mesothelioma, once centres recruiting effectively patients with MPM are available, it is acknowledged that to continue with the ongoing trial may have been the most efficient option available.

The population  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  defined  in  the  protocol  included  only  randomised patients  that  had  started  treatment,  a  definition,  which  is  generally  used  for  safety  and  not  primary efficacy analyses. The exclusion of randomized patients from the population for the primary analysis violates  fundamental  statistical  principles  and  cannot  be  considered  an  intent-to-treat  analysis. However, in view of the small number of patients actually excluded, it is unlikely that a re-analysis on all randomized patients would result in radically different conclusions. A re-analysis of the data was therefore not requested but the methodological pitfall was noted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The choice of the control group also required careful consideration. At the time when the study was designed, no established chemotherapy for MPM was available [19]. Concerning agents which had shown  some  activity,  certain  combination  regimens  such  as  with  anthracycline  /  cisplatin  reported better responses rates in phase II trials than single-agent therapy [104, 105]. No randomised trials have clearly  established  the  role  of  combination  regimen  over  single-agent  chemotherapy  (or  indeed  the clinical  benefit  of  single-agent  chemotherapy).  Thus,  the  choice  of  a  single  therapy  rather  than  a combined therapy as comparator is acceptable.

The 75 mg/m 2 every  3  weeks  cisplatin  regimen  was  used  in  place  of  more  intense  cisplatin  dosing (e.g., 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks) in the control arm of trial JMCH. So far no clear dose-response effect has  been  shown  in  for  single-agent  cisplatin  in  the  treatment  of  mesothelioma  [106,  107].  Similar results  were  observed  in  NSCLC  within  a  range  of  of  60  mg/m 2 to  120  mg/m 2 [108,  109].  In conclusion, the choice of control arm in the JMCH trials is acceptable.

The dose of  500 mg/m 2 pemetrexed, in combination with 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin, was selected  because of toxicities  observed in single-agent Phase 2 studies (without vitamin supplementation). It is possible that the 500 mg/m 2 of pemetrexed in combination with 75 mg/m 2 of cisplatin might not be the optimal dose  with  the  addition  of  vitamin  supplementation,  and  further  studies  are  warranted.  For  the  time being,  the  current  dosing  recommendation  as  described  in  the  SPC  are  adequate,  and  are  justified based on the efficacy and safety results from the main phase III trial.

Studies  of  pemetrexed  (without  the  supplementation  of  folic  acid  and  vitamin  B12)  identified myelosuppression  as  the  principal  dose-limiting  toxicity,  although  nonhematologic  toxicities  of mucositis,  diarrhea,  vomiting  and  infection  were  also  significant.  This  toxicity  profile  is  consistent with those of other antifolates. During the trial, toxicities such as Grade 4 neutropenia with Grade 3 or 4 infection, and Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, and pemetrexed-related death in patients receiving pemetrexed resulted in a decision to add folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation in both treatment arms. Folic acid  350  to  1,000 µ g  was  taken  orally  and  Vitamin  B12  1,000 µ g  was  given  intramuscularly.  The supplementation regimen was chosen based on a combination of theoretical, and practical considerations.  From  the  data  obtained  thus  far  in  the  clinical  development  of  pemetrexed,  no definitive  conclusions  can  be  drawn  regarding  the  contribution  of  supplementation  to  efficacy. Concerning safety, since vitamin supplementation considerably improves the toxicity profile, albeit in a  non-randomised  comparison  pragmatically,  it  has  been  proposed  that  all  patients  (regardless  of homocysteine plasma level) might benefit from vitamin supplementation.

There are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed alone. The uncontrolled phase II study JMDR (see Dose finding for MPM) showed that pemetrexed when administered as single agent to patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma has an antitumor activity in the range of such data published for other single agents as cisplatin, doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Most of the patients who responded were fully supplemented. The safety profile was also improved in supplemented  patients  with  a  lower  incidence  of  haematologic  toxicity,  particularly  Grade  3  and Grade 4 neutropenia and leukopenia.

## Main studies (NSCLC)

Study JMEI, was a multi-center, randomized, phase III trial comparing pemetrexed vs docetaxel in previously  treated  patients  with  histologic  or  cytologic  diagnosis  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic (stage III or IV) NSCLC [110].

## Patients and methods

- Study participants - eligibility criteria

The main inclusion criteria were designed to select patients at least 18 years of age with histologic or cytologic  diagnosis  of  NSCLC  with  locally  measurable  and/or  evaluable  advanced  or  metastatic disease  (stage  IIIA,  IIIB  or  IV  at  entry)  that  was  not  amenable  to  curative  therapy,  Eastern Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) performance status of  0  to  2.  Patients  should  have  received previous  treatment  consisting  of  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  neoadjuvant  followed  by  adjuvant chemotherapy  (only  a  single  regimen  was  allowed),  adjuvant  chemotherapy  or  chemotherapy  for advanced  disease.  Patients  were  also  eligible  if  they  had  received  one  chemotherapy  regimen  as neoadjuvant, neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant, or adjuvant chemotherapy and a different

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. Only a single regimen was allowed for prior therapy of advanced  disease.  Patients  had  to  have,  adequate  organ  function  including  the  following:  absolute neutrophil (segmented and bands) count (ANC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L, platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9 /L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, bilirubin ≤ ULN, AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 ULN. CrCl ≥ 45 ml/min using  the  lean  body  mass  formula  only)  [98].  Patients  with  symptomatic  brain  metastases,  or  with presence  of  clinically  detectable  (by  physical  exam)  third-space  fluid  collections  that  cannot  be controlled  by  drainage  or  other  procedures  prior  to  study  entry,  or  with  significant  weight  loss  (ie, ≥ 10%) over the previous 6 weeks before study entry, with prior treatment with either pemetrexed or docetaxel,  CTC  Grade  3  or  4  peripheral  neuropathy  were  not  eligible.  Patients  with  reproductive potential  must  have  been  using  an  approved  contraceptive  method  if  appropriate  during  and  for  3 months  after  the  study.  Females  with  childbearing  potential  must  have  had  a  negative  serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

## · Treatments

Pemetrexed was administered at 500 mg/m 2 as a 10-minute i.v. infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. All Pemetrexed patients were required to take folic acid, vitamin B12, and prophylactic dexamethasone  (4  mg,  orally  BID  on  the  day  before,  the  day  of  and  the  day  after  each  dose  of pemetrexed, unless clinically contraindicated).

No other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal cancer therapy, surgery for cancer, or experimental  medications  (with  the  exception  of  thymidine)  was  permitted  while  the  patients  were receiving  study  therapy.  Palliative  radiation  therapy  was  permitted  for  irradiating  small  areas  of painful metastasis that could not be managed adequately using systemic or local analgesics. Routine use  of  colony-stimulating  factors  (CSFs)  was  not  permitted.  Patients  taking  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or salicylates were not permitted the NSAID or salicylate on the 2 days before, the day of, and the 2 days after receiving pemetrexed. If a patient was taking an NSAID or salicylate  with  a  long  half-life  (for  example,  naproxen,  piroxicam,  diflunisal,  or  nabumetone),  it should  not  have  been  taken  on  the  5  days  before,  the  day  of,  and  the  2  days  after  receiving pemetrexed. Leucovorin was allowed for CTC Grade 4 leukopenia, CTC Grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater than 3 days, or immediately for CTC Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia.

Docetaxel  was  administered  at  75  mg/m 2 as  a  1-hour  i.v.  infusion  on  Day  1  of  a  21-day  cycle. Dexamethasone 16 mg orally, was administered daily (eg, 8 mg BID)  for 3 days starting 1 day prior to  each  dose  of  docetaxel  (or  equivalent  regimen),  unless  clinically  contraindicated,  to  reduced  the severity  of  fluid  retention  and  hypersensitivity  reaction.  The  docetaxel  regimen  was  chosen  as  the active control based on two randomized Phase 3 studies of docetaxel [29, 30].

Antiemetic therapy was to be administered according to standard local practice.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  objective  of  study  JMEI  was  to  show  non-inferiority  in  overall  survival  following treatment  with  pemetrexed  versus  docetaxel  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  (stage IIIA, IIIB or IV) NSCLC who had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Overall survival time was defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, or censoring.

Secondary  endpoints  included  toxicity, progression-free survival,  time  to  documented  disease progression, time to treatment failure, objective tumor response, duration of response, and changes in the average symptom burden index between the pemetrexed and docetaxel arms by using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS). Time-to-event efficacy variables were compared between treatment arms using the Cox proportional hazards model. Tumor response measurement was done according to Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria [99].

## · Sample size and Interim analysis

A sample size of 520 randomized patients was chosen assuming no more than 26% censoring in order to oberve 385 deaths necessary based on consideration of the primary comparison of overall survival between treatment arms using the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment as the only factor. From  the  Cox  model,  a  two  tailed  95%  confidence  interval  for  HR  was  used  to  simultaneously evaluate  the  null  hypotheses  of  HR ≥ 1.00  (pemetrexed  not  superior)  and  HR ≥ 1.11  (pemetrexed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inferior).  This  sample  size  ensured  about  80%  chance  of  demonstrating  statistically  significant superiority of pemetrexed for a true value of HR of 0.75, or noninferiority for a true value of HR of 0.83. Statistical power was calculated using methods developed for the log-rank statistic [111, 112], and using the asymptotic equivalence of the Cox model to one form of the log-rank statistic [113]. No interim analyses of efficacy were planned.

## · Randomization

The algorithm of Pocock and Simon [101], using a probability factor of 0.75, was applied to balance the treatment arms for the following factors: ECOG Performance Status (2 v. 0 or 1), prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy (Yes v. No), prior paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy (Yes v. No), baseline homocysteine level (&lt;12 µ M v. ≥ 12 µ M), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 v. 2), time since last chemotherapy (&lt;3 months v. ≥ 3 months), best response to last prior chemotherapy (CR/PR/SD v. PD or unknown, disease stage (III v. IV), investigational centre.

## · Methods of efficacy analyses / statistical analysis

Noninferiority of PEMETREXED over docetaxel in overall survival was defined by HR &lt;1.11. Prior to unblinding of the trial data, another (secondary) noninferiority criterion was defined in the analysis plan,  whereby  noninferiority  was  defined  by  HR  &lt;1.21.  This  new  margin  was  determined  by  the Rothmann method [114], so as to preserve a study-wide type I error rate of about 0.025 for testing for the  retention  by  pemetrexed  of  50%  of  the  assumed  efficacy  of  docetaxel  over  BSC  in  the  trial population. In terms of HR of docetaxel over BSC this was assumed to be 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.88), based on a previous study [29]. The HR and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for pemetrexed over docetaxel were calculated based on the Cox proportional hazards model with therapy arm as the only variable. From the Cox model, a two-tailed 95% confidence interval for HR was used to evaluate the null hypotheses (the resulting non-inferiority tests can be viewed as one-tailed at the 0.025 level). The primary  analysis  was  conducted  in  the  intent-to-treat  population  (ITT),  defined  as  all  patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm whether or not they received study drug. Secondary analyses for overall survival were performed on patients who were randomized and treated (RT) with at least one cycle of therapy.

## Results

## · Participant flow and numbers analysed

Study  JMEI screened  698  patients  at  135  investigational  sites  in  23  countries.  The  ITT  population consists of 571 patients randomized to either pemetrexed (n=283) or to docetaxel (n=288) (Figure 3) and constitute the ITT population. This includes all randomized patients, except for all patients (n=4) from one centre that was excluded from all analyses of efficacy (and safety) before analysis, because the  investigator  at  this  site  did  not  meet  applicable  regulatory  requirements  for  participating  in  the study.

## · Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 7-8. In order to allow the comparison between the Shepherd trial [29] and study JMEI by the percent retention method, patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics of these two trial have been compared. Age and stage of disease at baseline were similar. In the Shepherd trial, more patients had an ECOG Performance Status 2, more patients had prior chemotherapy (with at least 2 regimens), and fewer responders to prior chemotherapy than when compared with the JMEI study. Also, all patients had prior platinum therapy, and no patients received prior taxane in the Shepherd study.

## · Study outcome

A total of 283 patients on the pemetrexed arm and 288 patients on the docetaxel arm were included in the survival analysis of the ITT population. The median overall survival time for patients treated with pemetrexed was 8.3 months compared with 7.9 months for those treated with docetaxel. The HR was 0.99, (95% CI of 0.82 to 1.20) with a noninferiority P -value of 0.226 for testing HR of &lt;1.11. This means that the noninferiority criteria were not met using the fixed margin method. The estimate of the percentage of survival benefit (docetaxel over BSC) retained by pemetrexed was 102% with the lower 95% CI bound of 52% ( P= 0.047). The results of overall survival time analyses for the RT population were  consistent  with  those  of  the  ITT  population.  Key  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  results  are presented in Table 9-10 and Figure 4-5.

Thirty % of the patients in the pemetrexed arm received docetaxel after failure of pemetrexed therapy. Post  hoc  analyses  of  overall  survival  in  subgroups  of  patients  who  did  not  receive  poststudy chemotherapy, those who received docetaxel poststudy chemotherapy, and those who received other poststudy chemotherapy were performed and summarized in Table 11.  In the pemetrexed arm, the median survival of patients who received poststudy docetaxel was 1.0 months lower than the median survival of patients who received other poststudy chemotherapy.

## Duration of Clinical Benefit

The duration of clinical benefit was defined as the time since randomization to the progressive disease or death for patients who had a CR, PR (measurable or non-measurable disease), or stable disease. A total of 145 patients in the pemetrexed arm and 151 patients in the docetaxel arm were qualified for this analysis. Duration of clinical benefit for patients treated with pemetrexed was similar to that for the docetaxel patients (median time 5.4 months compared with 5.2 months). The HR was 0.91 with the 95% HR CI of 0.71 to 1.16.

## Lung Cancer Symptoms Scale

Compliance was 89.0% (3317 of 3726 of expected questionnaires) for the pemetrexed arm and 85.1% (2995 of 3519 of expected questionnaires) for the docetaxel arm. The most commonly reported reason for not completing the LCSS was failure by the site to administer the questionnaire. Compliance may have been underestimated if patients had discontinued therapy before the end of the 3-week cycle.

A total of 507 randomized patients completed at least the six symptom items of the patient LCSS at baseline. The mean average symptom burden index at baseline for these patients was 27.7 mm with a standard deviation of 16.2 mm. Baseline mean average symptom burden indices for the two treatment arms were not different (27.8 mm for pemetrexed, 27.6 mm for docetaxel).

LCSS data from 227 patients (80.2%) in the pemetrexed arm and 247 (85.8%) in the docetaxel arm were included in average symptom burden index analysis.

Data from 239 patients (84.5%) in the pemetrexed arm and 233 (80.9%) in the docetaxel arm were included in the observer scale analysis. Patients were only included in the analysis if they had data for the baseline period and had data from at least one cycle.

A summary of changes in observer LCSS scores by treatment arm is presented in Table 12.

## Ancillary analyses

A prospectively planned, stepwise Cox regression model of the JMEI survival data was constructed starting with seven of the nine baseline randomization factors (excluding homocysteine and center). Baseline  homocysteine  level  was  excluded  as  one  of  the  factors  because  homocysteine  had  been shown at the time the study was started to be a predictor of toxicity and not of efficacy; a high baseline homocysteine level most clearly distinguished patients with an increased risk of severe hematologic and/or nonhematologic toxicities following treatment with pemetrexed. In addition, the omission of center  from  this  model  (because  of  modeling  difficulties  of  including  135  centers  in  the  model)  is appropriate because the influence of center is always through other risk factors, and the important risk factors  have  all  been  included.    The  stepwise  Cox  procedure  resulted  in  three  significant  cofactors (performance status, stage, and time since last chemotherapy) among the original seven (Table 13). When treatment arm is added to these three significant factors in the model, the survival comparison to the 10% margin very nearly reached statistical significance ( P =0.051; hazard ratio upper confidence bound  of  1.13).  Additionally,  this  adjusted  margin  is  equivalent  to  retaining  at  least  73%  of  the docetaxel survival benefit over BSC. Treatment effect was added to the final model with the above three  significant  factors  to  test  for  any  difference  and  this  analysis  showed  that  there  was  no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival between the treatment groups ( P =0.608).

Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed. No subgroup by treatment interactions was observed with  either  age  or  sex  for  overall  survival  time.  Overall  survival  time  was  similar  between  the treatment arms in the subcategories of age (&lt; 65 yrs., ≥ 65 yrs.) or sex (female, male). No significant prognostic factor (performance status, stage of disease and time since last chemotherapy) by treatment interactions were observed for overall survival.

## Supportive studies (NSCLC)

Study JMBR was a phase 2 study of pemetrexed in second-line treatment of NSCLC. Pemetrexed was administered at 500 mg/m 2 by 10-min i.v. infusion once every 21 days. The investigators concluded

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that pemetrexed has manageable side effects and may be considered to have sufficient activity to be developed further as a first or second-line treatment in NSCLC [115].

The  applicant  also  conducted  two  trials  in  first-line  NSCLC  with  single-agent  pemetrexed  (Study JMAL  and  Study  JMAN)  [116,  117].  Two  additional  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the effectiveness  of  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  combination  therapy  in  first-line  patients  with  NSCLC (Study JMAY and Study JMBZ) [118, 119]. Trials JMBR, JMAL, JMAN, JMAY, and JMBZ were completed before the programmatic addition of folic acid and vitamin B 12  supplementation.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy- NSCLC

The  survival  data  from  trial  H3E-MC-JMEI  failed  the  test  for  non-inferiority  in  the  main  efficacy analysis ( P -value of 0.226 for testing HR of 1.11). The non-inferiority margin of 10% had been chosen according  to  a  Scientific  Advice  of  the  CPMP.  After  model  selection  and  adjustments  for  selected prognostic  factors  (as  secondary  analysis),  this  test  showed  a  borderline  statistical  significance ( P =.051).  Although  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  criterion  was  not  met,  further  analyses  have shown that at least 52% (lower 95% CI) of the (historical) survival benefit of docetaxel over BSC was retained by pemetrexed of the survival benefit of docetaxel over BSC, assuming that a similar effect would have been observed in the population under study, i.e., a hazard ratio survival of docetaxel over BSC 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.88), which corresponded to an observed median survival of 7.0 v 4.6 months. In comparison, a non-inferiority margin of 10% would correspond to a more stringent 78% retention of such an effect. It is noted that this estimates only refer to the subgroup which has received 75  mg/m²  of  docetaxel,  not  those  patients  which  have  received  100  mg/m²  of  docetaxel  [29],  and furthermore  does  not  consider  active  comparators  such  as  vinorelbine  or  ifosfamide  [30].  These considerations weaken the relevance of the proposed noniferiority margin. Adjusted and unadjusted survival  analyses  have  shown  upper  confidence  limits  between  1.13  and  1.20  (depending  on  the analysis).  This  range  corresponds  to  a  worst-case  scenario  of  pemetrexed  retaining  52%  to  73%  of docetaxel's  historical  benefit  over  BSC.  Notably,  this  corresponds  to  at  most  a  16.1  to  3.6  days difference  in  median  survival  from  the  protocol-defined  10%  margin.  Thus,  although  inferiority  of pemetrexed has not formally been excluded, based on the data provided it is still possible to rule out striking differences.

## Clinical safety

## Clinical safety of combination therapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin (MPM studies)

## · Patient exposure

Among all patients in study JMCH, 1066 cycles were administered to patients on the LY/cis arm while 877 cycles were administered to patients on the cisplatin alone arm. In the RT population, a median of six cycles (range: 1 to 12 cycles) was completed on the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm compared with four cycles (range: 1 to 9 cycles) completed on the cisplatin alone arm.

Among FS patients, a median of 6 cycles of therapy was delivered on the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm compared with 4 cycles delivered on the cisplatin alone arm. Concerning vitamin supplementation, in the  pemetrexed/cisplatin arm,  FS  patients  received  a  median  of  6  cycles  compared  with  5  cycles among PS+NS patients, and 2 cycles among NS patients.

Dose  reductions  occurred  more  often  in  the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  arm  (2.6  to  3.4%  of  doses administered) than in the cisplatin-alone arm (0.3% of doses administered). The most common reasons for  dose  reductions  in  the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  arm  were  neutropenia,  diarrhea,  thrombocytopenia, and stomatitis.

Dose delays were reported for 308 (28.9%) cycles on the LY/cis arm, and for 171 (19.5%) cycles on the cisplatin alone arm. Scheduling conflicts (difficulty to schedule the drug infusion due to reasons such as vacation, holiday, delayed lab collection, etc.) constituted the majority of the dosing delays in both groups. The most common clinical causes of delay on both arms were firstly neutropenia, and secondly decreased creatinine renal clearance.

On  the  LY/cis  arm,  the  most  frequent  reason  for  dose  reduction  was  neutropenia,  followed  by diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and stomatitis. On the cisplatin alone arm, 3 (0.3%) dose reductions were reported for neutropenia, hyponatremia, and neurotoxicity.  On both arms, dose reductions occurred most frequently in Cycle 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the FS patients on the LY/cis arm, the most frequent reasons for pemetrexed dose reductions were diarrhea, neutropenia, and stomatitis (each 17.4%).

## · Adverse events

A total of 226 patients on the LY/cis arm and 222 patients on the cisplatin alone arm were qualified for safety analyses. On the LY/cis arm, 223 (98.7%) patients reported at least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE). On the cisplatin alone arm, a total of 218 (98.2%) patients reported at least one TEAE. On both treatment arms, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue were the most commonly reported TEAEs. In addition, on the LY/cis arm, neutropenia and leukopenia were reported for &gt;50% of all patients and significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) than those events reported for the cisplatin alone arm.

Concerning fully supplemented patients, frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been reported  in  &gt; 5 %  of  patients  (RT/FS  population  mesothelioma)  are  summarised  in  Table  14. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in &gt; 1 % and &lt; 5 % (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include: increased AST, ALT, and GGT, infection, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, renal failure, chest pain, and urticaria. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in ≤ 1 % of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include arrhythmia and motor neuropathy.

Among FS patients on the LY/cis arm, there were significantly fewer reports of vomiting, stomatitis, neutropenia, anorexia, and rash than reported by the PS+NS patients (data not shown). This finding suggests that supplementation may have played a role in decreasing the episodes of these toxicities among patients randomized to the LY/cis arm.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In the RT population, there were more SAEs experienced by patients on the LY/cis arm (36.7%) than on  the  cisplatin  alone  arm  (21.6%).  In  the  FS  subgroup,  62/168  (36.9%)  patients  reported  serious adverse events in the LY/cis arm and 34/163 (20.9%) in the cisplatin alone arm.

The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs (among those reported in &gt;2% of patients) in the RT population for the LY/cis arm were nausea (8.4%), vomiting (8.4%) and dehydration (5.8%). The most frequently reported SAEs in the cisplatin alone arm were vomiting (2.3%) and nausea (1.4%). Drugrelated SAEs by supplementation status are summarised in Table 15.

A  total  of  22  deaths  occurred  while  patients  were  on-study  (LY/cis:  14;  cisplatin  alone:  8).  Three deaths on the LY/cis arm were considered to be possibly related to study drug. Febrile neutropenia was present in all 3 cases. Most deaths (eight in the LY/cis arm and three in the cisplatin alone arm) occurred in the first two cycles of therapy or in the 30 days following the last infusion of study drug (five in the LY/cis arm and three in the cisplatin alone arm). The proportion of on-study deaths in the LY/cis  arm  was  lower  in  the  FS  subgroup  (8/168  (4.8%))  compared  to  the  PS+NS  subgroup  (6/58 (10.3%)).

## · Laboratory findings

In  both  arms,  Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was the most commonly reported  hematologic  toxicity.  Grade  3/4  neutropenia  was  more  frequent  among  PS+NS  patients compared with the FS patients (Table 16).

The incidence of CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was significantly more common among PS+NS patients (24/58 (41.4%)) compared with FS (39/168 (23.2%)) patients in the LY/cis arm ( P =0.011).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On the  LY/cis  arm,  CTC  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  occurred  in  125  of  1066  cycles  of  study  drug administered (11.7%). By contrast, only five episodes of CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred among 877 cycles given in the cisplatin alone arm (0.6%). For all parameters, the percent of cycles of Grade 3/4  toxicity  are  higher  among  the  cycles  not  supplemented  when  compared  with  the  supplemented cycles for patients in the LY/cis arm, reaching statistical significance for neutrophils ( P =0.001).

Three  episodes  of  non-haematologic  Grade  4  toxicity  occurred,  all  in  the  LY/cis  arm  (two  CrCl decreased and one GGT). With the exception of 3 patients, all other patients who experienced any CTC Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic laboratory toxicities also received supplementation.

## · Safety in special populations

Patients randomized and treated on the LY/cis treatment arm who were ≥ 65 years of age demonstrated a  significantly greater frequency of nausea ( P =0.008) when compared with patients on the cisplatin alone arm.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No safety data related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions have been reported, with the exception of supplementation.

- Post marketing experience

No post marketing experience data have been available.

## Clinical safety of single-agent therapy with pemetrexed (NSCLC studies)

There were 5 completed clinical trials where single-agent pemetrexed was used along with low-dose folic  acid  and  vitamin  B 12   supplementation.  Of  these  5  clinical  trials,  a  total  of  472  patients  were treated with pemetrexed. The data of the JMEI study are the most relevant to the safety assessment and the primary focus hereafter.

- Safety Measurements and analyses

Patients  were  rated  for  toxicity  prior  to  each  cycle  by  using  the  NCI  CTC  scale  (version  2.0).  All patients who received at least one dose of pemetrexed or docetaxel (RT population) were evaluated for safety except for the patients previously mentioned for the centre excluded from the study.

Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE)  were  defined  as  events  that  first  occurred  or  became worse after baseline. Nonserious, clinically significant adverse events were defined as any nonserious adverse event that caused discontinuation from the study.

## · Patient exposure

A total of 265 patients received at least one dose of pemetrexed and 276 patients received at least one dose of docetaxel. Patients of the both treatment arms completed a median of 4 cycles of therapy: from 1  to  20  cycles  on  pemetrexed,  and  from  1  to  14  on  docetaxel.  A  total  of  90  (34%)  patients  on  the pemetrexed arm and 88 (32%) patients on the docetaxel arm completed at least six cycles of therapy. The  percent  of  planned  dose-intensity  was  98.8%  and  94.4%  for  pemetrexed  and  docetaxel, respectively.

A total of 231 dose delays were reported for patients on the pemetrexed arm and 193 for patients on the docetaxel arm (19.8% and 17.8% of doses administered, respectively). Most of the dose delays on both treatment arms were due to scheduling conflict and not due to study drug toxicity. Decreased CrCl was the second most common reason for dose delay in the pemetrexed arm. Infection was the second most common reason for dose delay in the docetaxel arm.

There were 14 dose reductions (1.2% of doses administered) on the pemetrexed arm compared with 61 (5.6%  of  doses  administered)  on  the  docetaxel  arm  (p&lt;.001).  Neutropenia  and  febrile  neutropenia were the cause of &gt;50% of reductions in the docetaxel arm. No single reason was the main cause of dose reductions in the pemetrexed arm.

- Adverse events

A total of 259 patients on pemetrexed (97.7%) and 272 patients on docetaxel (98.6%) reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The five most commonly reported events in pemetrexed arm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were fatigue (50.2%), anorexia (40%), nausea (37%), dyspnea (31.3%) and anemia (28.7%). The five most  commonly  reported  events  in  the  docetaxel  arm  were  neutropenia  (43.8%),  fatigue  (41.7%), alopecia  (39.1%),  dyspnea  (35.1%)  and  leukopenia  (33.7%).  Neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia, alopecia, leukopenia, myalgia, diarrhoea, arthralgia and neurotoxicity were significantly more frequent for  docetaxel,  whilst  the  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia,  fatigue,  nausea,  increased  transaminases, decreased creatinine clearance, vomiting, constipation and rash was significantly higher for pemetrexed.

Frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been reported in &gt; 5 % of patients are reported in Table 17. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in &gt; 1 % and &lt; 5 % (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, abdominal  pain,  increased  creatinine,  febrile  neutropenia,  infection  without  neutropenia,  allergic reaction/hypersensitivity and erythema multiforme.

Clinically  relevant  CTC  toxicities  that  were  reported  in ≤ 1 %  of  the  patients  that  were  randomly assigned to pemetrexed include supraventricular arrhythmias.

Clinically relevant Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory toxicities were similar between integrated Phase 2 results from three single agent pemetrexed studies (n = 164) and the Phase 3 single agent pemetrexed study  described  above,  with  the  exception  of  neutropenia  (12.8 %  versus  5.3 %,  respectively)  and alanine transaminase elevation (15.2 % versus 1.9 %, respectively). These differences were likely due to  differences  in  the  patient  population,  since  the  Phase  2  studies  included  both  chemonaive  and heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients with pre-existing liver metastases and/or abnormal baseline liver function tests.

Fifty patients on the pemetrexed arm received more than 6 cycles of drug.  In this population a slight cumulative toxicity regarding anemia, lymphopenia, ALAT and fatigue was observed.

## · Serious adverse events and deaths

The five most frequently reported SAE regardless of causality in the pemetrexed arm were pneumonia (6.8%), dyspnea (4.9%), pyrexia (4.5%), anemia (3.8%) and abdominal pain (2.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  five  most  frequently  reported  SAE  regardless  of  causality  in  the  docetaxel  arm  were  febrile neutropenia (11.2%), dyspnea (9.1%), neutropenia (6.2%), pneumonia (5.1%) and pyrexia (3.6%).

The serious drug related AE included febrile neutropenia, anaemia and pyrexia in the pemetrexed arm and febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, anaemia and pyrexia in the docetaxel arm. The incidence of drug related febrile neutropenia and neutropenia was statistically higher in the docetaxel arm.

Among the SAE, one case of serious decreased of creatinine clearance  after  cycle  4  (017-1614),  a grade 3 cytolysis on day 7 cycle 1 (303-3031) and a grade 3 supra-ventricular arrhythmia on day 12 cycle 1 (801-8020) were reported.

Three deaths in the pemetrexed arm and five deaths in the docetaxel arm were considered possibly drug related.

## · ECG findings

Electrocardiographic  data  from  patients  treated  in  the  phase  III  study  JMEI  were  collected.  Two baseline  ECG  recording  were  performed.  One  ECG  recording  was  performed  during  the  peak concentration oif the first pemetrexed infusion. One ECG recording was performed prior to the next cycle.  A  total  of  163  patients  had  evaluable  ECGs.  Five  patients  experienced  a  QTc  prolongation between  30  to  60  msec  at  peak  concentration  of  pemetrexed.  Two  other  patients  experienced  QTc prolongation  from  30  to  60  msec  21  days  after  pemetrexed  infusion,  probably  due  to  electrolyte imbalances.

## · Laboratory findings

The  incidence  of  drug  related  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenia  was  significantly  higher  in  the docetaxel arm (Table 17). Except for neutropenia, the biological toxicity of pemetrexed and docetaxel were not significantly different.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

In combination with cisplatin in patients treated for MPM, the main toxicities are gastrointestinal and haematological. Vitamin supplementation in MPM patients has a favourable effect on global toxicity. Combination  therapy  with  pemetrexed/cisplatin  (MPM  studies)  presented  more  toxicity  and  SAEs, than cisplatin alone in patients treated for malignant pleural mesothelioma, which is expected. In the combination arm, significantly more severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration, and stomatitis were observed. Haematological toxicity of the combination appears acceptable. Grade ¾ neutropenia did  not  present  frequent  clinically  significant  complications  such  as  febrile  neutropenia  and  sepsis. Nausea,  vomiting,  and  fatigue  are  the  most  frequent  non-haematological  toxicity.  The  TEAE  of stomatitis and diarrhea were significantly more frequently reported in the LY/cis arm compared to the cisplatin  arm  alone.  Grade  3  or  4  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  and  stomatitis  were  also  significantly more frequently reported in the LY/cis arm compared to the cisplatin arm alone. The TEAE of rash was significantly more frequently reported in the LY/cis arm compared to the cisplatin arm alone. In 3 cases on the pemetrexed arm, death can be considered as drug-related. All these patients were never supplemented. SAEs with cerebral ischemia, angina pectoris and pulmonary embolism were observed in  the  combination  arm  but  not  in  the  cisplatin  alone  arm.  In  the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  arm,  18/226 patients (8%) compared to 5/222 (2.3%) in the cisplatin alone arm presented depression as TEAEs. This was severe in one case, where depression with suicide attempt led to withdrawal from the study. In  general,  depression  was  not  reported  as  study  drug-  or  procedure-related.  Due  to  the  gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed, the combination pemetrexed + cisplatin significantly increases the risk of dehydration compared to the cisplatin alone and this has been reflected in a warning in section 4.4 of the SPC.

The  safety  profile  of  single-agent  pemetrexed  is  close  to  the  safety  profile  of  docetaxel,  regarding asthenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. The  incidence of drug related febrile neutropenia and neutropenia was significantly higher in the docetaxel arm. Pemetrexed is associated with a slight grade 3/4  hepatotoxicity  and  nephrotoxicity  which  was  not  observed  with  docetaxel  during  study  JMEI. Since  pemetrexed  is  excreted  by  the  kidney,  a  control  of  renal  function  at  baseline  and  before pemetrexed administration is necessary (see SPC section 4.2). Clinically relevant Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory  toxicities  were  similar  between  integrated  Phase  2  results  from  three  single  agent pemetrexed studies (n = 164) and the Phase 3 single agent pemetrexed study, with the exception of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neutropenia  (12.8 %  versus  5.3 %,  respectively)  and  alanine  transaminase  elevation  (15.2 %  versus 1.9 %, respectively). These differences were likely due to differences in the patient population, since the  Phase  2  studies  included  both  chemonaive  and  heavily  pre-treated  breast  cancer  patients  with pre-existing liver metastases and/or abnormal baseline liver function tests.

Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular  accident  and  transient  ischaemic  attack  have  been  uncommonly  reported  during clinical  studies  with  pemetrexed,  usually  when  given  in  combination  with  another  cytotoxic  agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors.  A  full  review  of  cardiovascular,  cerebrovascular  toxicity  and  heart  failure  adverse  event reports, which were reported during ongoing and completed pemetrexed clinical trials was submitted. Among the 128 patients who had cardiovascular events issued of 42 studies in a total of 4963 patients, 30  patients  had  events  that  were  reported  as  related  to  pemetrexed.  Among  these  30  patients  28 myocardial  toxicities  and  8  cerebrovascular  events  were  recorded.  Five  of  these  patients  received monotherapy . These findings are adequately reflected in the SPC, which includes a warning about the risk of cardiovascular event in patients with associated cardiovascular risk factors (see SPC section 4.4 and 4.8).

Six  cases  of  colitis  were  recorded  with  pemetrexed  (5  related,  out  of  7949  patients  included  in  an updated safety database), although 4 occurred prior to the vitamin supplementation. A full review of hepatobiliary adverse event reports during pemetrexed clinical trials was conducted. The hepatotoxicity profile of pemetrexed includes cytolytic hepatitis or cholestatic hepatitis, jaundice and hepatic failure. The incidence of hepatobiliary events seen in pemetrexed clinical trials is 1.5%, with the majority of the events occurring in patients with underlying liver metastases or other pre-existing disease.  Appropriate  dose  modifications  in  case  of  hepatobiliary  disorders  have  been  provided  (see SPC section 4.2). The occurrence of rare cases of hepatitis, potentially serious, with pemetrexed has been noted in the SPC (see section 4.8).

A full  review  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  adverse  event  reportsfrom  pemetrexed  clinical  trials (n=42) was conducted. Among the 92 patients who had skin toxicity related to pemetrexed, 3 cases of urticaria  and  three  cases  of  bullous  toxicity  including  one  case  of  Stevens  Johnson  syndrome  in association  with  cisplatin  were  reported.  To  reduce  the  incidence  and  severity  of  skin  reactions,  a corticosteroid  should  be  given  the  day  prior  to,  on  the  day  of,  and  the  day  after  pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent to 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see SPC section 4.4).

In clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary. ALIMTA is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this group of patients. This has been reflected in the SPC (see section 4.2).

Interactions and conditions relevant for all cytotoxics (oral anticoagulants, Yellow fever vaccine, other live  attenuated  vaccines,  immunosuppression)  are  expected  for  pemetrexed  as  well,  and  adequate contraindications and warnings have been provided in the SPC (see section 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).

Patients  receiving  pemetrexed  should  be  monitored  before  each  dose  with  a  complete  blood  count, including  a  differential  white  cell  count  (WCC)  and  platelet  count.  Prior  to  each  chemotherapy administration blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before the  start  of  any  cycle  of  chemotherapy,  patients  are  required  to  have  the  following:  Absolute Neutrophil  Count  (ANC)  should  be ≥ 1500 cells/mm 3 and  platelets  should  be ≥ 100,000 cells/mm 3 . Creatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min. The total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT  or  SGPT)  should  be ≤ 3 times  upper  limit  of  normal.  Alkaline  phosphatase,  AST  and  ALT ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement (see SPC section 4.2).

Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to  allow  sufficient  time  for  recovery.  Dose  adjustments  for  toxicity  are  adequately  described  in  the SPC (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  effect  of  third  space  fluid,  such  as  pleural  effusion  or  ascites,  on  pemetrexed  is  unknown.  In patients  with  clinically  significant  third  space  fluid,  consideration  should  be  given  to  draining  the effusion prior to pemetrexed administration (see SPC section 4.4).

There  are  no  data  from  the  use  of  pemetrexed  in  pregnant  women  but  pemetrexed,  like  other anti-metabolites,  is  suspected  to  cause  serious  birth  defects  when  administered  during  pregnancy. Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus. Effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed must be used as applicable, and men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment (see also discussion on non-clinical aspects and section 4.6 of the SPC). It is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse effects on the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed therapy (see SPC section 4.6) .

Pemetrexed may cause fatigue and patients should be cautioned against driving or operating machines if this event occurs (see SPC section 4.7).

Reported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be monitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary (see SPC section 4.9).

## 4. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Pemetrexed is a novel multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.

Pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even  more  potent  inhibitors.  Polyglutamation  is  a  time-  and  concentration-dependent  process  that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. In mice on a lowfolate diet, dietary folic acid protected mice from toxicity without negative influence on the efficacy of pemetrexed.

Gastrointestinal and haematotoxicity were the dose-limiting effects in dogs, and the toxicity observed in non-clinical models was predictive of the toxicity observed in clinical studies. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. Pemetrexed was not mutagenic using  the  Ames  test  and  did  not  increase  chromosomal  aberrations  in  the  CHO  cell  assay. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.

Administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate. Pemetrexed should not be used  during  pregnancy  unless  clearly  necessary,  after  a  careful  consideration  of  the  needs  of  the mother and the risk for the foetus. Administration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity suggesting that pemetrexed may impair male fertility.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy

A multicentre, randomised, phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in chemonaive patients  with  malignant  pleural  mesothelioma, has  shown that patients treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin  had  a  clinically  meaningful  2.8-month  median  survival  advantage  over  patients  receiving cisplatin alone. A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus the cisplatin arm alone was demonstrated using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale. Statistically significant differences  in  pulmonary  function  tests  were  also  observed.  The  separation  between  the  treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.

A multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel. Although  non-inferiority  was  not  formally  established,  the  data  submitted  are  robust  enough  to conclude that a clinically significant inferiority of pemetrexed to docetaxel in terms of efficacy in this population is unlikely.

## Safety

The most common side effects when pemetrexed is used in combination with cisplatin are disorders of the blood and lymphatic system, gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, sensory disorders of the nervous system,  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  rash  and  alopecia . Clinically  relevant  CTC  toxicities  that  were reported in &gt; 1 % and &lt; 5 % (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include: increased AST, ALT, and GGT, infection, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, renal failure, chest pain, and urticaria. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in ≤ 1 % of the patients  that  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  cisplatin  and  pemetrexed  include  arrhythmia  and motor neuropathy.

The most common side effects when pemetrexed is used as monotherapy are disorders of the blood and lymphatic system, gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, rash and desquamation. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in &gt; 1 % and &lt; 5 % (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned  to  pemetrexed  include:  sensory  neuropathy,  motor  neuropathy,  abdominal  pain,  increased creatinine,  febrile  neutropenia,  infection  without  neutropenia,  allergic  reaction/hypersensitivity  and erythema multiforme. Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in ≤ 1 % of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include supraventricular arrhythmias.

## Benefit/risk assessment

## Malignant pleural mesothelioma

The MPM indication is supported by one phase III study, JMCH. In this trial, a clinically relevant and statistically  significant  difference  in  survival  was  observed.  The  median  survival  time  for  patients treated with pemetrexed/cisplatin was longer than for patients receiving cisplatin alone: 12.1 months versus  9.3  months.  Consistent  results  were  observed  in  terms  of  secondary  endpoints  and  across relevant  patient  subgroups.  In  terms  of  safety,  pemetrexed  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is,  as expected, more toxic than cisplatin alone. The frequencies of adverse events were lower in the fully supplemented subgroup when compared to the non-supplemented subgroup. The main toxicities are haematological and gastrointestinal, regardless of supplementation and are considered to be manageable. Overall, the benefit/risk profile for pemetrexed is considered favourable in combination with cisplatin for chemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable MPM.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Non-inferiority  of  pemetrexed  over  docetaxel  was  not  formally  established  in  the  primary  efficacy analysis.  Nonetheless,  any  possible  differences  in  efficacy  between  pemetrexed  and  docetaxel  are likely  to  be  marginal.  The  rationale  for  the  vitamin  supplementation  and  the  proposed  dose  are considered acceptable. Altogether, the co-administration of pemetrexed and vitamin supplementation as second line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC reduces the toxicity of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pemetrexed,  particularly  nausea,  vomiting,  grade  III/IV  haematotoxicity  and  infections.  The  safety profile of pemetrexed appears to be manageable, and existing safety concerns have been adequately reported in the SPC.

Overall, the benefit/risk ratio of pemetrexed compared to docetaxel puts the two products on the same line  given  the  fact  that  efficacy  can  be  considered  as  similar  (although  formally  not  ruling  out  the possibility of a marginal loss of efficacy), and given that safety is slightly better.

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  ALIMTA  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for  the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma, and that the benefit/risk ratio of ALIMTA as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or  metastatic  NSCLC  after  prior  chemotherapy  was  favourable,  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation.
