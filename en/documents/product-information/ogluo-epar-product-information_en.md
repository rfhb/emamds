<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ogluo 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Ogluo 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Ogluo 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. Ogluo 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Ogluo 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen Each pre-filled pen contains 0.5 mg glucagon in 0.1 mL. Ogluo 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen Each pre-filled pen contains 1 mg glucagon in 0.2 mL. Ogluo 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Each pre-filled syringe contains 0.5 mg glucagon in 0.1 mL. Ogluo 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Each pre-filled syringe contains 1 mg glucagon in 0.2 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection (injection)

A clear, colourless to pale yellow solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Ogluo is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 years and over with diabetes mellitus.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults and adolescents (≥6 years)

The recommended dose is 1 mg, administrated by subcutaneous injection.

Paediatric population (≥2 to &lt;6 years)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The recommended dose for paediatric patients who weigh less than 25 kg is 0.5 mg administered by subcutaneous injection.
- The recommended dose for paediatric patients who weigh 25 kg or greater is 1 mg administered by subcutaneous injection.

## Time to respond and additional doses

The patient will normally respond within 15 minutes. When the patient has responded to the treatment, give an oral carbohydrate to restore the liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. If the patient does not respond within 15 minutes, an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance. It is recommended that patients are prescribed two Ogluo devices.

## Special populations

## Elderly (≥ 65 years old)

Ogluo can be used in elderly patients. No dose adjustment is required.

Efficacy and safety data are very limited in patients aged 65 years and absent in patients aged 75 and above.

## Renal impairment

Ogluo can be used in patients with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required.

## Hepatic impairment

Ogluo can be used in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required.

## Paediatric population (&lt;2 years)

The safety and efficacy of Ogluo in children aged less than 2 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Ogluo pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe are for subcutaneous injection only.

Patients and their caregivers should be instructed on the signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycaemia. As severe hypoglycaemia requires the help of others to recover, the patient should be instructed to inform those around them about Ogluo and its package leaflet. Ogluo should be administered as soon as possible when severe hypoglycaemia is recognised.

The patient or caregiver should be instructed to read the package leaflet at the time they receive a prescription for Ogluo. The following instructions should be emphasised:

- The foil pouch should not be opened until glucagon needs to be administered.
- The medicinal product should be administered according to the printed instructions on the foil pouch label, carton, or the package leaflet.
- The solution should be visually inspected prior to administration. The solution should appear clear and colourless to pale yellow and be free of particles. If the solution is discoloured or contains particulate matter, the medicinal product should not be used.
- Any clothing covering the injection site should be removed. The injection should be administered in the lower abdomen, outer thigh, or outer upper arm.
- Emergency assistance should be called immediately after administering the dose, even if the patient is not unconsious.
- Each device contains a single dose of glucagon and cannot be reused.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Pheochromocytoma.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Glycogen stores and hypoglycaemia

To prevent relapse of the hypoglycaemia, oral carbohydrates should be given to restore the liver glycogen, when the patient has responded to the treatment.

Glucagon will not be effective in patients whose liver glycogen is depleted. For that reason, glucagon has little or no effect when the patient has been fasting for a prolonged period, or is suffering from adrenal insufficiency, chronic hypoglycaemia, or alcohol induced hypoglycaemia.

Glucagon, unlike adrenaline, has no effect upon muscle phosphorylase and therefore cannot assist in the transference of carbohydrate from the much larger stores of glycogen that are present in the skeletal muscle.

## Insulinoma

In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood glucose. However, glucagon administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycaemia. A patient developing symptoms of hypoglycaemia after a dose of glucagon should be given glucose orally or intravenously.

Caution should also be observed in patients with glucagonoma.

## Recovery time

Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after 20 minutes or more in the pivotal trial.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

## Insulin

Insulin reacts antagonistically towards glucagon.

## Indomethacin

When used with indomethacin, glucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or paradoxically, may even produce hypoglycaemia.

## Warfarin

Glucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

## Beta-blockers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients taking beta-blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse and blood pressure, an increase of which will be temporary because of glucagon's short half-life. The increase in blood pressure and pulse rate may require therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Glucagon does not cross the human placenta barrier. The use of glucagon has been reported in pregnant women with diabetes and no harmful effects are known with respect to the course of pregnancy and the health of the unborn and the neonate. Ogluo can be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Glucagon is cleared from the bloodstream very fast (mainly by the liver) (t1/2= 3-6 minutes); thus the amount excreted in the milk of breast-feeding mothers following treatment of severe hypoglycaemic reactions is expected to be extremely small. As glucagon is degraded in the digestive tract and cannot be absorbed in its intact form, it will not exert any metabolic effect in the child. Ogluo can be used during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Ogluo. Studies in rats have shown that glucagon does not cause impaired fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ogluo has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

After a severe hypoglycaemic event, the patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired; therefore the patient should not drive or operate machinery after a severe hypoglycaemic event until the patient has stabilised.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (30%) and vomiting (16%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Frequencies of adverse reactions considered related to treatment with Ogluo during clinical trials are presented  below.  The  adverse  drug  reactions  are  classified  according  to  the  System  Organ  Class. Frequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); ver y rare (&lt; 1/10,000), and  not  known  (cannot  be  estimated  from  available  data).  Within  each  frequency  group,  adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (43%), vomiting (13%), and headache (5%). Adverse  reactions  are  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  resolved  on  their  own.  No  serious  adverse reactions have been related to glucagon.

Hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  anaphylactic  reactions,  have  been  reported  as  'very  rare' ( &lt; 1/10,000  patients)  with  injectable  glucagon.  These  are  known  medicinal  product  class  effects  of glucagon.

## Paediatric population

The most frequently reported  adverse  reactions  are  nausea  (48%),  vomiting  (19%),  hyperglycaemia (7%), and headache (7%). Hypoglycaemia (42%) was observed in clinical trials but was not considered related to glucagon. The most frequently reported adverse reactions observed by age group are presented below.

## Other special populations

Efficacy and safety data for Ogluo are very limited in patients aged 65 years and absent in patients aged 75 and above, in or pregnant patients, or patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Based upon data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience,the frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment are expected to be the same as in the general population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

If overdose occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of gastro-intestinal tract motility, increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. In case of suspected overdosing, serum potassium may decrease and should be monitored and corrected if needed. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure, use of nonselective α -adrenergic blockade has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure for the short time that control would be needed (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pancreatic hormones, glycogenolytic hormones: H04AA01.

## Mechanism of action

Glucagon is a hyperglycaemic agent that mobilises hepatic glycogen, which is released into the blood as glucose. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for glucagon to produce an anti-hypoglycaemic effect.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

After administration of 1 mg Ogluo in adult patients with diabetes, the mean maximum plasma glucose increase from baseline was 176 mg/dL. After administration, plasma glucose begins to rise as early as 5 minutes. From the time of injection, the mean time to plasma glucose &gt;70 mg/dL or ≥20 mg/dL increase was 14.8 (±5.3) minutes.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Ogluo was evaluated in 132 adult patients aged 18 to 74 years with type 1 diabetes in a multicentre randomised, active-controlled, single-blind, 2-way crossover study. The study involved 2 clinic visits 7 to 28 days apart, with random assignment to receive glucagon 1 mg solution for injection during one session and reconstituted glucagon 1 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection during the other. A total of 127 subjects received an injection of Ogluo and 123 subjects received a glucagon powder and solvent for solution for injection.

The efficacy of glucagon 1 mg solution for injection was compared to reconstituted glucagon 1 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection in subjects who were in a state of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with target plasma glucose less than 3.0 mmol/L (&lt;54 mg/dL). Treatment 'success' was defined as plasma glucose increase from time of glucagon administration to absolute value greater than 3.89 mmol/L (&gt;70 mg/dL) or relative increase of 1.11 mmol/L (≥20 mg/dL) or greater, within 30 minutes after glucagon administration. The proportion of patients who achieved treatment 'success' was 99.2% in the glucagon 1 mg solution for injection group and 100% in the reconstituted glucagon 1 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection group, and the comparison between groups met the prespecified non-inferiority margin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the time of administration, which does not include the preparation time for each medicinal product prior to administration the mean time to treatment 'success' was 14.8 (±5.3) minutes in the glucagon 1 mg solution for injection group and 10.4 (±1.8) minutes in the reconstituted glucagon 1 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection group.

From the time of decision to dose, which includes the preparation time for each medicinal product prior to administration, the mean time to treatment 'success' was 15.6 (±5.2) minutes in the glucagon 1 mg solution for injection group and 12.2 (±2.0) minutes in the reconstituted glucagon 1 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection.

## Paediatric population

Ogluo was evaluated in 31 pediatric patients ages 2 to 18 years (7 patients in the 2-&lt;6, 13 patients in the 6-&lt;12 and 11 patients in the 12-&lt;18 years old group) with T1DM in an open-label, sequential, uncontrolled clinical study. Efficacy was assessed based on increases from Baseline in mean plasma glucose 30 minutes post-dosing. Statistically significant changes from Baseline of 81.4 mg/dL [SD=18.3], 84.2 mg/dL [SD=25.3], and 54.0 mg/dL [SD=27.3] were observed in the 2-&lt; 6 years, 6-&lt;12 years, and 12-&lt; 18 years [1 mg dose] age groups, respectively). Across all 31 subjects the mean time to plasma glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL from baseline was 18.9 minutes.

In paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (2 to &lt;18 years), the mean maximum glucose increase from baseline was 134 mg/dL (2 to &lt;6 years), 145 mg/dL (6 to &lt;12 years), and 123 mg/dL (12 to &lt;18 years).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg Ogluo in adult type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects resulted in a mean glucagon Cmax of 2481.3 pg/mL, tmax of 50 minutes and AUC0-240min of 3454.6 pg*hr/mL.

## Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution was in the range of 137-2425 Liters.

## Metabolism

Glucagon is extensively degraded in liver, kidney, and plasma.

## Elimination

The mean half-life of Ogluo was determined to be 31.9 ± 9.13 minutes.

## Paediatric population

Subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg Ogluo in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus ages 2 to under 6 years resulted in a mean glucagon Cmax of 2 300 pg/mL, tmax of 41 minutes, and AUC0-180min of 138 900 pg/mL*min. Subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg Ogluo in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus ages 6 to under 12 years resulted in a mean Cmax of 1 600 pg/mL, median tmax of 34 minutes and AUC0-180min of 104 700 pg/mL*min. Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg Ogluo in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus ages 12 to less than 18 years resulted in a mean Cmax of 1 900 pg/mL, tmax of 51 minutes AUC0-180min of 134 300 pg/mL*min.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## B. PACKAGE LEAFLET

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ogluo 0.5 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen Ogluo 1 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen glucagon

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Ogluo is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Ogluo
3. How to use Ogluo
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Ogluo
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Ogluo is and what it is used for

Ogluo contains the active substance glucagon, which belongs to a group of medicines called glycogenolytic hormones.

It is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people with diabetes. It is for use in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 years or older.

Ogluo is a ready-to-use, pre-filled pen that contains a single dose of the active substance, glucagon. It is a subcutaneous injection, meaning that the medicine is administered under the skin using a needle.

Glucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas, which has the opposite effect of insulin in the human body. It helps the liver to convert stored sugar in the liver called 'glycogen' into glucose (sugar). Glucose is then released into the blood stream, which makes the blood sugar level rise, reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia.

## Information on hypoglycaemia

Early symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) include:

- sweating
- drowsiness
- dizziness
- sleep disturbances
- palpitation
- anxiety
- tremor
- blurred vision
- hunger
- slurred speech
- depressed mood
- tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue
- irritability
- light-headedness
- abnormal behaviour
- inability to concentrate
- unsteady movement

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- headache
- personality changes

## If not treated, the patient may progress to severe hypoglycemia which can include:

- confusion
- seizures
- unconsciousness
- death

## 2. What you need to know before you use Ogluo

## Important information

- Make sure that you, your family members, people you work with, and close friends know about Ogluo. Tell them that if you show any signs of severe hypoglyecaemia, including confusion, seizures, or unconciousness (pass out) they should use Ogluo straight away. You should always carry Ogluo with you.
- It is important that you or those around you know how to use Ogluo before you need it. Show your family members and others where you keep Ogluo and how to use it. They must act quickly if you become unconscious because if this happens for a period of time, it may be harmful. You, or the person administering Ogluo to you, should follow the instructions in Section 3 of this leaflet: 'How to use Ogluo'.
- It is important that you store Ogluo correctly to make sure that it can be used straight away if you need it. See Section 5 for more information on how to store this medicine properly.

## Do not use Ogluo if:

- You are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in Section 6).
- You have a tumour in your adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Ogluo.

Ogluo may not work properly if:

- You have been fasting or have had low blood sugar levels for a long time
- You have low levels of adrenaline
- You have low blood sugar caused by drinking too much alcohol
- You have a tumour that releases glucagon or insulin

If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after 20 minutes or more in the pivotal trial.

After using Ogluo, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. Take a fastacting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink.

## Children

Ogluo is not recommended for children under 2 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Ogluo

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following medicines can affect the way that Ogluo works:

- Insulin - used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar.
- Indomethacin - used to treat joint pain and stiffness. Indomethacin reduces the effect of glucagon.

Ogluo can affect the way that the following medicines work:

- Warfarin - used to prevent blood clots. Ogluo may increase the blood-thinning effect of warfarin.
- Beta-blockers - used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Ogluo may increase your blood pressure and pulse but this will only last a short time.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ogluo.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you experience very low blood sugar when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, you can use Ogluo.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant.

## Driving and using machines

After a severe hypoglycaemic event your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced, you should wait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off, and you feel better, before driving or using any tools or machines.

## 3. How to use Ogluo

Always use (or give) this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Ogluo is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). It is supplied in a pen. The injector pen contains a measured amount of medicine, so if you follow these instructions, the whole dose is administered.

## Prepare

3. How to use Ogluo
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Ogluo
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Ogluo is and what it is used for

Ogluo contains the active substance glucagon, which belongs to a group of medicines called glycogenolytic hormones.

It is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people with diabetes. It is for use in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 years or older.

Ogluo is a ready-to-use, pre-filled syringe that contains a single dose of the active substance, glucagon. It is a subcutaneous injection, meaning that the medicine is administered under the skin using a needle.

Glucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas, which has the opposite effect of insulin in the human body. It helps the liver to convert stored sugar in the liver called 'glycogen' into glucose (sugar). Glucose is then released into the blood stream, which makes the blood sugar level rise, reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia.

## Information on hypoglycaemia

Early symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) include:

- sweating

- drowsiness

- dizziness

- sleep disturbances

- palpitation

- anxiety

- tremor

- blurred vision

- hunger

- slurred speech

- depressed mood

- tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue

- irritability

- light-headedness

- abnormal behaviour

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- inability to concentrate
- unsteady movement
- headache
- personality changes

## If not treated, the patient may progress to severe hypoglycemia which can include:

- confusion
- seizures
- unconsciousness
- death

## 2. What you need to know before you use Ogluo

## Important information

- Make sure that you, your family members, people you work with, and close friends know about Ogluo. Tell them that if you show any signs of severe hypoglyecaemia, including confusion, seizures, or unconciousness (pass out) they should use Ogluo straight away. You should always carry Ogluo with you.
- It is important that you or those around you know how to use Ogluo before you need it. Show your family members and others where you keep Ogluo and how to use it. They must act quickly if you become unconscious because if this happens for a period of time, it may be harmful. You, or the person administering Ogluo to you, should follow the instructions in Section 3 of this leaflet: 'How to use Ogluo'.
- It is important that you store Ogluo correctly to make sure that it can be used straight away if you need it. See Section 5 for more information on how to store this medicine properly.

## Do not use Ogluo if:

- You are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in Section 6).
- You have a tumour in your adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Ogluo.

Ogluo may not work properly if:

- You have been fasting or have had low blood sugar levels for a long time
- You have low levels of adrenaline
- You have low blood sugar caused by drinking too much alcohol
- You have a tumour that releases glucagon or insulin

If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after 20 minutes or more in the pivotal trial.

After using Ogluo, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. Take a fastacting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink.

## Children

Ogluo is not recommended for children under 2 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Ogluo

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

The following medicines can affect the way that Ogluo works:

- Insulin - used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar.
- Indomethacin - used to treat joint pain and stiffness. Indomethacin reduces the effect of glucagon.

Ogluo can affect the way that the following medicines work:

- Warfarin - used to prevent blood clots. Ogluo may increase the blood-thinning effect of warfarin.
- Beta-blockers - used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Ogluo may increase your blood pressure and pulse but this will only last a short time.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ogluo.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you experience very low blood sugar when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, you can use Ogluo.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant.

## Driving and using machines

After a severe hypoglycaemic event your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced, you should wait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off, and you feel better, before driving or using any tools or machines.
