Sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) were updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the SmPC to reflect the latest version of the Quality Review of Data (QRD) template. Furthermore, the MAH updated the PL in agreement with the results of the User Testing.

Fanconi syndrome is already included in section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the SmPC of both cidofovir and tenofovir. However, as reports have illustrated, concomitant exposure to these compounds is expected to lead to cumulative toxicity. Therefore, a warning regarding the increased risk of Fanconi syndrome with the concomitant use of cidofovir and tenofovir was |

| II/0029 | To update section 4.8 of SPC to include diarrhoea as a common adverse reaction. Section 4 of the PL was updated accordingly. The MAH took the opportunity of this variation to reinsert into section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet a statement concerning barrier contraceptive in men, that was removed by mistake. Furthermore, product information was updated in accordance with version 7.2 of the QRD template Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 24/09/2009         | 23/10/2009 no | SmPC, Labelling and PL longer | The safety data submitted by the MAH was based on a review made by the MAH. Nineteen cases of spontaneous reports of diarrhoea had been received. In one case the aetiology of diarrhoea was due to a viral infection; in one case diarrhoea was primarily attributed to administration of probenecid. Most of the cases described patients who were severely ill and were receiving multiple treatments that included cidofovir. Some cases reported patients with medical history of diarrhoea. For these cases, as well as for the cases where no more likely aetiology was identified, a role for cidofovir in contributing to the diarrhoea in these patients could not be excluded. Based on these data section 4.8 of SPC was revised to include diarrhoea as a common adverse reaction. authorised |

| II/0021   | To update section 4.8 of the SPC, to be in line with the Guideline of Summary of Product Characteristics and QRD templates. This update is further to a CHMP request during the review of variation II/18. Furthermore, upon CHMP request section 4.5 was updated concerning interactions with probenecid and section 4.8 was revised to include information on the safety profile of probenecid. The MAH took also the opportunity of this variation to rephrase a paragraph of section 4.3 of the SPC. Sections 2 \"Before you use Vistide\" and 4 \"Possible side effects\" of the package leaflet were updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 24/04/2008   | 20/06/2008 no | and PL The MAH has conducted an updated integrated analysis of the safety data from the three pivotal phase II/III studies (GS-93-105, GS-93-106 and GS-93-107). This integrated analysis includes safety data from 247 patients treated with intravenous cidofovir. Data from GS-95-120 and dose response from GS-93-107 have been used as a supplementary source of information. Based on the result of this analysis the product information was updated as follows: \" Headache and chills were introduced as a very common and common adverse reactions respectively \" Vomiting was classified as very common instead of common \" Pneumonia and infection adverse reactions were removed since it was considered to represent background events of HIV patients and not causally related to cidofovir \" Renal failure and Falconi syndrome adverse reactions previously mentioned in the postmarketing reported reactions were included in the table with frequency common and uncommon respectively. This section was completely revised to be in line with Volume 9A, the Guideline of Summary of Product Characteristics and EMEA/QRD template. longer authorised |

| II/0018 | To update the SPC to reflect the most up-to-date safety information, further to the assessment of the renewal. The changes relate to concomitant use of cidofovir with other nephrotoxic agents and the occurrence of Fanconi's syndrome and concomitant use of other NRTIs and probenecid. The PL was updated accordingly. Furthermore, SPC, labelling and PL were updated in accordance with the latest QRD templates. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Medicinal product | 19/07/2007 | 29/08/2007 no longer | Further to the assessment of the renewal, the product information was updated to indicate that the safety of cidofovir has not been evaluated in patients receiving other known potentially nephrotoxic agents such as tenofovir. As cases of Fanconi's syndrome (a kidney disorder which results in decreased reabsorption of electrolytes and nutrients back into the bloodstream) have been reported, it is recommended to discontinue potentially nephrotoxic agents at least 7 days before starting cidofovir. The importance of pre-hydration and the use of probenecid when taking cidofovir was re-emphasised. The warnings section was updated and cidofovir was contraindicated in patients unable to receive probenecid, as the association prevents/reduces nephrotoxicity. The wording regarding administration of cidofovir in renal insufficient/haemodialysis patients was also updated to give guidance to prescribers on how to proceed. The interactions section was updated regarding the concomitant use of other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with probenecid, as patients should be monitored for zidovudine induced haematological toxicity when probenecid is also administered. The product information was also brought in line with the current EMEA quality review of documents templates. |
