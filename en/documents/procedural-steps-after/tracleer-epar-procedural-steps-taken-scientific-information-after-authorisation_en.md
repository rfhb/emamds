| II/0040 | Update of sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the SPC further to the results of a drug-drug interaction study with lopinavir/ritonavir conducted at the request of the CHMP (FUM 043). Information on interaction with other antiretroviral agents is also included. Furthermore, the list of local representatives has been updated in the Package Leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 29/05/2009 | 07/07/2009 | SmPC and PL | At the request of the CHMP, the Marketing Authorisation Holder conducted a drug-drug interaction study between bosentan and lopinavir/ritonavir. Co-administration of Tracleer 125 mg twice daily and lopinavir+ritonavir 400+100mg twice daily during 9.5 days in healthy volunteers, resulted in initial trough plasma concentrations of bosentan that were approximately 48-fold higher than those measured after Tracleer administered alone. On day 9, plasma concentrations of bosentan were approximately 5-fold higher than with Tracleer administered alone. Inhibition by ritonavir of transport protein mediated uptake into hepatocytes and of CYP3A4, thereby reducing the clearance of bosentan, most likely |

When administered concomitantly with lopinavir+ritonavir or other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, the patient's tolerability of Tracleer should be closely monitored with special attention, at the beginning of the initiation phase, to the risk of hypotension and to liver function tests. An increased long-term risk of hepatic toxicity and haematological adverse events cannot be excluded when bosentan is used in combination with antiretroviral medicinal products. After co-administration of Tracleer for 9.5 days, the plasma exposures to lopinavir and ritonavir decreased to a clinically non significant extent (by approximately 14% and 17%, respectively). However, full induction by bosentan might not have been reached and further decrease of protease inhibitors cannot be excluded. Appropriate monitoring of the HIV therapy is recommended. Similar effects would be expected with other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. No specific recommendation can be made with regard to co-administration with other available antiretroviral agents due to the lack of data. It is emphasized that due to a marked hepatotoxicity of nevirapine that could cumulate with bosentan liver toxicity, this combination is not   |

| II/0041 | Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics with regard to the posology in paediatric patients in section 4.2 of the SPC, further to the results of clinical studies and a review of the literature and post-marketing experience. Consequently, sections 4.8 and 5.2 of the SPC were updated. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Annex II was updated with the revised version number of the Risk Management Plan. The Product Information was also updated in line with QRD template and changes to the SPC, Labelling and the Package Leaflet were therefore agreed. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 23/04/2009 | 01/07/2009 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy from Study BREATHE-3, FUTURE-1, a review of the literature and post-marketing experience, the CHMP considered that the information on posology in paediatric PAH patients in section 4.2 was to be updated as follows: \"For paediatric patients aged 2 years or older, the optimal maintenance dose has not been defined in well-controlled studies. However, pediatric pharmacokinetic data have shown that bosentan plasma concentrations in children were on average lower than in adult patients and were not increased by increasing the dose of Tracleer above 2 mg/kg twice daily (see section 5.2). Based on these pharmacokinetic results, higher doses are unlikely to be more effective, and greater adverse event rates cannot formally be excluded in young children if the dose is increased. No clinical study has been conducted to compare the efficacy/safety ratio of 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg twice daily in children. There is only limited clinical experience in paediatric patients under 2 years of age.\" The CHMP also agreed to update sections 4.8 and 5.2 further to the results of these studies.

| One of the main safety concerns with Tracleer is related to the potential teratogenicity that was identified during its preclinical development. Tracleer is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable methods of contraception. Furthermore, due to the induction potential of bosentan on CYP isoenzymes, it has been anticipated that Tracleer may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective.  A total of 57 pregnancies have been reported since Tracleer was introduced on the market, including 53 following a maternal exposure (0.5% of female patients of childbearing potential exposed to bosentan). More than half of cases of maternal exposure were reported with \"no information on birth control\", 'no birth control' or 'inadequate birth control (only hormonal contraception)'. Therefore, it was considered that the information to patients and prescribers about bosentan and pregnancy should be improved.  In sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC, the information on the use in women with childbearing potential was reinforce to highlight the risk of hormonal contraceptive failure due to the pharmacokinetic interaction with Tracleer and the need to use appropriate additional or alternative method of contraception.  Section 4.6 was updated to reinforce that Tracleer is contraindicated during pregnancy and that before the initiation of Tracleer treatment in women of child-bearing potential, the absence of pregnancy should be checked, appropriate advice on reliable methods of contraception   |

However, long-term vital status was recorded for all 235 patients who were treated with bosentan in the two pivotal placebo-controlled trials (AC-052-351 and AC-052-352) and/or their two uncontrolled, open-label extensions. The mean duration of exposure to bosentan was 1.9 years ± 0.7 years; [min : 0.1 ; max : 3.3 years] and patients were observed for a mean of 2.0±0.6 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed as PPH (72%) and were in WHO functional class III (84%). In this total population, Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were 93% and 84% after 1 and 2 years after the start of treatment with Tracleer, respectively. Survival estimates were lower in the subgroup of patients with PAH secondary to systemic sclerosis. The estimates may have been influenced by the initiation of epoprostenol treatment in 43/235 patients. |
