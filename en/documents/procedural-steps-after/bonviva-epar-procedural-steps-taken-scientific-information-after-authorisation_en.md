1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Although the pathophysiology is uncertain, evidence from epidemiological studies suggests an increased risk of atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures with long-term bisphosphonate therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly beyond three to five years of use. The absolute risk of atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal long bone fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) remains very low.

Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information in regards to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) identified in the postmarketing setting. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Erythema Multiforme, and Bullous Dermatitis have been added with a very rare frequency. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to address the request of the QRD group from 30 April2014 to revise the dilution instructions for renally impaired patients in the SmPC and PL of Bondronat 2 mg and 6 mg concentrate for solution for infusion.

It is supported by clinical development program trials and has been confirmed by subsequent studies (including retrospective analyses), literature reviews, and post-marketing surveillance data. Its adverse event profile is as expected for the bisphosphonate (BP) class. The safety profile of IV Bonviva administered every 3 months and of the 150-mg oral tablet administered monthly for PMO has been shown to be consistent with that |

The safety of long-term BP therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is less clear, owing to conflicting study results regarding its possible association with ONJ (osteonecrosis of the jaw), atypical femoral fractures, or esophageal cancer. No cases of ONJ or atypical fracture were reported in the Bonviva trial program over 5 years of treatment. From review of the data on the use of Bonviva in the indication PMO the benefit risk balance remains positive for the use of Bonviva in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established. The CHMP recommends that the renewal be granted with   |

A literature search and search of the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) was also performed. Based on analysis of all safety data generated, the MAH proposed to update sections 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use'and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) with information on anaphylactic reaction/shock. In SmPC section 4.4 of the SmPC of the presentations for intravenus administration a warning and precautions statement was added: Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous ibandronic acid. |

The MAH also took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. In SmPC section 4.8 safety information was added to inform that cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous ibandronic acid. The Package leaflet was amended accordingly. The CHMP also accepted the proposed changes to annex II of the product information, the changes to align with the latest version of the new QRD template (version 8.1) and the SmPC guideline, and editorial and linguistic corrections.   |

In reproductive studies in rats by the oral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility at high daily doses: increased preimplantation losses at dose levels ? 1mg/kg/day. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid decreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day.

| II/0018   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet                                 | 29/05/2009   | 02/07/2009   | SmPC and PL                      | The objective of this Type II variation was to update section 4.8 of the SPC in order to bring it in line with the SPC guideline, to simplify the text as per QRD comments and to change the MedDRA frequency categories for two adverse events. This was done in response to a commitment given as a part of the renewal adopted in December 2008. In study BM16549, from year one to year two, the relationship of flatulence to the study medication has changed from possibly related to unrelated for one patient. The relationship of fatigue has also changed from possibly related to unrelated for one patient Both adverse events did not reach the 1% level at year 2 and have therefore been listed as uncommon. The Product information was revised to reflect this information.   |

However the safety profile of Bonviva is to be closely monitored due to the effects of Bisphosphonates as a class, which are currently being assessed by the CHMP.

Based on the safety profile of Bonviva in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture and considering the requirement of one-yearly PSUR submission, the CHMP recommended one additional renewal for Bonviva.   |

Section 4.1 Treatment of osteoporosis in post menopausal women at increased risk of fracture. (see section 5.1) A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established. Section 5.1.- addition of the paragraphs below: Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family history of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to identify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral fractures, however daily ibandronate appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD T-score < - 3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed. |
