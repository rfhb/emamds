## 1. Introduction

On 17 November 2016, the MAH submitted the completed post-marketing paediatric study P10-129, 'A One-Year Observational Study of Palivizumab in Infants at Risk for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Latin America' in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has been provided.

The  MAH  states,  that  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  this  study  is  consistent  with  the  previously established benefit risk profile of Synagis and does not recommend any changes to the SmPC.

## Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that:

P10-129, 'A One-Year Observational Study of Palivizumab in Infants at Risk for Respiratory Syncytial Virus  Infection  in  Latin  America',  is  a  stand-alone  study  and  does  not  form  part  of  a  development programme.

## 1.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study.

Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) specific for the fusion protein (F-protein) of RSV that has potent neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity against a broad range of RSV isolates. Based on clinical studies in children with chronic lung disease the product was licensed in the US in 1998 and in the EU in 1999. Further studies was subsequently conducted in different patient groups. The currently approved indications are:

SYNAGIS  is  indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:

- Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV season.
- Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the last 6 months.
- Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.'

The pharmaceutical formulationused in the study was the  lyophilized formulation of palivizumab (50 mg and 100 mg).

## 1.3. Clinical aspects

## 1.3.1. Introduction

Synagis  (Pavalizumab)  received  marketing  authorization  through  the  centralised  procedure  in  1999. Synagis was  approved  for the prevention of serious lower-respiratory-tract disease requiring hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:

-children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than six months of age at the onset of the RSV season;

-children  less  than two  years  of  age  and  requiring  treatment  for  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia (BPD) within the last six months;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-children less than two years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD).

## Description

## Methods

## Objective

To describe patterns of palivizumab usage in high risk-infants in Latin America; to estimate the RSV hospitalization  rate  during  a  follow-up  period  of  1  year  after  the  first  dose  and  to  determine  the compliance to prescribed usage of palivizumab.

## Study design

Non interventional, prospective, and multi-center study conducted in 24 sites across 7 Latin American countries: Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador.

## Inclusion Criteria .

Children  with  a  history  of  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia  (BPD),  infants  with  a  history  of  prematurity (less  than  or  equal  to  35  weeks  gestational  age),  or  children  with  hemodynamically  significant congenital heart disease (hsCHD) who received the first dose of palivizumab within 2 weeks prior to the signature of the Informed Consent Form

Written informed consent provided by the child's father, mother or legal Guardian

## Exclusion Criteria

'Children who did not fulfill the indication for palivizumab per local guidelines.'

## Study population:

Four hundred sixty-four (464) subjects were enrolled from February 19, 2011 through September 06, 2012. Six (6) of 464 subjects were excluded due to prior palivizumab administration from prior season, invalid consent, or no follow-up visits were recorded. A total of 458 subjects completed at least one visit.  Three  hundred  and  ninety-seven  (397)  subjects  completed  1  year  follow-up.  Sixty  one  (61) discontinuations were recorded, most of them corresponding to lost to follow-up (n = 43).

## Treatments

## Outcomes/endpoints:

Primary endpoint: The proportion of infants among the study population who were hospitalized for LRTI with a positive laboratory diagnostic test for RSV from respiratory secretions or who died due to RSV infection confirmed by autopsy or clinical history and virologic evidence.

Safety: Spontaneously reported non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) and serious AE through the study period.

## Statistical Methods:

As  this  was  a  descriptive  study,  summary  statistics  are  provided.  The  Safety  Analysis  Set  (SAS) included  all  patients  who  signed  patient  authorization  form  to  participate  in  the  study  and  had  any collected data.

## Results

## Recruitment and Baseline data

Fifty-two percent (52%) of the patients were male and 69% of the patients were Hispanic.

The mean birth weight was 1345 g (SD: 460), and the median gestational age was 31 weeks (range: 23 - 29 weeks). Almost all of the patients in the study were premature (98.2%); 29.2% of patients had BPD, and 10.1% had hsCHD. Prematurity with BPD and/or hsCHD were seen in 33.4%. A total number of 1744 palivizumab doses were administered to 458 subjects. The mean number of doses administered  was  3.8  (SD:  1.26)  doses  per  subject.  Of  the  total  number  of  subjects  studied,  200 subjects  received  5  doses,  66  received  4  doses,  130  received3  doses,  28  received  2  doses  and  34 received a single dose.

## Effectiveness results

Patients received 84% of their expected doses, and 78% (979/1249) of the inter-dose intervals were classified as adherent

A  hundred  and  nineteen  (119)  hospitalizations  were  recorded  in  90  subjects.  Sixty  one  (61) hospitalizations were reported due to lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) in 52 subjects. Of these, 44 had a single episode during the follow-up year, while 7 children had two and 1 child had 3 admissions. In  12  of  61  LRI  hospitalizations,  RSV  was  confirmed  as  the  causative  agent.  Five  (5)  of  the  RSV hospitalizations occurred in 147 subjects enrolled in Colombia where low compliance was reported due to delay inaccess to palivizumab prophylaxis.

## Safety results

A  total  of  1165  adverse  events  were  reported.  One  hundred  and  thirty-five  (135)  adverse  events reported in 102 subjects (22.3%) were described as serious. Of the serious adverse events reported, the most common event (≥ 5% of patients) was bronchiolitis (n = 28, 6.1%). Ninety-two (92) of the 135  serious  adverse  events  (68.1%)  resulted  in  or  prolonged  a  hospital  stay,  29  (21.4%)  were classified by the investigator as clinically relevant, and 11 (8.1%) were life-threatening. None of these serious  adverse  events  were  related  to  palivizumab  administration  as  assessed  by  the  investigator. Three deaths (2.2%) were reported during follow-up. The fatal events were cardiopulmonary arrest, sepsis,  and  hemodynamic  failure,  respectively,  and  none  of  them  were  considered  to  be  related  to prophylaxis with palivizumab or to RSV infection.

## 1.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted 'observational' study is poor. It is impossible from these extremely heterogeneous and limited data in different Latin America countries with different access to Synagis to conclude anything meaningful. Many patients were lost to follow up. There was a high rate of missing data. RSV testing was not done systematically.

However, even with these serious limitations, no new efficacy or safety concerns are identified.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The submitted post-marketing paediatric study P10-129 in accordance with article 46 of the Pediatric Regulation  are  in  agreement  with  the  currently  approved  SMPC  and  no  further  regulatory  action  is deemed necessary.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
