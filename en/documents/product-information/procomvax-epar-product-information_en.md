## Medicinal product no longer authorised ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

PROCOMVAX suspension for injection

Haemophilus b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) from Haemophilus influenzae type b as PRP-OMPC Neisseria meningitidis OMPC (outer membrane protein complex of the B11 strain of Neisseria meningitidis subgroup B) Adsorbed hepatitis B surface antigen produced in recombinant yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in 0.5 ml. For excipent, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection in vial. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications PROCOMVAX is indicated for vaccination against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b and against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in infants 6 weeks to 15 months of age. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Infants born of HBsAg negative mothers should be vaccinated with three 0.5ml doses of PROCOMVAX, ideally at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. If the recommended schedule cannot be followed exactly, the interval between the first two doses should be approximately two months and the interval between the second and third dose should be as close as possible to eight to eleven months. All three doses must be administered to complete the vaccination regimen. Children who receive one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth may be administered PROCOMVAX on the schedule of 2, 4, and 12 -15 months of age. Children not vaccinated according to recommended schedule Vaccination schedules for children not vaccinated according to the recommended schedule should be considered on an individual basis.

## Method of administration

FOR INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Individuals who develop symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after an injection should not receive further injections of the vaccine.

Because of the potential for immune tolerance (impaired ability to respond to subsequent exposure to the PRP antigen) PROCOMVAX is not recommended for use in infants younger than 6 weeks of age.

Medicinal product no longer authorised It has been recommended that immunisation should be delayed during the course of an acute febrile illness. All vaccines can be administered to infants with minor illnesses such as diarrhoea or mild upper-respiratory infection. Infants with moderate or severe febrile illness should only be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use As for any vaccine, adequate treatment provisions, including adrenaline, should be available for immediate use should an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction occur. PROCOMVAX must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. Infants born of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin and Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) at birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series.  The subsequent administration of PROCOMVAX for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied. In infants with bleeding disorders such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, special precautions should be taken against the risk of haematoma following the injection. Since PROCOMVAX has not been studied in persons who have malignancies or are otherwise immunocompromised, the extent of the immune response in such persons is unknown. PROCOMVAX will not protect against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae other than type b or against invasive disease (such as meningitis or sepsis) caused by other microorganisms. PROCOMVAX will not prevent hepatitis caused by other viruses known to infect the liver. Because of a long incubation period for Hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised infection to be present at the time the vaccine is given.  The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in such patients. PROCOMVAX may not induce protective antibody levels immediately following vaccination and may not result in a protective antibody response in all individuals given the vaccine. As reported with Haemophilus b Polysaccharide Vaccine and another Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week after vaccination, prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccines. The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Immunogenicity results from open-labeled studies indicate that PROCOMVAX can be administered concomitantly with DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and whole cell Pertussis vaccine),  OPV (Oral Poliomyelitis vaccine), IPV ( inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine) and Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live) using separate sites and syringes for injectable vaccines. Additionally, limited immunogenicity results from an open-labeled, controlled study indicate that PROCOMVAX may be administered concomitantly with DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis vaccine), using separate sites and syringes for injectable vaccines.

Efficacy of whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines when given concomitantly with PROCOMVAX has not been established in field trials.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Not applicable. For paediatric use only. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not applicable. For paediatric use only. 4.8 Undesirable effects In clinical trials involving the administration of 7,350 doses of PROCOMVAX  to 2,993 healthy infants 6 weeks to 15 months of age, PROCOMVAX  was generally well tolerated. Of these infants, 1,177 were involved in clinical trials in which most received PROCOMVAX concomitantly with other licensed paediatric vaccines. Of these, 1,110 were monitored for both serious and non-serious adverse experiences. The remaining 1,816 infants were involved in trials where PROCOMVAX  was administered concomitantly with either an investigational pneumococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine or an investigational preparation of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine and were under surveillance for serious adverse experiences. Among the 2,993 children given PROCOMVAX, 33 had serious adverse experiences within 14 days of vaccination. None of the serious adverse experiences was judged by the study investigator to be related to this vaccine. In one of these trials, a randomized, multicenter study, 882 infants were assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either PROCOMVAX or Merck Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) (Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine) plus Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age, with the children monitored daily for five days after each injection for local reactions and systemic complaints. Most children received DTP and OPV concomitantly with the first two doses of PROCOMVAX or Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine or Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. Across all three doses of PROCOMVAX, there were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse experiences between PROCOMVAX and the monovalent vaccines Merck PRPOMPC Vaccine and Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. However, the frequency of irritability was statistically higher after all three injections of PROCOMVAX combined and after the first injection of PROCOMVAX compared to the monovalent vaccines. The following local reactions and systemic complaints were reported in ≥ 1.0 % of children within five days after any injection of PROCOMVAX : pain/soreness, erythema, swelling/induration at the injection site; fever (&gt;38.3 °C, rectal equivalent); anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea; irritability, somnolence, crying including unusual high-pitched crying, prolonged crying (&gt;4hrs), and crying not otherwise specified; otitis media. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events was seen with subsequent doses. Post marketing Experience

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group : anti infectious, ATC code : J07CA

PROCOMVAX is a sterile bivalent vaccine made of the antigenic components used in producing Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine and Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. These components are the Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (PRP) that is covalently bound to an outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from recombinant yeast cultures.

The protective efficacy of the components of PROCOMVAX has been established in field trials performed with the monovalent vaccines.

Anti-HBs Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants Not Previously Vaccinated with Hepatitis B Vaccine

In 4 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 1809 infants, approximately 2 months of age, who had not previously received any hepatitis B vaccine. These infants nominally received PROCOMVAX at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised In these studies, 1503 infants had anti-HBs results available following the first 2 doses of PROCOMVAX and 1309 had anti-HBs results available following the third dose of PROCOMVAX. Post-dose 2, 77% to 96% of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs ( ≥ 10 mIU/ml) and the GMTs ranged from 30 mIU/ml to 190 mIU/ml. Post-dose 3, 96 % to 100 % of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs and the GMTs ranged from 897 mIU/ml to 4467 mIU/ml. Anti-HBs Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants Previously Vaccinated with Hepatitis B Vaccine In 4 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 722 infants, approximately 2 months of age, who had previously received a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. These infants nominally received PROCOMVAX at 2-3, 4-5, and 12-15 months of age In these studies, 618 infants had anti-HBs results available following the first 2 doses of PROCOMVAX and 461 had anti-HBs results available following the third dose of PROCOMVAX. Post-dose 2, 93 % to 100 % of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs ( ≥ 10 mIU/ml) and the GMTs ranged from 125 mIU/ml to 417 mIU/ml. Post-dose 3, 98 % to 100 % of infants developed a protective level of anti-HBs and the GMTs ranged from 1509 mIU/ml to 3913 mIU/ml. The duration of the protective effect for hepatitis B in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present and the need for a routine booster dose with hepatitis B-containing vaccines is not yet defined. Anti-PRP Responses to PROCOMVAX in Infants In 6 clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 2000, PROCOMVAX was administered to 2528 infants, approximately 2 months of age, who had not previously received any Hib vaccine. These infants nominally received PROCOMVAX at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. In these studies, 2121 infants had anti-PRP results available following the first 2 doses of PROCOMVAX and 1768 had anti-PRP results available following the third dose of PROCOMVAX. Post-dose 2, 95 % to 99 % of infants developed &gt; 0.15 µg/ml of anti-PRP, a level associated with short-term protection against invasive Hib disease, and the GMTs ranged from 2.5 µg/ml to 4.3 µg/ml. Post-dose 3, 92 % to 99 % of infants developed &gt;1.0 µg/ml of anti-PRP, a level associated with longterm protection against invasive Hib disease, and the GMTs ranged from 7.7 µg/ml to 14.0 µg/ml. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Not applicable.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In this leaflet : 1. What PROCOMVAX is and what it is used for 2. Before you use PROCOMVAX 3. How to use PROCOMVAX 4. Possible side effects 5. Storing PROCOMVAX 6. Further  information PROCOMVAX suspension for injection in vial. Haemophilus b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine. The active substances are: Polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) from Haemophilus influenzae type b as PRP-OMPC 7.5 µg Neisseria meningitidis OMPC (outer membrane protein complex 125 µg of the B11 strain of Neisseria meningitidis subgroup B) Adsorbed hepatitis B surface antigen produced in recombinant yeast cells 5.0 µg ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in 0.5 ml.

PROCOMVAX is indicated to help protect your child against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (infection of brain and spinal cord tissues, infection of the blood, etc.) and against infection of the liver caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus.  The vaccine can be administered in most infants 6 weeks to 15 months of age. 2. BEFORE YOU USE PROCOMVAX

## Do not use PROCOMVAX:

- -if your child is allergic to any component of the vaccine.
- -in infants younger than 6 weeks of age
- -if your child has  fever (vaccination should be delayed).
- -in infants born to HBsAg positive mothers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Take special care with PROCOMVAX:

- -if  your  child  has  bleeding  disorders  such  as  haemophilia  or  thrombocytopenia  ,  special precautions should be taken against the risk of haematoma following injection.
- -if you are a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mother, your infant should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (Recombinant) at birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. The subsequent administration of PROCOMVAX for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied.

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised -as with other similar vaccines, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week after vaccination prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccine. -because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time, it is possible that an individual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in these individuals. Using other vaccines PROCOMVAX can be administered simultaneously with the primary series of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV).  At 12 to 15 months of age, PROCOMVAX may be given simultaneously with Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), or OPV or with a booster dose of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) at 15 months of age in children who received the primary series of DTP. PROCOMVAX  has been administered simultaneously with the primary series of DTaP and enhanced inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to a limited number of infants. No serious vaccine-related side effects were reported. Immune response data are satisfactory for PROCOMVAX but are currently unavailable for DTaP. 3. HOW TO USE PROCOMVAX Infants born of HBsAg negative mothers should be vaccinated with three 0.5 ml doses of PROCOMVAX, ideally at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age. If the recommended schedule cannot be followed exactly, the interval between the first two doses should be approximately two months and the interval between the second and third dose should be as close as possible to eight to eleven months. All three doses must be administered to complete the vaccination regimen. Children who receive one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth may be administered PROCOMVAX on the schedule of 2, 4, and 12 -15 months of age. Children not vaccinated according to recommended schedule Vaccination schedules for children not vaccinated according to the recommended schedule should be considered on an individual basis. PROCOMVAX  must be injected into the muscle of the thigh. Do not inject intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously If you forget to take PROCOMVAX:

Your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Like all medicines, PROCOMVAX can have side effects. PROCOMVAX has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials.  Side effects include injection-site reactions such as pain, soreness, redness, and swelling.  Other side effects include irritability, sleepiness, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of appetite, middle ear infection, and unusual high-pitched crying. Other side effects that may occur rarely and be serious include seizure, febrile seizure, allergic reactions, allergic swelling (angioedema) and certain severe types of rash, injection site nodule.
