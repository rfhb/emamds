## INTRODUCTION

The MAH submitted 1 completed paediatric study W97-225 for Norvir, in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. One other study, R&amp;D/04/110 . (a retrospective patient registry/observational Cohort study in Switzerland comparing lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) is also mentioned. This has not been accessed, but will be discussed in relation to the submission for Kaletra in view of the type of comparisons in this study.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided. In this document the two pediatric studies mentioned above were identified and reviewed in which ritonavir was administered as an antiretroviral agent. The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy demonstrated by these two studies are consistent with the ritonavir product label.

Ritonavir is already approved by the CHMP for the indication of treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Norvir and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

In addition, the following documentation has been included as per the procedural guidance:

Study W97-225: Open-label, Randomized, Dose Ranging Study of Two Different Doses of Ritonavir in Combination with 3TC and d4T in Children Infected with HIV

-  Description
-  Methods

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Objective(s)

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 2 doses of ritonavir in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) and stavudine (d4T, Zerit) in HIV-1 infected children of 6 months to 12 years of age.

- Study design

This was a Phase I/II open-label, randomized study that evaluated two dose levels of ritonavir namely 350 or 400 mg/m 2 in combination with lamivudine and stavudine. Patients were naïve to protease inhibitors and to at least 1 of the 2 nucleoside agents used in the study. Patients were to  remain on their assigned treatment regimen for 24 weeks. After completion of the 24-week treatment  period,  patients  were  eligible  to  continue  therapy  during  a  24-week  extension treatment period.

The revised 1 randomization method used a block size of 2 and provided for a stratified randomization procedure (by the 2 age groups, children between 6 and 24 months and children 2 to 12 years of age). In both cases, the block size was fixed.

- Study population /Sample size

Main inclusion criteria: Participating patients were to be between the ages of 6 months and 12 years with a HIV- 1 infection diagnosis based on a positive ELISA test and with viral loads above 5000 copies/mL. They were protease inhibitor naive, naive to at least 1 of the 2 nucleosides, and showed absence of acute infections requiring treatment.

In total 76 patients from Brazil (out of the 106 screened) were enrolled and randomised; 42 patients were assigned to receive the 350 mg/ m 2 dose , and 34 were assigned to receive the 400 mg/m 2 dose.

Only a subgroup participated in the pharmacokinetic sub-study.

- Treatments

Ritonavir (Norvir, RTV, ABT-538) was supplied by Abbott in oral suspension (80 mg/mL) or in 100 mg capsules. Doses of ritonavir were administered twice each day (approximately 12 hours apart), preferably with food, and could have been given together with stavudine and lamivudine. During the first 7 days of dosing, patients received the standard dose of lamivudine and stavudine along with escalating doses of ritonavir.

Stavudine was supplied in capsules containing 15 or 20 mg of stavudine, and also as a paediatric powder blend yielding a 1 mg/mL concentration following reconstitution. Doses of stavudine did not exceed 40 mg BID and were dependent upon body weight, as follows:

Table 2. Stavudine dosing

Lamivudine was supplied in a syrup formulation with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Doses of lamivudine were always 4 mg/kg BID.

Both lamivudine and stavudine were administered beginning on Day 1 .

Dosage of all study medications was recalculated at each visit. When a patient's weight or body surface area (BSA) changed the new dose was adjusted.

1 Revised after dropping the originally planned 300 mg/m 2 dose group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The patients for PK evaluations were identified at enrolment and underwent additional procedures at the Week 4 visit if they had been receiving the study drugs at the assigned doses for at least 1 week preceding the visit. Patients were required to report to the study site without taking any of the morning's study medication. If patients had taken the medication, they were permitted to return within 3 days for the pharmacokinetic study procedures. Blood sampling was initiated with a pre-dosing sample within 10 minutes of 0800 hours. The 3 drugs were administered simultaneously (with or without food) under the observation of study personnel. Subsequently 1 to 2 ml, blood samples were taken at 09:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 20:00 hours.

Compliance was assessed based on all medication bottles which were returned to the study site at each visit for assessment of the number of solid formulation doses remaining or the amount of liquid formulation remaining, as appropriate. The assessments were recorded in the case report form.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was the time-normalized area under the curve (AUC) through Week 24 for the change from baseline in log10 viral load. Secondary variables included: the number of patients with viral loads below the limit of quantification (LOQ: &lt;400 copies/mL); the time-normalized AUC for the change from baseline in log10 viral load during the extension treatment period from the end of Week 24 to Week 48; the log10 viral loads at each visit and at endpoint; the time-normalized AUCs through Week 24 and through Week 48 for the change from baseline in log CD4 cell count; loge CD4 cell count at each visit and at endpoint; and progression of CDC disease stage.

PK parameters included Cmax, Cmin, predose concentration (C0 or Ctrough), Tmin, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from hour 0 to hour 12 (AUC12), and the apparent clearance (CL/F).

Safety evaluations included analysis of AEs and HIV-related events using COSTART III summarization, and changes from baseline vital signs and laboratory determinations

## · Statistical Methods

The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the comparison of the primary variable for observed cases without retrieved dropouts in the ITT population. Secondary analyses included analyses of completers population with retrieved dropouts, for completers with and without retrieved dropouts, for the PP cohort without retrieved dropouts, and for PP completers without retrieved dropouts. These comparisons were performed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) using randomization group, study center, and group/center interaction as factors. The same cohorts were analyzed for all secondary variables.

[For the handling of dropouts or missing data, the LOCF method was used for assessment of efficacy parameters at endpoint].

In addition, the absolute changes from baseline in viral load and CD4 Cell count at each weekly visit and at endpoint were evaluated with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model included Randomization Group and Study Center as factors tested for main effects and for interaction.

The number of patients with viral loads below the limit of quantification at each study visit was tested with Fisher's exact test to examine possible differences between randomization groups. In addition, a post-hoc analysis was performed on subsets of patients based on the patients' previous treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Patients were classified as naïve to all 3 of the drugs used in the study or naïve to 2 of the 3 drugs used in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study. This subset analysis was performed to determine if a greater proportion of patients who were naïve to all 3 of the drugs used in the study would achieve viral loads below the LOQ. For the purpose of the pharmacokinetic analysis, dose group (two levels) and gender were used as classification factors, while age, body surface area (BSA) and one of two disease factors (baseline CD, cell count or baseline viral load) were used as covariates in the two-way ANCOVA models. In particular, one ANCOVA model included effects for dose group, gender, age, age-bygender interaction (i.e., males and females had separate slopes for age), BSA, and baseline CD4 cell count. The other ANCOVA model included effects for dose group, gender, age, age-bygender interaction, BSA, and baseline viral load (HIV RNA). Additionally, the partial Pearson correlation with classification by dose group was calculated to assess the association between each pharmacokinetic variable and age or BSA. The statistical test of the association was performed under the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the pharmacokinetic variable and either age or BSA.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

The numbers of patients analysed are presented in the following Table. Of  106  patients  screened,  76  were  eligible  to  participate  and  were  assigned  to  treatment according to the randomization list. The first 24-week course of dosing was completed by 35 of 42 patients (83.3%) receiving 350 mg/m 2 and all 34 patients (100%) receiving 400 mg/m 2 . A total of 10 patients (all from the 350 mg/m 2 group) discontinued the study, 7 during the initial 24-week phase and 3 during the 48-week extension. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse event (AE) (5/10 patients, all from the 350 mg/m 2 dose group).

The 2 dose groups were clinically similar in main demographic and disease characteristics. Approximately half of the patients (40/76 patients, 52.6%) was under the age of 6 years (i.e., &lt;72 months). The majority of patients in both groups became HIV-infected through maternal transmission (73/76, 96. 1 %) . Median age at time of diagnosis was 18 months for the 350 mg/m 2 group and 21 months for the 400 mg/m 2 group. Median duration of disease was 33.5 and 39.5 months for the 2 dose groups, respectively.

## Pharmacokinetic Evaluations

A total of 33 patients from the 350 and 400 mg/m 2 dosing groups were enrolled in the PK substudy. All patients participating in the pharmacokinetic evaluation were between the age of 2 and 12 years (range, 2 years, 6 months to 12 years, 9 months). There were 19 patients from the 350 mg/m 2 dose group (Group I) and 14 patients from the 400 mg/m 2 dose group (Group II).

The results for the lower dose level were better than for the higher dose level, although none of these differences achieved statistical significance in the ANCOVA comparison of randomization group. There were some statistically significant site interactions and randomization group-by-site interactions, but due to the limited number of subjects, no further investigation was performed. Results for mean change in viral load (log10 copies/mL) from baseline at each study visit for the ITT and PP analysis cohorts were similar for both dose levels. See the following table.

Similar results were obtained for the number of patients achieving a plasma viral load below the LOQ in the 2 dose groups at each visit. Similar observations were seen for patients when results were analyzed by prior treatment with NRTIs. A greater proportion of patients who were naïve to all 3 of the drugs used in this study achieved viral loads below the LOQ at Week 24 compared to those patients who were naïve to only 2 of the 3 study drugs (total of 57.6% versus 27.0% , respectively).

In all analyses, mean time-normalized AUC for change from baseline in CD4 cell count was higher in the 400 mg/m 2 dose group as compared to the 350 mg/m 2 group. These differences achieved statistical significance for the comparison in the primary analysis cohort (ITT) at Week 48, (p=0.0240) in the ANCOVA comparison of randomized group.

In the secondary analysis cohorts, there were several statistically significant effects in the ANCOVA comparison for randomized group. See the table below.

The reductions in viral load observed in this study are comparable to the 1.5 log10 decrease reported by Thuret et al. 9 The percentage of patients with HIV RNA levels below the LOQ in this study are also comparable to those reported by Thuret et al 9 and Nachman et al 10 . However, these rates are all lower than those reported in studies in HIV-infected adults 7,11 despite the use of more sensitive viral load assays with lower LOQ in the adult studies. As mentioned previously, these lower rates are partly a function of the patients' prior NRTI therapy and vertical transmission of HIV at a time when the immune system is incompetent. This leads to a poor humoral and cellular primary response to HIV, associated higher viral loads in children compared to adults and a more rapid progression to AIDS in children (4.8 years) compared to adults (10.0 years). Like in adults, careful consideration must be given to a patient's previous antiretroviral treatment experience before NRTI therapy is prescribed.

## PK results

The data show, relative ritonavir plasma exposures from the 2 dosing regimens appeared to be similar, probably as a result of relatively high intersubject variability and only a 14% increase in dose from 350 to 400 mg/m 2 . See the following table.

Age and BSA appear to be significant predictors of ritonavir pharmacokinetics when both are included as covariates; however, these factors are highly positively correlated, and results should be interpreted with caution. Gender has no significant effect on steady-state ritonavir pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients. Ritonavir concentrations do not appear to be dependent on disease factors, such as baseline CD4 cell count or baseline HIV RNA. In children older than 2 years of age receiving a dosing regimen of 350 mg/m 2 or 400 mg/m 2 BID, steady-state ritonavir concentrations appear to be similar to those reported in adults at 600 mg BID. Mean Cmin in paediatric patients appeared to be somewhat lower than that noted in adult patients, see the following table.

## · Safety results

A higher percentage of patients in the 350 mg/m 2 group had at least 1 adverse event (34/42, 81.0%) compared with the 400 mg/m 2 group (25/34, 73.5%). While the percentage of patients with at least 1 moderate-to-severe adverse event was higher in the 350 mg/m 2 group (16/42, 3 8. 1 %) compared with the 400 mg/m 2 group (9/34, 26.5%), the percentage with serious adverse events (SAEs) was comparable between the 2 groups (8/42, 19.0% and 7/34, 20.6% , respectively). No death occurred during this study. Five patients (11.9%) in the 350 mg/m 2 group discontinued due to adverse events. Only 1 patient (2.4%, 350 mg/m 2 group) was reported to have a ritonavir dose reduction of study medication due to an adverse event. Adverse events that were considered to be related to study medication mostly involved the digestive system and showed that the 2 (slightly different) dose levels had comparable adverse event profiles. See the following table.

*Adversc events are listed in order of decreasing incidence in the total population.

The overall incidence of HIV related adverse events (e.g. infection, hepatomegaly) was low in this study, with no HIV-related adverse event occurring in more than 2 patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Laboratory  data  analysis  revealed  a  pattern  of  drug  effects  that  are  typical  of  antiretroviral agents  (i.e.,  effects  on  haematological,  hepatic,  and  pancreatic  parameters).  The  analysis revealed no strong trends favouring either dose group. Low red-cell indices tended to be more frequent in the 400 mg/m 2 group.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Ritonavir is generally used at lower doses as PK enhancing PI in the EU and most countries in the world. The provided study in HIV-infected children from 6 months to 12 years of age, the tested  ritonavir therapeutic  dosing regimens  of  350  mg/m 2 or  400  mg/m 2 in  combination  with lamivudine and stavudine demonstrated similar antiviral and immunological results at Week 24 and Week 48. The results are consistent with data from a couple limited published data in the literature and do not raise new safety concerns. Of note, the number of patients younger than 2 years of age remains limited to 9 patients (approx. 12% of the tested population).

## Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The new data with therapeutic doses of ritonavir in combination with two NRTIs (lamivudine and stavudine) from this study in paediatric patients from Brazil add further support to the approved posology for paediatric patients (2 years of age and above) in the EU as mentioned in the Norvir SmPC; the recommended dosage of Norvir solution in children is 350 mg/m² orally twice daily and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily. In this regard there is no need to amend section 4.2 in the SmPC.

## Issues which need Type II variation:

Section 5.1 can be expanded with a brief summary of few lines mentioning the present results at the end of subsection Clinical pharmacodynamic data in a similar fashion as the other brief results in paediatric patients using the therapeutic ritonavir doses.
