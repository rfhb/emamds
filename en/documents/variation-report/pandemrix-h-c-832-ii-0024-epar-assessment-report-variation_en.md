## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisation in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  phase  6  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix H1N1 to reflect newly available results from a study in children aged from 6-35 months (D-PAN-H1N1-008, called 'H1N1-008' in this report ). In  support  of  this  variation  the  MAH  has  submitted  a  synoptic  report  of  day  21  (D21)  safety  and immunogenicity data (HI only) from study H1N1-009. This  variation  has  been  submitted  to  fulfil  the  specific  obligation  SOB  056  for  which  the  MAH committed to provide the post-dose 1 HI immunogenicity data (uncleaned) from this study to CHMP. Further data will be submitted from this study at intervals as committed in the Letter of Undertaking for the pandemic strain variation (PU-017) and described in Annex II to the Opinion. 1.2 Clinical aspects FLU D-PAN H1N1-009 This is  an  on-going    phase  II,  randomised,  open-label,  multicentre  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1 following a homologous prime-boost schedule in children aged 6 to 35 months. The  study  was  initiated  in  September  2009  and  is  ongoing  at  five  study  sites  in  Spain.  The  data provided in the abridged report of 23 October 2009 have a data lock point at 19 October 2009. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH provided an abridged study report that covers the post-dose 1 immunogenicity results (i.e. at D21) after a single dose of 1.9 µg/AS03B (i.e. half the adult dose of HA and of AS03 in 0.25 ml volume) together with data on reactogenicity, AEs and SAEs for the first 51 children enrolled.

The analyses reported thus far were performed on uncleaned data and the primary analysis was done on the total vaccinated cohort for each age stratum and overall. The analysis of immunogenicity was provided as a descriptive analysis of the humoral immune response in children 6 to 35 months of age and also within each age stratum.

## Study design and objectives

## The sequential co-primary objectives are:

- To  evaluate  superiority  in  terms  of  vaccine  homologous  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI) antibody response after a booster dose of Pandemrix administered at 6 months following a twodose primary series with 3.75 µg/AS03A vaccine compared to the response after the first dose.
- To  evaluate  superiority  in  terms  of  vaccine  homologous  haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI) antibody response after a booster dose of Pandemrix administered at 6 months following a twodose primary series with 1.9 µg/AS03B vaccine compared to the response after the first dose.

## The secondary objectives are:

Immunogenicity · To assess HI responses at 21 days after the 1st and the 2nd dose primary vaccinations and after the booster at Month 6 in each vaccine group. · To assess HI GMTs, SCRs, SPRs and SCFs seven days, six months and one year after the booster dose. · To describe the antibody responses in the three age strata used for enrolment in this study. · To describe the neutralising antibodies at each time point in a subset of sera. Safety · To evaluate safety in terms of selected biochemistry safety parameters (ALT, AST, BILI, BUN and CREA) on Day 0, Day 21, Day 42, at Month 6 and Month 6+7 Days. · To evaluate post-primary and post-boost safety and reactogenicity in terms of 7-day solicited local and general symptoms and the 21-day post Dose 1, 62-day post Dose 2 and 30-day post-booster dose unsolicited AEs. · To  describe  medically-attended  events  (MAEs),  adverse  events  of  specific  interest  (AESIs)  or potential Immune-Mediated-Diseases (pIMDs) and SAEs during the whole study period. Exploratory · To evaluate the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response in terms of the expression of T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) markers in a sub-cohort of 60 subjects at each time point. · To describe immunogenicity to any emergent drifted variant from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike  antigen  in  terms  of  HI,  on  Day  0,  Day  21  and  Day  42  in  all  subjects  and  neutralising antibodies on Day 0, Day 21 and Day 42 in a subset of subjects. This analysis will depend on the emergence of such a drifted strain and on the availability of adequate testing reagents. Vaccination was to occur on Day 0 and Day 21 with administration IM into the anterolateral part of the thigh for subjects below 12 months of age at entry and into the deltoid for older children. The study planned to enrol 204 children aged 6 to 35 months with allocation to two parallel vaccine groups  in  a  ratio  of  1:1  (i.e.  to  receive  the  full  3.75 µ g/AS03A  or  half  1.9 µg/AS03B  adult  dose). Subjects  were  to  be  stratified  into  three  age  strata  (6 to 11 months,  12  to  23  months,  and  24  to  35 months) with a ratio of 1:1:1. Enrolment was to occur in three steps: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- o Step 1: Open enrolment of 51 subjects into vaccine group 1.9 µg/AS03B. There were to be 17 enrolled into each age stratum.

Only the data from this phase are currently reported.

The 7-day post-dose 1 reactogenicity was assessed after Step 1 by a GSK internal Safety Review Committee,  who  provided  a  recommendation  to  proceed  with  the  next  recruitment  phase. Therefore, step 2 of the study is currently ongoing.

- o Step  2:  Open-label,  randomised  enrolment  of  102  subjects  in  a  1:1 randomisation  ratio between  vaccine  group  1.9 µ g/AS03B  (completion  of  enrolment)  and  vaccine  group  3.75 µ g/AS03A

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Step 3: Open enrolment of 51 subjects into vaccine group 3.75 µ g/AS03A.

Dosing with the full adult dose will still go ahead and the study protocol remains unchanged at present since the data are limited to only the first 51 subjects. Any change to the protocol would be subject to a variation of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed for Pandemrix.

As was planned, the study enrolled 51 subjects into Step 1, including 17 in each age stratum, all of whom  completed  to  the  post-dose  1  time  point.  Within  each  stratum  the  age  range  covered  that intended by the protocol. The mean age across all strata was 18.9 months for the total vaccinated subjects. The overall malefemale distribution was 60.8% versus 39.2% with the imbalance coming from the 12-23 month and 24-35 month groups and 48/51 were Caucasian. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunogenicity data

The table below summarises the immunogenicity data overall and by age strata.

- At Day 0 only three subjects (all in the 6-11 month stratum) were seropositive and two of these three  were  seroprotected.  It  may  be  that  there  was  some  residual  maternal  antibody  in  these subjects.
- At Day 21, the overall seropositivity rate increased to 100% with an observed GMT of 340. The GMT was numerically lower in the cohort aged 24-35 months.
- At Day 21 the SCR was 100% in the 12-23 and 24-35 month old groups and 94% in the youngest age stratum (6-11 months). The SPR was 100% in all three age strata. The SCF ranged between 44.4 and 76.9.

HI Antibodies against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) Whereas there were only three children seropositive at baseline in this study, all in the age stratum 611 months, the assessor obtained an additional breakdown of responses for these three vs. the other 14 in  the  same  stratum to see whether baseline serostatus interfered with immune responses. Since the data are still blinded the MAH is currently unable to confirm the exact ages of the three children who were seropositive at baseline (i.e. the younger they are the more likely it is that the baseline serostatus may reflect maternal antibody).

The MAH provided four additional tables as shown below. The GMT at D0 and D21 was higher for the three seropositive at D0. The minimum GMT for these three seropositive children increased from 10  to  57,  demonstrating  that  all  three  must  have  had  an  increment  in  HI  antibody  in  response  to vaccination.  At  D21  two  of  the  three  met  the  definition  of  seroconversion,  the  child  who  was  not seroprotected at D0 achieved the required titre and the SCF was much lower for these three compared to the others.

## Clinical safety

The  safety  analysis  was  performed  on  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  of  51  subjects,  for  which  all parents/guardians returned the symptom records.

As shown below, for total and general symptoms the reporting rates were comparable between the 611 and 12-23 month age strata but were lower in the oldest stratum of 24-35 months. In contrast the rates of local symptoms did not show a trend according to age. Only one symptom was of Grade 3 and this was irritability that occurred in a child in the youngest age stratum and lasted for one day.

Pain  at  the  injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  symptom  with  a  mean duration of 2.2 days. Redness and swelling were reported less frequently and with mean durations of 1.9 days and 2.6 days, respectively. Pain was most frequently reported in the 24-35 month age group. The  assessor  considers  that  this  may  simply  reflect  the  superior  ability  of  older  children  to  voice complaints  of  pain  to  their  parents/guardians.  In  contrast,  almost  all  cases  of  redness  and  swelling occurred in the 12-23 month age group. The only case of swelling in the oldest age stratum persisted for 6 days.

The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptom  was  irritability  (mean  duration  1.8  days), followed by loss of appetite (2.1 days), drowsiness (1.3 days) and fever above 37.5°C (1.4 days). The majority  of  these  symptoms  were  considered  to  be  related  to  vaccination.  Solicited  and  unsolicited general  symptoms  most  often  occurred  in  the  youngest  age  stratum  and  least  often  in  the  oldest stratum. No child had a fever above 39 0 C and no child in the 24-35 months stratum had a documented fever. It should be noted then that prophylactic antipyretic medication was not taken in this study and that 12 children received an antipyretic at some time during the 20 days after the dose. Fifty-one unsolicited AEs were reported in 33 subjects and the most frequently reported was upper respiratory tract infection (25%). Two unsolicited AEs were considered to be related to vaccination (diarrhoea and rash), each reported in one subject. Details of the rash were not provided but it was not of Grade 3. The MAH provided additional information on the three cases of  rash reported as unsolicited AEs. These occurred in children aged 18 (M), 20 (M) and 29 (F) months with onset at D17, D1 and D0, respectively.  Two were of Grade 1 and the other has not been graded. Only one rash resulted in a medically-attended  visit  (see  table  below)  and  was  considered  vaccine-related  by  the  investigator. However, it seems that the child has not been withdrawn from the study (at least not at the time of the cut-off for this report). Rash is already included in the SPC. Five unsolicited AEs were Grade 3, including one report of each of pyrexia, gastroenteritis, laryngitis, otitis  media and upper respiratory tract infection, but none was considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination. Nineteen subjects had unsolicited AEs resulting in a medically-attended visit, as shown in the table on the next page.

## No AESI or pIMD were reported up to Day 21

Thus the D21 HI data suggest that a single administration of half the adult dose may be sufficient for healthy  children  in  the  age  group  6-35  months.  In  contrast,  and  as  observed  in  older  children  and adults, the data with the corresponding H5N1 vaccine clearly showed that two half or full adult doses (according to age) were needed to achieve the sort of HI responses reported with a single half adult dose of H1N1v vaccine in study H1N1-009. In this regard the assessor notes that in a published study with half the adult dose of  an adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluad) in children aged 6-35 months the seroprotection rate to the H1N1 seasonal strain after one dose was from 40-65% in various age  sub-groups.  There  are  no  such  data  in  this  age  group  with  the  experimental  AS03-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine that might help put the results into perspective.

The statistical analysis of selected serum biochemistry safety parameters was not available at the time of  finalisation  of the  abridged  study  report.  Based  on  a  review  of  the  available  serum  biochemistry data the MAH reports that no safety signal has been detected Up to D21 there have been no SAEs, no withdrawals due to AEs and no deaths. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment The  abridged  study  report  describes  the  preliminary  safety  and  immunogenicity  results  following vaccination with one half of the adult dose of Pandemrix (i.e. 1.9 µg HA +AS03B) in 51 children aged 6-35 months. The safety and HI immune response data have been reported according to the three predefined age strata with 17 subjects per stratum. Based on the HI data three subjects, all in the 6-11 month age stratum, were seropositive at baseline (two of the three were seroprotected). The most likely (but not the only possible) explanation for their baseline serostatus is the persistence of maternal antibody. Details of the immune responses in this age group for the three seropositive subjects and the 14 seronegative subjects showed that each of these three subjects had a measurable HI response based on the shift in minimum GMT observed and all three were seroprotected at D21. Therefore, if some children in this age group still have some maternal antibody that reacts with H1N1v in HI assays they still show measurable responses to vaccination. The CHMP highlighted that there are currently no established CHMP criteria for the interpretation of immune responses to influenza vaccines in children. It is not likely that HI titres alone can wholly explain the degree of protection observed and it is not proven that a direct extrapolation of criteria from adults to children is possible. Despite these uncertainties, all the 50 children with Day 21 HI data were 'seroprotected', the seroconversion rates were at least 94% and the seroconversion factors were at least 44. The GMT was numerically but not significantly lower in the oldest age stratum but this had no  detectable  effect  on  meeting  the  three  criteria  (SPR,  SCR  and  SCF).  The  reverse  cumulative distributions  by  age  cohort  will  be  provided  and  compared  when  the  MAH  reports  the  D42  data. However,  it  is  clear  from  the  GMTs  that  the  majority  of  children  must  have  achieved  HI  titres considerably in excess of 1:40. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Despite these encouraging HI data the CHMP considers that it would be highly desirable to have the neutralising antibody data available before making a decision on the suitability of a single half-adult dose in this age group. It may be 2-3 months before such data can be generated, by which time it is very likely that the current pandemic wave will be over. Therefore if a decision to allow a single dose now based on HI data is not made then it will likely be too late to affect current practice.

Nevertheless, taking into account the few data available (N=51) and the lack of confirmation of the findings with NA data the Rapporteur is unable to recommend at this time an amendment to the dose recommendations for children aged from 6-35 months. As a result, the current recommendation for 2 x half adult doses administered at least 3 weeks apart should remain.

The safety profile of a single half adult dose of Pandemrix H1N1 appears to be generally comparable with  that  reported  with  Pandemrix  H5N1  in  older  children  (aged  3-9  years)  although  redness  and swelling appeared to be very common in children aged 12-23 months. General symptoms were most often reported in those aged &lt; 12 months but only one (irritability lasting one day) was of Grade 3. In addition,  in  a  population  that  was  not  apparently  given  prophylactic  antipyretic  medication  the  per subject rates of any fever were &lt; 20%, only three had a fever above 38 0 C and none had a fever above 39 0 C. Therefore the tolerability of a single half-adult dose appears to be quite acceptable. Safety data on a second half adult dose are not yet available. Based on the H5N1 data the second dose was not notably more reactogenic than the first dose in children aged 3-5 years. Therefore the decision to allow a single half-dose in children aged 6-35 months would not be driven by any known concerns over the safety of a second dose. Submission of the further data from this study is included in the Specific Obligations and will be dealt with in sequential assessment reports. Finally, the CHMP considers that the plan to administer a full adult dose at D0 and D21 in this study could be difficult to justify based on current evidence. While this would mean a modification of the commitments  made  under  the  PIP  the  CHMP  recommends  that  the  MAH  should  give  urgent consideration to the possibility of dropping the full adult dose administrations in this study. 1.4 Changes to the Product Information The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH. SPC section 4.2 -Posology and method of administration Medicinal product no longer authorised

This section was amended to highlight that the dose recommendations are based on limited data in children aged 6 months to 9 years and that no data is available in children aged less than 6 months and from 10-17 years. Furthermore, the posology sub-sections on children aged from 6 months to 3 years and on children aged 3-9 years has been merged. The combined section states now that 'the available data suggest that administration of 0.25 ml of vaccine (i.e. half of the adult dose) at an elected date and a second dose administered at least three weeks later may be sufficient. There are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of a half dose of Pandemrix (i.e. 1.875 µg HA and half the amount of AS03 adjuvant in 0.25 ml)'.

## SPC section 4.4 -Special warnings and precautions for use

This  section  was  revised  to  reflect  as  in  section  4.2  that    no  or  very  limited  or  limted  safety  and immunogenicity data are  available in  studies  with  Pandemrix  manufactured  with    H1N1  or  H5N1 antigen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SPC section 4.8 - Undesirable effects

A section was added to describe the safety data especially in Children aged 6-35 months from study H1N1-009

## SPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

This section was further revised in line with statements included in sections 4.2 and 4.2 and to include stratified data from study H1N1-009 by age group and serostatus in the proposed table.

The PL was updated accordingly.
