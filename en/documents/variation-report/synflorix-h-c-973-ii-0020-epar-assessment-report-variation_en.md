## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (including septicaemia, meningitis, and bacteraemic pneumonia) and non invasive pneumococcal diseases (such as acute otitis media (AOM), non-bacteraemic pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis) in young children. WHO estimates that about 16 million people, including up to 1 million children under 5 years old, die every year of pneumococcal disease. The highest incidence of IPD is found at the extremes of age - in young children &lt;2 years of age and in elderly adults. The highest morbidity and mortality rates have been reported in developing countries, but the disease burden is considerable also in industrialised countries. Extrapolation of data on hospitalizations due to IPD from England and Wales (prior to introduction of Prevenar) to the European Union (EU) paediatric population &lt;5 years of age indicate that there would be 6500 IPD cases and 61,000 pneumonia cases annually. Acute otitis media (AOM) is most prevalent in early childhood and it has been estimated that each year in the EU 2.1 million AOM cases occur in children &lt;5 years of age.

Bacteria are isolated in ~70% of children with otitis media, with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae being the most commonly identified pathogens.

Despite the availability of antibiotic therapies the mortality of pneumococcal disease remains high.

The continuing emergence of penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal strains is an increasing global threat posing serious therapeutic challenges. Although the resistance patterns vary between countries, the predominance of certain serotypes (i.e. 6A, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F) among the resistant organisms is shared.

Synflorix is a second generation vaccine being developed and contains other carrier proteins (protein D, diphtheria toxoid [DT] and tetanus toxoid [TT]) and three more pneumococcal serotypes (1, 5 and 7F) in addition to the seven shared with Prevenar. The three additional serotypes are among the major IPD causing serotypes worldwide and represent in Europe a combined average of 13% of all IPD in children &lt;5 years of age. Protein D was selected as a carrier protein, due to its potential to provide protection against H. influenzae infections.

The Company proposes to update the indication section of the Synflorix Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) by increasing the upper age limit of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years. Accordingly the sections posology, adverse events and pharmacodynamics have been amended.

The proposed changes are supported by two clinical studies, 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and -046. During the assessment, new reactogenicity results became available from study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 in Kenya (600 children of 12-59 months of age exposed to one or two doses of Synflorix). The reactogenicity profile of Synflorix across age groups in study 070 is described below and supports the claim according to which two doses of Synflorix are safe and well tolerated in children 2-5 years of age.

Additional supporting safety data in children above 4 years of age have also been provided during the assessment.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The scope of the variation includes updating the indication Section 4.1 to increase the upper age limit of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years and updating all relevant sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), i.e. 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and Package Leaflet.

Amend the version number of the RMP mentioned in Annex II in order to reflect the latest approved RMP version 5.0.

The proposed changes are supported by two main clinical studies 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and -046 and one supportive study 10PN-PD-DIT-070.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/104/2010) for the following condition(s):

-  Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
-  Acute otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae

On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

The PIP is not yet completed.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

Three clinical studies were submitted to support the proposed change of indication, 10PN-PD-DIT-013, 10PN-PD-DIT-046 and study 10PN-PD-DIT-070. Study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 was submitted at the time of the initial MAA, and assessed during the approval procedure. The study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 results are summarised in this assessment report (AR). Study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 was submitted during the type II variation EMEA/H/C/973/II/14, with the purpose of adding the 2+1 primary vaccination schedule, in addition to the 3+1 primary schedule. The EC decision for variation II/14 was issued on 24 January 2011. Study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 was submitted as additional supporting data that became available in support of the current variation.

## Clinical efficacy

## Methods

Study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 is an open, controlled study with 4 parallel groups stratified according to age and with different vaccination schedules and blood sampling time points according to the age group, which are detailed in Table 1.

Primary objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (10Pn-PD-DiT), when given as a catch-up immunization in children older than 7 months of age (three age-groups with different schedules).

Secondary objectives included the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT as well as the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine when co-administered in the group starting vaccination before 6 months of age.

## Statistical methods and endpoints

For  the  evaluation  of  immunogenicity  of  the  appropriate  schedule  for  catch-up  vaccination,  the following parameters were measured.

One month after the administration of the primary (&lt;6 Mo and 7-11 Mo groups) or the full (12-23 Mo and  24 Mo groups) vaccination course, before and one month after the booster dose (&lt;6 Mo and 7-11 Mo groups):

-  Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 6A and 19A (22F-inhibition ELISA).

visit 2 for &gt;= 24 Mo group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Opsonophagocytic activity against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 6A and 19A.
-  Antibody concentrations against protein D.

## Serological Methods

All  serological  assays  used  to  evaluate  the  anti-pneumococcal  antibody  and  OPA  responses  were performed in the MAH's laboratory in Rixensart, Belgium using standardised and validated procedures with adequate controls.

Antibody concentrations as measured by ELISA and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against all vaccine serotypes and vaccine related serotypes 6A and 19A were evaluated in study 10PN-PD-DIT-013. The analysis  of  the  immunogenicity  was  performed  on  the  according  to  protocol  (ATP)  cohort  for immunogenicity.

For the evaluation of the immunogenicity of the different vaccination schedules a descriptive analysis based on GMCs and GMTs as well as seropositivity rates was performed for each of the pneumococcal serotypes, protein D and the co-administered antigens. In addition, an exploratory inferential analysis was performed for  pneumococcal  serotypes,  by  comparing  the  percentages  of  subjects  reaching  an ELISA  antibody  concentration  of  0.2  g/ml  after  catch-up  vaccination  and  after  a  3-dose  primary schedule in infants below 6 months of age.

Without an immunological correlate for individual protection, the comparison of the immune response after catch-up vaccination in older children to those after a 3-dose primary schedule in infants below 6 months of age is justified because the catch-up vaccination can actually be seen as primary vaccination in older children. The immune response after full catch-up vaccination should therefore be at least as good as after 3 doses in infants below 6 months of age.

Study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 is an open, controlled, long-term follow-up study with three parallel groups and is an extension study of the primary and booster vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-002. The study design is detailed further in Table 2 and Figure 1.

The number of subjects included in the study is shown below.

| Number of subjects                                 |   Total |   10Pn-2d |   10Pn-3d |   unprimed |

| Number of subjects completed                       |     171 |        51 |        58 |         62 |
| Total vaccinated cohort                            |     172 |        51 |        59 |         62 |
| According to Protocol (ATP) for safety/persistence |     172 |        51 |        59 |         62 |
| According to Protocol (ATP) for immunogenicity     |     167 |        51 |        57 |         60 |

Primary objective was to assess the immune responses following vaccination with a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine administered at 36-46 months of age in children previously vaccinated with the 10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-002  according  to  either  a  3-dose  or  2-dose  primary vaccination within the first 6 months of age and booster vaccination at 11 months of age and to assess

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  immune  responses  following  vaccination  with  a  single  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  agematched unprimed children.

Secondary  objectives  included  the  assessment  of  safety,  reactogenicity  and  immunogenicity  of  the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when given as a 2-dose vaccination course to unprimed children in their fourth year of life.

Table 2. Study 10PN-PD-DIT-046: groups with vaccination schedules and blood samples

| Group    | Vaccination schedule in 002      | Vaccination schedule in 046              | Blood sampling timepoint                            |

| 10Pn-2d  | 2+1 at 2-4 and 11months of age   | 1 dose at 36-46 months of age            | Pre and 7-10 days post dose 1                       |
| 10Pn-3d  | 3+1 at 2-3-4 and 11months of age | 1 dose at 36-46 months of age            | Pre and 7-10 days post dose 1                       |
| Unprimed | -                                | 2 doses at 36-46 and 38-48 months of age | Pre and 7-10 days post dose 1 One month post dose 2 |

Figure 1. Study design 10PN-PD-DIT-002 and -046

<!-- image -->

For the evaluation of immunogenicity of an appropriate schedule for catch-up vaccination, the following parameters were measured prior to, 7-10 days post-dose 1 (all groups), and one month post-dose 2 (unprimed group only):

-  Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (22F-inhibition ELISA)
-  Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F.
-  Antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A.
-  Antibody concentrations against protein D (ELISA).

## Statistical methods and endpoints

Where appropriate, for each treatment group, at each time-point for which a blood-analysis result was available and for each pneumococcal serotype and for protein D:

-  Antibody GMCs/GMTs with 95% CIs was tabulated.
-  Seropositivity rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated.
-  Percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations  0.2  g/ml with exact 95% CIs was calculated for each pneumococcal serotype.
-  The  distribution  of  antibody  concentrations/titres  was  displayed  using  table  and/or  reverse cumulative distribution curve.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  For  each  pneumococcal  serotype,  at  each  time  point  for  which  a  blood  analysis  result  was available,  geometric  mean  of  ratios  of  opsonophagocytic  titres/ELISA  concentrations  were tabulated with their 95% CIs.

Without an immunological correlate for individual protection, the comparison of the immune response after  full  catch-up  vaccination  in  older  children  to  those  after  a  3-dose  primary  schedule  in  infants below 6 months of age is justified because the catch-up vaccination can actually be seen as primary vaccination in older children. The immune response after catch-up vaccination should therefore be at least as good as after 3 doses in infants below 6 months. Although in study 046 no direct control group of infants receiving a 3-dose primary schedule was available, in the preceding study 002 this group was  present  and  can  be  compared  with.  The  3-dose  primed  group  in  study  002  was  vaccinated according to a 3, 4, 5 month schedule, despite the protocol defined vaccination schedule of 2, 3, 4 months. A limitation of such comparison is that the groups were vaccinated at different points in time as there was approximately a 2 year interval between studies.

## Results of main studies

Immunogenicity results for study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. In addition to the results for the unprimed group in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 the immune responses for the 3-dose primary schedule in infants vaccinated in the preceding study 10PNPD-DIT-002 are shown.

In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  for  the  24  Mo  group,  one  month  post-dose  I,  at  least  91.4%  of  the subjects  had  antibody  concentrations  0.2  g/ml,  for  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes except  for  serotypes  6B  (68.6%)  and  23F  (66.9%).  The  observed  antibody  GMCs  were  lower  for serotypes 1, 5, 14 and 23F and higher for serotypes 4, 18C and 19F compared to those observed for the same serotypes in the &lt;6 Mo group after a 3-dose primary series (non-overlap of CIs) (Figure 2). The  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  ELISA  antibody  concentrations  0.2  g/ml  was  lower  for serotypes 14 and 23F and higher for serotype 19F compared to the &lt;6 Mo control group.

In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  for  the  24  Mo  group,  one  month  post-dose  I,  at  least  90.2%  of  the subjects had an OPA titre  8, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes except for serotypes 1 (46.3%), 5 (56.4%) and 6B (64.7%). The observed GMTs were lower for serotype 5 and higher for serotypes 4, 18C and 19F compared to those observed in the &lt;6 Mo group after a 3-dose primary series (non-overlap of CIs) (Figure 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In all three catch-up immunization groups, high responses were observed for serotypes 18C and 19F. These  serotypes  are  conjugated  to  the  TT  and  DT  carrier  respectively,  for  which  children  were previously primed during early childhood. This priming could have contributed to the observed higher responses for serotypes 18C and 19F. However, also high responses were observed for serotype 4, conjugated to protein D, for which children were not previously primed.

The  anti-PD  GMC  [224.8  EL.  U/ml  (95%  CI:  185.2-272.7)]  and  the  proportion  of  subjects  [76.3% (68.3-83.1)] with measurable anti-PD antibody concentrations (  100 EL.U/ml) after one dose in the  24 Mo group were lower compared to the responses after a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule, i.e. a GMC of 1637.7 (1430.9-1874.3) and 100% (97.2-100) of subjects with measurable anti-PD antibody concentrations.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

From these results it can be concluded that one dose in 2-5 year olds was immunogenic but that the response was not as high as the response after 3 doses in infancy for some serotypes, and Protein D. In  study  013  higher  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  against  serotype  6B  were  observed  one  month post-dose 1 in children &gt;2 years old at the time of vaccination, compared to those in the 2 years old group (no overlap of 95% CIs).

No statistically significant differences could be observed for the other serotypes, although conclusions need to be drawn with caution given the small sample sizes. No consistent differences were observed between age groups, with for some serotypes a trend for a higher response in the above 2 years old subgroup and for other serotypes a trend for higher responses in the 2 years old group. However, in the OPA analysis, consistently higher GMTs were observed in the older subgroup. It is of note that OPA activity was tested only in one third of the subjects, i.e. approximately 50 subjects per age group.

The number of subjects 3-5 years of age is limited to 40 subjects, which is considered very low. No firm conclusions with respect to vaccine immunogenicity and safety could be drawn.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  study  046,  the  immune  responses  following  2-dose  catch-up  vaccination  with  the  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during the 4th year of life showed robust increases in ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs  one  month  after  the  second  dose  of  vaccine  as  compared  to  the  pre-vaccination  status.  All subjects had pneumococcal antibody concentrations  0.2  g/ml for each vaccine serotype except for serotypes 6B and 23F (both 93.3%). One month after the second dose of vaccine, all subjects had an OPA titre  8 for each vaccine serotype except for serotypes 1 (89.3%), 5 (98.2%) and 6B (93.0%). The results of study 046 are summarised in Tables 3 and 4.

For each of the pneumococcal serotypes, 2 doses resulted in higher GMCs and GMTs compared to a 3dose  primary  vaccination  course  in  infants  (at  2,  3  and  4  months  of  age)  in  study-002.  Also,  the proportion of subjects reaching an antibody concentration  0.2  g/ml or an OPA titre  8 was greater after 2 doses when compared to 3 doses in the first 6 months of life for all serotypes. Although this study  was  not  designed  to  compare  to  the  3-dose  primed  group  in  the  preceding  study-002  and comparison  should  be  done  with  caution,  it  is  reassuring  to  observe  that  2  doses  in  previously unvaccinated older children result in higher immune responses compared to the primary vaccination in infants.

Of note, the OPA GMTs 1 month after the second dose in the unprimed group were lower than 7 days after the first dose for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V, remained at the same levels for serotype 18C and 23F, and  increased  for  serotypes  6B,  14  and  19F.  In  contrast,  the  IgG-specific  antibody  responses  as measured by ELISA did not follow the same kinetics. This observation suggests that the OPA GMTs resulted from the combined opsonic activity of different immunoglobulin classes i.e. IgG, IgM or IgA. Early  kinetics  of  these  immunoglobulin  classes  upon  PCV  vaccination  are  poorly  described  in  the literature, especially in paediatric populations. However, ELISA results available in toddlers, adults and elderly populations indicated that the observed immunoglobulin profile (IgG, IgM, IgA), magnitude of immune  responses  and  the  pneumococcal  natural  immunity  may  vary  from  serotype  to  serotype. Although the IgM and IgA composition of the samples was not investigated in study 046, a high level of IgM at 7 days post-vaccination could explain the observed OPA titre in absence of IgG while at 30 days post-vaccination the opsonisation would be mainly mediated by IgG. The different OPA kinetic profiles between serotypes might depend on pre-existing immunity which may have evolved differently over time. The lack of knowledge in the OPA kinetics during the course of the vaccination schedule makes it difficult to draw final conclusions on these observations.

One month after the second dose of vaccine, the observed percentage of subjects with measurable anti-PD antibody concentrations (  100 EL.U/ml) was 98.3% and anti-PD GMC was 960.4 EL.U/ml (95% CI  752.7-1225.5).  This  was  in  the  same  range  as  the  response  after  a  3-dose  primary  vaccination course in study-002, i.e. 100% with measurable anti-PD antibody concentrations and a GMC of 1223.3 EL. U/ml (95% CI 1066.5-1403.2).

The immune responses after 2 doses in study-046 were clearly higher than those observed after one dose in this age group in study-013 for each of the pneumococcal serotypes and for Protein D.

The results  of  study  046  indicate  that  2  doses  given  to  children  3-4  years  of  age  result  in  immune responses that are higher than what was seen in children ≤ 6  months receiving the 3-dose priming schedule.  Higher  immune  responses  are  expected  among  older  children,  as  they  are  more  likely  to have  some  previous  exposure  to  pneumococci.  Thus,  in  conclusion,  two  doses  should  be  given  to children above 2 years of age for optimal immune responses.

## Clinical safety

## Methodology of safety monitoring

The evaluation of the safety of the catch-up vaccinations schedules included in both study 013 and study  046  the  incidence  of  solicited  local  and  general  events  (during  4  days  post  vaccination),  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

incidence of unsolicited events (during 31 days post vaccination), the use of concomitant antipyretics or  medication  and  the  occurrence  of  SAEs  (during  the  whole  study  period).  The  intensity  of  each solicited  symptom  was  graded  according  to  a  standard  intensity  scale  except  for  fever  (rectal temperature  38  C  or  axillary/oral/tympanic  temperature  37.5  C;  3  fever  was  defined  as  rectal temperature &gt;40.0  C or axillary/oral/tympanic temperature &gt;39.5  C). Using his/her clinical judgement the  investigator  assessed  the  intensity  of  each  unsolicited  event  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  a possible causal relationship to vaccination according to criteria specified in the protocol. All solicited local  symptoms  were  considered  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  Large  swelling  reactions involving the entire vaccinated limb are a well-recognised phenomenon following booster vaccination with many vaccines including DTPa, DT, and DTPw vaccines from all manufacturers and with Prevenar. The cause of these large swelling  reactions is  not  fully  understood,  they  are  however  generally  not associated  with  significant  impairment  of  function,  and  resolve  without  sequelae.  The  occurrence  of large swelling reactions was solicited following catch-up vaccination in both studies.

## Solicited adverse events

## Study 013

The age distribution of the subjects vaccinated in the  24 months - 5 years of age group in catch-up study  10PN-PD-DIT-013  is  shown  below.  Of  the  150  subjects  vaccinated  in  this  age  group,  100 subjects were 2 years of age and in total 50 subjects were older than 2 years. Therefore the safety and immunogenicity  analyses  were  done  according  to  two  subcategories;  2  year  old  subjects  (24  -  35 months of age) (N=100) and subjects above 2 years of age (  36 months of age) (N=50). The safety analysis included only the solicited AEs.

## Number of subjects by age category for the &gt; 24 months of age group (Total vaccinated cohort)

A trend towards a higher incidence of local solicited symptoms was reported in subjects who started catch-up  immunization  at  an  older  age,  but  differences  with  the  younger  age  group  were  not statistically  significant.  Due  to  the  small  sample  size  of  the  dataset,  one  cannot  exclude  a  slight increase of local symptoms when administering the vaccine beyond 36 months of age. There was no evidence  of  imbalance  between  age  groups  when  comparing  the  incidence  of  solicited  general symptoms.

The solicited symptoms (local and general) following catch-up immunization, are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. Pain (any and grade 3) was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom at the 10PnPD-DiT injection site in the 12-23 months of age and  24 months of age groups, whereas redness was more common in the 7-11 months of age group. High incidences of pain in the 12-23 months and  24

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months  of  age  groups  (60  %  and  68.9%,  respectively,  for  any  reaction  and  11.3%  and  16.2% respectively,  for grade 3 reactions) were previously documented for the licensed Prevenar vaccine.

Large swelling reactions were reported by four out of 300 subjects at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site: one  subject  was  in  12-23  months  group  and  three  subjects  in  24  months  group.  All  were  local reactions around the injection site, not involving adjacent joints. Two were associated with functional impairment that prevented normal activities and all resolved within 2 days.

Although comparison of reactogenicity between the different catch-up groups needs to be done with caution  given  the  difference  in  age  and  number  of  vaccine  doses,  fever  38  C  was  less  commonly reported in the  24 months of age group compared to both the 7-11 months of age and 12-23 months of  age  groups.  In  all  groups,  general  symptoms  of  grade  3  intensity  were  infrequently  reported, following no more than 2.4% of doses. There were no cases of fever &gt; 40.0  C in any of the catch-up groups.

## Study 046

The incidences of solicited events (local and general) are presented in Table 7 and Table 8. Pain at injection  site  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  adverse  event  (72.6%  dose  1,  51.6% dose  2  and  62.1%,  overall/dose).  The  overall/dose  incidence  of  grade  3  solicited  local  symptoms ranged  from  4.8%  to  13.7%  in  the  unprimed  group.  Large  swelling  reaction  (&gt;  50  mm)  following vaccination was reported by 1 subject after the first dose. The lesion had a diameter of 60 mm and had resolved after 1 day.

Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event.  None  of  the  subjects reported fever&gt; 40  C or any other grade 3 solicited general adverse events.

There was no increase in incidence of events with consecutive doses.

## Unsolicited adverse events

## Study 013

The overall/dose incidence of at least one unsolicited AE was 56.6% in the 7-11 months of age group (two doses), 43.4% in the 7-11 months of age group (third dose), 47.8% in the 12-23 months of age group and 36.0% in the  24 months of age group (Table 9). The most common unsolicited adverse event considered to be causally related to vaccination was injection site induration in the two groups receiving two 10Pn-PD-DiT doses. In the  24 months of age group, the most common related adverse event was headache (2.0%).

The number of subjects included in the analyses of study 046 is summarised in the table below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean age in the unprimed group was 40.3 months (38 months in the other two groups) and the range was 36-45 months.

The overall/dose incidence of at least one unsolicited AE was 40.3%, and 8.1% of the doses were followed by at least one unsolicited event that was considered to be causally related to vaccination. The most common unsolicited adverse events considered to be causally related to vaccination were nausea, vomiting, injection site hematoma, pyrexia and rhinitis (all reported after 1.6% of the doses).

## Serious adverse events

## Study 013

In  study  10PN-PD-DIT-013,  6  subjects  in  the  7-11  months  of  age  group,  2  subjects  in  the  12-23 months of age group and none in the  24 months of age group reported at least one SAE (data lock point  15  June  2008).  None  of  the  subjects  reported  a  causally  related  SAE  or  an  SAE  with  a  fatal outcome.

## Study 046

One subject in the unprimed group reported an SAE (bronchitis) during the course of the study. This SAE  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  and  the  subject recovered uneventfully.

Following  assessment  of  the  submitted  documentation,  some  concerns  were  raised.  The  major objection concerned the limited data in children above 4 years of age.

## Additional supporting safety data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 10PN-PD-DIT-070 is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya. This study is a GSK-supported conducted at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). The main objectives of the study are to determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 1 or 2 doses of Synflorix in children aged 12-59 months and to determine the effect of vaccination on the carriage prevalence of Synflorix types. A total of 600 children aged 12-59 months were enrolled in three study groups as follows:

## Vaccination schedule

|         | Group A   | Group B   | Group C             |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
|         | N=200     | N=200     | N=200               |
| Day 0   | Synflorix | Synflorix | Havrix1             |
| Day 60  | Synflorix | Infanrix2 | Infanrix            |
| Day 180 | Infanrix2 | Synflorix | Havrix1 + Synflorix |

Infanrix:GSK's DTPa vaccine

Havrix: GSK's Hepatitis A vaccine

This study provided safety data from 600 children aged 12-59 months exposed to two doses of Synflorix.

The occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms reported within 3 days after vaccination has been calculated across age groups (12-23 months; 24-35 months; 36-47 months; 48-59 months).

Table 11 and Table 12 summarise the reactogenicity data following the first dose of Synflorix (pooled Groups A+B: N ~100 per age group) or control vaccine Havrix (Group C: N ~50 per age group), respectively. The occurrences of solicited symptoms were comparable between Synflorix and the control vaccine in all age groups. Most importantly, no increase of occurrence of solicited symptoms was observed in children aged 48 months and above as compared to younger children for either Synflorix or control vaccine. There were no reports of grade 3 solicited local and general symptoms across all age groups, except grade 3 drowsiness which was documented in one child after the first dose of Synflorix.

The occurrences of solicited symptoms across all age groups and overall after a second dose of Synflorix (Group A: N ~ 50) or after control vaccine Infanrix at Day 60 (pooled Groups B+C: N ~100) are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. Similar to the reporting of solicited symptoms observed after the first dose of Synflorix, there was no trend towards higher reactogenicity with increasing age after the second dose of Synflorix. The occurrences of solicited symptoms following a second dose of Synflorix and following the control vaccine Infanrix at day 60 were comparable.

The results from Table 11 and Table 13 show that the reactogenicity profile for solicited local and general symptoms following one dose of Synflorix was generally higher than that following the second dose of Synflorix across all age groups. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were documented in 6 of 400 children (1.5%) in the groups receiving at least one dose of Synflorix (groups A+B) and 1 of 200 children (0.5%) in the control group C. All SAEs were considered to be unrelated to vaccination.

It is acknowledged that the safety profile of Synflorix in European population may differ from that obtained in the Kenyan population due to ethnic factors, clinical settings or health conditions in Africa. However, the data are reassuring in that the reactogenicity profile for the subjects in the 48-59 months age group was not higher than in the other age groups, either following one dose or two doses of Synflorix. In addition, the reactogenicity profile in the 48-59 months age group following two doses

of Synflorix tended to be lower than that following one dose of Synflorix. Finally the reporting of solicited local and general symptoms following vaccination with Synflorix was similar to that following the control vaccines (Havrix and Infanrix).

## Supportive data from studies conducted in Europe

The safety and reactogenicity data of a single dose of Synflorix in children 24-71 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-013 and two doses in children 36-45 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 was previously submitted and assessed. Synflorix was well tolerated in both studies. There was no increase of local and general symptoms with increasing age, except for injection site pain of any severity in study 013, which was higher in the ≥ 24 months age group (68.9%) than in the 12-23 months and 7-11 months age groups (60.6% and 44.1%, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A new analysis of study 013 has been performed to determine if this trend towards higher injection site pain with age is observed in the 48-59 months age group and the 60-71 months age group. The results indicated that the occurrences of local adverse events of any severity and grade 3 by age group are generally similar in the 36-47 months, 48-59 months and 60-71 months age groups.

With regards to the solicited general symptoms, higher incidences were not observed in children in of 48-59 months of age and 60-71 months of age in study 013 with the exception of fever of any severity in the 60-71 months of age group (22%). No grade 3 cases of fever, drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite were reported in children of 48-59 months of age and 60-71 months of age.

In addition to this new analysis, the solicited local and general symptoms after one dose of Synflorix in children of 46-48 months of age from study 10PN-PD-DIT-061 are also presented. Study 10PN-PDDIT-061 is a phase III, open, multicentre, extension study in Germany to assess the immune response following administration of an additional dose of Synflorix or Prevenar at approximately 4 years of age in children previously vaccinated with three primary doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 10PNPD- DIT-003 and a booster dose of 23-valent pneumococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-008 BST: 003. In total, 52 subjects were enrolled in study 061, of which 27 subjects received one dose of Synflorix and 25 subjects received one dose of Prevenar. The percentages of subjects reporting any adverse event (solicited and unsolicited, local and general) within the 31-day post-additional dose period were 80.8% in the Synflorix group and 72.0% in the Prevenar group. The percentages of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited adverse event in the 31-day post-additional dose period were 22.2% in the Synflorix group and 32.0% in the Prevenar group. No grade 3 unsolicited adverse events were reported within the 31-day post-additional dose period. No serious adverse events were reported and none of the subjects was withdrawn due to an adverse event.

In study 061, the reporting of solicited local and general symptoms (Table 15 and Table 16 respectively) were generally similar to the reporting in study 013 for the similar age groups (i.e. 36-47 months of age and 48-59 months of age) except for higher fever of any severity in study 061 (26.9% of subjects versus 0% and 4.3% in the 36-47 months of age and 48-59 months of age groups in study 013 respectively).

As noted previously, there was no increase of occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms with consecutive vaccine doses in study 046.

## Worldwide marketing experience

There were 41 spontaneous reports when Synflorix was used in subjects older than 2 years of age (data  lock  point  10  June  2010).  Out  of  the  41  reports,  there  were  21  cases  concerning  children between 2 and 6 years of age. The Company is closely monitoring off-label use in PSURs and so far did not observe any particular safety signal linked to the use of Synflorix in subjects older than 2 years. Since launch up to 10 December 2010, 379 spontaneous cases were reported after Synflorix vaccination. Of these 379 cases, 28 occurred in subjects who were aged from 2 to 5 years old at the time they received Synflorix vaccination. Data presented within these 28 cases did not highlight any particular safety concern regarding cases reported in children aged from 2 to 5 years old.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of Synflorix has been documented in 206 children 36 to 48 months of age (studies 013, 046, 061 and 070), 124 children of 48 to 59 months of age (studies 013 and 070) and 9 subjects of 60 to 71 months of age (study 013). Reporting of adverse events following a second dose of Synflorix was studied in 62 subjects of 36 to 45 months of age in study 046 and 52 children of 48 to 59 months of age in study 070. It should be noted that the number of children of 3 to 4 years of age (36 months to 59 months) in these studies are similar to that the number of children found in for PCV13 indication in children 2-5 years of age (N=152 in PCV13 study 3002) (EPAR, 2009).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A further analysis by age of the data from study 013 in children of 24 to 71 months of age showed that local and general solicited symptoms were similar in children of 36 to 47 months of age, 48-59 months of age and 60 to 71 months of age, except for fever of any severity in the 61 to 71 months of age group. Study 061 provided additional data in children of 46 to 48 months of age with reporting of local and general solicited symptoms generally similar to the reporting in study 013 for the age groups 36 to 47 months of age and 48 to 59 months of age.

The recently available data from study 070 in Kenya indicate that Synflorix was well tolerated in children of 12 to 59 months of age and are of special interest as they provide safety and reactogenicity data for children of 48 to 59 months of age following one or two doses of Synflorix. The reporting of solicited symptoms for oldest age group in the study (48 to 59 months of age) was similar to the other age groups that received Synflorix and also similar to that in children of 48 to 59 months of age receiving control vaccine Havrix (except for higher number of children reporting fever in the Synflorix group) or control vaccine Infanrix.

Following the first round of assessment, some concerns were raised. The major objection concerned the limited data in children above 4 years of age. This concern was satisfactorily resolved upon the assessment of additional supporting safety data.

Furthermore, a new analysis of safety data from previous studies conducted in Europe provided additional evidence that there are no trends towards higher reactogenicity in children above 48 months of age receiving one or two doses of Synflorix.

In conclusion, one dose of Synflorix has been shown to be well tolerated in children of 2 up to 5 years of age in studies 013 and 061 with similar reporting of solicited symptoms in the older children of 3 up to 5 years of age and, in study 046, there was no increase in reporting of solicited symptoms following a second dose of Synflorix in children of 3 years of age. A review of the available post-marketing surveillance safety data did not reveal any safety concerns in children of 2 to 5 years of age. The data from Kenya can support the conclusions reached for the safety and tolerability of two doses of Synflorix when administered to children from 2 up to 5 years of age (i.e. up to 59 months of age).

The evidence presented supports the safety and tolerability of two doses of Synflorix in children of 2 up to 5 years of age and supports the changes to the SmPC to increase the upper age limit to 5 years of age and the inclusion of immunogenicity data and new safety data.

## Overall Conclusion and Benefit-Risk assessment

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Two doses of Synflorix were shown to elicit immune responses in children aged 3-4 years old in study 046, which are at least of the same magnitude as the responses to the approved 3+1 and 2+1 primary vaccination schedule in infants.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

There are limited data in children 48-60 months of age, and there are no data on children in this age group receiving two doses. The immune responses after two doses in children 3-4 years of age were lower than those seen in children of the same age who had received a priming course of 3+1 or 2+1 doses and a booster dose at 36-46 months of age. The implication of this lower response on long-term immunity is currently unknown. The lack of immunogenicity data following 2 doses in children &gt;4 and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

&lt;6 years of age are of some concern, but it is likely that immune responses in 2-4 year old children are also representative of children 4-5 years of age.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The reactogenicity is generally similar to what has been shown previously in younger children. However, the frequency of pain at the injection site was shown to increase with increasing age in study 013.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There are no data on children 48-60 years of age receiving two doses. Considering the observed increased frequency of pain at the injection site in study 013, there is a need for more data on the risks. The MAH provided additional analysis from study 013 for age groups 24-35 months, 36-47 months, 48-59 months and 60-71 months, which do not indicate a clear increase in reactogenicity with increasing age, although the age segments are small, e.g. the 60-71 month group only includes 9 individuals. In addition, a Kenyan study in children 12-59 months of age do not support increased reactogenicity with increasing age. However, data in the oldest children, i.e. 48-60 months of age receiving two doses are scarce, and the MAH is requested to closely monitor adverse reactions in children 2-5 years and report in upcoming PSURs.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The incidence of pneumococcal infection is greatest among children below 5 years of age, and therefore there is a need to vaccinate this age group. The lack of immunogenicity data following 2 doses in children older than 4 years of age is a deficiency, but it is likely that the results from the younger children can be extrapolated to the older children. The lack of safety data in the initial dossier was identified by CHMP as a major objection, mainly due to the observed increase in frequency of injection site pain with increasing age. However, in response to the major objection raised, the MAH has presented additional data that do not support an overall increase in reactogenicity by increasing age.

## Benefit-risk balance

The incidence of disease caused by S. pneumoniae is highest in children up to 5 years of age, thus there is a need to vaccinate children up to 5 years of age. The results of study 013 indicated that a single dose given to children over 2 years of age did not result in sufficient immune responses. In that were at least comparable to the responses seen in younger children following primary immunisation. It is considered that the immunogenicity data from the 3-4 year old children can be extrapolated to children up to 5 years of age.

study 046, it was shown that 2 doses given to children 3-4 years of age resulted in immune responses There was an increase in the incidence of pain at the injection site with increasing age in study 013, but no increase in systemic reactions. These data were not supported by a Kenyan study 070, which did not support increased reactogenicity with increasing age and by further analysis of the 013 data by age group. Thus, there is no specific safety concern with increasing age, and the safety data from younger children can be extrapolated to children up to 5 years of age.

Thus, the benefit of vaccinating children up to 5 years of age is considered to outweigh the risks of vaccination.

As the overall safety database in children 2-5 years of age is very limited, the CHMP recommended performing an active safety surveillance, and closely monitoring vaccine safety in this age group. All serious listed and unlisted adverse events should be continuously reported and accordingly be presented cumulatively in future PSURs.

## Changes to the Product Information

The  changes  to  the  Product  Information  include  updating  the  indication  Section  4.1  to  increase  the upper age limit of infants and children from 2 years to 5 years and updating all relevant sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), i.e. 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and Package Leaflet.

Amend the version number of the RMP mentioned in Annex II in order to reflect the latest approved RMP version 5.0.

The CHMP agreed with the changes to the Product Information. The SmPC has been modified as indicated in Annex 1.

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance of Synflorix for active immunisation against invasive disease and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants in children 2-5 years is considered acceptable. The MAH took the opportunity to amend the version number of the RMP mentioned in Annex II in order to reflect the latest approved RMP version 5.0.

The CHMP recommends performing an active safety surveillance and closely monitoring vaccine safety in this age group. All serious listed and unlisted adverse events should be continuously reported and accordingly be presented cumulatively in future PSURs.

The CHMP is of the opinion that study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 EXT: 002, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant.

## 2. Conclusion

On 23 June 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be approvable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                  | Type   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.I.6.a               | Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate the Package Leaflet.

In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation EC(No)1901/2006 as amended, significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation

## Follow-up measures undertaken by the marketing authorisation holder

As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to perform an active safety surveillance, and closely monitoring vaccine safety in this age group. All serious listed and unlisted adverse events will be continuously reported and accordingly be presented cumulatively in future PSURs.
