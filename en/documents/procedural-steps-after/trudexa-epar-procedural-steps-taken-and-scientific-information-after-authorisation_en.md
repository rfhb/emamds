| II/0037 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics To update section 5.1 of the SPC with 5 year results from an open label extension of a clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis. Section 4.8 was consequentially updated. | Product 24/05/2007  | no 29/06/2007                            | longer SPC                       | Results from an open label extension study in rheumatoid arthritis indicated that the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is maintained up to 5 years in a subset of patients. Data also showed that efficacy in terms of ACR (American College of Rheumatology) response (criteria used in rheumatoid arthritis which allows for standardisation of trial outcomes and permits comparisons of treatment efficacy across clinical trials) was maintained in a group of patients who continued throughout the study period. 114 out of 207 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 60 months. Among those, 86, 72 and 41 patients had ACR 20/50/70 response. The SPC was updated to reflect these results. |

|         | regarding hepatitis B reactivation further to the update of the company's core data sheet. The PL was updated accordingly. In addition the MAH completed the list of local representatives in the PL to include the two new EU Member States (Bulgaria and Romania), and corrected the list of local representatives for Finland, Portugal and United Kingdom. |                     | longer                                   |                                  | authorised Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving TNF-antagonists including adalimumab, who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some rare cases, especially if taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) had a fatal outcome. The PI now states that patients are advised to contact their doctors if they are carriers of HBV, have active HBV or think they might be at risk of contracting HBV. |
| II/0034 | Product Update of Summary of Product Characteristics. To update sections 4.5 and 5.1 of the SPC regarding antibodies to adalimumab as requested by the CHMP further to the assessment of pharmacokinetic data from a long term clinical trial.                                                                                                                 | 24/01/2007          | no 05/03/2007                            | SPC                              | Based on the assessment of pharmacokinetic data, the SPC was updated to revise the numbers of subjects positive for anti-adalimumab antibodies observed in the clinical setting in patients on adalimumab monotherapy and patients on adalimumab and methotrexate. The formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies was associated with increased elimination and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. Higher antibody values did not appear to affect safety.                                |
| II/0033 | Medicinal Extension of Indication To update sections 4.1 of the SPC to include treatment of adult patients with moderately to severe active Crohn's disease. Sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 were consequently updated. The PL was updated accordingly.                                                                                                         | 26/04/2007          | 04/06/2007                               | SPC, PL                          | Please refer to the Scientific Discussion: EMEA-H-481-II-33-AR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| II/0019 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC on malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders following the assessment of the 3rd PSUR (reporting period 31.12.03-30.06.04). | Product 15/12/2004  | no 25/01/2005                            | longer SPC                       | In line with the CHMP recommendations further to the assessment of the 3rd PSUR, the MAH applied to update the text in sections 4.4 \"Special warnings and special precautions for use\" and 4.8 \"Undesirable effects\" on malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders. The purpose was to revise the warnings section and include details of the post- marketing experience on malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders, including incidence. In clinical trials, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. Additionally, there is an increased background lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. |
