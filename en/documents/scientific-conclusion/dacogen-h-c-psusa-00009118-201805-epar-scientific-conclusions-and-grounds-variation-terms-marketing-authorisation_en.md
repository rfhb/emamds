## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for decitabine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The MAH provided a comprehensive cumulative review of cardiomyopathy cases with analysis and discussion of cases reported in the safety database, clinical trial data, literature data and disproportionality analysis. Overall, 19 cases reporting cardiomyopathy have been retrieved in the MAH safety database. Although most of them had limited information or confounding factors, some, especially those published in the literature, provided evidence of a possible causal association with decitabine administration. Disproportionality analysis suggested also a higher risk of cardiomyopathy with decitabine.

Furthermore, there is a biological plausibility for this adverse reaction and cardiomyopathy is listed in the US Product Information and in some PIs of other pyrimidine analogues.

Therefore, based upon these data, the PRAC recommends that the section 4.8 of the SmPC be updated to add cardiomyopathy with the frequency uncommon. The current labelling in section 4.4 regarding patients with history of severe cardiac disease excluded from clinical studies should be updated with a warning regarding this risk. The PL should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for decitabine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing decitabine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
