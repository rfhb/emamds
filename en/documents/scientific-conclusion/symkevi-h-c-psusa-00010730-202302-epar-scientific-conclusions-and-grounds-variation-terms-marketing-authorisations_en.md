## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tezacaftor / ivacaftor, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on risk of occurrence of depression and related events from spontaneous reports in post-marketing surveillance, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive dechallenge  and  re-challenge,  and  in  the  context  of  updates  made  to  the  product  information  for ELX/TEZ/IVA, the PRAC considered that a causal relationship between IVA/TEZ and depression is at least a reasonable possibility.

In  addition,  the  PRAC  recommends  an  update  to  the  product  information  to  reflect  that  tezacaftor, ivacaftor is excreted in human breastmilk based on data from 2 publications which demonstrated excretion of  both  actives in  the  breastmilk  of  5  patients.  As such,  the  MAH  is  requested  to  update  section  4.6 wording relating to breastfeeding.

The PRAC requests the MAH to provide a cumulative review of all data related to excretion in breast milk including available literature evidence wat the next PSUR for Symkevi. Furthermore, the same cumulative review including all available data and literature) should also be provided for the upcoming PSUR for Kaftrio (DLP 20 October 2023).

The PRAC also recommended that the product information of medicinal products containing IVA/TEZ/ELX should be amended accordingly at the next regulatory opportunity.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tezacaftor / ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tezacaftor / ivacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
