## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen-Cilag International NV submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 11 November 2014 an application for a variation.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Centrally authorised Medicinal product(s):   | International non-proprietary name:   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Imbruvica                                    |                                       |
|                                              | IBRUTINIB                             |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for an extension of indication for Imbruvica for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM). Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet in order to incorporate all information relevant to the WM indication. In addition, some minor editorial corrections have been made in the SmPC.

The variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0271/2014 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/984 - EMA/OD/156/11 on 26 April 2012 and EU/3/13/1115 - EMA/OD/171/12 on 12 March 2013. Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within a separate orphan designation ''treatment of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma' EU/3/14/1264 granted on 29/04/2014.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## Problem statement

Waldenstr ӧ m macroglobulinaemia is a lymphoproliferative B-cell disorder characterized by infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells into the bone marrow and immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy. It is considered to be a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) by the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) and World Health Organization classification systems. Waldenstr ӧ m macroglobulinemia is a rare type of NHL, accounting for &lt;2% of all NHL subtypes (Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, 2013).  It is a disease of the elderly with a median age of 63-68 years with a male predominance (Buske 2013).

The somatic mutation MYD88 L265P is present in &gt;90% of patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and supports malignant growth via signalling involving Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). WHIM-like mutations in CXCR4 are present in 1/3 of patients with WM, and their expression induces BTK activity and may confer  decreased sensitivity to ibrutinib mediated growth suppression in WM cells (Treon et al, 2013).

Clinical manifestations of WM include cytopenias (anaemia) and lymphadenomegaly resulting from infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and IgM paraprotein-related symptoms such as cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin syndrome, demyelinating neuropathy, amyloidosis (involving kidneys, heart and nervous system), infections and symptomatic hyperviscosity (visual disturbance, headache, dizziness, altered consciousness, fatigue and weakness).

To establish the diagnosis of WM, it is necessary to demonstrate an IgM monoclonal protein, along with histological evidence of infiltration of the bone marrow by lymphoplasmacytic cells in line with the diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Weber et al 2003).

Factors associated with a poor prognosis include advanced age (&gt;65 years); β2-microglobulin &gt;3 mg/L; anemia (hemoglobin ≤11.5 g/dL); thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤100 x 10 9 /L); and IgM monoclonal gammopathy (IgM &gt;7.0 g/dL). Based on these key factors an international prognostic scoring system for newly diagnosed patients with WM was recently developed, indicating that the 5year survival rates range from 36% to 87% in high- and low-risk patients, respectively (Table 1).

Waldenstr ӧ m  macroglobulinaemia remains an incurable disease.  According to the current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines (Buske 2013) the first recommendation is to include the patient in a clinical trial, otherwise frontline treatment options include alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues, bortezomib and the monoclonal antibody rituximab. In relapsed disease the choice of the rituximab/chemotherapy depends on the prior regimen. If the patient was treated initially with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rituximab plus alkylating agents, the salvage regimen could be switched to rituximab in combination with nucleoside analogues, rituximab/bendamustine or bortezomib and vice versa.

## About the product

Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that targets the ATP binding domain of BTK and forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the binding pocket that leads to sustained inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK has a pivotal role in signalling through the B-cell antigen receptor activating pathways necessary for B-cell activation/proliferation and development in WM (SmPC section 5.1).

The applicant applied for a marketing authorisation for the following indication: 'IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM).'

The recommended indication for approval is:

IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy (SmPC section 4.1).

The recommended dose for the treatment of WM is 420 mg (three capsules) once daily until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient (SmPC section 4.2).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data with the exception of ERA have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.1. Introduction

## 2.2.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The total consumption of ibrutinib on the EU market within the approved indications (mantle-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; MCL/CLL) and the intended indication (WM) has been recalculated, assuming 100% market share within the EU. This recalculation resulted in an estimated consumption volume of 9200 kg/year in the year 2021. Using this updated estimate for the consumption volume of ibrutinib, the calculations in the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) have been updated. The changes are related to the increase of the consumption volume due to adding the WM indication and recalculating the volume based on a 100% market share.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The updated ERA is considered acceptable and it does not change the conclusions drawn from ERA submitted with the initial MAA that ibrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.2.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Considering the above data, ibrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

The MAH has submitted an analysis of sparse PK data from the Study 1118E using 62 samples from 16 subjects receiving ibrutinib for WM. Study 1118E was an open Phase 2, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in previously treated, relapsed/refractory WM patients. Treatment was administered in 4-week cycles until progression for a total of up to 40 cycles. Subjects received ibrutinib orally at a dose level of 420 mg given once daily with approximately 240 mL of water; each dose of ibrutinib had been taken approximately at the same time each day at least 30 minutes before eating or at least 2 hours after a meal.

Ibrutinib concentrations in plasma were measured liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). Plasma samples were extracted using liquid/liquid extraction and subsequently analyzed using a chromatography method. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.500ng/mL, and the validated concentration range was 0.500-100 ng/mL.

Individual empirical Bayes PK parameters for ibrutinib were estimated for the subjects recruited in study 1118E, using the previous population PK model and parameters values (Bayesian feedback). The outcome was qualified using graphical exploration (including goodness of fit (GOF) plots and visual predictive checks (VPC) and calculating the prediction errors (%PE).

Standard of goodness fit are provided below:

A: observations [DV] vs population predictions [PRED]; B: observations [DV] vs individual predictions [IPRED]; C: conditional weighted residuals [CWRES] vs population predictions [PRED]; D: conditional weighted residuals [CWRES] vs time.

The distribution of covariates was similar to that reported in the previously reported population PK report model. The GOF plots, the graphical exploration of the empirical Bayes estimates and the VPC plots indicated the absence of bias in the individual predictions. Median PE% was -13.2%, i.e., within the predetermined cut-off value of ±15%.

Comparison of previous PK parameters against data from study 1118E is presented below:

The plots are log-scaled and show the median （thick line),the 1and 3\" quartiles (box),and outliers (dots).The position of the whiskers (i.e. the lines that go from the ends of the box to the most remote points that are no outliers) are adjusted for uimodal skewness°(range=1.5).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The approach taken is based on Bayesian feedback of new data to a previously developed PoP-PK model for ibrutinib to demonstrate that these new dataset in WM patient compares well to those estimated from PoP-PK data from previous data. Overall, the approach taken appears justifiable given the scarcity of the new data as estimating standard NC PK parameters is not an option, and the development of a new model is likely futile given the nature of the dataset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With the limitations linked to the sparse dataset, the updated population pharmacokinetic model indicated no differences between the pharmacokinetics in patients with WM as compared with other Bcell malignancies. There is thus no concern regarding potential differences in interaction risk or how to dose special populations in the new patient population.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Additional clinical pharmacology studies for Imbruvica are not required.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response studies

## Study 04753

Study PCYC-04753 was a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of ibrutinib in subjects with a variety of B-cell malignancies. Four subjects with a diagnosis of previously treated WM were enrolled and treated at 2 different dose levels: 3 subjects received 560 mg/day and 1 subject received 12.5 mg/kg. All 4 subjects were male with a median age of 65 years (range: 54 to 78 years). Median time since initial diagnosis was 102 months (range: 18 to 182 months). Subjects had received a median of 3 prior therapies (range: 1 to 5).

Average dose-normalized ibrutinib exposure based on the AUC was approximately 2 times higher in the 2.5 mg/kg dose cohort compared with the other cohorts in this study. Given the atypically high level of exposure to ibrutinib at the 2.5 mg/kg dose level and the intersubjective variability in plasma levels observed in this study (CV for Cmax: 59% to 136%; CV for AUC: 60% to 107%), there was concern that some subjects in a larger population may experience low exposures and may not achieve the targeted pharmacodynamic effect. Therefore, a dose greater than 2.5 mg/kg was considered necessary to achieve consistent, full BTK occupancy. In Study 04753, the next higher dose level above 2.5 mg/kg demonstrating full occupancy was 5.0 mg/kg (350 mg for a 70 kg individual), where absolute doses ranged from 280 mg/day to 600 mg/day. Taken together, these findings indicated that dose levels &gt;280 mg are likely necessary to achieve full PD effect in the vast majority of subjects.

Efficacy was a secondary objective of this study, with serum IgM reduction being the basis of the response assessment for patients with WM (Kimby 2006). Three subjects had a best response of PR (defined as IgM reduction of at least 50% from baseline) and continued on therapy for more than 3.5 years, and the fourth subject achieved stable disease but discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease after 8 months.

While the number of subjects with WM in the Phase 1 study was small (n=4), the overall safety profile in these subjects was consistent with the safety profile observed in subjects with other B-cell malignancies.

## Study 1102

Saturation of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) binding sites was confirmed at doses of 420 and 840 mg in subjects with CLL/SLL in Study 1102 (a Phase 1b/2, Open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL). Although ibrutinib plasma exposures

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were higher at 840 mg compared to 420 mg, there were no clinically meaningful advantages with regard to safety, efficacy and PD findings with the higher dose in subjects with CLL/SLL in Study 1102.

The once-daily dosing regimen of 420 mg/day ibrutinib was chosen for Study 1118E, in line with the dose used in subjects with CLL/SLL. Ibrutinib exposure in PK evaluable subjects in Study 1118E (n=16) receiving 420 mg/day was also within range of the exposure observed in subjects with CLL/SLL receiving the same dose level.

## 2.4.2. Main study

## PCYC-1118E

PCYC-1118E was a phase 2, single-arm, multi-centre study of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib, in subjects with previously treated Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

The main criteria for subject inclusion in the study were:

- Clinicopathological diagnosis of WM and meeting criteria for treatment using consensus panel criteria;
- Measurable disease, which was defined as the presence of serum IgM with a minimum IgM level of &gt;2 times the institutional ULN;
- At least 1 prior therapy for WM;
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of ≤ 2;
- Age ≥ 18 years;
- Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function;
- No active therapy for other malignancies with the exception of topical therapies for basal cell or squamous cell cancers of the skin.

## Exclusion criteria

Key exclusion criteria included anti-coagulation with warfarin therapy and known lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS), treatment with strong CYP3A4/5 and/or CYP 2D6 inhibitors, and significant cardiovascular disease.

## Treatments

Ibrutinib was administered orally at a dose of 420 mg daily in 4-week cycles. Subjects were evaluated for response and tolerance to ibrutinib on the first day of each cycle (4 weeks ±2 days) at Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and thereafter every 3 cycles (12 ±1 week) for a maximum of 40 four-week cycles (ie,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 3 years), or until disease progression. Participants were to be followed for up to two years after removal from or completion of the study, until new treatment or death, whichever occurs first.

Doses were to be withheld for any of the following conditions: Grade 4 ANC (&lt; 500/μL) for &gt; 7 days (neutrophil growth factors are permitted); Grade 3 Platelets (&lt; 50,000/μL) or, in subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, a platelet decrease of 50-74% from baseline in presence of bleeding; Grade 4 Platelets (&lt; 25,000/μL) or, in subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, decrease of &gt; 75% from baseline or &lt; 20,000/ μL, whichever is the larger decrease; Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (if persistent despite optimal antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal therapy); any other related grade 4 toxicities and any unmanageable non hematologic Grade 3 toxicities.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy in terms of Overall response rate (ORR) (&gt;25% reduction in disease burden), major response rates (&gt;50% reduction in disease burden), and VGPR/CR of ibrutinib in symptomatic WM patients with relapsed/refractory disease.

The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in symptomatic WM subjects with relapsed/refractory disease and to determine Progression free survival (PFS) and Time to next therapy (TTNT) of ibrutinib in symptomatic WM subjects with relapsed/refractory disease.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was the ORR per investigator assessment utilizing the adopted response criteria from the Third International Workshop on WM (see table below). Overall response rate was defined as a response assessment of minor response (MR:25-49% reduction in serum IgM levels) or better. The primary endpoint has also been assessed by IRRC.

Key secondary efficacy endpoints included major response rate (defined as PR or better, where PR was ≥50% reduction in serum IgM levels), duration of response (DOR: defined as time from the date of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

initial minor response or better for overall response - or partial response or better for major response to the date of the earliest occurrence of disease progression or death or date of censoring), time to response (TTR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS: defined as time from the date of first dose to the date of disease progression or death or date of censoring), overall survival (OS: defined as time from Study Day 1 to death or date of censoring) and haemoglobin improvement. For subjects with baseline haemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL, haemoglobin improvement was defined as an increase to &gt;11 g/dL with at least a 0.5 g/dL improvement or an increase of ≥ 2 g/dL over baseline; for subjects with baseline value &gt; 11 g/dL, haemoglobin improvement was defined as an increase of ≥ 2 g/dL over baseline; sustained haemoglobin improvement was defined as improvement that sustained continuously for ≥ 56 days without blood transfusion or growth factors.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the change in serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) as well as the assessments of tumours involvement in the bone marrow, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.

## Sample size

Assuming the response rate for ibrutinib is 50% in the study population with at least 60 evaluable subjects the study would have at least 80% power to declare that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for response rate would exceed 32%.

## Randomisation

## Blinding (masking)

N/A

## Statistical methods

Overall response rate as assessed by investigator, and IRRC assessments, along with their 95% confidence interval (CI) (Clopper-Pearson), were calculated using exact binomial distribution.

Subgroup analyses for ORR were performed for selected baseline characteristics and potential prognostic variables to explore the effect of these factors on clinical benefit in response to ibrutinib. The ORR and its corresponding exact binomial 95% CI were calculated for each subgroup.

An analysis for the primary endpoint, overall response rate (PR or better), was conducted at 6 months.

According to the Investigator Assessment, at the 18-month landmark, 86.1% (CI: 65.7%, 94.8%) of all responders (MR or better) remained alive and progression-free per investigator assessment, and the median duration of overall response was not reached. Per IRRC assessment, 80.9% of responders remained alive and progression-free at the 18-month landmark (CI: 64.9%, 90.2%); the median duration of overall response was not reached. The corresponding figures for major responders are 82.4% (CI: 58.1%, 93.3%) and 86.7% (CI: 67.9%, 94.9%), respectively.

Per investigator assessment, the median time to overall response was 1.0 month (range: 0.69 to 13.37 months), while the median time to major response was 1.6 months (range: 0.72 to 13.67 months).

Per IRRC assessment, the median time to overall response was 1.0 months (range: 0.69 to 13.37 months), while the median time to major response was 1.2 months (range: 0.72 to 13.37 months).

Reductions in serum IgM of ≥25% were observed in 89% of subjects. Levels continued to decrease up to cycle 12 (median serum IgM value: 10.5 g/dL).

Concerning the exploratory evaluation of the extent of WM in other compartments, in the bone marrow an  Independent pathology review showed improvement from baseline in cellularity in 39 of 54 subjects (72.2%), the median percentage of tumour involvement by cellularity at baseline was 60.0% and decreased to 30.0% by Cycle 12.

Reduction in adenopathy was observed in 38 (84%) of the patients who had complete follow-up scans available (45/50), as assessed by the Independent Radiology Review. Approximately 89% of subjects (32 of 36 evaluable) with major response were reported with any reduction of adenopathy and 4 of these subjects reported increased adenopathy.

Out of 26 subjects (41%) with splenomegaly at baseline, 25 had follow-up scans available and reduction in splenomegaly was observed in 24 of these (96%), as assessed by the Independent Radiology Review. Approximately 95% of subjects (20 of 21) with major response were reported with reduction/normalisation in spleen size. Any reduction in splenomegaly was reported for all 4 categorical non-responders.

## Combination Therapy Studies

A comprehensive review of published clinical studies with combination therapies in subjects with WM showed generally high response rates, comparable to ibrutinib (Dimopoulos 2013; Leblond 2001; Tedeschi 2012; Treon 2011b; Treon 2009a, 2009b; Treon 2014).

There is only 1 reported randomized, controlled study conducted with combination therapy in the relapsed setting. In this, study, 92 subjects with relapsed WM, were randomly assigned to fludarabine or cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-prednisone (CDP) chemotherapy. Partial responses were observed in 30% of subjects treated with fludarabine compared with only 11% in those treated with CDP (Leblond 2001). A study of bendamustine plus rituximab in the treatment of 30 subjects with relapsed or refractory WM resulted in an ORR of 83.3%; the median estimated PFS time was 13.2 months. In addition, 26.6% of subjects required dose reduction and/or truncation of therapy and 46.7% (14 of 30) of subjects completed all 6 planned cycles of bendamustine (Treon 2011b).

The majority of combination therapy studies in WM were conducted in the treatment-naïve setting. In a study of dexamethasone, rituximab, and bortezomib in subjects with treatment-naïve WM, the ORR was 85% and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 27%.

A study of carfilzomib, rituximab, and dexamethasone in 31 treatment-naïve subjects produced an 87% ORR, but only 32% of subjects received treatment for the total of 14 induction and maintenance cycles initially planned (Treon 2014). Treatment discontinuation or dose reduction was necessary for 30.2% (13 of 43) of subjects treated with rituximab and fludarabine. Specifically, treatment with rituximab was discontinued in 9% of subjects due to toxicity and in 21% of subjects with fludarabine (Treon 2009a). In a further study, 32.6% (14 of 43) of subjects treated with rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide discontinued due to toxicity (Tedeschi 2012).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The application in WM is based on the results obtained in the Study 1118E, a Phase II, single arm, multicentre study that recruited 63 patients with previously treated WM. Ibrutinib dose selection was not based on a MTD determination (as this was never reached); the selection of the 420-mg, oncedaily dose regimen of ibrutinib for the treatment of adult subjects with WM was based on the dosefinding 04753 study, a Phase I, open-label, multicentre, dose escalation study of ibrutinib in B-cell malignancies including 4 WM patients. The justification of the 420 mg once-daily dose was considered acceptable.

The median age of the study population was 63 years with approximately half of the population below the 65 years of age cut-off, with older age defining an adverse factor in the prognostic score. Although this median age corresponds to a slightly lower age at diagnosis than recently reported for WM overall (63-68 years), the reported age span at diagnosis varies considerably among published reports. The 1118E study population is considered representative for the general WM population with previously treated disease.

The primary endpoint (ORR per investigator assessment utilizing response criteria adopted from the third IWWM) and the independent review sensitivity analysis were considered appropriate for a single arm trial in this setting.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the primary analysis, the ORR (including MR) per investigator assessment, was 87.3% (CI: 76.5%, 94.4%) with the predominant response category being PR, 56%; best response of VGPR was reached in 14% of patients, giving a major response rate of 70%. Progressive disease was reported for 1 patient.

The primary endpoint, ORR by investigator, was also assessed by an independent review committee for which response notably demanded confirmatory data; the concordance rate was 95%. According to IRRC assessment, the ORR was 82.5% (CI: 70.9%, 90.9%), with 2 fewer VGPRs, 3 fewer PRs, 2 more MRs and 2 more SDs, and the major response rate was 62%. Thus, the result of this sensitivity analysis was considered to be supportive of the primary endpoint.

Follow-up was relative short at the CSR cut-off of 28 February 2014, 14.8 months, with high censoring rates for time-dependent outcomes and consequently immature data. However, updated analyses were submitted corresponding to a median duration of treatment increase from 11.7 months to 19.1 months. In the updated data (cut off: 19 Dec 2014) the ORR has increased from 87.3% to 90.5% (95% CI: 80.4%, 96.4%) with one more patients reaching PR and VGPR, respectively, giving a major response rate of 73% (69.8% at the previous cut-off); PD was still observed in 1 patient.

Results in terms of Response Rate have been provided in a small subgroup of patients from Study 1118E, comparing subjects with MYD88 mutation (N=55) versus wild type group (N=7). The ORR was 94.5% for the MYD88 group versus 71.5% of the wild type group; Overall and the depth of response (major response) was 94.5% and 80% in the MYD88 group versus 71.5% and 28.6% in the wild type group, respectively, showing that there might be a trend for a higher ORR and deeper responses in the mutated group. The CHMP recommended the MAH to submit the results of the MYD88 L265P mutation analyses. Furthermore, since the WHIM-like CXCR4 mutation can promote resistance to ibrutinib and is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the 2nd most frequent mutation described in WM the CHMP recommended the MAH to evaluate the potential prognostic and/or predictive value WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations.

During the assessment the CHMP raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further discussed, with reference to first line setting.  Based on historical comparisons of results obtained with ibrutinib in the R/R (Refractory/Relapsed) setting with efficacy and safety/tolerability for single drugs and combination therapies in the first line setting, the indication has been revised to include adult patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. The restricted indication was considered acceptable as there is no reason to expect inferior efficacy or a worse safety profile in the first line setting, and for the group of patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy, limited treatment options are currently available.

Study PCYC-1127, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ibrutinib or placebo in combination with rituximab in subjects with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, is currently ongoing and the CHMP recommended the MAH to submit the CSR.

Regarding the secondary endpoints, the medians for DOR, PFS and OS have not been reached; updated KM estimates at 18 months showed a decrease of event-free rate to 73.7% (86.1%) and PFS to 80% (83.2%), and an increase of OS to 95.2% (92.7%). With the new cut-off (19 Dec 2014), haemoglobin improvement has been achieved in 4 more patients in the all-treated population, 65% (59% in the previous cut off), and in 1 more patient in subjects with a baseline haemoglobin level ≤11 g/dL, 84% (82% in the previous cut off).

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Study 1118E provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of ibrutinib in terms of the primary endpoint with support of secondary outcomes in adult patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The evaluation of Imbruvica safety derives from the Study 1118E (data cut off: 28 February 2014, N=63) and the integrated safety data of the 420 patients who received ibrutinib in studies 1112 (a randomised, ongoing, Phase III study comparing ibrutinib to ofatumumab in patients with CLL or SLL, N=195), 1102 (a non-randomised, open-label study conducted in patients with CLL/SLL, N=51), 1104 (a non-randomised, open-label study in MCL patients, N=111) and 1118E. The posology administered was 560 mg daily in MCL patients and 420 mg daily in CLL and WM subjects.

An analysis of the long-term safety (cut-off 10 March 2014) of ibrutinib in 198 subjects who received monotherapy with the longest treatment duration and follow-up is based on integrated data from Studies 1102, 04753, and 1103 (an open-label, ongoing, extension study with 119 patients already treated with ibrutinib); the long-term safety population of 198 patients includes 4 subjects with WM. The cumulative number of patients in the long-term safety population who received treatment with ibrutinib for ≤ 1 year was 198, for &gt;1 to 2 years was 125, for &gt;2 to 3 years was 99, and for &gt;3 years was 65.

Pooled data from Studies 1112 (ibnutinib treated), 1102 (51 previously-treated subjects treated with 420 mg/day), 1104, and 1118E

Concerning the long-term safety analysis, at the time of the data cut-off (10 March 2014) the median duration of ibrutinib exposure was 24.1 months (range: 0.2 to 52.5). The median treatment duration for the ≤ 1, &gt;1 to 2, and &gt;2 to 3 year exposure periods was the same (12.0 months); for the &gt;3 years exposure period was 5.5 months. Among the four patients with WM, the duration of ibrutinib exposure ranged from 8.0 to 46.5 months (as of the data cut-off date). Three patients are currently remaining on treatment.

## Adverse Events of special interest

## Haemorrhage

In study 1118E, 44.4% of the patients experienced a haemorrhagic TEAE of any grade. The most common haemorrhagic events (≥5%) of any severity were epistaxis (19.0%), contusion (11.1%), and purpura (6.3%). One (1.6%) patient with von Willebrands disease experienced a major haemorrhagic event consisting of a non-fatal, Grade 3, post-procedural haematoma that was assessed as possibly related to study treatment; the event occurred in association with a bone marrow biopsy, reoccurred at a later time-point at the same site and ibrutinib was discontinued. All other haemorrhagic events in this study were Grade 1 or 2.

In the label pool, 49.3% experienced a haemorrhagic TEAE of any severity. The most common of these events (≥5%) were contusion (15.7%), petechiae (11.9%), epistaxis (11.4%) and increased tendency to bruise (9.3%). Grade 3 or 4 haemorrhagic events were experienced by 3.6% of the patients in the label pool. Grade 3 or 4 events experienced by more than one patient were subdural hematoma (five patients, 1.2%) and haematuria (two patients, 0.5%). Nineteen patients experienced major haemorrhagic events: post procedural haematoma (1), ecchymosis (1), epistaxis (1), haematuria (2), lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (1), post procedural haemorrhage (1), splenic haematoma (1), spontaneous haematoma (1), subdural haematoma (8), traumatic haematoma (1) and vitreous haemorrhage (1).

In 6 of the 8 cases of subdural haematoma there was a fall or head trauma or both prior to the event, five of the eight patients had concomitant anticoagulants, in all but three cases the level of platelets was ≥ 100. All but one case did eventually resolve, in the latter case ibrutinib was continued. In two cases there were no fall or head injuries. None of the eight cases was fatal.

In the long-term safety analysis one major haemorrhagic event (subdural haematoma reported during the third year of exposure) was fatal; this subject experienced bilateral subdural hematomas in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia, 30 days after his last dose of ibrutinib which had been discontinued due to disease progression.

## Infections

Treatment-emergent adverse events classified in the SOC 'infections and infestations' were reported for 73.0% of subjects in Study 1118E. The most commonly reported PTs included sinusitis (19.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (19.0%), folliculitis (11.1%), pneumonia (7.9%), urinary tract infection (7.9%), and influenza (6.3%). Infections of Grade 3-4 severity were observed in 14.3% of the patients and pneumonia was the most common type of infection of Grade 3-4 severity (eg, pneumonia, pneumonia haemophilus and pneumonia influenzal). In addition, other Grade- 3 infections reported by a single patient each included cellulitis, herpes zoster disseminated, influenza, pleural infection, streptococcal endocarditis and superinfection bacterial. Serious infectious events were reported in 17.5% of the patients. None were fatal. None of the infections resulted in treatment discontinuation or dose reduction, and no atypical infections were reported.

According to the long-term safety analysis, 5 subjects died due to infections: two (1.0%) subjects during the first year of exposure (pneumonia events), 2 (1.6%) subjects during the second year of exposure (sepsis and pneumonia events), and 1 (1.0%) subject during the third year of exposure (pneumonia). Overall, 33.8% of subjects in the long-term safety population experienced a Grade 3 or higher infectious TEAEs (23.2% for ≤ 1 year, 21.6% for &gt;1 to 2 year, 14.1% for &gt;2 to 3 year, and 12.3% for &gt;3 year exposure periods). The most common ( ≥ 3%) Grade 3 or higher infections were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pneumonia (16.2%), cellulitis (3.5%), and sepsis (3.5%). The prevalence of serious TEAEs in the SOC Infections and Infestations for the long-term safety population was 23.7% for ≤ 1 year, 20.8% for &gt;1 to 2 year, 11.1% for &gt;2 to 3 year, and 12.3% for &gt;3 year exposure periods. Infectious TEAEs led to ibrutinib discontinuation in 3.0% of subjects during the first year of exposure and 3.2% of subjects during the second year; no subject with &gt;2 years of ibrutinib exposure were discontinued due to an infectious TEAE.

N = number of subjects in the analysis set

TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event

Pooled data firom: Studies 1112 (ibrutinib treated), 1102 (51 previously-hreated subjects treated with 420 mg/day), 1104, and 1118E.

In the long-term safety population, the prevalence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in terms of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders remained stable during the second and third year of exposure (19.7% for ≤ 1 year, 11.2% for &gt;1 to 2 year, 11.1% for &gt;2 to 3 year, and 7.7% for &gt;3 year exposure periods). One subject was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia occurred during the first year of exposure.

## Cardiac Arrhythmias

Cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (7.9%), sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia (1.6% each), were reported in the 1118E study. No cases of atrioventricular block or atrial flutter were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the label pool, cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs reported in ≥1% of the 420 subjects treated with ibrutinib were atrial fibrillation (8.1%), sinus tachycardia (1.9%), sinus bradycardia (1.2%), and atrial flutter (1.0%).

Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent cardiac arrhythmias reported overall in ≥ 1% of subjects in the long-term safety population were atrial fibrillation (4.5%) and atrial flutter (1.0%).

## Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

Atrial fibrillation was reported for 5 patients in the 1118E study whereof three Grade 1-2 and two Grade 3. For 3 subjects, these events were reported as related to ibrutinib. Review of the medical history of the 5 patients with atrial fibrillation revealed that 3 out of the 5 patients had a prior history of atrial fibrillation. Discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy was reported for one patient with Grade-2 atrial fibrillation which worsened to Grade-3 atrial fibrillation and led to treatment discontinuation. None of the TEAEs of atrial fibrillation in Study 1118E were fatal.

In the label pool, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter TEAEs of any grade were reported in 34 (8.1%) and 4 (1.0%) patients respectively. A total of 37 patients experienced a TEAE of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter in the label pool (one patient experienced both TEAEs) whereof Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter were reported in 20 (54 %) patients respectively. None of the events of atrial fibrillation/flutter were fatal. Serious TEAEs of atrial fibrillation were reported in 20 patients while atrial flutter was serious in one patient. In two of the 37 patients (5.4%) atrial fibrillation and/or flutter events led to a dose reduction or treatment discontinuation.

In the long-term safety population the prevalence of Grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation was 2.0% for ≤ 1 year, 2.4% for &gt;1 to 2 year, 0% for &gt;2 to 3 year, and 3.1% for &gt;3 year annual exposure periods. The prevalence of Grade 3 or higher atrial flutter was 0%, 0.8%, 1.0% during the first, second, and third year of exposure, respectively, and 0% during the &gt;3 year exposure period. Serious TEAEs of atrial fibrillation occurred in 5.6% of subjects overall, with a prevalence rates of 3.0%, 2.4%, and 0% during the first, second, and third year of exposure, respectively, and 3.1% during the &gt;3 years exposure period. Serious TEAEs of atrial flutter occurred in 1.0% of subjects overall, with a prevalence of 0%, 0.8%, and 1.0% of subjects in the first, second and third years of exposure, and 0% during the &gt;3 year annual exposure period. Treatment-emergent events of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were not fatal in any subject in the long-term safety population and no subject discontinued study treatment due to these events.

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

No cases of TLS were reported in Study 1118E.

Four of the 420 patients (1.0%) in the label pool experienced TLS, each in the setting of disease progression. Events were assessed as Grade 3 or 4 in severity for three of these patients, one of which was serious (0.2%). None of the events of TLS were fatal, and none led to a reduction in the ibrutinib dose or treatment discontinuation.

## Hypersensitivity

No cases of anaphylactic reactions were reported among patients treated with ibrutinib in Study 1118E or in the larger label pool.

Hypersensitivity-like AE terms such as hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, urticaria, angioedema, swelling of face, and lip swelling were reported at low rates in the label pool (≤1.2%), but were not reported in any subject in Study 1118E. Most of these TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and for only 1 subject (0.2%) was a hypersensitivity-like TEAE assessed as Grade 3 or 4 (angioedema in label

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pool). The patient had a history of multiple food and drug allergies, including anaphylaxis, and experienced four episodes of worsening angioedema during the study.

## Eye Disorders

In the 1118E study, TEAEs in the SOC 'eye disorders' were observed in 19.0% of subjects. The two most common eye disorders were conjunctival hemorrhage and vision blurred (4.8% each). Retinal hemorrhage was reported for one patient. Each of these events was Grade 1-2 in severity. Retinal detachment, which occurred in two patients (3.2%, was of Grade-3 severity in one subject. None of the events in the 'eye disorders' SOC were serious nor did they require treatment discontinuation or dose reduction for resolution.

N = number of subjects in the analysis set

All malignancies duuing the study are included regardless if within or beyond 30 days of last dose.

Events are listed in order of descending frequency in the Study 111SE population.

Pooled data from: Studies 1112 (ibrutinib treated), 1102 (51 previously-hreated subjects treated with 420 mg/day), 1104, and 1118E

Sowce: Mod5.3.5.3/ISS/Tab2.10.1.

## Gastrointestinal Disorders

In Study 1118E, the MedDRA SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders was associated with the highest incidence of TEAEs (79.4%), with events of diarrhea (36.5%), nausea (20.6%), stomatitis (14.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (12.7%) being the most common. For one patient the GI TEAE was assessed as severe (Grade 3 abdominal pain). There were no Grade 4 reports. None of the GI TEAEs reported in study 1118E led to treatment discontinuation.

As in study 1118E, the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders was associated with the highest incidence of TEAEs (82.4%) in the label pool, but relatively few patients had Grade 3 (n=35, 8.3%). There were no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade 4 events reported. Grade 3 GI TEAEs reports included diarrhea (16 subjects, 3.8%), abdominal pain (9 subjects, 2.1%), nausea (5 subjects, 1.2%), and stomatitis (2 subjects, 0.5%). Notable Grade 3 GI TEAEs reported in a single patient in the label pool included colitis, intestinal obstruction, and small intestinal obstruction. For one patient, the GI TEAE was fatal (ileus paralytic). Three patients (0.7%) had GI TEAEs that led to discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment; for two patients, the event was severe (diarrhea). There were two patients with reports of pancreatitis-related TEAEs in the label pool (pancreatitis, pancreatitis chronic). One of the events of pancreatitis was considered serious but did not result in ibrutinib discontinuation.

## Renal Events

In study 1118E, TEAEs of any grade in the MedDRA SOC Renal and Urinary Disorders were reported in 3 subjects (4.8%) consisting of single reports of hematuria, renal failure acute, and urinary tract pain (1.6% each). Each of the TEAEs was assessed as Grade 1 or 2 and none were reported as serious or resulted in a dose reduction or treatment discontinuation.

In the label pool, TEAEs of any grade were reported in a higher proportion of subjects (15.7%) compared with study 1118E although the most common events were similar for the two safety populations. The most common TEAEs ( ≥ 2%) in the label pool were pollakiuria (3.6%), dysuria (2.9%), hematuria (2.9%), and renal failure acute (2.9%). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (3.3%) as well as serious events (2.4%) were infrequent in the label pool, of which renal failure acute (5 five patients [1.2%], 4 events were serious) was the most common severe and serious event. For one patient, the renal event (renal failure acute) was fatal. No TEAE resulted in a reduction of the ibrutinib dose or treatment discontinuation.

## Hepatic Events

One patient (1.6%) in study 1118E had a hepatobiliary TEAE. The event, cholecystitis, was reported as a nonfatal, serious event. The reported event did not result in a reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation.

In the label pool, TEAEs of any grade in the MedDRA SOC Hepatobiliary Disorders were reported in 3.8% of subjects, with hyperbilirubinemia (1.9%) and cholecystitis (1.0%) being the only events in this SOC reported in 1% or more of the patients. For three patients (0.7%), the hepatobiliary TEAEs were assessed as Grade 3 or 4 in severity, and these events consisted of single patients with hyperbilirubinemia, cholecystitis, and cholestasis (0.2% each). No patient had a fatal hepatobiliary event. Serious hepatobiliary TEAEs were reported in 3 (0.7%) patients (2 reports of cholecystitis; 1 report of cholestasis). One (0.2%) patient experienced a hepatic TEAE that resulted in a reduction of the dose (hepatic function abnormal) while no patient experienced a hepatobiliary TEAE that resulted in discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment.

## Hypertension

Hypertension was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event for 5 subjects (7.9%) in Study 1118E; the event was assessed as Grade 3 in severity for 1 subjects. Among the 420 subjects treated with ibrutinib in the label pool, hypertension was reported in 47 (11.2%) subjects; the event was assessed as Grade 3 or 4 in severity for 22 (5.2%) of these subjects. In addition, a treatmentemergent adverse event of blood pressure increased was reported for 3 subjects (0.7%), 1 of which was assessed as Grade 3 or 4. One subject (0.2%) in the label pool required an ibrutinib dose reduction as a result of an adverse event of hypertension. Thus, albeit that the absolute numbers of subjects experiencing treatment-emergent hypertension was relatively low, there appears to be no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increase in the frequency of treatment-emergent hypertension in Study 1118E when compared to rates expected based on previous experience with ibrutinib.

TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

Events are listed within each SOC in order of descending frequency in the Study 1118E population

N = number of subjects in the analysis population.

Pooled data from: Studies 1112 (ibrutinib treated), 1102 (51 previously-treated subjects treated with 420 mg/day), 1104, and 1118E.

## Deaths

In Study 1118E, one patient died due to worsening of pleural effusion 22 days after the last dose of study drug. The condition was attributed to disease progression.

In the label pool, TEAEs with a fatal outcome were reported for 38 subjects (9.0%) and were considered events related to disease progression and infections. Adverse events leading to death in more than 1 subjects in the label pool included MCL (8 subjects, all with MCL at baseline), pneumonia (including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; 6 subjects), Richter's syndrome (3 subjects, all with CLL at baseline), sepsis or neutropenic sepsis (4 subjects), cardiac arrest (2 subjects), and CLL (2 subjects, both with CLL at baseline). The primary cause of death for other subjects included events considered to be related to their underlying oncologic disease, sudden death, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, renal or respiratory failure, or shock.

## Safety in special populations

## Age

Close to 50% of the patients in the 1118E study were ≥ 65 years of age. In the ≥ 65 years subgroup, 58.1% of subjects experienced Grade 3 or higher TEAEs versus 43.8% in the younger subgroup; concerning serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation, the percentage was 48.4% vs 28.1% and 12.9% vs 6.3%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neutropenia was the only Grade 3 or 4 TEAE experienced by a higher proportion (absolute difference ≥ 10% higher) of patients in one age subgroup versus the other one and was reported by 25.0% of subjects &lt;65 years of age compared to 9.7% of those aged ≥ 65 years.

AEs according to age-groups in Study 1118E and in the pooled safety population are shown in Table 27 and Table 28, respectively:

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety evaluation includes a total of 420 patients that constitutes the integrated dataset (label pool) which includes the 63 WM patients in the pivotal 1118E study, 195 CLL/SLL patients from Study 1112, 51 CLL/SLL patients from Study 1102 and 111 MCL subjects from Study 1104.  The median duration of exposure to ibrutinib in the 1118E study, was about 12 months with a median average daily dose of 416 mg/day and 14.1 months in the pooled data with a median average daily dose of 419 mg/day.

All patients in study 1118E reported at least one TEAE. The highest incidence was reported for gastrointestinal disorders (79 %) and the most common TEAEs included diarrhoea (37 %), neutropenia (25 %), nausea, fatigue, and muscle spasms (21 % each), epistaxis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection (19 % each), thrombocytopenia (18 %), and anaemia (16 %). TEAEs in Infections and Infestations were also reported in a high proportion (73 %). The most common included sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection and folliculitis. Both the WM disease in itself and ibrutinib (by way of action) may contribute to the increase in susceptibility for infections.

For both the WM and CLL populations, an informative overview of the prevalence of the most commonly reported TEAEs illustrated by histograms have been provided by the MAH (data not shown). For the WM population as opposed to the CLL population, events of diarrhoea decrease over time and fatigue remain at the same low level throughout the treatment periods. There were no obvious accumulation/increases over time in regard to the WM population and overall no concern was raised. Any discrepancies between the two populations are considered related to the differences in disease characteristics between the two populations.

About 50 % of the patients in the 1118E study reported any Grade 3 or 4 events. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 TEAEs were hematologic events including neutropenia (18 %) and thrombocytopenia (13 %). Cumulatively, infectious events (including pneumonia and other respiratory events) were also frequently reported Grade 3-4 TEAEs (14 %). Serious TEAEs were reported for 38 % of the patients.

In the 1118E study one patient died while on study however this was attributed to disease progression.

About 10 % of the patients in the 1118E study experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and 11 % had TEAEs leading to dose reduction whereof four patients with Grade ≥ 3. Although recognising the relatively high proportions of TEAEs, serious TEAEs and Grade ≥ 3 events reported in the study, the proportion of patients that discontinued was considered low. Seven patients in study 1118E and 6 in the CLL population reported events leading to dose reductions and all of them recovered/resolved. In the CLL population all events leading to dose reductions recovered/resolved except for one case of conjunctivitis.

In study 1118E, 44% of the patients experienced a haemorrhagic TEAE of any grade. The most common were epistaxis (19 %), contusion (11 %), and purpura (6 %). One patient (with Von Willebrand disease) experienced a major haemorrhagic event consisting of a non-fatal, Grade 3, postprocedural haematoma (bone marrow biopsy).

In the label pool, 49 % experienced a haemorrhagic TEAE of any severity. The most common of these events were contusion (16 %), petechiae (12 %), epistaxis (11 %) and increased tendency to bruise (9 %). Grade 3 or 4 haemorrhagic events were experienced by 3.6%. A total of eight cases were reported of subdural haematoma whereof six cases were related to a fall/ head trauma. After review of study narratives it appeared that several were associated with fall/ trauma, however an adequate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

account of events of fall occurring in the WM study as well as for the CLL population has been provided and no concern has been evoked.

Cases of leukostasis have previously been reported in association with ibrutinib. There were however, no cases reported in the 1118E study.

Atrial fibrillation/ flutter have been reported in association with ibrutinib. The clinical relevance is however un-clear, but there were overall few discontinuations/ dose reductions due to these events and atrial fibrillation/ flutter are adequately highlighted in the SmPC section 4.4 with recommendations and measures to be considered/ taken.

No new safety concerns with regard to hepatic, renal or laboratory observations have been identified.

Based on the data from the long term safety population (198 patients) after a median of 2 years of follow up, it appears that there is no evidence of any cumulative toxicity.

In general no new ADRs have been included in the SmPC however based on the updated pooled analysis the frequencies of the following ADRs have been revised: epistaxis, skin infections and urinary tract infection.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

From the safety perspective, the safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with WM is overall consistent with what is already known in ibrutinib treated patients with CLL/SLL and MCL. No new safety signal has been evoked. No significant tolerability issues in the WM population as compared to the overall integrated dataset including CLL/SLL and MCL patient populations have been identified. In addition, data from the long-term safety population is not indicative of any cumulative toxicity.

It is concluded that ibrutinib has an acceptable safety profile to support the extension of the indication to include WM.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.0 is acceptable, barring any amendments to the safety specification that may be necessary in the light of questions on clinical safety raised by CHMP.

No new safety concerns were identified during the evaluation of this application but the safety specification of the RMP was updated with information on the epidemiology of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) and with the findings from clinical trials in WM patients (4 subjects with WM from Study PCYC-04753and 63 subjects with WM from Study 1118E).

No new pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed in this RMP update.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Finally, no significant changes to the risk minimisation measures have been proposed in this update.

As requested, TLS has been moved from an Important Potential Risk to an Important Identified Risk.

TLS is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC as well as listed in section 4.8 as an adverse reaction. Based on the risk assessment, the MAH believes that the wording included in the SmPC along with the pharmacovigilance plan and monitoring through routine pharmacovigilance activities are sufficient to manage the risk. No additional risk-minimisation activities are proposed. This is supported.

Relevant sections of the proposed RMP version 4.1 have been satifactorily updated and the RMP is therefore acceptable.

The CHMP endorsed the PRAC advice without further changes.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted which was acceptable based on the limited PI changes.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Based on the results of the primary endpoint (cut-off date 28 February 2014 corresponding to a median follow-up of 14.8 months) Overall Response Rate was 87.3% (CI: 76.5%, 94.4%) with the predominant response category being PR, 56%; no CR was obtained. The median time to overall response was 1.0 month (range: 0.69 to 13.37 months). These data were supported by the IRRC assessment.

Furthermore, a sustained (≥8 weeks) improvement in haemoglobin levels, a clinically highly relevant outcome, was reported in 59% of patients overall and in 82% of patients with ≤11 g/dL at baseline. Kaplan-Meier estimate of Progression Free Survival rate was 83.2%. Preplanned subgroup analyses generally showed a reasonably consistent treatment effect across the variables studied.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

One uncertainty was about the generalizability of the results to a broader setting, i.e. first line. The assessment of ibrutinib in naïve patients was based only on historical comparisons. However, the observed  ORR of 87.3%, as reported in the 1118E study, is reassuring in terms of activity, and numerically superior in inter-study comparisons with most published studies investigating other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monotherapy agents in previously treated and/or naive patients. Furthermore, the presence of the MYD88 L265P mutation in both untreated and previously treated WM patients, supporting the mechanistic rationale for treatment with ibrutinib in the treatment-naive setting.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The highest TEAE incidence in the Study 1118E was reported for gastrointestinal disorders (79 %) and the most common TEAEs included diarrhoea (37 %), neutropenia (25 %), nausea, fatigue, and muscle spasms (21 % each), epistaxis, sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infection (19 % each), thrombocytopenia (18 %), and anaemia (16 %).

Almost 50 % of the patients reported any Grade 3 or 4 events. The most frequently reported being hematologic events (neutropenia [18 %] and thrombocytopenia [13 %]). One death occurred while on study which was attributed to disease progression.

About 10 % patients experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and seven (11 %) had TEAEs leading to dose reduction whereof four patients with Grade ≥ 3. Although recognizing the relatively high proportions of TEAEs, serious TEAEs and Grade≥ 3 events reported in the 1118E study, patients that discontinued and /or had dose reductions due to TEAEs are considered low.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No new uncertainties in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects have emerged. Previously known uncertainties including other malignancies, cardiac safety and long term safety are to be addressed in future study updates and within the RMP.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The observed effect in terms of the primary endpoint supported by secondary outcome measures in the pivotal study is clearly of importance for WM patients. An ORR of 87.3%, as reported in the 1118E study, when combined with a sustained improvement of the haemoglobin level in 59% of patients overall, is reassuring in terms of activity, and numerically superior in inter-study comparisons with most published studies investigating other monotherapy agents in previously treated and/or naive patients.

The safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with WM is overall consistent with what is already known in ibrutinib treated patients with CLL/SLL and MCL and no new safety signal has been evoked.

## Benefit-risk balance

The efficacy of ibrutinib in the target population is considered clinically relevant and, in the view of the safety profile, the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks and uncertainties. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Considering the current treatment landscape and general outcomes in WM, the positive B/R based on reassuring activity and durable responses were reported with ibrutinib in the single-armed 1118E study, with no new major safety or tolerability issues identified, it is sufficient to justify the positive benefit/risk of ibrutinib for the treatment of previously treated WM. The inclusion also of first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo or immunotherapy was based on historical comparisons of results obtained with ibrutinib in the R/R setting with efficacy and safety/tolerability for single drugs and combination therapies in the first line setting. Reference is also made to the presence of the MYD88 L265P mutation in both untreated and previously treated WM patients, supporting the mechanistic rationale for treatment with ibrutinib in the treatment-naive setting. There is no reason to expect inferior efficacy or a worse safety profile in the first line setting for the group of patients unsuitable for chemo or immunotherapy for whom no satisfactory treatment options are currently available.
