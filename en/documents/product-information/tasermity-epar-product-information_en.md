## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Tasermity 800 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each tablet contains 800 mg sevelamer hydrochloride.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

| Serum phosphate level in patients not on phosphate binders   | Starting dose of Sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.76 - 2.42 mmol/L (5.5-7.5 mg/dl)                           | 1 tablet, 3 times per day                                 |

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet (tablet) The off-white, oval tablets are imprinted with 'SH800' on one side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Tasermity is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Starting dose The recommended starting dose of sevelamer hydrochloride is 2.4 g or 4.8 g per day based on clinical needs and serum phosphorus level. Sevelamer hydrochloride must be taken three times per day with meals. For patients previously on phosphate binders, Sevelamer hydrochloride should be given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. Titration and maintenance Medicinal product no longer authorised

Serum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride titrated by 0.8 g three times per day (2.4 g/day) increments with the goal of lowering serum phosphate to 1.76 mmol/L (5.5 mg/dl) or less. Serum phosphate should be tested every two to three weeks until a stable serum phosphate level is reached and on a regular basis thereafter.

The dose range may vary between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal. The average actual daily dose used in the chronic phase of a one year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.

## Renal impairment

The safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in predialysis patients.

## Method of administration

For oral use

Patients should take sevelamer hydrochloride with meals and adhere to their prescribed diets. The tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to administration.

4.3 Contraindications · Hypersensitivity to sevelamer or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. · Hypophosphataemia · Bowel obstruction. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Efficacy and safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with: · swallowing disorders · active inflammatory bowel disease · gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, diverticulosis, retention of gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion · patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery Therefore caution should be exercised when sevelamer hydrochloride is used in patients with these disorders. Intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with sevelamer hydrochloride. Sevelamer hydrochloride treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Fat-soluble vitamins Depending on diet intake and the nature of end stage renal failure, dialysis patients may develop low vitamin A, D, E and K levels. It cannot be excluded that sevelamer hydrochloride can bind fat-soluble vitamins contained in ingested food. Therefore, in patients not taking these vitamins, monitoring vitamin A, D and E levels and assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of thromboplastin time should be considered and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary. Additional monitoring of vitamins and folic acid is recommended in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, since in the clinical study, vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in these patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Folate deficiency

There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term sevelamer hydrochloride treatment.

## Hypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia

Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Sevelamer hydrochloride does not contain calcium. Serum calcium levels should be monitored as is done in normal follow-up of a dialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolic acidosis

Patients with chronic renal failure are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis.  Worsening of acidosis has been reported upon switching from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of studies where lower bicarbonate levels in the sevelamer-treated patients compared to patients treated with calcium-based binders were observed.  Closer monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended.

## Peritonitis

Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to the dialysis modality. Peritonitis is a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in a clinical study with sevelamer hydrochloride, a number of peritonitis cases were reported. Therefore, patients on PD should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.

Cases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including serious complications such as bleeding, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis, …) associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported in literature. However, the causality of the sevelamer crystals in initiating such disorders has not been demonstrated. Sevelamer hydrochloride treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms.

Swallowing and choking difficulties Uncommon reports of difficulty swallowing the sevelamer hydrochloride tablet have been reported. Many of these cases involved patients with co-morbid conditions including swallowing disorders or oesophageal abnormalities.  Caution should be exercised when sevelamer hydrochloride is used in patients with difficulty swallowing. Hypothyroidism Closer monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). Long term chronic treatment As data on the chronic use of sevelamer hydrochloride for over one year are not yet available, potential absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment cannot be totally excluded (see section 5.2). Hyperparathyroidism Sevelamer hydrochloride alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. Serum chloride Serum chloride may increase during sevelamer hydrochloride treatment as chloride may be exchanged for phosphorus in the intestinal lumen. Although no clinically significant serum chloride increase has been observed in the clinical studies, serum chloride should be monitored as is done in the routine follow-up of a dialysis patient. One gram of sevelamer hydrochloride contains approximately 180 mg (5.1 mEq) chloride. Inflammatory Gastrointestinal Disorders Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Dialysis

Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis.

## Ciprofloxacin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer hydrochloride should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin.

## Anti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products

Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials. Caution should be exercised when prescribing sevelamer hydrochloride to patients also taking these medicinal products.

Levothyroxine During post marketing experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. Closer monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal products. Ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients Reduced levels of ciclosporin,  mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (i.e graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal. Digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. Proton pump inhibitors During post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in patients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride. Bioavailability Sevelamer hydrochloride is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer hydrochloride, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in pregnant women. In animal studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Sevelamer hydrochloride should only be given to pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Breast-feeding

The safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Sevelamer hydrochloride should only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3).

## Fertility

There are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown that sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface area.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Sevelamer hydrochloride has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

The most frequently occurring (≥5% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal disorders system organ class. Tabulated list of adverse reactions In parallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 weeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks were conducted Adverse reactions from these studies (299 patients),  from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients) and that were spontaneously reported from post-marketing experience are listed by frequency in the table below. The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). * post-marketing experience Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.9 Overdose

Sevelamer hydrochloride has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the equivalent of seventeen 800 mg tablets, per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02.

Tasermity contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.

In clinical trials, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The effects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up. Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In clinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 weeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change. In the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer hydrochloride alone did not have a consistent and clinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism sevelamer hydrochloride should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the iPTH levels. In a clinical trial of one-year duration, sevelamer hydrochloride had no adverse effect on bone turnover or mineralisation compared to calcium carbonate. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Sevelamer hydrochloride   is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients (see section 4.4). 5.3 Preclinical safety data Medicinal product no longer authorised

In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid.

In a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper was detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials.

Currently, no formal carcinogenicity data are available. However, in  vitro and in  vivo studies  have indicated  that  sevelamer    does  not  have  genotoxic  potential.  Also  the  medicinal  product  is  not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity or  teratogenicity  at  the  doses  tested  (up  to  1  g/kg/day  in  rabbits  and  up  to  4.5  g/kg/day  in  rats). Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with sevelamer at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg. The effects may be secondary to vitamin D and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Tasermity 800 mg film-coated tablets sevelamer hydrochloride

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

-If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Tasermity is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you take Tasermity 3. How to take Tasermity 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Tasermity 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Tasermity is and what it is used for Tasermity contains sevelamer as the active ingredient. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive tract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. Tasermity is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment. Adult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. The amount of phosphate then rises (your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard deposits in your body called calcification. These deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. Tasermity may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin D supplements to control the development of renal bone disease. 2. What you need to know before you take Tasermity Do not take Tasermity: · if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- if you have bowel obstruction.
- if  you  are  allergic  to  sevelamer  or  to  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in section  6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before taking Tasermity if any of the following applies to you:

- if you are not on dialysis
- if you have swallowing problems
- if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel
- if you have symptoms of delayed emptying of stomach contents such as feeling of fullness, nausea and/or vomiting
- if you have prolonged diarrhoea or pain in the abdomen (symptoms of active inflammatory bowel disease)
- if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel.

Additional treatments : Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: · develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Tasermity does not contain calcium your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. · have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as necessary. Changing treatment : When you switch from another phosphate binder to Tasermity, your doctor might consider monitoring the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Tasermity may decrease the levels of bicarbonate. Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis: You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, K and folic acid. Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) have not been studied. Therefore Tasermity is not recommended for use in this population. Other medicines and Tasermity Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. · Tasermity should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). · If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor before taking Tasermity.
