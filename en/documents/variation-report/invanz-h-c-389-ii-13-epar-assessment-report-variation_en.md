## 1. Introduction

Ertapenem  sodium  is a sterile, synthetic, long-acting, parental,  1 β -methylcarbapenem  that is structurally  related  to β -lactam  antibiotics  with  activity  against  a  wide  range  of  gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins.

Ertapenem  sodium  is  a  white  to  off-white  hygroscopic,  crystalline  solid.  It  is  soluble  in  water  and 0.9% sodium chloride solution, practically insoluble in ethanol, and insoluble in isopropyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran.

Invanz  is  supplied  as  sterile  lyophilised  powder  for  intravenous  infusion  after  reconstitution  with appropriate  diluent  and  transfer  to  50  ml  0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection;  or  for  intramuscular injection  following  reconstitution  with  3.2  ml  of  1%  lidocaine  hydrochloride.  Each  vial  contains 1.046 grams (g) ertapenem sodium, equivalent to 1 g ertapenem.

The initial Marketing Authorisation was granted on 18 April 2002 by the European Commission.

In November 2004 the MAH submitted the present type II variation to include 'Complicated skin and soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot infections' for the current approved indications:

'Treatment of the following infections in adults when caused by bacteria known or very likely to be susceptible to ertapenem and when parenteral therapy is required:

- Intra-abdominal infections
- Acute gynaecological infections'
- Community acquired pneumonia

On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  a  clinical  study  named  'Protocol  034', a  prospective,  randomised, multicenter,  double-blind,  active-treatment-controlled,  non-inferiority  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  ertapenem  versus  piperacillin/tazobactam  (P/T)  in  the  treatment  of diabetic  foot  infections  (DFI)  in  adults ,  the  MAH  submitted  an  application  for  an  extension  of indication of the use of Invanz to 'Complicated skin and soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot infections'.  Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  data  submitted, the  extension  of  indication  has  been restricted to 'diabetic foot infections of skin and soft tissue'.

## 2. Clinical aspects

## 2.1 Clinical efficacy

##  Description of the main study: Protocole 034.

Protocol  034  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multicentre,  double-blind,  active-treatment-controlled, non-inferiority  study  conducted  in  89  centres  in  the  USA  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  and efficacy of ertapenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) in the treatment of diabetic foot infections (DFI)  in  adults.  This  study,  which  began  on  27  April  2001  (FPI)  and  ended  21  April  2004,  was anticipated to enrol 600 patients (300 on ertapenem) from 89 study sites in the United States, in order to  achieve  200  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  each  treatment  group.  Each  patient  was  expected  to complete  the  study,  including  follow-up,  within  6  weeks.  Last  Patient  Out  (LPO)  was  on  21  April 2004 and all data was received in-house by 24 June 2004.

##  Methods and results from the main study: Protocole 034.

## -Methods

The newly submitted study (P034) was initiated in 27 April 2001 and finished in 21 April 2004, and conducted at 89 centres in the United States.

The  study  was  conducted  in  conformance  with  applicable  country  or  local  requirements  regarding ethical committee review, informed consent, and other statutes or regulations regarding the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in biomedical research.

## Study objectives

- -The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam with respect to the clinical response in patients evaluable for clinical efficacy at the Discontinuation of IV Therapy Assessment.
- -Secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of ertapenem and piperacillin /tazobactam in patients evaluable at the Follow-Up Assessment, 10 days post antibiotic therapy with respect to:
- a. Clinical response in patients at the Follow-Up Assessment.
- b.  Clinical  and microbiological response at the Follow-Up Assessment in patients with a confirmed microbiologic pathogen.
- c. Clinical response in patients at DCIV therapy.
2.  To  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  ertapenem  and  piperacillin/tazobactam  with  respect  to drug-related adverse experiences (AEs), drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs), and drug-related adverse events (AEs) leading to study drug discontinuation.

As  an  additional  exploratory  objective,  the  study  also  aimed  at  the  evaluation  of  the  relationship between  the  Diabetic  Foot  Infection  (DFI)  Wound  Score  of  the  primary  wound  site  and  clinical response.

## Enrolment - Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to enroll patients with appropriate diabetic foot infections that were likely to require 5 to 28 days of parenteral therapy and were not complicated by preexisting conditions which could confound the evaluation of the efficacy or safety profiles of the study drugs.

Particularly, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered:

- -For a clinical diagnosis of diabetic foot infection, patients must have had well-documented signs and symptoms of acute infection located on or above the foot, but not extending past the knee.
- -For  patients  who  had  received  a  &gt;7  day  course  of  prior  antibiotic  therapy  or  in  whom pseudomonas  infection  was  suspected,  wound  cultures  were  to  be  taken  to  rule  out  pathogens resistant to either study drug. If culture results identified pathogen(s) resistant to either study drug after initiating treatment but the patient showed clinical improvement the patient could remain in the  study  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  (upon  ammendment  of  the  initial  protocol,  which required that patients with resistant pathogens at screening would not be enrolled).
- -In cases in which patients had prior surgery, at least 7 days must have elapsed before entry into the study.
- -Infection  had  to  be  without  the  presence  of  unremovable  indwelling  foreign  material  (such  as prosthetic  or  surgical  hardware)  or  evidence  of  gangrene  that  could  not  be  removed  with debridement. In cases in which surgical debridement and wound approximation was performed, and, in the opinion of the physician, there was a need to maintain sutures in the wound, the patient was considered eligible if all other criteria were met.
- -Patients  who  receive  empiric  vancomycin  therapy  for  treatment  of  enterococcal  or  MRSA infection or a history of MRSA infection would be considered clinically and   microbiologically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- unevaluable if entry cultures are only positive for methicillin resistant S. aureus or other organisms susceptible to vancomycin. Patients treated with vancomycin who have mixed infections will be considered  clinically  evaluable.  Gram-positive  pathogens  will  be  non-evaluable  and  gramnegative pathogens and anaerobes will be evaluable.
- -Patients  who received more than 24 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy known to be effective against the presumed or documented etiologic pathogen(s) within the 3 days prior to receipt of the first  dose  of  study  drug,  except  for  those  patients  entered  as  clinical  failures  on  prior  antibiotic therapy with a positive baseline wound culture, would be considered non-evaluable. In addition, any non-study antibiotic therapy administered between the time of the first dose of study drug and the follow-up assessment would make the patient nonevaluable .

Patients with known or suspected osteomyelitis underwent an additional review. The roentgenographic  changes  characteristic  of  osteomyelitis  can  take  several  weeks  to  appear  on  plain films,  resulting  in  falsely  negative  x-ray  findings  early  in  infection.  Before  the  assessment  of evaluability was made, a determination of whether osteomyelitis was present at eligibility screening was made based on the date of diagnosis. A window of 7 days from eligibility screening was selected as  a  conservative  estimate  for  detection  of  pre-existing  osteomyelitis.  Patients  with  osteomyelitis diagnosed within 48 hours of initiation of study therapy were considered clinically non-evaluable due to  baseline  medical  condition  unless  all  infected  bone  was  removed  as  described  in  the  DAP.  For patients with osteomyelitis detected between 48 hours and Study Day 7, the investigator was queried to confirm whether osteomyelitis was present at study entry. If, in the investigator's clinical judgment, osteomyelitis was present at study entry, the patient was clinically non-evaluable. If osteomyelitis was diagnosed after Study Day 7, the patient was considered a clinically evaluable failure, unless, in the opinion of the investigator, extenuating circumstances precluded classification as a failure, in which case the clinical response could be indeterminate.

The  studied  population  cannot  be  considered  representative  for  the  major  group  of  patients  with diabetic  foot  infections,  which  generally  includes  osteomyelitis  and  severely  impaired  perfusion. Therefore as patients with osteomyelitis have not been included in this study, the CHMP decided that a statement should be included in section 4.4 of the SPC to reflect that the efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not been established .

Adult  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  who  met  all  of  the  entry  criteria  and  had  a  clinically  or bacteriologically documented diabetic foot infection (defined as at least the presence of cellulitis with or without ulceration, or purulent discharge) judged by the investigator to require parenteral antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 28 days were enrolled. For a clinical diagnosis of diabetic foot infection, the primary site of infection was required to have either purulent drainage from the wound and/or at least 3 established signs and symptoms of acute infection located on or above the foot, but not extending past the knee.

Patients  had  an  initial  eligibility  screening  assessment  within  48  hours  prior  to  initiation  of  study therapy  that  included  a  complete  physical  examination,  detailed  clinical  wound  assessment  of  the primary  and  any  secondary  wounds,  a  baseline  wound  culture,  and  an  x-ray  examination  of  the involved lower extremity. Investigators were instructed to make every attempt to obtain a deep tissue culture,  however  if  no  culture  was  obtained  or  if  no  baseline  pathogen  was  isolated,  the  patient remained in the study for clinical evaluation. If culture results from an appropriately obtained wound specimen were not available at the time of the eligibility screening, a patient could have been entered into the study pending the culture results.  If the culture results were negative, then the patient was considered  to  be  nonevaluable  and  must  have  been  withdrawn  from  the  study.  (Subsequently,  in Protocol Amendment 02, this was further elaborated to include: If the culture results were negative, but the patient showed clinical improvement, they could be continued in the study at the investigator's discretion.)  If  the  baseline  culture  was  known  prior  to  enrolment  to  contain  a  pathogen  resistant  to either study drug, the patient should not have been enrolled in the study. If the baseline culture was found  during  the  study  to  be  resistant  to  either  of  the  study  drugs  and  there  was  no  clinical improvement, the patient  should  have  been  discontinued  as  a  failure;  if  the  patient  was  improving, he/she  was  allowed  to  remain  in  the  study  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator.  (Subsequently,  in Protocol Amendment 02, this was further elaborated to include : Patients with pathogens identified as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resistant to either study drug after initiating study therapy but who showed clinical improvement could be continued in the study at the discretion of the investigator.)

## Randomisation

Diabetic patients who met all of the entry criteria were randomised to 1 of the 2 study regimens in a 1:1 ratio. Allocations were stratified for severity of disease based on the baseline classification of the primary wound according to the University of Texas Wound Classification Scale. Infections classified as  Grade  0  Stage  B,  Grade  0  Stage  D,  Grade  1  Stage  B,  and  Grade  1  Stage  D  were  considered moderate diabetic foot infections (Stratum I), while infections classified as Grade 2 Stage B, Grade 2 Stage  D,  Grade  3  Stage  B,  and  Grade  3  Stage  D  were  considered  severe  (but  not  life-threatening) infections (Stratum II).

## Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses

Five  (5)  amendments  to  the  original  protocol  (34-01,  034-02,  034-04,  034-05,  and  034-06)  were implemented  prior  to  unblinding  the  study.  One  amendment  (034-03)  incorporating  an  exploratory health economics objective was not released to investigators and was never implemented.

Two amendments were medically significant, both contained in amendment 02 which was the single protocol  amendment that clarified  multiple  parameters  for  the  study.  Also  in  this  protocol,  was  the clarification for evaluability of :  'The evaluability criteria were revised to indicate that patients who received more than 24 hours of systemic antibiotic therapy known to be effective against the presumed or documented etiologic pathogen(s) within the 3 days prior to the first dose of study therapy would be non-evaluable, except for those patients entered as clinical failures on prior antibiotic therapy.' These and other details of the amendments appear to increase/clarify the details of study parameters without changing their material nature, including clarifications of primary wound site in patients with multiple sites  of  infection  in  the  lower  extremity  so  that  the  tertiary  objective  evaluating  the  Diabetic  Foot Infection Wound Score and clinical response was clarified to apply only to the primary wound.

## Study medication and Dosage

Ertapenem was given as a single daily dose of 1 g IV.  P/T was given at 3.375 g per dose IV every 6 hours.  To  maintain  blinding,  a  matching  IV  placebo  was  administered  at  hours  6,  12,  and  18  to patients randomised to receive ertapenem. The recommended duration of therapy was 5 to 28 days. Consistent with common clinical practice for the management of patients with DFI, investigators had an option to switch patients after at least 5 days of IV study therapy to a protocol specified oral followup antibiotic, amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg Q12 hours), if they had responded sufficiently and had met protocol-specified criteria for clinical improvement.  Patients were to receive at least 5 days of parenteral therapy and to receive no less than 80% of the minimum and no greater than 120% of the maximum  recommended  antibiotic  (IV  alone  or  IV  plus  optional  oral)  study  therapy.  With  the exception of open-label vancomycin for resistant Gram-positive infections, use of non-study systemic or topical antimicrobials was not permitted. Open label vancomycin was permitted in this study for treatment  of Enterococcus or  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA) according  to  the usual practice of the investigator.

The comparator in the  study,  P/T,  has  a  broad  spectrum  of in  vitro activity  encompassing  relevant pathogens  in  this  condition  and  is  licensed  for  the  treatment  of  skin  and  skin  structure  infections, (including ischemic/diabetic foot infections in the US).

After  a  period  of  parenteral  study  therapy,  the  patients  could  have  been  switched  to  an  oral antimicrobial if they had improved sufficiently.  Patients were required to meet criteria specified in the protocol before the investigator could have elected to change to oral therapy. The oral switch agent was amoxicillin/clavulanate, 875/125 mg twice daily. The investigator could have utilised another oral switch agent if baseline pathogens demonstrated resistance to the protocol-specified oral switch agent or if the patient was intolerant of the protocol-specified oral switch agent.

Open  label  vancomycin  was  permitted  in  this  study  for  treatment  of Enterococcus or  methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) according to the usual practice of the investigator. However,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these patients were considered clinically and microbiologically non-evaluable if entry cultures were only  positive  for  Gram-positive  organisms.  Patients  who  received  vancomycin  may  have  been considered evaluable if they had mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative or anaerobic infections; in the per pathogen analyses for these patients, only the Gram-negative pathogens and anaerobes were considered and the outcomes for vancomycin susceptible Gram-positives were considered indeterminate.

The ertapenem dose for this study was based on the results of the Clinical Pharmacology multipledose study, and upon the susceptibility of the organisms presumed to be the infecting bacteria, and/or Phase III data. Piperacillin/tazobactam was chosen as the comparator because it is used commonly to treat diabetic foot infections and has been previously shown to be safe and effective in treating these infections.  The  dosage  selected  was  the  usually  recommended dose for this indication. It should be noted that the US dose regimen for piptazobactam (3 g piperacillin/375 mg tazobactam) delivers the same total daily dose of each component as 4 g/500 mg t.i.d. but the plasma profiles are inevitably different. There are currently no oral antibiotics indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot infections. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as the oral switch agent because it is commonly used to treat skin and skin structure infections and has activity both in vitro and in clinical studies against the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens commonly associated with diabetic foot infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus(methicillin-sensitive) .  The  usual  adult  dose  for  amoxicillin/clavulanate  is  500 mg  every 12  hours.  For  more  severe  infections  the  dose  should  be  875  mg  every  12  hours  or  500  mg  every 8 hours. For this study a dose of 875 mg every 12 hours was chosen.

## Efficacy evaluation

Clinical  assessment  of  the  infectious  process  was  performed  at  eligibility  screening,  Day  5  of  IV therapy, at the discontinuation of IV therapy (DCIV), at the discontinuation of oral therapy (DCOral) and at the Follow-up Assessment 10-day post antibiotic therapy (FUA). Overall clinical response was evaluated by the investigator at the DCIV and FUA visits. Microbiological response assessments were made separately for each pathogen identified at eligibility screening. Patients were monitored daily for adverse experiences and tolerability at the site of study drug infusion.

The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of DCIV clinically evaluable patients who had a favorable clinical response assessment at the DCIV visit. Clinical response assessments were made by the investigator for all patients at Day 5 of IV Therapy, DCIV Visit, DCOral Visit and FUA Visit. For the efficacy analysis, only the clinical responses at DCIV and the FUA were considered.

The secondary endpoints were: (1) The proportion of FUA clinically evaluable patients who had a favorable clinical response assessment ('cure' or 'improvement') at the Follow-Up Assessment, 10 days  post  antibiotic  therapy.  (2)  The  proportion  of  FUA  clinically  and  microbiologically  evaluable patients who had both a favorable clinical ('cure' or 'improvement') and favorable microbiological ('eradication'  or  'presumptive  eradication')  response  to  baseline  pathogens  at  the  Follow-Up Assessment 10 days post antibiotic therapy. (3) The proportion of FUA clinically evaluable patients who had a favorable clinical response assessment ('cure' or 'improvement') at Discontinuation of IV therapy.

The exploratory endpoints were: (1) The DFI Wound Score of the primary wound at all scheduled time  points.  (2)  The  proportion  of  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable  patients  who  had  a  favorable microbiological response assessment ('eradication' or 'presumptive eradication') at Discontinuation of IV Therapy Assessment. (3) The proportion of FUA microbiologically evaluable patients who had a favorable  microbiological  response  assessment  ('eradication'  or  'presumptive  eradication')  at  the Follow-Up Assessment, 10 days post antibiotic therapy.

A microbiological  response was  assessed  separately  for  each  pathogen  identified  in  the  prestudy wound and blood cultures at the DCIV, DCOral, and FUA visits.

## Definitions of populations

The following terms are used to describe the study populations analysed in this study:

- Screened population: all patients who signed a consent form for the study. This population includes those  patients  who  were  not  randomised  to  therapy  and  those  patients  who  were  randomised  to therapy.
- Randomised  population: a  subset  of  the  screened  population  comprised  of  patients  who  were randomised to a study regimen, irrespective of whether the patient  actually  received  study therapy. Patients randomised  to one treatment group who, due to dispensing errors, mistakenly received study therapy  with  the  other  study  treatment  for  the  entire  parenteral  study  period  were  analysed  and displayed  throughout  the  report  based  on  the  study  therapy  actually  received.  No  patients  received both parenteral study medication at any time during the study.
- Treated Population: a subset of the randomised  population comprised of patients who received at least one dose of study therapy. Only treated patients are included in the safety analysis.
- Clinical Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) population: a subset of the treated population that met the minimal disease definition. The Microbiologic MITT population , a subset of the clinical MITT population, was comprised of those clinical MITT patients who had a baseline pathogen identified, regardless of susceptibility to study agents, and a microbiological response assessed. Determination of the  clinical  and  microbiologic  MITT  populations  was  made  prior  to  unblinding  using  prespecified criteria as indicated in the DAP .
- DCIV Clinically  Evaluable  population: a  subset  of  the  clinical  MITT  population  comprised  of patients who  met  the evaluability criteria specified in the DAP  up  to  and  including their discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  assessment.  This  population  comprises  patients  in  whom  sufficient information was available to determine their outcome at discontinuation of IV therapy and for whom no confounding factors were present that interfered with the assessment of that outcome.
- FUA  Clinically  Evaluable  population: A  subset  of  the  DCIV  Clinically  Evaluable  population comprised of patients who met the evaluability criteria specified in the DAP up to and including their 10 day post-antibiotic follow-up assessment. This population comprises patients in whom sufficient information  was  available  to  determine  their  outcome  at  the  follow-up  assessment,  10  days  postantibiotic  therapy,  and  for  whom  no  confounding  factors  were  present  that  interfered  with  the assessment of that outcome.
- The  FUA  Microbiologically  Evaluable  population ,  a  subset  of  the  FUA  clinically  evaluable population, is comprised of those clinically evaluable patients who had a baseline pathogen identified and a microbiological response assessed at FUA. Furthermore, it was required that one or more of these baseline pathogens were susceptible to both parenteral study therapies. As all microbiologically evaluable patients were  required to be clinically evaluable, the population of clinically  and microbiologically evaluable patients is identical to the microbiologically evaluable population; for all data  presented  hereafter,  this  group  will  be  referred  to  as  the  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable population.

(Determinations of evaluability were made prior to unblinding using prespecified criteria as indicated in the DAP.)

## Profile of Patient Enrolment

## Analysis populations

Efficacy results were determined using an 'evaluable-patients-only' approach and a 'modified intentto-treat' (MITT) approach. The 'evaluable-patients-only' approach was the primary efficacy analysis. Two 'evaluable-patients-only' populations were identified. The first contained all patients who were deemed clinically evaluable up to and including the discontinuation of their IV therapy assessment. The  second  contained  all  patients  who  were  deemed  clinically  evaluable  up  to  and  including  the 10-day post antibiotic therapy follow-up assessment. The population evaluable at DCIV will be used to address the primary hypothesis. All other analyses will be considered in those clinically evaluable at the follow-up assessment.

To address  the  primary  efficacy  hypothesis,  the  proportion  of  patients  within  each  treatment  group who had a favorable clinical response assessment at the discontinuation of IV therapy among those who  were  clinically  evaluable  at  the  discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  was  calculated.  All  secondary hypotheses were considered in the population of patients evaluable at the FUA visit. The endpoints are displayed  by  stratum  and  combined  over  strata  within  each  treatment  group.  The  endpoints  are displayed by treatment group for each analysis at DCIV and FUA.

## Statistical Methods

The primary  objective of  this  study  was  to  compare  ertapenem  with  piperacillin  /  tazobactam  in terms  of  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  a  'favourable'  (defined  as  cure  or  improved)  clinical response.  The primary timepoint was the DCIV visit and the primary analysis population comprised those patients who were clinically evaluable at that visit.  Supportive statistical analyses for efficacy were  performed  using  a  number  of  different  patient  populations  (described  above).    A  number  of secondary endpoints, including microbiological response, and timepoints were assessed (also described above).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the efficacy analysis, only the clinical responses at DCIV and the FUA were considered. For a 'favourable' clinical response rating, each primary wound and secondary wound clinically assessed at the eligibility screening must have received a 'favourable' clinical response rating. An 'unfavourable' clinical response included 'failure' and 'relapse'.  For missing data, all assessments of 'failure' or 'relapse' were carried forward to subsequent timepoints. This included patients discontinuing before their Day 5 visit, if the patient had received at least 48 hours of treatment.  All assessments of 'cure or improvement' were carried back to previously missing timepoints provided that no prior assessment was available. If a patient was a 'cure or improvement' or 'indeterminate' at DCIV and was missing subsequent timepoints, information available up to 90 days after the discontinuation of drug could be used to assess clinical response.

The response rates, adjusted for baseline severity of infection, were compared using Cochran-MantelHaenszel.  Associated 95% confidence intervals were computed.  Ertapenem was to be considered at least  as  effective  as  piperacillin  /  tazobactam  if  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  in proportions  (ertapenem  minus  piperacillin/tazobactam)  contained  zero  and  the  lower  limit  of  the confidence  interval  was  greater  than  -15  percentage  points.    A  test  of  the  treatment  by  baseline severity interaction was also performed.

The statistical  analysis  is  generally  appropriate.    In  particular,  the  analysis  populations  are  sensibly defined  and  sufficiently  wide-ranging.    Patient  withdrawals  and  missing  data  are  not  considered problematic.

One major concern related to the criteria for success, i.e. the definition of a 'favourable' clinical response .  This concern was raised by the CHMP in the Request for Supplementary Information (RSI) adopted by the CHMP in June 2005. The MAH answered that determining when a complex process like a diabetic foot infection is 'cured' can be difficult. Most of these infections resolve slowly with treatment,  usually  over  a  period  of  weeks.  The  clinical  assessment  of  'cure/improvement'  as  the favorable  clinical  response  at  the  discontinuation  of  IV  therapy  (DCIV)  and  at  the  10  day posttreatment  follow-up    (FUA)  in  Protocol  034  required  complete  resolution  of  cardinal  signs  of infection (i.e., fever, purulence, and lymphangitis) and improvement in most of the remaining signs and  symptoms  of  infection  (e.g.,  chills,  fluctuance,  non-purulent  discharge,  erythema,  induration, tenderness, pain, skin warmth), since the inflammatory component of these latter signs and symptoms may persist to some degree for days, sometimes weeks, after the active infection has resolved.

As defined in the Protocol, by assigning an outcome of 'cure/improvement' at FUA, the investigator had declared that, based on the assessment of signs and symptoms, the patient had been essentially cured  of  their  infection  and  no  longer  required  antibacterial  therapy.  At  DCIV,  an  outcome  of 'cure/improvement' was a determination by the investigator that the infected wound(s) had responded sufficiently  to  parenteral  study  therapy  so  that  either  (1)  the  patient  was  essentially  cured  and  all antibiotic  therapy  could  be  discontinued,  or  (2)  the  patient  had  met  all  required  clinical  response criteria as defined in the protocol for oral switch and could be transitioned to oral follow-up therapy as per protocol.  Patients were required to have received at least 5 days of parenteral study therapy before being  switched  to  oral  follow-up  study  therapy  (ampicillin/clavulanate).    The  following  protocoldefined oral switch criteria indicative of a substantial response to the parenteral study therapy needed to be considered by the investigator:

1. Patient received at least 5 full days of IV study therapy;
2. For at least 24 hours, the patient's maximum temperature was &lt;38°C (100.4°F) orally, &lt;38.5°C (101.2°F)  by  tympanic  measurement,  or  &lt;39°C  (102.2°F)  by  rectal  measurement,  without  the influence of aspirin, acetaminophen, or NSAIDS;
3. WBC was &lt;10,000/mm 3 , with ≤ 5% immature neutrophils (bands) on differential;
4. Patient was able to tolerate oral (or resume enteral) feeding and had no suspected impediment to absorption, (e.g., gastroparesis, vomiting, bowel edema, right-sided heart failure, etc.);
5. Improvement was demonstrated in most (without worsening of any) of the signs and symptoms of diabetic  foot  infection  (primary  and  secondary  wound  sites)  including  a  marked  and  sustained reduction in the following, if present at enrollment:
- Localised periwound erythema
- Localised periwound edema (swelling)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Localised tenderness or pain
- Localised warmth
- Localised fluctuance
- Induration of wound (limb brawny edema)
6. Any purulence associated with wound was completely resolved;
7. Lymphangitis associated with wound was completely resolved;

8. Patient's  metabolic  status,  with  regard  to  hyperglycemia,  was  resolved  to  the  patient's baseline.

Clinical response analyses are discussed below for patients who received parenteral study therapy only and  for  patients  who  received  parenteral  followed  by  oral  study  therapy.  The  clinical  response analyses  for  patients  who  received  parenteral  study  therapy  only  and  for  patients  who  received parenteral followed by oral study therapy were done at both the DCIV and FUA time points.

For evaluable patients who  received only parenteral study therapy, a clinical response of 'cure/improvement' at the DCIV visit is ostensibly an assessment of 'cure,' since these patients were discontinued from IV study therapy to receive no further antibacterial treatment. For evaluable patients who  received  parenteral  and  then  switched  to  oral  follow-up  study  therapy,  a  clinical  response  of 'cure/improvement'  at  the  DCIV  visit  represents  'improvement,'  since  these  patients  went  on  to receive oral follow-up as per Protocol. All assessments of 'cure/improvement' at the FUA visit are ostensibly  investigator  assessments  of  'cure,'  since  by  Protocol  definition  these  patients  did  not require any additional antibacterial therapy for their infected wounds at the time of the FUA.

Efficacy analyses in the population of patients who received parenteral therapy alone show that the observed  'cure'  rate  for  ertapenem  was  numerically  superior  and  statistically  non-inferior  to piperacillin/tazobactam at both the DCIV and FUA time points. Additionally the observed 'cure' rates for  the  most  severe  baseline  diabetic  foot  infections  was  numerically  higher  for  ertapenem  at  both DCIV and FUA time points.

The  population  of  patients  who  had  responded  sufficiently  to  parenteral  therapy  and  were  then switched to oral study therapy, were by definition considered 'improved' at the DCIV assessment. Followed  out  to  the  posttreatment  visit,  a  favorable  assessment  at  FUA  was  indicative  of  a  'cure' since the investigator considered no further anti-infective treatment to be required. Cure rates in these patients at the FUA time point again showed again that the ertapenem regimen was statistically noninferior  to  piperacillin/tazobactam.  Additionally,  the  cure  rate  observed  for  ertapenem  in  the  most severe baseline infections was numerically higher than that observed for piperacillin/tazobactam.

These  results,  in  conjunction  with  the  overall  study  results  and  analyses  of  improvement  and resolution in the signs and symptoms of infection over the course of treatment and follow-up, attest to the efficacy of ertapenem in resolving the infectious process. They further support the conclusion that ertapenem is non-inferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of diabetic foot infections.

The CHMP concluded that the MAH has provided a reasoned response based on a clinical/practical point of view. It may be considered sufficiently robust to accept the reasoned assumptions elaborated by the MAH above i.e. that results from the subgroups treated only by parenteral therapy realistically reflect  the  'cured'  category  and  the  subgroups  treated  by  parenteral  and  oral  therapy  realistically reflect the 'improved' category. The individual results presented under the above assumptions show consistency at both DCIV and FUA and may be sufficiently convincing in support of non-inferiority between Invanz and the comparator.

This table contains coumts of patient evaluability. Therefore, although a patient may have one or more reasons for being non-evaluable, the patient will be coumted only once in the non-evaluable category. DCIV = Discontinuation of IV Therapy. FUA = Follow-up Assessment.

- Patients entered with pathogens known at baseline to be resistant to either study dhug.

Patients with all baseline pathogens resistant to either study drug.

- Patient was outside FUA visit window specified in DAP (&lt;6 days for Favorable clinical responses or &gt;14 days for Unfavorable clinical responses).

There appeared to be very similar proportions of subjects in each treatment group found not evaluable by each of the criteria listed in the above table for Clinical Evaluable Population. In the Microbiologic Evaluable  Population  however,  there  are  higher  proportions  in  the  comparator  group  found  not evaluable and on more detailed assessment, the principal cause of this can be identified i.e. baseline microbiology - no pathogen isolated.

The 2 treatment groups appeared to be similar with respect to the extent of exposure to overall study therapy,  parenteral  therapy,  and  oral  therapy.  Overall  131  (33%)  of  these  patients  (69/206  and 62/196 patients in the ertapenem and P/T groups, respectively) did not receive any oral therapy and were treated entirely with parenteral study therapy.  i.e. sixty-seven percent (66.5%) of the clinically evaluable  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  68.4%  of  the  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  the comparator  group  completed  therapy  with  an  oral  agent.  Most  patients  in  both  groups  received amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg every 12 hours for a mean duration of approximately 9.4 days in the ertapenem group and 10.0 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group.

As  might  be  expected,  the  mean  duration  of  parenteral  therapy  was  longer  in  this  subset  for  both treatment groups (16.6 and 15.8 days, respectively, for the ertapenem and P/T groups). Approximately two thirds of the patients in both treatment groups received oral switch therapy; 93% and  100%  of  these  patients  in  the  ertapenem  and  P/T  groups,  respectively,  received  the  protocol specified oral agent, amoxicillin/clavulanate.

## Baseline Pathogens

The most commonly isolated pathogens in both treatment groups were aerobic gram-positive cocci including  S.  aureus,  enterococci,  and  Streptococcus  agalactiae,  gram  positive  anaerobic  cocci, primarily Peptostreptococcus species, and gram-negative bacilli, including E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Patients  with  monomicrobial  or  polymicrobial  infections  with  pathogens  that  were  only  nonsusceptible  (intermediate  or  resistant)  to  parenteral  study  therapy  isolated  from  either  the  primary infection site or blood were clinically but not microbiologically evaluable in cases where there was clinical improvement and the investigator elected to continue the patient on blinded parenteral therapy. In cases where in vitro susceptibility results to study agents were not reported, all organisms except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci were assumed to be susceptible to both ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam for the purpose of evaluability determination. All methicillin-resistant staphylococci were assumed to be resistant to both ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam regardless of in  vitro susceptibility  results . All  of  the  pathogens  from  a  patient  with  a  polymicrobial  infection were  included  in  the  per-pathogen  analyses  regardless  of  baseline  susceptibility  of  each  individual pathogen.  If  the  patient  was  also  microbiologically  evaluable,  then  microbiologic  outcomes  were assessed for all baseline pathogens regardless of baseline susceptibility of each individual pathogen.

Polymicrobial infection was defined as an infection in a microbiologically evaluable patient with 2 or more different baseline bacterial pathogens.  Non-polymicrobial infection included microbiologically evaluable patients with a single baseline pathogen and also patients who were clinically evaluable but not microbiologically evaluable.  If vancomycin was used to treat resistant gram-positive infections, all gram-positive aerobic organisms were assigned an indeterminate microbiological outcome.

Of  the  206  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  172  (83.5%)  had  at  least 1  baseline  wound  or  blood  pathogen  identified  at  study  entry.  Ninety-nine  (99)  of  these  (48.1%  of FUA clinically evaluable patients) had polymicrobial infections.

Of the 196 FUA clinically evaluable patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group 149 (76.0%) had at least 1 baseline wound or blood pathogen identified at study entry. Eighty-eight (88) of these (44.9% of FUA clinically evaluable patients) had polymicrobial infections.

The most commonly isolated pathogens in the FUA clinically evaluable population were similar to those seen in the treated population. Staphylococcus aureus was the single most commonly isolated pathogen (90 isolates in the ertapenem group and 79 isolates in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) in the  FUA clinically evaluable population. Seventy-one (71) (78.9%) isolates in the ertapenem group and  64  (81.0%)  isolates  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  were  methicillin-sensitive S.  aureus (MSSA).

Overall,  the  distribution  and  susceptibility  patterns  of  baseline  pathogens  in  the  2  treatment  groups were  similar  with  the  exception  of  enterococci  and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa .  In  the  ertapenem treatment group, 16.7% (6 of 36) of enterococcal isolates tested were susceptible to ertapenem while 94.4% (34 of 36) of enterococcal isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam.  Similarly, in the piperacillin/tazobactam treatment group, 13.6% (3 of 22) of enterococcal isolates were susceptible to ertapenem while 90.9% (20 of 22) of enterococcal isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam.  Vancomycin susceptibility was reported for 32 enterococcal isolates (18 in the ertapenem group and 14 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) and all were vancomycin sensitive. In  the  ertapenem  treatment  group,  for Pseudomonas  aeruginosa ,  33.3%  (6  of  18)  of  isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem while 100% (18 of 18) of isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam.  In the piperacillin/tazobactam treatment group, 70% (7 of 10) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates  were  susceptible  to  ertapenem  while  80% (8 of 10) isolates were  susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  only  pathogens  isolated  from  blood  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  were  gram-positive aerobic  cocci,  methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus  aureus , Streptococcus  agalactiae,  Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus  viridans .  All  bacteremic  patients  had  blood  isolates  which  were susceptible in  vitro to  the  study  drug  received  with  the  exception  of  AN594  which  grew  out Streptococcus viridans which was not tested, but was presumed to be sensitive to both study drugs. One FUA clinically evaluable patient in the ertapenem group(MRSA) and 2 FUA clinically evaluable patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae) were bacteremic at baseline.

## Clinical efficacy per patient

To address the primary hypothesis, the estimated proportion, adjusting for baseline severity, of DCIV clinically evaluable patients with a favorable clinical response assessment at the DCIV time point was evaluated in both treatment groups.

To  address  another  important  secondary  efficacy  hypothesis,  the  proportion  of  FUA  clinically evaluable patients with a favorable clinical response assessment was also evaluated in both treatment groups at the 10-day follow-up assessment visit.

## Subgroup Analyses

Clinical response rates decreased in both treatment groups with increasing depth of the wound (Grades 0 through 3 according to the University of Texas Diabetic Wound Classification).  Most of the FUA clinically evaluable patients in both treatment groups (68% in the ertapenem group; 66% in the P/T group)  had  wounds  extending  through  the  epidermis  or  dermis  without  penetration  to  the  tendon, capsule or bone (Grade 1). A third of all FUA clinically evaluable of patients in both treatment groups (31%) had wounds extending to either the tendon or capsule (Grade 2) or to the bone or joint (Grade 3) and these infections were appropriately considered severe.

Data Source:  [4.1.1; 4.3.3; 4.3.5; 4.3.13]

The clinical response with ertapenem seems to be worse with increasing age (90.1% for &lt; 65 years vs. 81.3% for &gt; 65 years and 89.0% for &lt; 75 years vs. 76.0% for &gt; 75 years), whilst the reverse was observed for piperacillin-tazobactam (80.2% for &lt; 65 years vs. 87.7% for &gt; 65 years and 81.2% for &lt; 75 years against 90.3% for &gt; 75 years). In patients above 75 years (25 for the ertapenem arm and 31 for the piperacillin-tazobactam arm) the observed difference between treatments was -14.3, while the difference between  the lower CI95  was  around  20%.  These  differences  also affect the generalisation of the results from the presented study to the general population. In the RSI adopted in June 2005, the MAH was requested to comment upon this issue.

In his answer, the MAH explained that while the favorable clinical response rates at DCIV and FUA were numerically greater for piperacillin/tazobactam in the oldest decades (70 to 79 and 80 to 89 years of age) this was not true for patients 50 to 59 or 60 to 69 years age, the age groups with the largest proportion  of  patients  studied  and  where  the  ertapenem  response  rates  were  higher.  Upon  careful statistical analysis, the data do not appear to support a clear age trend with regard to treatment effect.

The  MAH  presented  the  data  in  groups  of  10-years,  rather  than  the  dichotomies  described  in  the question.  This has the potential to mask differences of potential importance. However, the MAH's

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

position, that the data do not appear to support a clear trend for age, is supported by the CHMP, but a decreased effect in elderly patients cannot be ruled out based on the data.

## Clinical efficacy per pathogen

The  most  common  baseline  species  identified  in  the  FUA  clinically  evaluable  population  with Diabetic  Foot  Infections  at  the  DCIV  visit  were  gram  positive  aerobic  cocci  including S.  aureus , enterococci, and S. agalactiae ; gram-negative aerobic rods including E, coli and P. aeruginosa ; grampositive  anaerobic  cocci,  primarily Peptostreptococcus species,  and  gram-negative  anaerobic  rods, including Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.

S. pyogenes, a well-recognised pathogen in skin/soft tissue infection, was only very rarely observed. Despite the study 034 was conducted in US, the epidemiology of the pathogens isolated in Protocol 034  was  generally  similar  to  other  studies,  which  were  conducted  in  the  EU.  The  evidence  that S. pyogenes is uncommon in DFI studies justifies the lack of infections with S. pyogenes in this study. The epidemiology of pathogens is shown to be broadly similar to those in other EU studies, which satisfies concerns over external validity.

There were 4 ertapenem-targeted pathogens for which sufficient numbers of isolates were available (10  per  group,  as  outlined  in  the  Data  Analysis  Plan  [DAP])  to  determine  a  95%  CI  around  the difference in clinical response rates between the 2 treatment groups. Among these pathogens, the only pathogen  for  which  piperacillin/tazobactam  had  a  higher  clinical  response  rate  than  ertapenem  was Streptococcus agalactiae (between treatment difference -13.2; 95% CI: -38.3, 10.9).  The inclusion of zero  in  the  95%  CI  around  the  difference  in  response  rates  indicates  that  this  difference  was  not statistically significant.  A previous study in skin and skin structure infections demonstrated ertapenem had a similar response as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of S. agalactiae infections.

The favorable clinical response rates for MRSA in both treatment groups also appear to be similar. The MRSA favorable clinical response rates were 14/18 isolates (77.8%) in the ertapenem group and 10/15 isolates (66.7%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group.

The  population  of  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  with  MRSA  was  further  analysed.    In  the ertapenem  group,  6  of  the  18  (33.3%)  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  were  monomicrobial infections.    In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group,  5 out  of  15  (33.3%)  of  MRSA  infections  were monomicrobial infections. The clinical response rates for MRSA in both treatment groups appear to be similar irrespective of the use of concomitant vancomycin.   In the ertapenem group, 7 of 18 (38.8%) patients  with  MRSA  had  received  concomitant  vancomycin;  of  the  7  patients  who  had  received vancomycin,  5  (71.4%)  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  Eleven  (11)  patients  did  not  receive vancomycin, of which 9 patients (81.8%) had a favorable clinical response. In the piperacillin/tazobactam  group,  5  of  15  (33.3%)  patients  with  MRSA  had  received  concomitant vancomycin;  of  the  5  patients  who  had  received  vancomycin,  3  (60.0%)  had  a  favorable  clinical response.  Ten (10) patients did not receiv e vancomycin, of which 7 patients (70.0%) had a favorable clinical response.

Upon further sub-analysis, the clinical response rates for MRSA in both treatment groups appear to be similar  irrespective  of  the  use  of  concomitant  vancomycin  among  monomicrobial  or  polymicrobial groups.   In the ertapenem group, 5 of 5 (100%) patients with polymicrobial MRSA infection who had not  received  concomitant  vancomycin  had  a  favorable  clinical  response;  of  the  7 patients  who  had received  vancomycin,  5  (71.4%)  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam group, 4 of 5 (80.0%) patients with polymicrobial MRSA infection who had not received concomitant vancomycin had a favorable clinical response; of the 5 patients with polymicrobial infections who had received vancomycin, 3 (60.0%) had a favorable clinical response.

All 11 patients in the clinical EPP  population (6 in the ertapenem group and 5 in the piperacillin/tazobactam  group)  with  MRSA  isolated  as  a  sole  baseline  pathogen  had  not  received vancomycin.  In the ertapenem group, 4 of 6 (66.7%) patients with monomicrobial MRSA infection who had not received concomitant vancomycin had a favorable clinical response. In the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

piperacillin/tazobactam group, 3 of 5 (60.0%) patients with monomicrobial MRSA infection who had not received concomitant vancomycin had a favorable clinical response.

For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the favorable clinical response rates were 15/18 isolates (83.3%) in the ertapenem group and 7/10 isolates (70.0%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. The difference in the clinical response rates between the 2 treatment groups was 13.3% (95% CI:  -18.2, 48.7). In patients whose culture  results  demonstrated  organisms  for  which  resistance  to  the  protocol-specified  switch agent amoxicillin/clavulanate was a concern, alternative oral antibacterial therapy was permitted. Six (6)  out  of  18  patients  (33.3%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  1  out  of  10  patients  (10%)  in  the piperacillin/tazobactam group were switched to oral study therapy consisting of amoxicillin/clavulanate and an antipseudomonal oral agent (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) following parenteral therapy.  In patients who did not receive an antipseudomonal oral agent, 9 out of 12 patients (75.0%) in the ertapenem group had a favorable clinical response while 6 out of 9 patients (66.7%) in the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  had  a  favorable  clinical  response.  The  clinical  response  rates  for P.  aeruginosa  appeared  to  be  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  irrespective  of  the  use  of  an  oral antipseudomonal agent following parenteral therapy.

Clinical response rates for MRSA, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were remarkably high, completely independently of the addition or not of vancomycin for MRSA or enterococci, or the use of an antipseudomonal agent during the switch to oral therapy, respectively. Several explanations may account  for  the  higher  than  expected  favorable  clinical  response  rates  for  MRSA,  enterococci  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in  this  study.    First,  factors  other  than  antibiotic  susceptibility  may  have influenced  the clinical response. The  study  investigators took  a multi-disciplinary  approach incorporating off-loading, local wound  care, optimisation of glycemic control, and surgical intervention (when necessary) in addition to antimicrobial therapy.  These factors were applied equally across  treatment  groups  and  without  knowledge  of  treatment  group  by  the  investigators.    Second, although MRSA, enterococci, and P. aeruginosa have all been implicated as pathogens in diabetic foot infections, their contribution to the infectious process remains a topic of some controversy. Finally, another  contributing  factor,  particularly  in  patients  with  MRSA,  is  the  frequency  of  polymicrobial infections.  It is acknowledged that the adequacy of the chosen primary endpoint for DFI may still be open  to  discussion  and  that  improvement  may  be  eventually  possible,  particularly  with  regard  to clinical  variables  and  staging,  since  the  relevance  of  microbiologic  findings  may  be  more  open  to dispute.  Under  these  circumstances,  a  more  careful  choice  of  the  analyses  that  should  figure  in  the main dossier is warranted.

## Clinical efficacy Per pathogen (blood isolates only)

To be included in this analysis, a clinically evaluable patient had to have a baseline pathogen isolated from blood. Bacteremia was uncommon in both treatment groups. One patient in the ertapenem group and 3 patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group were bacteremic at baseline. One baseline blood isolate was identified from each patient. All of the isolates identified from blood were gram-positive aerobic  cocci.  None  of  the  patients  with  baseline  pathogens  isolated  from  blood  had  persistent bacteremia. In each of the 3 patients with positive blood cultures at baseline, no follow-up cultures were considered necessary and the pathogens were presumed eradicated. The small number of isolates precluded meaningful comparison between the 2 treatment groups.

## Microbiological efficacy per patient

For  this  analysis,  151  out  of  289  treated  patients  (52.2%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  were  FUA microbiologically evaluable and 135 out of 287 treated patients (47.0%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group were FUA microbiologically evaluable.

If  no  specimen  was  obtained  for  culture  at  a  follow-up  visit,  the  microbiological  outcome  was presumed based on the clinical outcome; eradication was presumed for favorable clinical outcomes and persistence was presumed for unfavorable clinical outcomes. For a favorable overall per patient microbiological  response,  all  pathogens  identified  at  baseline  should  have  been  eradicated  or presumed to be eradicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lower proportion of comparator group subjects qualifying as microbiologically evaluable implies fewer had specimen taken for culture than in the ertepenem group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Combined Clinical and Microbiological Efficacy

The  proportion  of  FUA  microbiologically  evaluable  patients  with  both  a  favorable  clinical  and  a favorable  microbiological  response  assessment  was  evaluated  in  both  treatment  groups  at  the  FUA visit.

If  both  the  clinical  assessment  and  the  overall  microbiological  assessment  were  'favourable,'  the patient  was  counted  as  'favourable'  for  this  analysis.  If  either  or  both  the  clinical  and  the microbiological  assessments  were  classified  as  'unfavourable,'  then  the  patient  was  counted  as 'unfavourable' in the analysis.

## MITT population

Analysis of the clinical response rates in the clinical MITT population was performed to support the primary  analyses  of  the  evaluable  population.  The  results  for  the  MITT  clinical  efficacy  were consistent  with  the  clinical  response  rates  in  the  clinically  evaluable  population  and  supported  the primary and secondary efficacy hypotheses and the results for the MITT microbiological efficacy were consistent with the microbiological response rates in the microbiologically evaluable population.

## Emergent Infections

Emergent pathogens were pathogens that were not present at baseline, but were isolated from patients with clinical evidence of infection after study therapy had been initiated. Emergent pathogens isolated during study therapy were termed 'superinfections.' Emergent pathogens isolated after study therapy was completed were termed 'new infections.'

One patient in  the  ertapenem  group  (AN  229)  and  one  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group (AN 807) developed bacteremia following discontinuation of study therapy. Both patients grew out methicillin-sensitive S. aureus .  No  FUA  clinically  evaluable  patients  in  either  treatment  group  had persistence  of  baseline  pathogens  at  the  FUA  visit  due  to  the  development  of  resistance  to  study therapy.

Overall, the most common emergent pathogens in the ertapenem treatment group were Enterococcus species  and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa .  In  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  treatment  group,  the  most common emergent pathogen was S.  aureus .  The  incidence of new and superinfections was low and appeared to be similar between the 2 treatment groups.

## Exploratory Analyses-Diabetic Foot Wound Score

The clinical response assessment at DCIV and FUA was also analysed within each treatment group by baseline diabetic foot wound score, a composite score based on general wound parameters (signs and symptoms  of  infection)  and  wound  measurements.  Clinical  response  rates  were  similar  in  both treatment groups across baseline  wound scores at  DCIV and FUA and the response rates generally decreased with an increase in baseline wound score.

##  Conclusion on efficacy

The  data  from  the  single  pivotal  study  034  does not  support  the  claimed  proposed  indication Complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI) ,  including diabetic foot infections. It  may  only support the indication restricted to diabetic foot infections (DFI).

To support its request for cSSTI, the MAH mentioned again an earlier study (protocol 016), where the efficacy of ertapenem, 1.0 g IV once daily was compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, 3.375 g every 6  hours,  in  the  treatment  of  complicated  skin  and  skin  structure  infections,  defined  as  lower  limb infections  in  diabetics,  infected  pressure  sores,  deep  tissue  infections  in  which  enterobacteria  or anaerobes were likely or which required surgical drainage, extensive cellulititis, wound infections and perineal  abscesses.  In  study  016,  patients  were  stratified  at  baseline  according  to  the  presence  or absence  of  complicating  underlying  disease.  Stratum  I  consisted  of  those  with  decubitus  ulcers, diabetes  mellitus  or  other  neuropathic  conditions  whereas  Stratum  II  contained  all  other  patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  60  %  of  patients  had  received  an  antimicrobial  agent  within  14  days  of  study  entry, predominantly  beta-lactam  compound. Further  to  its  evaluation,  study  016  had  been  deemed unsuitable  for  granting  the  same  proposed  indication  in  the  original  Marketing  Authorisation Application (MAA). As already assessed in the original MAA, there were too many concerns with the overall efficacy results in Protocol 016 per se, even to grant a restricted indication of cSSTI excluding DFI.

Protocol 034 provided evidence in only one subgroup of infections within the heterogenous clinical condition of cSSTI, namely DFI. Therefore, it can only support an indication of DFI, as satisfactory efficacy evidence in the other conditions within the heterogenous clinical condition of cSSTI is not available. Given the heterogeneity of the two patient populations recruited into the two studies, it is considered that Protocol 034 does not provide the additional evidence required such that, together, the trials support the broad indication of cSSTI.

## 2.2 Clinical safety

##  Safety data from the main study: Protocole 034.

Adverse experiences that occurred while the patient was on parenteral study therapy are more likely to be related to the parenteral study therapy than those occurring after the completion of the parenteral therapy  (i.e.,  during  oral  therapy  or  the  follow-up  period).    For  this  reason,  separate  analyses  are presented on adverse experiences that occurred specifically within the parenteral treatment period and on those that occurred during study therapy and the 14-day follow-up period (i.e., parenteral and oral antibiotic therapy and the 14-day follow-up period).

## Patient exposure

Adverse experiences were recorded during parenteral and oral study therapy and for 14 days after the last dose of study therapy (safety follow-up period).  Of the 639 patients enrolled, 576 received at least 1 dose of parenteral study therapy (289 in the ertapenem group and 287 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) and are included in the analysis of adverse experiences. Ten (10) patients (ANs 0232, 0235, 0236,  0313,  0773,  and  1055  in  the  ertapenem  treatment  group  and  419,  471,  488,  and  683  in  the piperacillin/tazobactam  group)  were  randomised    but  did  not  receive  any  study  medication.  These patients were excluded from the safety analyses.

Patients in the ertapenem group received up to 33 days of therapy with a mean duration for any dose of 10.6 days.  Patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group received up to 30 days of therapy with a mean duration of 11.0 days.

Data Source: [4.2.1; 4.3.11]

Overall,  273  out  of  576  treated  patients  (47.4%)  had  clinical  adverse  experiences  reported  during parenteral  therapy.  One  patient  in  the  ertapenem  group  (AN  0715)  experienced  a  serious  adverse experience of positive blood culture that began on the first day of study therapy but prior to the first dose.  The  patient  discontinued  from  parenteral  therapy  on  Study  Day  2.  The  investigator  did  not consider the positive blood culture related to study therapy. Because the onset of the serious adverse experience occurred prior to initiation of study therapy, this patient is not included in the number of patients with clinical adverse experiences during parenteral therapy, serious clinical adverse experiences,  clinical  adverse  experiences  leading  to  discontinuation,  or  serious  clinical  adverse experiences  leading  to  discontinuation  during  parenteral  therapy  or  during  the  study  therapy  and follow-up period. There was 1 patient in the ertapenem group and 1 patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam group with serious drug-related clinical adverse experiences.

Clinical  adverse  experiences  occurring  in  5%  or  more  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  were defined as frequently occurring clinical adverse experiences.  The frequently occurring clinical adverse events were: diarrhoea , nausea and headache .

The  most  common  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence ≥ 3%  were gastrointestinal  disorders , general  disorders and administration  site  conditions ,  and nervous  system  disorders .  The incidence of clinical adverse experiences was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

There are no apparent differences between the 2 treatment groups for these adverse experiences with the exception of diarrhea. During parenteral therapy, diarrhea was reported by 24 patients (8.3%) in the ertapenem group and 41 patients (14.3%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. The results suggest that ertapenem may have a lower incidence of diarrhea than piperacillin/tazobactam.

The most common drug-related clinical adverse experiences with an incidence ≥ 1% were gastrointestinal  disorders (9.7%  of  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  13.2%  in  the  piperacillin group) and general disorders and administration site conditions (1.7% of patients in the ertapenem

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group and 4.5% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The incidence of drug-related clinical adverse experiences was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11]

Overall, 331 out of 576 treated patients (57.5%) had clinical adverse experiences reported during study therapy and 14-day follow-up period. The incidence of clinical adverse experiences, including serious adverse  experiences,  deaths,  drug-related  adverse  experiences,  and  discontinuations  due  to  adverse experiences, was similar in the 2 treatment groups. There was 1 patient in the ertapenem group and 1 patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam group  who  had  serious drug-related clinical adverse experiences reported during study therapy and the 14-day follow-up period.

The  most  common  clinical  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence ≥ 3%  were gastrointestinal disorders (23.5% of patients in the ertapenem group and 30.0% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group), infections (16.3% of patients in the ertapenem group and 15.3% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group), and general disorders and administration site conditions (11.8% of patients in the ertapenem group and 18.8% .in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). The incidence of clinical adverse experiences was similar between the two treatment groups.

The  most  common  medictation-related  clinical  adverse  experiences  with  an  incidence ≥ 1%  were gastrointestinal disorders (11.1% of patients in the ertapenem group and 16.0% in the piperacillin/tazobactam group) and infections (3.5% of patients in the ertapenem group and 2.4% in the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group).  The  incidence  of  clinical  drug-related  adverse  experiences  was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One patient in each treatment group died during the parenteral therapy period. One patient (AN 0832 an 84 year old male) in the ertapenem treatment group had an adverse experience of pneumonia during the parenteral therapy period due to lung cancer diagnosed during the follow-up period. The patient died during the follow-up period. The death was not considered to be related to study therapy. One patient  (AN  1009  a  73  year  old  male)  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  died  due  to  myocardial infarction during the parenteral therapy period. The death was not considered to be related to study drug.

Four  (4)  patients  in  the  ertapenem  group  and  one  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group experienced adverse experiences resulting in death after parenteral therapy but while on oral antibiotic therapy  or  during  the  14  day  follow-up  period  following  study  therapy.  None  of  these  deaths  were considered to be drug related.

The percent = number of patients within the laboratory adverse events category/number of patients with one or more laboratory tests postbaseline

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11]

Five hundred forty-five (545) of the 576 treated patients had at least 1 laboratory test post baseline. Eighty-three (83) of these had laboratory adverse experiences, 32 (11.8%) in the ertapenem group and 51 (18.7%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. There were 2 patients with serious laboratory adverse experiences, both in the ertapenem group. Neither of these serious adverse experiences was considered drug  related  and  neither  resulted  in  discontinuation  from  study  therapy.  Two  (2)  patients  in  the piperacillin/tazobactam group were discontinued due to drug-related laboratory adverse experiences.

During parenteral therapy the most common laboratory adverse experiences in both treatment groups with an incidence ≥ 3% were increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood glucose .

Medication-related laboratory adverse experiences with an incidence ≥ 1% were generally uncommon in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most  common  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

parenteral therapy were increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver transaminases (ALT and AST).

Two  patients  (0.7%)  in  the  ertapenem  group  had  serious  laboratory  adverse  experiences  during parenteral  therapy  that  were  not  considered  medication-related.  No  serious  laboratory  adverse experiences occurred in the piperacillin/tazobactam group. AN 0484 had increased blood glucose and decreased blood potassium reported as serious laboratory adverse experiences. AN 0944 had increased blood potassium reported as a serious laboratory adverse experience.

There  was  a  decreased  relative  risk  of  medication-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the ertapenem group compared with piperacillin/tazobactam. The 2 treatment groups were not significantly  different  with  respect  to  discontinuations  due  to  medication-related  laboratory  adverse experiences.  No  serious  medication-related  adverse  experiences  were  observed  in  either  treatment group.

One  patient  in  the  piperacillin/tazobactam  group  (AN  0298)  experienced  a  serious  clinical  adverse experience  of  hypoglycemic  seizure  that  was  definitely  not  related  to  study  therapy.  Of  note,  there were no seizures reported in any patient who received ertapenem in the study. There were no adverse experiences of seizure in either treatment group during the 14-day follow-up period.

## -During study therapy and the 14-day follow-up period

The table below displays the number (percent) of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study therapy with clinical adverse experiences during study therapy and the follow-up period (14 days after discontinuation of parenteral and oral study therapy) by category.

† Determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely drug related.

The percent = number of patients within the laboratory adverse events category/number of patients with one or more laboratory tests postbaseline

Data Source:  [4.2.1; 4.3.11]

The most common laboratory adverse experiences during study therapy and 14-day follow-up period with  an  incidence ≥ 3  %  were increases  in  C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  blood  glucose,  aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate .

When the MAH applied for this extension of indication, he proposed to include C-reactive protein and decrease in blood sodium in section 4.8 of the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As the number of cases of decrease in blood sodium and increase in C-reactive protein reported during study  034  was  limited,  a  detailed  cumulative  safety  review  from  post-marketing  data  of  cases  of decrease  in  blood  sodium  and  increase  in  C-reactive  protein  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  before concluding on the addition of these 2 events in the SPC.

The  review  performed  by  the  MAH  from  30.03.2001  to  22.06.2005  identified  4  reports  of hyponatremia received from inception to 22.06.2005, which did not provide substantial information to infer more than a temporal relationship of ertapenem with hyponatremia and no report with increase of c-protein reactive. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that this cumulative safety review has not detected any signals associated for either of the 2 events. Furthermore the rise in the CRP is often seen after onset  of  antibiotic  therapy  in  patients  with  bacterial  infections  (particularly  those  with  chronic disease), the CHMP requested information on the temporal characteristics of the rise and fall of the CRP for study 034. In the answer from the MAH, all reports of medication-related C-reactive protein elevations  were  from  a  single  clinical  site  in  the  study.  The  assessment  of  these  elevations  in  Creactive  protein  as  medication-related  non-serious  adverse  experiences  is  not  representative  of  the experience of other clinical sites in the study. It is most likely that the CRP increases observed in these patients are attributable to an acute phase reaction in response to infection or ongoing inflammation. Further  to  the  evaluation  of  the  submitted  data, the  CHMP  concluded  that  there  was  no  signal requiring the addition of C-reactive protein and decrease in blood sodium in section 4.8 of the SPC.

The most common medication-related laboratory adverse experiences during study therapy and 14-day follow-up period with an incidence ≥ 1% were increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver transaminases (ALT and AST).  The incidence of medication-related laboratory adverse experiences appeared similar to that seen during the parenteral therapy period.

## -Conclusion on laboratory findings

Laboratory  abnormalities  are  common  in  patients  with  acute  bacterial  infections.  In  addition  to reviewing investigator-reported laboratory adverse experiences, assessment of the relative laboratory safety  of  each  treatment  group  was  accomplished  by  predefining  clinically  significant  laboratory abnormalities (CSLAs) for specified tests and then identifying patients whose worst laboratory value represented  a  worsening  from  baseline  and  met  the  criteria  for  a  CSLA.  The  combination  of  these 2  approaches to the analysis of laboratory abnormalities provides a more complete overview of the profile of laboratory safety.

The most common CSLAs in both the parenteral therapy period and the study therapy and 14-day follow-up period were elevated serum creatinine and decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) . As expected in a diabetic population, many patients in the treated population had pre-existing renal disorders such as diabetic nephropathy (5.4%) and renal insufficiency (6.1%). Overall, the proportion of patients with CSLAs was low and generally similar between the 2 treatment groups. The proportion of patients with CSLAs in the study therapy and 14-day follow-up period was similar to that seen in the  parenteral  therapy  period.  Very  few  patients  treated  with  ertapenem  had  a  creatinine  clearance (CrCl) level ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .  An analysis of the clinical and laboratory AE profile using a CrCl level  of  60 ml/min/1.73  m 2 as  the  cut-off  point  for  renal  dysfunction  showed  no  substantive differences between patients with CrCl ≤ 60 and those with CrCl &gt;60. Given the relatively few patients in the analyses, however, detailed comparison between the 2 populations (CrCl ≤ 60 and CrCl &gt;60) is limited.    Overall,  the  2  populations  appear  generally  similar  and  the  adverse  event  profile  in  these patients was generally similar to that which appears presently in the EU SPC. Although the fact that the  data  is  scarce  does  not  warrant  any  specific  amendment  to  the  product's  literature  regarding patients with renal insufficiency.

##  Conclusion on safety

The frequently occurring clinical adverse events during parental therapy were: diarrhea , nausea and headache .

None of the deaths occurring during the parenteral therapy period or after parenteral therapy but while on  oral  antibiotic  therapy  or  during  the  14  day  follow-up  period  following  study  therapy,  were considered to be medication related.

The most common clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in both the parenteral therapy period and the study therapy and 14-day follow-up period were elevated serum creatinine and decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) .

With respect to the above data revealed in the responses on C-reactive protein and blood sodium, the addition of elevations in C-reactive protein and decreases in blood sodium was not supported by the CHMP.

Further to the assessment of the data submitted, no major new safety issues have been identified that needed to be added to the SPC.

## 3. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

Protocol 034 provided evidence in only one subgroup of infections within the heterogenous clinical condition of cSSTI, namely DFI. Therefore, it can only support an indication of DFI, as satisfactory efficacy evidence in the other conditions within the heterogenous clinical condition of cSSTI is not available.

Further to the assessment of the data submitted, no major new safety issues have been identified. With respect  to  the  above  data  revealed  in  the  responses  on  C-reactive  protein  and  blood  sodium,  the addition of elevations in C-reactive protein and decreases in blood sodium was not supported by the CHMP.

The overall benefit-risk assessment is then negative for an extension of the therapeutic indication to the use in Invanz to complicated skin and soft tissue infection, including diabetic foot infections, but positive for the restricted indication of diabetic foot infections only.

## 4. Changes to the Product Information

## -Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indications' of the SPC

A fourth bullet point has been added to as follows:

- Diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue (see section 4.4).

## -Section 4.4 'Special warnings and special precautions for use' of the SPC

The following statement has been added:

Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not been established.

## -Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the SPC

This  section  has  been  rearranged  to  allow  for  a  better  overview  of  data  belonging  to  different  age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to have this section up-to-date with regard to the EME/QRD template and SCP guideline, the post-marketing  reported  adverse  reactions Very  rare  =  &lt;  1/10,000 has  been  moved  to  the  table  of adverses reactions instead of being in a separate paragraph.

## Therefore,

Very rare: anaphylaxis including anaphylactoid reactions has been moved to Immune system disorders,

Very rare: hallucinations has been moved to Nervous system disorders.

## -Section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties' of the SPC

The  full  section  has  been  updated  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  current  Note  for  Guidance  on Evaluation of Medicinal Products indicated for Treatment of Bacterial Infections (CPMP/EWP/558/95 adopted April 2004). This update was the subject of questions in the RSI adopted in June 2005 and the RSI adopted in October 2005. The table presented in this section 5.1 does now follow the Section V.4.2. Format for section 5.1 (page 20 of 23) of the above-mentioned Nfg, where it is stated that the relevant  pathogens  related  to  the  requested  indications  should  be  categorised  under  the  3  headings given in the guideline: ' Commonly susceptible species ', ' Species for which acquired resistance may be a problem ' and ' Inherently resistant organisms .'

Further to assessment of pre-clinical studies, the PK/PD relationship has been added to this section and should now read:

## Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship

Similar  to  other  beta-lactam  antimicrobial  agents,  the  time  that  the  plasma  concentration  of ertapenem exceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in pre-clinical PK/PD studies.

Additionally the description of the mechanisms of resistance has been revised to include more detail further to the request from the CHMP in its RSI adopted in October 2005, and replace the previous 2 paragraphs on Resistance . It should be read:

## Mechanism of Resistance

For species considered susceptible to ertapenem, resistance was uncommon in surveillance studies in Europe.  In  resistant  isolates,  resistance  to  other  antibacterial  agents  of  the  carbapenem  class  was seen in some but not all isolates. Ertapenem is effectively stable to hydrolysis by most classes of betalactamases, including penicillinases, cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases, but not metallo-beta-lactamases.

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are resistant to ertapenem, owing to PBP target insensitivity;  P.  aeruginosa  and  other  non-fermentative  bacteria  are  generally  resistant,  probably owing to limited penetration and to active efflux.

Resistance  is  uncommon  in  Enterobacteriaceae  and  the  drug  is  generally  active  against  those  with extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases  (ESBLs).  Resistance  can  however  be  observed  when  ESBLs  or other potent beta-lactamases (e.g. AmpC types) are present in conjunction with reduced permeability, arising by the loss of one or more outer membrane porins, or with up-regulated efflux. Resistance can also arise via the acquisition of betalactamases with significant carbapenem-hydrolysing activity (e.g. IMP and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases or KPC types), though these are rare.

The  mechanism  of  action  of  ertapenem  differs  from  that  of  other  classes  of  antibiotics,  such  as quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines. There is no target-based cross-resistance between ertapenem and these substances. However, micro-organisms may exhibit resistance to more than one class of antibacterial agents when the mechanism is, or includes, impermeability to some compounds and/or an efflux pump.

Invanz-H-389-II-13 30/31 The MAH commits to implement appropriate studies in the post-marketing period to collect data on the prevalence of resistance, both within Europe and in the rest of the world, to enable the updating of the SPC whenever the resistance patterns change. These worldwide resistance surveillance studies are currently  ongoing.  In  accordance  with  CPMP  Guidance  Document  CPMP/EWP/520/96  (18  June, 1997), 'Note for guidance on the pharmacodynamic section of the SPC for anti-bacterial medicinal products', the prevalence of resistance information in the Section 5.1 of the SPC will be updated at the 5-year  periodic  update.  This  periodic  update  coincides  with  the  registration  renewal  submission, scheduled for October 2006.
