## I. Introduction

On 10 July 2014 the MAH submitted a final clinical study report for the paediatric study MenACWY-TT059 (EXT052) Year 5 for Nimenrix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The primary phase study MenACWY-TT-052, as well as the follow-up study after 1 year (MenACWY-TT059 EXT052 Y1) were submitted as part of the initial MAA for Nimenrix. The 3 year follow-up data (MenACWY-TT-059 EXT052 Y3) was submitted and assessed under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 in September 2012 (Art 46 reference P46-015).

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The applicant states that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product and therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for the above mentioned product.

## II. Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study MenACWY-TT-052 is part of a clinical development program.

A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, Y conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Nimenrix was authorised on the 20th of April 2012 for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135 and Y. A 0.5 ml dose of the reconstituted vaccine is used in all ages.

## Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study MenACWY-TT-052, which investigated the long-term antibody persistence of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT vaccine versus Menactra® in healthy adolescents/adults aged 10-25 years, and booster response to MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 5 years post-primary vaccination.

## Clinical study (MenACWY-TT-052)

## Description

MenACWY-TT-052 was a phase II, open, controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the administration of one dose of MenACWYTT versus one dose of Sanofi-Pasteur's meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (Menactra®) in healthy adolescents/adults aged 10-25 years and to evaluate the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

safety and immunogenicity of a booster response to MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 5 years post-primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Menactra® and of a primary vaccination of MenACWYTT in a newly enrolled group aged 15-&lt;31 years. The clinical study report supplied for this procedure presents the persistence results at 5 years (Month 60) after primary vaccination in study 109377 (MenACWY-TT-052) and immunogenicity and safety up to six month after a booster or primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT administered at Month 60.

## Methods

Study MenACWY-TT-059 was conducted in the United States. This study evaluated the immunogenicity induced by Nimenrix as compared to Menactra at 11-25 years of age in terms of the percentage of subjects with N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W -135 and Y titers ≥1:8 as measured by hSBA (using GSK hSBA assays). The study included 3 groups: · ACWY-TT: MenACWY-TT (11-25 years of age) · ACWY-DT: Menactra (11-25 years of age) · ACWY&lt;11: MenACWY-TT (10-&lt;11 years of age) At Year 5, an additional arm of vaccine-naïve 15-&lt;31 year olds was added to receive MenACWY-TT. Subjects who received MenACWY-TT or Menactra in study MenACWY-TT-052 received a booster dose of MenACWY-TT at Year 5 (Month 60). The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term persistence of the immunogenicity induced by MenACWY-TT vaccine as compared to Menactra at 11-25 years of age in terms of the percentage of subjects with MenA, MenC, MenW-135, and MenY titers ≥1:8 as measured by a serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). Secondary objectives included measurement of antibody titers ≥1:4 and geometric mean titers (GMTs), evaluation of the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT vaccine when given 5 years after a priming dose compared to the immunogenicity in vaccine-naïve subjects.

## Results

Persistence phase Of the 852 subjects in the MenACWY-TT-059 database, 540 did not come to the Year 5 persistence Visit 3, therefore the total cohort at Year 5 included 312 subjects (218 in the ACWY-TT group, 56 in the ACWY-DT group and 38 in the ACWY&lt;11 group) who signed an informed consent and participated in the Year 5 blood draw. The According-to-Protocol (ATP) immunogenicity analysis for persistence at Year 5 contained 215 subjects (144 in the ACWY-TT group, 45 in the ACWY-DT group and 26 in the ACWY&lt;11 group). In the majority of cases, the reasons for subjects not returning for the Year 5 persistence study were: the subjects had been revaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine or the subjects were lost to follow-up. Other reasons fell under the categories of withdrawal of consent or migration to another area. Across all three vaccine groups the mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 5 was 19.6 years (range 15 to 30 years) with a standard deviation of 3.32. The distribution of males and females was similar (51.6% male and 48.4% female). According to race, 47.4% were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

White/Caucasian/European Heritage, 21.9% were Other and 10.7% were American Indian or Alaskan Native.

The analysis of the 5 year persistence was performed on the ATP cohort for persistence Year 5.

Because the results for the blood samples taken at 1 month after administration of the vaccine and 1, 3 and 5 years after vaccination are based on assays done at different times, comparisons of the kinetics of antibody titer calculations should be interpreted with caution. Note that having serological results 1 year and/or 3 years after primary vaccination was not an entry requirement for the Year 5 persistence of study MenACWY-TT-059EXT:052.

At five years following primary vaccination, the percentage of subjects with hSBA antibody titers ≥1:8 was 48.9%, 92.9%, 87.0% and 94.4% for MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, respectively, in the ACWY-TT group, and 44.4%, 79.5%, 84.1% and 90.9% for MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, respectively, in the ACWY-DT group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of subjects in the ACWY&lt;11 group with hSBA titers ≥1:8 five years after vaccination was 37.5%, 84.6%, 92.3% and 92.3% for serogroups MenA, MenC, MenW-135 and MenY, respectively.

The GMTs for MenW-135 and MenY at the Year 5 persistence timepoint remained above prevaccination titers for all three groups. The GMTs for MenC remained above pre-vaccination titers for the ACWY-TT and ACWY&lt;11 but dropped to almost pre-vaccination levels for the ACWY-DT group at the Year 5 persistence timepoint. In contrast, the MenA GMTs decreased markedly to almost baseline levels for all groups as soon as 1 year after primary vaccination.

Since, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who came back for the Year 5 follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total cohort at Year 5 was performed to complement the ATP analysis. The descriptive immunogenicity results for the Total cohort at Year 5 were generally consistent with the results for the ATP analysis.

## Booster phase

A total of 322 subjects received a booster (183 subjects in the ACWYBST group and 38 subjects in the ACWY-DT group) or primary vaccination (101 subjects in the ACWYPRI group). A total of 23 subjects did not complete the booster phase of the study and in the majority of the cases (18 subjects) this was due to the subject being lost to follow-up. The according-to-protocol immunogenicity analysis at Month 61 contained 223 subjects (109 in the ACWYBST group, 29 in the ACWY-DT group and 85 in the ACWYPRI group).

Across all three vaccine groups in the booster phase, the mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Month 61 was 20.9 years (range 15 to 30 years) with a standard deviation of 4.46. The distribution of males and females was 43.5% male and 56.5% female. According to race, 44.8% were White/Caucasian/European Heritage, 17.0% were American Indian or Alaskan Native and 13.5% were Other.

## o Unsolicited adverse events

At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 21.9 % of subjects in the ACWYBST, 23.7% of subjects in the ACWY-DT group and 15.8% of subjects in the ACWYPRI group during the 31-day period after vaccination. Grade 3 unsolicited events were reported in 4.4% of the subjects in the ACWYBST group. No grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported in the ACWY-DT and ACWYPRI groups.

The most commonly reported unsolicited adverse event in the ACWYBST group was nasopharyngitis (4 subjects, 2.2%) followed by upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and oropharyngeal pain (3 subjects, 1.6% for each event). The most commonly reported unsolicited adverse event in the ACWYDT group was upper respiratory infection (2 subjects, 5.3%) followed by vomiting, chills, injection site pruritus, pain in the extremity, dizziness, dysmenorrhoea, oropharyngeal pain, hypermetropia, and vaginitis bacterial, each reported in 1 subject (2.6%). The most commonly reported unsolicited adverse events in the ACWYPRI group were headache and influenza, each reported in 2 subjects (2.0%).

Vaccine related unsolicited symptoms were reported in 7.7% of subjects in the ACWYBST group, 7.9% of subjects in the ACWY-DT group, and in 5.0% of subjects in the ACWYPRI group. No grade 3 vaccine related unsolicited symptoms were reported in any of the groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Serious adverse events

SAEs were reported for 3 (1.6%) subjects in the ACWYBST group during the 6 month period following booster vaccination and were not considered related to vaccination. All events (acute appendicitis, depression and malaria) had recovered/resolved by the end of the study with one event recovered but with sequelae (subject with depression). No SAEs were reported in the ACWY-DT or ACWYPRI groups. No SAEs were reported within the 31 days after booster vaccination.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

Data from Year 5 of the extension of the original MenACWY-TT-059 study are available from 312 subjects. 852 subjects were randomised at baseline, and 487 returned for the Year 3 visit. Despite the limited number of subjects, particularly in the cohort who were aged under 11 years in the original vaccination phase, the data from Year 5 are consistent with those from Year 3, and generally show a persistence of effect against all four meningitis serogroups targeted by the vaccine. Although the MenA GMTs had dropped close to the pre-vaccination levels by12 months after vaccination, they continued to increase thereafter, up to Year 5. MenC GMTs declined between Years 3 and 5, but remained above baseline levels. The persistence of effect appears better with Nimenrix than with the comparator, Menactra.

In the booster study, the effect of a Nimenrix booster in subjects originally vaccinated with Nimenrix 5 years earlier in the original study was compared against that in subjects originally vaccinated with Menactra, and a cohort of vaccine-naïve subjects were administered a primary dose of Nimenrix as an additional comparison. A strong immunogenic response was observed in both booster groups, and no safety concerns were evident in the booster groups as compared with the vaccine-naïve group.

## III. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The MAH has provided Year 5 persistence data from the MenACWY-TT-059 (EXT052) study, which are broadly consistent with data from Year 3 of the study. A booster at Year 5 elicited a strong immunogenic response. No new safety concerns are raised.

The SmPC currently includes persistence data up to Year 3 from this study. This is acceptable.

## Recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a variation before any conclusion on product information amendments is made.

## Additional clarifications requested
