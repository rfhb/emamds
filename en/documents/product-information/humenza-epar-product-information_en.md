PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. The antigen is a colourless limpid to opalescent suspension. The adjuvant is a white opaque emulsion. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

In the different age groups, there are limited data (adults aged 18 to 60 years), very limited data (adults aged 61 years and over, children aged 6 months to 17 years) or no data (children aged less than 6 months) with HUMENZA as detailed in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children from 3 years of age, adolescents and adults up to 60 years of age:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Humenza in clinical studies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and the second dose.

## Elderly above 60 years of age:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Children from 6 months of age to less than 3 years of age: One half-dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date. Immunogenicity data obtained in a limited number of children aged 6-35 months show that there is a further immune response to a second half-dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three weeks. The use of a second half-dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. Children below 6 months of age: Vaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. For further information, see section 5.1. It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of HUMENZA, complete the vaccination course with HUMENZA (see section 4.4). Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection (IM) preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). For instructions for preparation, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde). If vaccination is considered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need. See section 4.4. for Special warnings and special precautions for use. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal, and to residues (ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde).

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.

HUMENZA should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no data with HUMENZA using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

There are no data on administration of AF03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of influenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Very limited data in children aged 6 to 35 months (N=96) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses indicate an increase in the rates of injection site reactions and general symptoms (see section 4.8.). In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature ≥ 38°C) may increase considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 8 years of age) after each vaccination. There are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with HUMENZA in adults aged over 60 years of age. There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of HUMENZA with other H1N1 pandemic vaccines. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction There are no data on co-administration of HUMENZA with other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation No data have been generated in pregnant or lactating women with the vaccine HUMENZA or with any other vaccine containing adjuvant AF03. A reproductive and developmental toxicity study conducted in rabbits with HUMENZA showed no effects on embryo fetal development.

The use of HUMENZA may be considered during pregnancy and lactation if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## · Clinical trials

## Adults and elderly:

In an open-label clinical trial, two doses (0.5 ml) of HUMENZA have been administered at a 3-week interval in 153 subjects (99 adults and 54 elderly).

Local and systemic reactions occurred within 7 days following any vaccine administration. These reactions were usually resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. The severity of these reactions was from grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate). The rate of grade 3 (severe) reactions was overall low ( ≤ 2%).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The most frequent reaction was injection site pain. Overall, reactions were more frequent in adults than in elderly and less frequent after the second dose in both age groups. Adverse reactions reported following any vaccination are listed below according to the following frequency: Very common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare (&lt;1/10,000) Nervous system disorders -Very common: headache Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders -Very common: myalgia General disorders and administration site conditions -Very common: injection site pain -Common: malaise, shivering, fever, injection site reactions such as induration, erythema, swelling, ecchymosis. Children and adolescent (from 3 to 17 years of age): In an open-label clinical trial, two doses (0.5 ml) of HUMENZA have been administered at a 3-week interval in 50 children from 3 to 8 years of age and 49 adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age. The safety has been assessed after each administration. Overall, reactions were more frequent in children and adolescents than in adults and elderly.

Local and systemic reactions occurred within 7 days following any vaccine administration. These reactions were usually resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset.

The severity of the local and systemic reactions was mainly from grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate). The rate of grade 3 (severe) reactions was overall low (from 2 to 14% in children from 3 to 8 years of age and from 2 to 8.2% in adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In children from 3 to 8 years of age, the most frequent reactions were injection site pain and injection site erythema. Overall, a higher frequency of injection site reactions and fever was reported in this age group compared to the adolescents. Moreover, a higher frequency of fever and headache was reported after the second dose than after the first dose.

In adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age, the most frequent reactions were injection site pain and headache. A higher frequency of headache was reported in this age group compared to the children, adults and elderly.

Percentages of subjects who reported the following adverse reactions after each dose are provided by age group in the table below:

Medicinal product no longer authorised This section describes the clinical experience with HUMENZA following administration of one or two vaccine doses (0.5 ml or 0.25 ml) at a 3-week interval. The immunogenicity 21 days after each dose has been assessed and is presented below for each age group according to the seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and the seroconversion factor, using haemagglutination inhibiting (HI) method. The seroprotection rate corresponds to the proportion of subjects achieving a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40. The seroconversion rate corresponds to the proportion of subjects with a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 achieving a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40, or the proportion of subjects with a ≥ four-fold increase from pre- to post-vaccination titer. The seroconversion factor corresponds to the geometric mean of individual ratios (post-/prevaccination titers). For all age groups: -Immunogenicity results observed with the seroneutralisation (SN) method reflect those observed with HI method. -No data on antibody persistence are currently available. Adults (from 18 to 60 years of age): In a clinical trial, the immunogenicity 21 days after each injection of HUMENZA given 21 days apart has been assessed in 99 adults.

A single administration of a human dose of HUMENZA elicited HI titers ≥ 80 and MN (Microneutralization) titers ≥ 160 specific to the vaccinal strain in 100% of vaccinated animals and a two-dose administration regimen markedly increased (at least a 5-fold increase) HI and MN antibody titers. A mean body weight loss of 20% was recorded in control group 4 days after infection. This body weight loss was reduced to ≤ 8% in animals that received 1 or 2 doses of HUMENZA. Four days after challenge, in the control group, 34% of the lungs were affected and presented lung lesions associated with high levels of virus replication in lung tissue ( ≥ 4.7 TCID50/g tissue).

Medicinal product no longer authorised * Proportion of subjects achieving a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 ** For subjects with a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10, proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 and for subjects with a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10, proportion of subjects with a ≥ four-fold increase from pre- to post-vaccination titer *** Geometric mean of individual ratios (post-/pre-vaccination titers) All children aged from 6 to 35 months were seronegative prior to vaccination. Information from non-clinical studies A challenge ferret study showed vaccine similar protection after one or two human doses based on lung macroscopic examination, body weight loss (as indicator of disease after challenge) and viral loads in lungs and in the upper respiratory tract. The ability of one or two administrations of HUMENZA to protect ferrets against infection in the lungs was evaluated. Groups of 7 ferrets were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with one human dose of HUMENZA (3.8 µg of HA and full dose AF03) (at D21) or 2-dose administration of one human dose at 3-week intervals (at D0 and D21) and compared to a control group (AF03 adjuvant diluted in PBS). Four weeks after the last vaccine administration, ferrets were challenged with the wild type homologous strain A/H1N1/Netherlands/602/2009.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In ferrets administered with one or two doses of HUMENZA, a significant reduction of lung damages (4 % or 1 % of affected lung, respectively) and of lung viral loads (more than 4 log10 reduction) was achieved resulting in 86% (6 out of 7 ferrets) or 100% of ferrets with no detectable virus in lungs, respectively. The protection against infection in the lungs was associated with vaccine-induced HI titers ≥ 40, a titer described in humans to be associated with protection against seasonal influenza. Viral shedding was assessed by measuring viral replication in both nasal and throat swabs and results demonstrated that HUMENZA was able to consistently reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Medicinal product no longer authorised Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Available non clinical data obtained with the vaccine HUMENZA or with the same vaccine but with another strain (A/H5N1) revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional  repeat dose toxicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies and an investigative pneumopathology study. Repeated injections of the vaccine induced moderate local inflammation in rabbits and no exacerbation of pneumonia after exposure to the parental wild-type virus in monkeys.  Rabbits dosed with vaccine, or with AF03 adjuvant alone, showed a slight increase of apoptosis / necrosis in the lachrymal tissues at doses higher than the human dose. Rabbits dams dosed with vaccine pre-mating and during gestation did not show any effects on embryofetal development. The adjuvant, AF03, was not mutagenic or clastogenic and induced transient inflammatory changes in repeat dose toxicity studies (in rats and rabbits). The reproductive and developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits with AF03 did not show any effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryofetal development or early postnatal development. 6.

Number of doses after mixing the content of antigen vial into the adjuvant vial: 10 doses of 0.5 ml. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling HUMENZA consists of 2 separate vials: -One vial containing the antigen (suspension) -One vial containing the adjuvant (emulsion) Before use, the two components should be mixed. Instructions for mixing the vaccine: 1. Before extemporaneous mix, the two vials (antigen and adjuvant) should be allowed to reach room temperature and must be gently swirled between hands and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), the vaccine should be discarded. 2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing with a sterile syringe and needle the entire content of the antigen vial and adding it into the adjuvant vial. 3. After the addition of the antigen to the adjuvant, the mixture should be gently shaken by at least 5 rotating movements. After mixing, the vaccine is a white opaque emulsion. 4. The volume of HUMENZA after mixing is at least 6 ml and allows the withdrawal of several doses (multidose vial). For the dose to be administered, see recommended posology in section 4.2. 5. After mixing HUMENZA should be stored in a refrigerator (2°C-8°C) (never place in the freezer) and should be used within 24 hours. 6. To facilitate tracking and timely disposal of partially used vials, it is suggested that the date and hour of mixing be clearly written on the label of adjuvant vial.

## Instructions for the administration of the vaccine:

1. Before injection the vaccine should be allowed to reach room temperature by gently swirling the vial between hands (not more than 5 minutes).
2. Prior to each administration, the multidose vial should be gently shaken by at least 5 rotating movements.
3. The content of the multidose vial as well as the content of the syringe after withdrawal should be inspected visually. The vaccine is of a white opaque emulsion appearance. If deviations from this description and/or any foreign particulate matter are observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), the vaccine should be discarded.

## · OTHER CONDITIONS

Medicinal product no longer authorised Official batch release : in accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. Pharmacovigilance system The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 10.0 presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains in use. PSUR submission during the influenza pandemic: During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for benefit-risk balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of the extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated. The MAH shall submit on a monthly basis a simplified periodic safety update report with the timelines, format and content as defined in the CHMP Recommendations for the Pharmacovigilance Plan as part of the Risk Management Plan to be submitted with the Marketing Authorisation Application for a Pandemic Influenza Vaccine (EMA/359381/2009) and any subsequent update.

## HUMENZA Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection

Pandemic influenza vaccine (H1N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted)

For the most up-to-date information please consult the website of the European Medicines Agency : http://www.ema.europa.eu/.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine.

-

Medicinal product no longer authorised -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor. In this leaflet : 1. What HUMENZA is and what it is used for 2. Before you receive HUMENZA 3. How HUMENZA is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store HUMENZA 6. Further information 1. WHAT HUMENZA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR HUMENZA is a vaccine to prevent pandemic influenza (flu). Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around the world. The symptoms (signs) of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but may be more severe. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE HUMENZA You should not receive HUMENZA:

if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of HUMENZA (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an allergic reaction.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Take special care with HUMENZA:

- -if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde (see section 6. Further information).
- -if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with HUMENZA,
- -if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with HUMENZA the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given HUMENZA.
- -as with all vaccines, HUMENZA may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. Children below 6 months of age: HUMENZA is not recommended in children below 6 months of age. Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. There is no information on administration of the vaccine HUMENZA with other vaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or if you are breastfeeding.
