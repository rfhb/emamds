## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Vaxchora effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension Cholera vaccine (recombinant, live, oral)

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each dose of vaccine contains 4 x 10 8 to 2 x 10 9 viable cells of Vibrio cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD 103-HgR 1 .

1  Produced by recombinant DNA technology.

This product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

## Excipients with known effect

Each dose of vaccine contains approximately 2.3 grams of lactose, 12.5 milligrams of sucrose, and 863 milligrams of sodium.

For the full list of excipients see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension.

White-to-off-white buffer powder and white-to-beige active ingredient powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Vaxchora is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 in adults and children aged 2 years and older.

This vaccine should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

Adults and children aged 2 years and older

A single oral dose should be administered at least 10 days prior to potential exposure to Vibrio cholerae O1.

Consumption of less than a half dose may result in decreased protection. If less than half the dose is consumed, consideration may be given to repeating a full dose of Vaxchora within 72 hours.

## Revaccination

No data are available on revaccination interval.

Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety and efficacy of Vaxchora in children less than 2 years has not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Oral use.

For instructions on reconstitution of Vaxchora prior to administration, see section 6.6.

Eating and drinking should be avoided 60 minutes before and after oral ingestion of this vaccine. The reconstituted vaccine forms a slightly cloudy suspension that may contain some white particulates. After reconstitution, the suspension should be drunk within 15 minutes. The recipient should drink the full contents of the cup at once.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Individuals with congenital immune deficiency or receiving immunosuppressive treatment.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Factors affecting protection

Vaxchora confers protection specific to Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1. Immunisation does not protect against Vibrio cholerae O139 or other species of Vibrio.

This vaccine does not provide 100% protection. Vaccinees should adhere to hygiene advice and exercise caution regarding food and water consumed in cholera-affected areas.

No data are available in persons living in cholera-affected areas or in individuals with pre-existing immunity to cholera.

The protection afforded by this vaccine may be reduced in HIV-infected individuals.

## Potential risk to contacts

Vaxchora shedding in the stools was studied for 7 days post-vaccination, and was observed in 11.3% of vaccine recipients. The duration of shedding of the vaccine strain is unknown. There is a potential for transmission of the vaccine strain to non-vaccinated close contacts (e.g., household contacts).

## Concomitant administration with antibacterial agents and/or chloroquine

Concomitant administration with antibacterial agents and/or chloroquine should be avoided because protection against cholera may be diminished (see section 4.5).

## Gastrointestinal Disease

In individuals with acute gastroenteritis, vaccination should be postponed until after recovery, because protection against cholera may be diminished. The degree of protection and the effects of vaccination in individuals with chronic gastrointestinal disease are unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Limitations of the clinical data

Clinical trials were conducted in individuals age 2 to 64 years old. Efficacy was demonstrated in a human cholera challenge at 10 days or 3 months post-vaccination in adults age 18-45 years and immunobridging to other populations based on the rate of seroconversion. Immunogenicity data are available for 24 months post-vaccination (see section 5.1). There are no immunogenicity or efficacy data in individuals over 64 years of age.

## Excipients

This vaccine contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

This vaccine contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucosegalactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

This vaccine contains 863 mg of sodium per dose, equivalent to 43% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g of sodium for a healthy adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed with Vaxchora, however data and clinical experience from other vaccines can be applicable to this vaccine.

## Oral typhoid vaccine

There should be an interval of 2 hours between the administration of this vaccine and of typhoid vaccine Ty21a (gastro-resistant capsules) as the buffer administered with this vaccine may affect the transit of the capsules through the gastrointestinal tract.

## Antibiotics

Concomitant administration of this vaccine with systemic antibiotics active against Vibrio cholerae should be avoided since these agents may prevent a sufficient degree of replication to occur in order to induce a protective immune response. This vaccine should not be administered to patients who have received oral or parenteral antibiotics within 14 days prior to vaccination. Oral or parenteral antibiotics should be avoided for 10 days following vaccination with this vaccine.

## Antimalarial prophylaxis

Data from the study of a previous CVD 103-HgR-based vaccine indicate that immune responses to Vaxchora and protection against cholera may be diminished when this vaccine is administered concomitantly with chloroquine. Administer this vaccine at least 10 days before beginning antimalarial prophylaxis with chloroquine. There are no data regarding concomitant use of this vaccine with other anti-malarial drugs.

## Food and drink

The vaccine is acid-labile and is administered with a buffer. Eating and drinking should be avoided for 60 minutes before and after taking this vaccine as this may interfere with the protective effect of the buffer.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited data from the use of Vaxchora in pregnant women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). This vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Vaxchora is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from using this vaccine taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of the vaccine for the woman.

## Fertility

No human or animal data on the effect of Vaxchora on fertility are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Vaxchora has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under Section 4.8 (e.g., fatigue, dizziness) may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most frequent reported adverse reactions following Vaxchora administration are fatigue (30.2%), headache (28.3%), abdominal pain (18.4%), nausea/vomiting (17.9%), and decreased appetite (15.7%).

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The adverse reaction frequency classification used is as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A clinical trial was conducted in 550 children age 2 to &lt;18 years. Based on the results of this trial the type of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to those in adults. Some adverse reactions were more common in children than adults, including fatigue (35.7% vs 30.2%), abdominal pain (27.8% vs 18.4%), vomiting (3.8% vs 0.2%), decreased appetite (21.4% vs 15.7%) and pyrexia (2.4% vs 0.8%).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There have been reports of multiple doses of Vaxchora being administered several weeks apart. The adverse reactions reported were comparable to those seen after the recommended dose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Cholera vaccines, ATC code: J07AE02

## Mechanism of action

Vaxchora contains live attenuated cholera bacteria ( Vibrio cholerae O1 classical Inaba strain CVD 103-HgR) that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient and induce serum vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses. Immune mechanisms conferring protection against cholera following receipt of the vaccine have not been determined, however, rises in serum vibriocidal antibody 10 days after vaccination with this vaccine were associated with protection in a human challenge study.

## Efficacy against cholera challenge

Vaxchora efficacy against cholera was demonstrated in a human challenge study conducted in 197 healthy adult volunteers mean age 31 years (range 18 to 45, 62.9% male, 37.1% female) in which a subset of vaccine or placebo recipients were challenged with live Vibrio cholerae at 10 days postvaccination (n=68) or 3 months post-vaccination (n=66). Protective efficacy against moderate to severe diarrhoea is shown in Table 1.

In individuals with blood group O only, the protective efficacy against moderate or severe diarrhoea was 84.8% in the 10day challenge group (n=19) and 78.4% in the 3 month challenge group (n=20).

## Immunogenicity

The human challenge study showed that vibriocidal seroconversion, defined as a four-fold or greater rise in serum vibriocidal antibody titres from baseline measured 10 days after vaccination, had a nearly one-to-one correlation with protection against moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. Seroconversion was therefore selected as the immunologic bridge between adults age 18 to &lt;46 years in the challenge study and other populations, i.e. older adults and paediatric subjects. Three additional studies evaluated immunogenicity: a large trial in 3146 healthy adults age 18 to&lt;46 years (mean age 29.9, range 18-46, 45.2% male, 54.8% female) (Study 3); a trial in 398 healthy older adults age 46 to &lt;65 years (mean age 53.8, range 46-64, 45.7% male, 54.3% female) (Study 4); and a paediatric trial in healthy subjects age 2-&lt;18 years (Study 5). Prespecified immunobridging analyses, based on differences in seroconversion rates, were determined to demonstrate non-inferiority in seroconversion rate between older adults or paediatric subjects and the adults age 18 to &lt;46 in the large immunogenicity trial.

The seroconversion rates in vaccine and placebo recipients from each trial at 10 days post-vaccination, as well as immunobridging results, are summarised in Tables 2 and 4. In the challenge study, 79.8% of subjects seroconverted by 7 days post-vaccination. Seroconversion rates in older adults and paediatric subjects were non-inferior to those in younger adults.

In the three adult studies significant increases in the percentage of anti-O1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) IgA and IgG memory B cells and anti-cholera toxin IgG memory B cells were seen at 90 and 180 days after vaccination.  No relationship between age and memory B cell response was observed. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of serum vibriocidal antibodies in vaccinated subjects were also significantly higher than the respective GMTs of placebo recipients at 90 and 180 days after immunisation in all age groups. The duration of protection is not known.

## Paediatric population

An immunogenicity trial was conducted in 550 healthy children age 2 to &lt;18 years (mean age 9.0, range 2-17, 52.0% male, 48.0% female) (study 5). In the immunogenicity evaluable population (n=466) the ratio of male to female was 52.8% male and 47.2% female. The seroconversion results in vaccine and placebo recipients and immunobridging results are shown in Table 4.

Long-term immunogenicity data are available from a subset of children age 12 to &lt;18 years. The seroconversion rate ranged from 100% at 28 days post-vaccination to 64.5% at 729 days postvaccination.  The seroconversion results over time are shown in Table 5.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product contains genetically modified organisms. Unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in compliance with the local biosafety guidelines.

To prepare the vaccine for administration the active and buffer component sachets are removed from the refrigerator no more than 12 hours at 25°C prior to reconstitution.

It is important to mix the sachets in the order described. First, the contents of the buffer sachet 1 (a white-to-off-white powder) are mixed with 100 mL of cold or room temperature (≤25°C) noncarbonated or carbonated bottled water in a cup. For children age 2 to &lt;6 years ONLY, half (50 mL) of the buffer solution should then be discarded before proceeding to the next step. Second, the contents of the active component sachet 2 (a white-to-beige powder) are then added and the mixture is stirred for at least 30 seconds. The reconstituted vaccine forms a slightly cloudy suspension that may contain some white particulates. Sucrose (up to 4 g/ 1 teaspoon) or stevia sweetener (no more than 1 gram / ¼ teaspoon) may then be stirred into the suspension if desired. DO NOT add other sweeteners as this may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. The dose should be administered within 15 minutes of reconstitution. Some residue may remain in the cup. The cup should be washed with soap and hot water.

Note: if the sachets are reconstituted in the incorrect order, the vaccine must be discarded.

## Vaxchora effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension cholera vaccine (recombinant, live, oral)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you take this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.
- -This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Vaxchora is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Vaxchora
3. How to take Vaxchora
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Vaxchora
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Vaxchora is and what it is used for

Vaxchora is an oral vaccine against cholera that stimulates the immunological defence in the gut. The vaccine is used for protection from cholera in adults and children aged 2 years and older. The vaccine must be taken at least 10 days before travelling to a cholera-affected area.

## How Vaxchora works

Vaxchora prepares the immune system (the body's defences) to defend itself against cholera. When a person takes the vaccine, the immune system makes proteins called antibodies against the cholera bacterium and its toxin (harmful substance) that causes diarrhoea. In this way the immune system is ready to fight cholera bacteria if the person comes into contact with it.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Vaxchora

## Do not take Vaxchora:

- -if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6).
- -if you have a weakened immune system, for example, if you were born with a weakened immune system or if you are having treatments such as high-dose corticosteroid treatment, cancer medicines or radiotherapy that can weaken the immune system.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Vaxchora.

Contact a doctor immediately if you get the following serious side effects (see also Section 4):

- serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face or throat,hives, itchy rash, breathlessness and/or a drop in blood pressure and fainting.

If you present any of the following or a combination of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse prior to taking the vaccine. Vaccination should be postponed until after recovery because protection against cholera may be diminished.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Not everyone taking this vaccine will be fully protected against cholera. It is important to continue to follow hygiene advice and take special care with food and water in cholera-affected areas.

This vaccine may be less effective if you have HIV.

Bacteria from the vaccine may be present in your stool for at least 7 days after you take the vaccine. To prevent any contamination, wash your hands thoroughly after visiting the toilet, changing nappies and before preparing food for at least 14 days after you take this vaccine.

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this vaccine to children younger than 2 years of age because it is not known how well it works in this age group.

## Other medicines and Vaxchora

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because this vaccine can affect the way some other medicines and vaccines work.

In particular tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking:

- -antibiotics - this vaccine may not work if you take it while you are also taking antibiotics. Take this vaccine no earlier than 14 days after the last dose of an antibiotic. Avoid antibiotics for 10 days after taking this vaccine.
- -chloroquine for malaria prevention - this vaccine may not work if you take it while you are also taking chloroquine. Take this vaccine at least 10 days before starting chloroquine or 14 days after taking chloroquine.
- -the typhoid vaccine Ty21a - this vaccine may not work if it is taken at the same time as Ty21a. You should take this vaccine at least 2 hours before or after taking Ty21a.

If any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this vaccine.

## Vaxchora with food and drink

You must not eat or drink for 60 minutes before and after taking this vaccine as this may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

Vaxchora vaccine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 'Possible side effects' may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination.

## Vaxchora contains lactose, sucrose, and sodium

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.

This vaccine contains 863 mg of sodium (the main component of cooking/table salt) per dose.  This is equivalent to 43% of the recommended daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Please take this into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

## 3. How to take Vaxchora

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always take this vaccine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

The recommended dose is the contents of both sachets in the carton. However for children 2 to less than 6 years old take note of Step 8 in the instructions on how to prepare the vaccine, shown below.

Protection against cholera is established within 10 days after taking Vaxchora. Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will tell you how soon before travelling to take the vaccine.

## Instructions:

## PREPARE THIS VACCINE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN THIS LEAFLET

## Please read the following before you begin:

Vaxchora may not work if the following occurs:

- Incorrect storage; the vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator (2  C - 8  C).
- Using the incorrect amount of water; 100 mL must be used.
- Using the incorrect type of water; bottled water that is cold or room temperature and noncarbonated or carbonated must be used.
- Mixing the sachets in the wrong order; sachet 1 must be added to the water first. If the sachets are mixed in the wrong order you must discard the vaccine and request a replacement dose.
- Eating or drinking; must be avoided 60 minutes before and after taking the vaccine, eating or drinking can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Do not touch your eyes when you prepare the vaccine to avoid contamination.

If any powder or liquid gets spilt, clean the surface with hot water and soap or an antibacterial disinfectant.

If there is a significant spill (more than a few drops of liquid or grains of powder), dispose of the vaccine and get a new one from your doctor or pharmacist; DO NOT take the remaining medication.

Step 1

Step 2

Gather materials:

- Clean cup
- Utensil to stir
- Bottled water (non-carbonated or carbonated, cold or room temperature, 25°C or less)
- Item to measure 100 mL of bottled water (e.g. measuring jug)
- Scissors

| Step 3   | Locate the two sachets: the sachets are labelled 1 and 2. Sachet 1 contains 'Vaxchora Buffer' and is black and white. Sachet 2 contains 'Vaxchora Active ingredient' and is blue and white. If a sachet is not intact, do not use either sachet and contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about acquiring a replacement dose; using a sachet that is not intact can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine..   |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 4   | Measure 100 mL of bottled cold or room temperature non-carbonated or carbonated water and pour into a clean cup. Using bottled water is necessary for the vaccine to be effective -using non-bottled (e.g. tap water) may render the vaccine ineffective.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Step 5   | Use scissors to cut off the top of sachet 1. Do not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash your hands if you touch the sachet contents, in order to reduce the chance of contamination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Use scissors to cut off the top of sachet 2.

Do not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash your hands if you touch the sachet contents, in order to reduce the chance of contamination.

Empty the contents of sachet 2 into the cup.

Stir for at least 30 seconds. The powder from sachet 2 may not dissolve completely. It will form a slightly cloudy mixture with some white particles.

DO NOT add other sweeteners as this may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Drink the full contents of the cup within 15 minutes of preparing it. Some residue may remain in the cup and must be discarded.  If you or your child take less than half of the dose, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse right away about the need for a repeat dose.

Dispose of the empty sachets according to local biosafety guidelines.

Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse how to throw away medicine waste material.

If a spill occurs while stirring or drinking the medication, or there is any residue (powder or liquid left behind from a stirring utensil, cup, or other object) on the mixing surface, clean up spilled material or residue preferably with a disposable paper towel/cloth using hot water and soap or antibacterial disinfectant. Discard the paper towel together with the sachets (see above).
