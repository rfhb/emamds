Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

In August 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for 'treatment of Nonsense Mutation Aniridia' , in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Information on the development program The MAH stated that PTC-124-GD-028-ANI is a stand-alone study to assess the efficacy and safety of ataluren for the treatment of aniridia. Aniridia,  a  familial  condition  with  autosomal  dominant  inheritance,  is  a  bilateral,  panocular  disorder affecting the cornea, iris, intraocular pressure, lens, fovea, and optic nerve (Valenzuela 2004, Netland 2011,  Hingorani  2012,  Chang  2014).  The  vast  majority  of  cases  of  aniridia  are  associated  with mutations in the PAX6  gene,  which  is located  on  chromosome  11p13  and  regulates  ocular development.  The  phenotype  is  variable  between  and  within  families;  however,  affected  individuals usually show little variability between the 2 eyes. Individuals with aniridia characteristically show the absence of iris, nystagmus, impaired visual acuity (usually 20/100 to 20/200), and foveal hypoplasia. Aniridia  mainly  manifests  in  the  eye,  but  there  are  additional  characteristics  of  aniridia,  including obesity (Netland 2011) and impaired glucose tolerance and/or diabetes (Wen 2009) as PAX6 regulates not  only  eye  development  but  also  islet  cell  development  (Yasuda  2002).  PAX6  continues  to  be expressed through adulthood, contributing to the maintenance of function in the eye and other tissues. Individuals with isolated aniridia may show reduced olfaction and cognition, behavioural problems, or developmental delay. Nonsense  mutations  are  the  cause  of  congenital  aniridia  in  ~40%  of  patients  (Tzoulaki  2005). Nonsense mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) correspond to premature stop codons in mRNA. Ataluren  is  a  small-molecule  drug  that  promotes  ribosomal  readthrough  of  mRNA  containing  a premature stop codon. Through this mechanism of action, ataluren is thought to overcome the genetic defect in patients with a nonsense mutation that causes aniridia. 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Ataluren used in the study is the same drug as approved in the EU for nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) ambulatory subjects. Ataluren is available as white to off-white granules for  oral  suspension  packaged  in  child-resistant  sachets  (packets)  and  supplied  in  dose  strengths containing  125,  250,  or  1000  mg  of  the  active  drug  substance.  All  excipients  were  tested  to pharmaceutical or food grade and are generally recognized as safe. 2.3. Clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- PTC-124-GD-028-ANI;  randomized,  double-masked,  placebo-controlled  study  of  ataluren  in children ≥ 2 years old with aniridia whose disease is mediated by a nonsense mutation (nmAniridia).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## PTC-124-GD-028-ANI

Description Study PTC124-GD-028-ANI was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of ataluren in children ≥2 years old with aniridia whose disease is mediated by a nonsense mutation (nmAniridia). Methods Objective(s) The  therapeutic  rationale  for  the  study  was  to  evaluate  whether  ataluren  may  offer  an  effective therapy by restoring critical protein production for aniridia. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ataluren on Maximum Reading Speed as measured using the Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test (MNREAD) Acuity Charts. The secondary  objectives of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  ataluren  on  other  functional outcome measures (e.g. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Iris area) and characterize the systemic and ocular safety profile of ataluren in subjects with nonsense mutation aniridia. Study design Study  PTC124-GD-028-ANI  was  a  Phase  2,  multicenter,  stratified,  randomized,  double-masked, placebo-controlled  study  with  a  4-week  screening  period,  a  144-week  treatment  period,  an  optional 96-week open-label sub-study, and a 4-week post-treatment follow-up period (either following study completion or early termination [ET]) (Figure 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During  the  4-week  screening  period,  subjects  were  assessed  for  eligibility,  which  included  a  clinical diagnosis of aniridia and the presence of a nonsense mutation in 1 allele of the PAX6 gene. Subjects with  other  significant  ocular  or  systemic  diseases  and  those  undergoing  warfarin,  phenytoin,  or tolbutamide, IV aminoglycoside or IV vancomycin or systemic cyclosporine therapy were excluded.

Eligible subjects were randomized in a masked  2:1 fashion to either ataluren or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age: ≤ 10 years versus &gt;10 years. Masked study drug was dosed 3 times  a  day:  10  mg/kg  in  the  morning,  10  mg/kg  at  midday,  and  20  mg/kg  in  the  evening  for  48 weeks. Subjects (or parent/legal guardian) recorded each dose on a diary card provided by the MAH. After completing Stage 1 of the parent study (Week 48), subjects were eligible for an additional 96 weeks  of  open-label  ataluren  treatment.  Subjects  who  received  ataluren  during  Stage  1  were  to continue to receive ataluren; subjects who had been randomized to placebo in Stage 1 were to receive ataluren during Stage 2. During this phase, the posology remained unchanged, i.e. ataluren was dosed 3 times a day. There  was  an  optional  Open-Label  (OL)  sub-study  at  the  end  of  the  Stage  2  Open-Label  Extension (OLE).  Subjects  were  able  to  consent  to  receive  an  additional  96  weeks  of  ataluren  treatment, returning to the clinic every 24 weeks. Subjects who  chose  not  to participate in the OL  sub-study  were  required to complete  the posttreatment follow-up visit at the end of the Stage 2 OLE. The start of the sub-study required prior approval  of  a  protocol  amendment  from  applicable  Institutional  Review  Boards  and  was  planned  to continue for 96 weeks. Analyses of the double-masked phase were conducted after the last subject had completed Week 96. After the subject's last dose of ataluren, there was a 4-week post-treatment follow-up period. CHMP comment It should be noted that the study was originally primarily a safety study; however, no explanation was provided why the study was changed into an efficacy study in 2019, i.e. almost 3 years after the first subject was enrolled and 2 months before the last subject enrolled. Furthermore, any explanation for the stratification by age is also lacking. Study population /Sample size A minimum of 36 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of nonsense mutation aniridia who were ≥ 2 years of  age  were  planned  for  enrolment  into  this  study  at  investigator  sites  in  United  States  (US)  and Canada. Treatments Ataluren used in the study is the same drug as approved in the EU. Ataluren was provided as granules for oral suspension with a white to off-white powder appearance. For administration, the powder in the sachet could be mixed with water, fruit juice, fruit punch, or milk (skim, 1% fat, 2% fat, whole milk, chocolate milk, soy milk, or lactose -free milk), or semi-solid food (yogurt, pudding, or applesauce). Medicinal product no longer authorised

For placebo, a white to off-white granule placebo formulation was provided for oral suspension. The placebo  formulation  was  manufactured  under  cGMP  conditions.  The  dry  granules  and  the  liquid suspension of the drug matched the active formulation in appearance, odour, and taste. The placebo formulation contained excipients similar to those used in the active product. The placebo was packaged in  the  same aluminum foil, child-resistant sachets using weights and volumes to match each of the 125-, 250-, and 1000-mg dose strengths of active drug sachets.

## CHMP comment

The  same  ataluren  was  used  in  the  study  as  approved  for  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  (DMD) treatment.

<!-- image -->

For a statistical hypothesis test for any efficacy endpoint, the study would have 60% power to detect an effect size (i.e., standardized mean difference) of 0.85, or 80% power to detect an effect size of 1.06, at the 0.05 significance level (two-sided).

Outcomes/endpoints The primary  endpoint of  the  study  is  percent  change  from  baseline  (Visit  2/Day  1)  to  Week  48  in Maximum Reading Speed of both eyes (OU) as measured using the Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test (MNREAD) Acuity Charts. The secondary  endpoint included  the  characterization  of  the  systemic  and  ocular  safety  profile  of ataluren. All safety presentations were based on the Safety Population and were based only on data included in the analysis period of interest. Secondary  efficacy outcomes  included  the  effect  of  ataluren  on  Reading  Accessibility  Index,  Bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA), Critical Print Size, Reading Acuity, Severity of corneal keratopathy and Iris area. Exploratory  endpoints were  also  included  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  ataluren  further.  These  included assessment of Ocular surface epithelial cell differentiation, Central corneal thickness, Retinal thickness, Iris length, Foveal hypoplasia, Ocular symptoms, Intraocular pressure, Levels of paired box 6 (PAX6) protein and downstream ocular proteins regulated by PAX6 (e.g., matrix metallopeptidase 9, in ocular tissue), Insulin/c-peptide level and Ataluren concentrations in aqueous humour. CHMP comment Note that subjects were enrolled into the study when the study was still primarily designed as a safety study (in 2016). As indicated previously the study was changed into an efficacy study almost 3 years after  the  first  subject  was  enrolled  and  2  months  before  the  last  subject  enrolled.  An  adequate assessment  of  the  outcome  of  the  study  is  questioned  as  the  chosen  primary  endpoint  cannot  be reliably assessed in the population included in the trial. The study includes subjects from 2 years of age and older, while the MNREAD acuity can only be reliably assessed in subjects ≥ 8 years of age. In addition also for subjects &gt;8 years of age different performance levels are distinguished; children 8-16 years show an increase with age, while persons 16-40 years show no change and middle aged to older adults show a decreases. As, there is no upper age limit in the study, differences in performance based on age etc., should be accounted for. The MAH did not provide a justification for the chosen primary endpoint. The use of the MNREAD acuity chart is questioned as this may not be the most relevant outcome measure for subjects with aniridia apart  from  the  questionable  suitability  for  the  population  included.  Subjects  with  aniridia  generally present with symptoms of photosensitivity, which is not included in the study. In addition, in isolated aniridia, cognitive functioning may be impaired, or subjects could suffer from cognitive disfunction or developmental delay. Both impact the performance on the MNREAD. Statistical Methods Medicinal product no longer authorised

Eligible subjects were randomized in a masked  2:1 fashion to either ataluren or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age: ≤ 10 years versus &gt;10 years

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two analysis populations were defined for the statistical analyses:

- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population / Safety Population: This population included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

<!-- image -->

· Efficacy Analysis Populations: For each efficacy outcome measure, this population included all subjects who had a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value. The  ITT  and  efficacy  populations  are  identical  in  the  study,  so,  only  data  from  ITT  Population  is presented. CHMP comment The power calculation based on an effect on any efficacy endpoint follows the change in study design from a safety  study  to  an  efficacy  study.  No  rationale  is  given  for  the  low  predefined  power  in  the context of a higher likelihood of not demonstrating an true effect. Furthermore, it is unknown which endpoint is the best to assess clinically relevant differences. An effect size of 0.85 or 1.06 is considered marginal on some of the scales, e.g. BCVA where a clinically relevant difference is 5 letters or retina thickness falls within the natural variability ranges. Furthermore, the choice for stratification at age 10 is  not  understood  but  could  be  related  to  the  original  study  design  where  the  focus  was  on  safety rather  than  efficacy.  However,  these  concern  are  not  pursued  as  the  study  is  not  appropriate  to conclude on efficacy of the product in treatment of aniridia and the flaws that are also acknowledged by the MAH. Results Recruitment/ Number analysed A total of 44 individuals were screened and 39 were randomized across 3 study sites, all of whom met the definition for the ITT and Safety Populations. Of these 39 subjects, 34 (87%) completed Week 48 (Stage  1),  19  (56%)  completed  the  open-label  portion  through  Week  144  (Stage  2),  and  5  (26%) completed the open-label sub-study through Week 240 (Table 1).

CHMP comment A participant flow chart would have been clearer than the provided tabulated overview. Compared with placebo, fewer patients in the ataluren group completed stage 1, i.e. the Week 48 double-blind phase. In the open-label extension, when placebo switched to ataluren, completion was comparable. The  subjects  who  received  a  placebo  during  the  double-blind  phase  switched  to  ataluren  treatment after week 48. Therefore, this should be the delayed start group as they no longer received a placebo. During the open-label phase the drop-out rate was comparable between the delayed start group and the early start group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 5 subjects who did not complete treatment through Week 48 (Stage 1), 4 were in the ataluren group (3 subjects withdrew consent at Week 24 and 1 subject was unable to tolerate the treatment); 1 subject in the placebo group was noncompliant with study drug.

Of the 14 (41%) subjects who did not complete Stage 2, 3 terminated the study due to AEs and 11 withdrew due to other reasons, including loss of interest (8 subjects), social and resource stresses (1 subject), start of a new job (1 subject), and difficulty of medication preparation and administration for parents (1 subject). CHMP comment The high proportion of subjects not completing the study is a concern. Particularly as drop-out rate was two times higher in the ataluren group compared to the placebo group in the double blind phase. It is noted  that  the  predefined  randomization  ratio  between  subjects  available  for  analysis  at  48  weeks remained proportional, i.e. an 2:1 ratio between ataluren and placebo. The flow chart presented is a bit misleading as the proportion of subjects per arm is only included for the subjects who completed the MNREAD at 48 weeks and not during the full course of the study. Baseline data Demographic characteristics of subjects are summarized in Table 2 Gender  distribution  was  relatively  similar  in  total  population  with  54%  males  and  46%  females. However, there was a higher proportion of males in the ataluren group (62%), as compared to the placebo group (39%). Race and ethnicity were well-balanced between the 2 groups, with the majority of all subjects white (85%) and not Hispanic or Latino (97%).

There was an imbalance of age between the 2 groups in the overall population with a mean of 14.1 years in the ataluren group, as compared to 19.2 years in the placebo group. The primary endpoint of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Maximum Reading Speed of OU was measured using the MNREAD Acuity Charts, which could only be assessed  in  subjects  ≥8  years  old  for  which  the  imbalance  was  greater  than the  overall  population (mean age of 17.4 versus 32.3 years in the ataluren and placebo groups, respectively). Data for the primary endpoint were available for a total of 11 subjects in the ataluren group and 5 subjects in the placebo  group  where  the  imbalance  was  even  more  severe  (mean  age  of  16.5  versus  34.0  years, respectively).

CHMP comments Baseline data are presented with the efficacy results in the section below. The imbalance in age between the ataluren group and placebo group is a concern as this may impact an unbiased read out of the outcome parameter since performance on the MNREAD is associated with age. Efficacy results MNREAD data were available for 11 ataluren-treated subjects and 5 placebo-treated subjects at the Week  48  endpoint,  representing  fewer  than  half  of  the  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study.  The  mean (standard deviation) percent change from baseline was 11.14 (30.322) in the ataluren group and -3.68 (29.769) in the placebo group. When the comparison was made by adjusting for baseline values and age, the mean treatment difference was 11% (CI:-22%, 43%) (see Table 3). Table 3: Maximum Reading Speed (MNREAD) (words per minute) - ITT Population (Age ≥8 years) - Bilateral Vision Similar results as for the MNREAD were also shown for the Reading Accessibility Index and Critical Print Size. No apparent change in logMAR visual acuity was found. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## CHMP comment

On  a  group  level,  changes  are  observed.  However,  as  the  number  of  subjects  who  could  reliably perform the MNREAD are limited, mean age was different between groups, and there is a high drop-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

out, individual profiles over time would be more informative. Particularly as more subjects are included for the baseline measure than for week 48 (LOCF). As change from baseline is the primary endpoint, BOCF may have given a more accurate account of the effect, as the missing subjects may now drive the effect.

As  also  indicated  by  the  MAH,  the  confidence  interval  has  a  wide  range;  therefore,  a  difference between placebo is not shown/demonstrated. A more informative representation of the data will not be requested as the aniridia indication is not pursued. The main requirement of the current procedure is the submission of the study data, which the MAH has complied to. Safety results During  Stage  1  of  the  study,  the  most  commonly  reported  SOCs  in  the  ataluren  group  were gastrointestinal disorders (19 subjects, 73%), general disorders and administration site conditions (9 subjects, 35%), eye disorders (6 subjects, 23%), and infections and infestations (6 subjects, 23%). For the placebo group, the most commonly reported SOCs were gastrointestinal disorders (8 subjects, 62%), general disorders and administration site conditions (5 subjects, 39%), and eye disorders (5 subjects, 39%). The most commonly occurring individual AEs (&gt;10% subjects) in both groups were upper abdominal pain, malaise, vomiting, dry eye, and nausea. Additionally, flatulence and increased lacrimation occurred in &gt;10% subjects in the ataluren group and eye pruritus, abdominal discomfort, and eye discharge occurred in &gt;10% subjects in the placebo group. During  the  open-label  extension  phase,  the  most  commonly  reported  SOCs  were  eye  disorders  (29 subjects, 78%), gastrointestinal disorders (27 subjects, 73%), infections and infestations (20 subjects, 54%), general disorders and administration site conditions (17 subjects, 46%), and investigations (10 subjects, 27%). The most commonly occurring individual AEs (&gt;10% subjects) were photophobia, eye pruritus, increased lacrimation, upper abdominal pain, dry eye, malaise, vomiting, viral gastroenteritis, influenza, pyrexia, conjunctivitis, eye pain, and nausea CHMP comment The adverse events reported are either in line with that known for ataluren treatment or in line with disease progression. No new or unexpected findings were reported. 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects From an efficacy point of view, no conclusion can be drawn as the study was not properly designed to assess efficacy. The study was modified from a safety study into an efficacy study, which led to an uneven distribution of subjects able to perform the Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test (MNREAD). The choice  for  this  endpoint  itself  is  questioned  as  this  may  not  be  the  most  relevant  for  the  aniridia population, who generally are presented with photophobia. In addition, the overall number of subjects included was very limited. The  data  should  have  been  presented  in  a  different  manner  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  ataluren  in aniridia, e.g. individual profiles. The confidence interval has a wide range; therefore, a difference from placebo is not shown. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No new or unexpected safety findings were reported, as the adverse events reported are either in line with that known for ataluren treatment or in line with disease progression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted the study PTC124-GD-028-ANI in line with the regulatory requirements and has fulfilled these.

<!-- image -->

The study was originally a phase II safety study which was modified into an efficacy study 2 months before the last subject enrolled in the study. As a consequence, the chosen primary endpoint could not be reliably  assessed  in  all  included  subjects.  The  late  choice  of  the  primary  endpoint  resulted  in  an uneven distribution in the age of subjects, which is an important effect modifier of MNREAD. Moreover, the choice for the primary endpoint itself is questioned. As cognition may be impaired in these patients or  aniridia  subjects  may  show  developmental  delay,  reading  speed  may  be  hampered  as  well.  In addition,  subjects  who  suffer  from  aniridia  have  photophobia;  therefore,  an  endpoint  related  to  the symptoms would be more logical. No  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  the  study  as  the  number  of  subjects  was  limited,  there  was  an uneven  distribution  of  subjects,  the  choice  of  the  primary  endpoint  is  questionable  the  confidence interval  has  a  wide  range;  therefore,  a  difference  from  placebo  is  not  shown.  In  addition,  the  data should  have  been  presented  in  a  different  manner  to  allow  assessment  of  efficacy,  e.g.  presenting individual profiles. However, these major concerns are not pursued as the MAH is not applying for the aniridia indication. No unexpected safety findings were reported. No additional requirement are needed. Fulfilled: No regulatory action required. Medicinal product no longer authorised
