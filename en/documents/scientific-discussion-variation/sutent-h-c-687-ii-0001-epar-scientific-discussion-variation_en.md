## Introduction

Sutent was authorised in the EU in July 2006 for the following indications:

'SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib mesylate treatment due to resistance or intolerance.

SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) after failure of interferon alfa or interleukin-2 therapy.

Efficacy  is  based  on  time  to  tumour  progression  and  an  increase  in  survival  in  GIST  and  on  objective response rates for MRCC. (see section 5.1).'

The Marketing Authorisation (MA) was granted as a Conditional Marketing Authorisation pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The Applicant agreed to provide, as requested by the CHMP, results of an ongoing study (Study A6181034) in cytokine-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma as a specific obligation.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has now submitted a Type II variation, which includes the requested efficacy and safety data from an analysis of Study A6181034 (A phase III randomised study of sunitinib versus interferon-alfa as first line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma).

An interim analysis of this study has already been presented to the CHMP during the assessment of the original marketing authorisation application early in 2006.

The provision of this specific obligation serves as an application to extend the indication from second to first line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and to switch from a conditional to a 'normal' marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 7 of regulation (EC) No 507/2006.

## Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (MRCC)

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a malignancy originating from the tubular cells of the kidney, comprises 80% to 85% of all renal parenchymal malignancies reported from surgical series.  Some 75% to 85% of  RCCs  are  histologically  classified  as  'clear  cell';  these  tumors  tend  to  be  very  vascular,  and typically metastasize to lung, bone, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands.

Incidence  rates  for  RCC  vary  by  more  than  10-  to  20-fold  around  the  world,  with  higher  rates  in Western countries such as Scandinavia, France, Canada and the US, and the lowest rates in Central and South America and Asia.   RCC is nearly twice as common among men than among women: for example, in the US in 2004, it is estimated that there were over 22 000 new cases in males (6% of all cancer diagnoses in males) and nearly 8000 deaths (3% of cancer deaths in males), compared to nearly 14 000 new cases and nearly 5000 deaths among females. A number of etiological associations have been  described,  including  smoking,  obesity,  long-term  hemodialysis,  hypertension,  sickle-cell  trait, and genetic factors.

Receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (RTK)  activity  appears  to  play  a  prominent  role  in  the  malignant transformation,  growth  and  metastasis  of  many  RCCs,  often  through  inactivation  of  the VHL gene. This tumour suppressor gene codes for a protein that is responsible for regulating the transcription of Vascular  Endothelial  Growth  Factor  (VEGF),  Platelet-Derived  Growth  Factor  -B  (PDGF-B)  and  a number  of  other  hypoxia-inducible  proteins.  Through  deletion,  mutation  or  methylation, VHL is believed to be inactivated in as many as 80% of sporadic clear cell RCCs, resulting in overexpression of these ligands.  Inappropriately expressed VEGF and PDGF-B promote tumour angiogenesis and, in those RCCs that also express receptors for VEGF and PDGF, further serve as signals in a stimulatory autocrine loop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At  least  25  to  30% of  patients  with  RCC  present  with  metastases.  Metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma (MRCC), based on 1992-1999 US data, has a 5-year survival rate of only 9.1%. Treatment of MRCC has been generally disappointing, and in some countries the poor results of systemic therapy in MRCC has  resulted  in  the  acceptance  of  supportive  care  as  standard  therapeutic  approach.      Many  MRCC patients undergo nephrectomy, either for palliation of local symptoms, or because this may improve outcome when performed prior to cytokine therapy.

The only systemic first-line treatments available for MRCC are cytokines, but their efficacy is limited. No satisfactory methods of treatment that have been authorised, exist in the Community for patients with MRCC who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment. Despite other agents that have shown activity in this setting, such as different regimens of cytokines and novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, there remains a large unmet medical need in the treatment of this condition.

For patients who fail to respond to cytokine-based therapy or relapse after an initial response or period of  disease  stabilization,  treatment  options  are  very  limited  and  generally  ineffective,  with  rates  of response to chemotherapy alone of less than 5%. Drug resistance may be related to the expression of the  multidrug  resistance  transporter  in  proximal-tubule  cells  -  the  cells  from  which  clear-cell  and papillary  renal-cell  carcinoma  may  originate.  Chemotherapy  may  be  more  efficacious  for  advanced non-clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, particularly the collecting-duct type.

## About the product

Sunitinib is an oral, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets and blocks the signaling pathways of multiple selected receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).  Through competitive inhibition ATP binding site, sunitinib inhibits the TK activity of a group of closely related RTKs, all of which are involved in various human malignancies: the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, -2,  -3),  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptors  (PDGFR -α, -β ),  the  stem  cell  factor  receptor (KIT), CSF-1R, FLT-3, and RET.

## Worldwide Marketing Experience

The  US  granted  approval  for  2  indications  (GIST  after  disease  progression  on  or  intolerance  to imatinib  mesylate  and  advanced  RCC)  on  26  January  2006.    Commercial  drug  was  available  for patients on 2 February 2006.  Sunitinib has been approved for both indications in Argentina, Uruguay, Indonesia, Korea, and the Philippines.  Sunitinib has been approved for GIST in Canada, Brazil, and Switzerland.  Special service product permission has been granted for both indications in Venezuela.

Two studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of sunitinib (starting dose of 50 mg, schedule 4/2) for  the  treatment  of  cytokine-refractory  MRCC: pivotal  Study  A6181006 and supportive Study RTKC-0511-014.

Study A6181034 was ongoing at the time of the submission of the original Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) and was designed to study sunitinib for treatment of cytokine-naïve patients with MRCC.  This was an open-label, multinational 1:1 randomized study comparing sunitinib to IFNα , with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint. The trial completed enrolment (N=750) in  October  2005.  The  applicant  presented  an  interim  analysis  of  Study  A6181034  during  the assessment of the original MAA and made a commitment to provide the final analysis as a specific obligation post-authorisation. This was reflected in Annex IIC of the original Conditional Marketing Authorisation as a specific obligation. The final analysis has now been provided as part of the present application.

## Study A6181034

## Patient population

Study A6181034 enrolled patients with histologically confirmed metastatic RCC with a component of clear  (conventional)  cell  histology  who  had  not  previously  been  treated  with  systemic  therapy. Eligible patients were men or women of at least 18 years of age, with adequate vital organ function, an absence of known brain or leptomeningeal metastases, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

The primary purpose of this planned analysis was to compare the primary endpoint, Progression-free survival  (PFS),  in  the  2  treatment  arms.    Comparisons  of  safety  in  the  2  treatment  arms  were performed for AEs, drug exposure, demographics, and laboratory abnormalities.

750  patients  are  included  in  the  efficacy  analyses  and  are  defined  as  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT) population.  Fifteen patients randomized to the IFNα arm withdrew consent after randomization prior to  starting  the  study  treatment;  therefore,  735  patients  are  included  in  the  safety  analyses  and  are defined as the as-treated (AT) population.  These 2 analysis populations are described in Table 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Population        |   Sunitinib |   Interferon- α |   Total |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Intent-to-Treat a |         375 |             375 |     750 |
| As-Treated b,c    |         375 |             360 |     735 |

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.  a The intent-to-treat population included all patients who were randomized, with study drug assignment designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether patients received study drug or received a different drug from that to which they were randomized. b The as-treated population included all patients who received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  with  treatment  assignments  designated  according  to  actual  study  treatment received.  c Fifteen patients randomized to IFNα withdrew consent prior to starting study treatment; these patients never received study treatment.

Baseline  patient  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  2  treatment  arms  for  the  ITT population.    The  majority  of  the  patients  were  white  (94.4%  for  sunitinib  versus  90.7%  for  IFNα , respectively) and men (71.2% versus 71.7%, respectively).  The median ages were 62 versus 59 years, respectively.    The  majority  of  the  patients  had  undergone  nephrectomy  (90.7%  versus  89.3%, respectively).  The most common site of metastases present at screening was the lung (77.9% versus 79.5%,  respectively),  followed  by  the  lymph  nodes  (58.1%  versus  52.8%,  respectively),  and  the majority of the patients had multiple (2 or more) metastatic sites at baseline (80.3% versus 76.5%, respectively).    The  patient  characteristics  for  Study  A6181034  are  representative  of  the  general population of advanced RCC patients.

## Study Design

Study A6181034 was a randomized, multicenter, international, Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of single-agent sunitinib compared with IFNα in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic RCC.  Patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment arms.

Based on a planned sample size of 690 patients, the trial was designed with 90% power to detect a 35%  improvement  in  median  PFS  from  20  weeks  to  27  weeks  (2-sided  unstratified  log-rank  test; significance level 0.05).

Patients received treatment with either sunitinib in repeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50  mg  daily  administration  followed  by  2  weeks  off  (Schedule  4/2),  or  IFNα ,  administered  as  a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the first week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter on 3 non-consecutive days each week.  IFNα is  widely recognized as the current standard of care for patients with advanced RCC.

Radiographic (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) assessments were performed 1) at screening, 2) at the end of the dosing period during the first 4 cycles, 3) at every other cycle after Cycle 4 until the end of the study, and 4) at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  Additional scans were  performed  to  confirm  response,  or  whenever  disease  progression  was  suspected.    All  images were assessed by the investigators and also by the independent core imaging laboratory, which was blinded to the treatment assignment and to the investigator's assessment.  The primary analysis was based  on  core  imaging  laboratory  assessments  according  to  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid Tumors (RECIST).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy Endpoints

## Primary endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint, Progression-free survival (PFS), was analyzed based on independent core  imaging  laboratory  assessments  for  the  ITT  population.    PFS  was  defined  as  the  time  from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression according to RECIST or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used.  PFS data were censored on the day following the date of the last on-study tumor assessment (including the 28-day follow-up period) documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who did not have objective tumor progression and who did not die due to any cause while on treatment  or  who  were  given  antitumor  treatment  other  than  the  study  treatment  prior  to  observing objective  tumor  progression.    Data  for  patients  lacking  an  evaluation  of  tumor  response  after randomization were censored on the date of randomization with a duration of 1 day.

An  improvement  in  median  PFS  from  20  weeks  to  27  weeks  in  patients  randomized  to  receive sunitinib was considered to be clinically relevant for the purposes of this study.

## Secondary endpoints

Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  time  to  progression  (TTP), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DR), and patient reported outcomes (PROs).

Statistical methodology is summarized in Table 2.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.  AT = as-treated, CI = confidence interval, CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, DR = duration  of  response,  ECOG = Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group,  ITT = intent-to-treat,  K-M = Kaplan-Meier, LDH = lactic dehydrogenase, ORR = objective response rate, OS = overall survival, PD = progressive disease, PFS = progression-free survival, TTP = time to progression.

## RESULTS

Time-to-event  endpoints  were  stratified  by  baseline  factors  and  further  analyzed.    Results  of  these additional analyses are presented in the original submission.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Progression-Free Survival

The median PFS for the sunitinib-treated group was 47.3 weeks compared with 22.0 weeks for the IFNα -treated  group;  the  hazard  ratio  was  0.415  (95% CI:    0.320-0.539,  p  &lt;0.001).    Ninety-six (25.6%) of the patients on sunitinib versus 154 (41.1%) of the patients on IFNα had progressed or died based on the core imaging laboratory assessments, indicating a significant reduction in risk of progression or death in patients receiving sunitinib compared with IFNα .  These results demonstrate a treatment advantage in favor of sunitinib.

Results available for PFS are presented in Figure 1 and Table 3.

## Time to Progression

Results for TTP are similar to PFS, indicating a treatment advantage in favor of sunitinib.  The median TTP for the sunitinib-treated  group  was  47.9  weeks  compared  to  22.3  weeks  for  the  IFNα -treated group;  the  hazard  ratio  was  0.416  (95% CI:    0.318-0.545,  p &lt;0.001).    Ninety  patients  (24.0%)  on sunitinib versus 142 patients (37.9%) on IFNα had progressed based on the core imaging laboratory assessments, indicating a reduction in risk of progression in patients receiving sunitinib compared with IFNα .

Results available for TTP are presented in Figure 2 and Table 4.

## Overall Survival

Forty-nine (13.1%) of the patients treated with sunitinib and 65 (17.3%) of the patients treated with IFNα had died up to 15 November 2005.  The median OS had not yet been reached in either treatment arm due to the relatively small number of patients who died.  Thus, meaningful comparisons between the 2 groups cannot be determined at this time.

## Objective Response Rate

ORR data are summarized in Table 5 for the core imaging laboratory and investigator assessments that were  evaluated  by  RECIST  demonstrating  a  robust  improvement  in  ORR  with  administration  of sunitinib.  The percentage of patients with measurable disease at baseline was similar between the 2 treatment groups.

The analysis for the ORR based on the core imaging laboratory assessments identified 103 patients with PRs on sunitinib (27.5%, 95% CI:  23.0-32.3) versus 20 patients with PRs on IFNα (5.3%, 95% CI:  3.3-8.1),  indicating  a  significantly  higher  response  rate  on  sunitinib  (p &lt;0.001).    Of  note,  88 patients  were  not  yet  assessed  by  the  core  imaging  laboratory  at  the  time  of  data  analysis.    The investigator-assessed ORR was 36.5% for sunitinib (95% CI:  31.7-41.7, including 1 CR and 136 PRs) compared with 8.8% for IFNα (95% CI:  6.2-12.2, including 33 PRs, p &lt;0.001).

Note:    Data  up  to  15  November  2005.    N  =  number  of  patients  in  the  population,  n  =  number  of  patients, % = n/N × 100,  CI = confidence  interval,  CR = complete  response,  PR = partial  response.    a  In  order  to  be considered as stable disease, follow-up measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. b Patients with less than 6 weeks on-study observation time were considered  'Not  Evaluable'  for  the  core  imaging  and  investigator  assessments,  unless  they  had  disease progression.  Patients were also considered 'Not Evaluable' if any of their disease sites were not assessed. c Missing  for  the  core  laboratory  assessment  includes  scans  that  were  not  sent  by  the  investigator  to  the  core imaging laboratory for evaluation, or scans that were sent to the core imaging laboratory but not evaluated in time  for  this  analysis.    d  Missing  for  the  investigator  assessment  includes  patients  lacking  post-baseline assessments or incomplete data collection at the time of this analysis.

Response rates from Study A6181034 are consistent with efficacy results obtained in the pivotal Study A6181006 that evaluated sunitinib in patients with cytokine-refractory metastatic RCC.  Using data from the pivotal Study A6181006 through 28 January 2005 (from the original marketing applications), the core-imaging laboratory reported an ORR  of 25.5% (95% CI:  17.5-34.9), whereas the investigators reported an ORR of 35.8% (95% CI:  26.8-45.7, including 1 CR and 37 PRs).  In Study A6181006,  the  response  rates  have  increased  with  continued  treatment  and  monitoring  of  patients. Based on updated efficacy assessments through December 2005, the core-imaging laboratory reported 38  PRs,  yielding  an  ORR  of  35.8%  (95% CI:  26.8-45.7).    Similarly,  based  on  updated  efficacy assessments  through  1  August  2005,  investigators  reported  1  CR  and  45  PRs,  yielding  an  ORR  of 43.4% (95% CI:  33.8-53.4).

## Duration of Response

DR data were calculated for patients who had a response in either treatment arm.  Median DR was 40.9 weeks (95% CI:  30.1-54.1) for the 16 responding patients in the sunitinib treatment arm who had subsequently progressed or died based on core imaging laboratory assessments.  Median DR for patients  receiving  IFNα could  not  be  calculated  because  none  of  the  20  responding  patients  had subsequently progressed or died.

## Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)

PROs were measured using 3 validated instruments: 1) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G) Questionnaire, 2) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI), and 3) EQ-5D Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D).

The  FACT-G evaluates  cancer  patients'  general  health-related  quality  of  life;  its  endpoints  include FACT-G Total score and 4 subscales (Physical Well-Being (PWB), Social/family Well-Being (SWB), Emotional  Well-Being  (EWB),  and  Functional  Well-Being  (FWB).    The  FKSI  measures  common symptoms related to kidney cancer and its treatment; it  also  contains  a  Disease  Related  Symptoms subscale  (FKSI-DRS),  which  measures  the  symptoms  related  to  the  disease  only.    The  EQ-5D measures a patient's general health status; it includes 5 descriptors of current health state (mobility, self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort,  and  anxiety/depression),  from  which  the  EQ-5D  health state index (EQ-5D Index) is derived, and a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) for current health status. The FKSI-DRS was pre-specified as the primary PRO endpoint.  Between-treatment differences of the post-baseline  measurements  of  all  PRO  endpoints  were  tested  using  the  repeated  measures  mixedeffects  model  adjusting  for  the  time,  treatment-by-time  interaction,  and  the  baseline  scores  for  the same PRO endpoints.

The between-treatment differences in the PRO endpoints over time from Cycle 1 Day 28 to Cycle 10 Day 1 and the p-value differences are summarized in Table 6; a score greater than zero indicates a difference favoring sunitinib.

Results demonstrate that patients in the sunitinib arm reported statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) better outcomes in their  kidney disease-related  symptoms,  physical  well-being,  functional  well-being,  and overall quality of life than patients in the IFNα arm at all assessment time points.  For social/family well being and emotional well-being, the statistical significance dropped to below the 0.05 level after Cycle 8 and Cycle 5, respectively).  Results consistently demonstrated that patients in the sunitinib arm generally reported better PROs over time.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.

FKSI-DRS = Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  -  Kidney  Symptom  Index  Disease  Related  Symptoms  subscale, FACT-G = Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General, PWB = Physical Well-Being, SWB = Social/family WellBeing, EWB = Emotional Well-Being, FWB = Functional Well-Being, FKSI = Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index, EQ-5D Index = EQ-5D Self-Report Questionnaire Health State Index, VAS = visual analog scale.

Compared to the pre-established minimum clinically important differences for these endpoints (2-3 points for FKSI-DRS, 5 points for FACT-G Total, 2 points for PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB, and 3-5 points for FKSI), the between-treatment differences for kidney cancer-related symptoms (FKSI-DRS and FKSI), overall quality  of  life  (FACT-G)  and  FWB  were  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The EQ-VAS results indicated that patients receiving sunitinib also had better overall health status.

## Discussion on Clinical Efficacy

Results from Study A6181034 demonstrate that sunitinib significantly prolongs PFS compared with IFNα for patients with treatment-naïve metastatic RCC.  The superior efficacy, also demonstrated by a robust improvement in ORR of sunitinib over IFNα , was evident at the time of this analysis.  These positive  ORR  results  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  Study  A6181006  in  patients  with cytokine-refractory metastatic RCC.  Additionally, patient reported outcomes were better for patients receiving  sunitinib.    Taken  together,  these  results  demonstrate  a  treatment  advantage  for  sunitinib compared with IFNα .

Further to the assessment of Study A6181034, two additional complementary analyses are requested as follow-up measures:

- -Considering the relatively high rate of dose reductions in the Sunitinib arm of Study A6181034, the  MAH  should  provide  a  complementary  analysis  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  the subgroup of patients for whom the dose was reduced.
- -The MAH will provide further information regarding possible pharmacodynamic markers, such as the target RTKs or the VHL mutation, as well as a justification for why such studies were not considered necessary to perform as part of study A6181034.

## Clinical Safety

Data  presented  in  this  section  are  based  primarily  on  safety  analyses  presented  in  the  A6181034 Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR),  with  data  available  through  15  November  2005.    Additionally, comparisons  are  made  to  an  additional  overall  Safety  Update  (SU)  with  data  available  from  2451 subjects  through  15  November  2005,  which  presents  patient  demographic  and  other  characteristics, treatment-emergent  serious  adverse events (SAEs)  (including  deaths), discontinuations due  to treatment-related  AEs,  laboratory  abnormalities,  and  disposition  for  all  ongoing  sunitinib  studies. Cross  references  are  also  made  to  the  general  safety  profile  of  sunitinib  and  specifically  to  the metastatic RCC safety profile.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.

N = number of patients in the population, n = number of patients, % = n/N × 100, SD = standard deviation. a  A patient was considered to have started a cycle if the patient took at least one dose of drug (sunitinib or IFNα ). b  Days on treatment is defined as the time period starting from the date of first dose and ending at the earlier of the termination date, the data cutoff date, or 2 weeks after the last dose.  c  Number of days on drug is calculated for sunitinib and is defined as the total number of days on which drug was actually administered, excluding the 2-week off period and temporary dosing delays. d    Number  of  doses  is  calculated  for  IFNα .    e    Dose  reduction  is  defined  as  a  daily  dose  prescribed  below  50  mg  for sunitinib and as a dose less than the protocol-defined dose for IFNα due to any reason at any time during the study.  f Relative dose intensity = [(total dose administered)/(total dose assigned)]*100.  The total dose assigned is calculated based on the dose at the beginning of each cycle and does not include dose reductions occurring within a cycle.

The  median  number  of  days  on  study  was  approximately  37%  longer  for patients  receiving sunitinib than for patients receiving IFNα through 15 November 2005.  The difference in the median number of days on study (169.0 days for sunitinib versus 123.5 days for IFNα ) is expected due to the higher rate of disease progression for patients in the IFNα treatment arm.  Dose interruptions were similar  in  both  arms  (37.9%  versus  31.9%,  respectively);  however,  dose  reductions  were  more frequent with sunitinib than with IFNα (32.3% versus 21.4%, respectively).

## Demographic and Other Characteristics of the Study Population

The demographic characteristics of the safety population appear similar to the population described in published epidemiologic data.

## Common Adverse Events

The majority of patients in both treatment arms experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (98.7% on sunitinib and 98.3% on IFNα ).    The most commonly occurring AEs (those occurring in 10% or more of patients in either treatment arm) are summarized in Table 8.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.

N = number of patients in the population who received at least 1 dose of study drug, n = number of patients,

% = n/N × 100, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, AE = adverse event.

a Data are reported for AEs that occurred in more than 10% of patients in either treatment arm.

For patients receiving sunitinib, gastrointestinal events such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were commonly reported, as well as fatigue, dysgeusia, anorexia, dyspepsia, hypertension, and stomatitis. Hematologic events (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia) were somewhat less common but nonetheless occurred in more than 10% of patients receiving sunitinib.  The most common AEs in the IFNα group were fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, chills, and anorexia.  One hematologic event that occurred in more than 10% of patients receiving IFNα was anemia.

In general, the safety profile of sunitinib was consistent with that reported in the SU and in particular, was consistent with data presented in the metastatic RCC portion of the initial MAA.

Table 9  summarizes  those  treatment-emergent  AEs  that  the  investigator  judged  to  be  related  to  the study drug.  This safety profile is similar to that of the all-causality AEs.

Common  sunitinib-related  events  (reported  for  at  least  20%  of  patients)  included  constitutional (fatigue, dysgeusia, anorexia, mucosal inflammation, and asthenia), GI (diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, stomatitis,  and  vomiting),  cutaneous  (palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  syndrome  and  rash)  events, and hypertension.  These events have previously been reported (as part of the initial MAA) and are also  currently  reported  in  the  SU.    The  most  common  IFNα -related  events  were  fatigue,  pyrexia, nausea, chills, anorexia, and asthenia.

## Serious Adverse Events:  Deaths

As  summarized  in  Table 10,  13.1%  of  the  patients  receiving  sunitinib  and  17.5%  of  the  patients receiving  IFNα died.    Study  disease  was  the  most  common  cause  of  death  for  patients  on  either treatment, consistent with the most common cause of death for all studies reported in the SU.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005. N = number of patients in the population who received at least 1 dose of study drug, n =  number of patients  % = n/N × 100,  MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. a Includes  deaths  reported during treatment and within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. b Follow-up period is more than 28 days after the last dose of study drug.

One  death  was  associated  with  a  treatment-related  SAE  in  sunitinib-treated patients (Patient 110114-00436 experienced an SAE of sudden death).  Two deaths in patients receiving IFNα were associated  with  a  treatment-related  SAE  (Patient  056590-00146  experienced  an  SAE  of  cardiac disorder  and  Patient  068012-00681  experienced  an  SAE  of  myocardial  infarction).    Narratives  for these patients are located in the A6181034 CSR.  The remaining deaths during treatment or within 28 days  after  last  dose  of  study  drug  for  patients  receiving  sunitinib  or  IFNα were  due  to  disease progression  or  to  adverse  events  considered  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  disease  as  described  in Table 11.

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.  N = number of patients in the population who received at least 1 dose of study drug, n = number of patients, % = n/N × 100, No. = number, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, F = female, M = male,  W = white,  A = Asian,  NA  =  not  available. a If  the  relationship  to  study  drug  was  unknown,  the  event  was considered to be related to treatment. b Days since first dose = (death date - first dose date). c Detailed information for Patient 043999-00635 was not available at the time of this analysis due to incomplete data reconciliation. d One patient (168839-00451) receiving interferonα who died due to disease progression also had an adverse event of dyspnea at  the  time  of  death.    Dyspnea  was  incorrectly  classified  as  a  contributing  cause  of  death  at  the  time  of  this analysis, but has since been corrected to reflect that the cause of death was solely disease progression (and not dyspnea).  Therefore, dyspnea is not listed as a cause of death in this table.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

In  Study  A6181034,  116  (30.9%)  of  the  patients  treated  with  sunitinib  versus  79  (21.9%)  of  the patients treated with IFNα experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE.

Those SAEs that occurred in more than 1 patient in either treatment arm are summarized in Table 12. The overall incidence of SAEs was comparable between Study A6181034 and the general population of patients receiving sunitinib, although there was some variation in the rates of individual SAEs.

In Study A6181034, 66 (17.6%) of the patients treated with sunitinib versus 18 (5.0%) of the patients treated with IFNα experienced at least 1 treatment-related SAE.

Table 13  summarizes  those  SAEs  that  were  judged  by  the  investigator  to  be  treatment-related  and which occurred in more than 1 patient in either treatment arm.  The overall incidence of treatmentrelated  SAEs  was  comparable  between  Study  A6181034  and  the  general  population  of  patients receiving  sunitinib,  although  there  was  some  variation  in  the  rates  of  individual  treatment-related SAEs.

## Treatment Discontinuations

Table 14 summarizes patient disposition for Study A6181034.  As of 15 November 2005, 374 patients were continuing treatment on study (248 patients [66.1%] on sunitinib and 126 patients [33.6%] on IFNα ).

Lack of efficacy (disease progression) was the most common reason for discontinuation in both the sunitinib and IFNα groups.  A substantially greater number of patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy  on  IFNα (45.3%)  compared  with  sunitinib  (24.5%).    Thirty  (8.0%)  of  the  patients  on sunitinib  discontinued  because  of  an  adverse  event  compared  with  47  (12.5%)  of  the  patients  on IFNα .

Note:  Data up to 15 November 2005.

N = number of patients in the population who received at least 1 dose of study drug, n = number of patients, % = n/N × 100,  MedDRA = Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities. a 'Consent  withdrawn'  does  not include the 15 patients randomized to the IFNα arm who withdrew consent after randomization prior to starting the  study  treatment.    These  15  patients  are  listed  separately  with  the  primary  reason  for  discontinuation  as 'randomized but did not receive any study drug'.

Table 15 summarizes the treatment-related AEs that were reported as ongoing in more than 1 patient in either treatment arm at the time of treatment discontinuations.  Fewer events (fatigue, nausea, and vomiting)  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  patients  on  sunitinib  as  compared  with  events (fatigue,  depression,  dyspnea,  nausea,  asthenia,  and  weight  decreased)  leading  to  discontinuation while on IFNα .

## Overall Safety Profile - Other Safety Assessments

## Laboratory Tests

Sixty-two (16.5%) of the patients on sunitinib versus 37 (10.3%) of the patients on IFNα experienced Grade 4 serum chemistry abnormalities in Study A6181034.  The most common Grade 4 chemistry abnormalities for patients receiving sunitinib were hyperuricemia (43 patients, 11.5%) and increased lipase (11 patients, 2.9%).  These 2 abnormal findings were also the most common for the IFNα arm, with hyperuricemia in 29 patients (8.1%) and increased lipase in 4 patients (1.1%).

One hundred fifty-one (40.3%) of the patients on sunitinib versus 115 (31.9%) of the patients on IFNα experienced Grade 3 serum chemistry abnormalities.  The most common Grade 3 serum chemistry abnormalities in the sunitinib-treated group were hyperlipasemia (49 patients, 13.1%), hyponatremia (17 patients, 4.5%), hyperamylasemia (16 patients, 4.3%), hypophosphatemia (16 patients, 4.3%), and hyperglycemia  (10  patients,  2.7%);  whereas  the  most  common  abnormalities  in  the  IFNα -treated group were hypophosphatemia (22 patients, 6.1%), hyperglycemia (20 patients, 5.6%), hyperlipasemia (19 patients, 5.3%), and hyperkalemia (12 patients, 3.3%).  For patients treated with IFNα , Grade 3 hyponatremia was reported for 9 patients (2.5%) while Grade 3 hyperamylasemia was reported for 7 patients (1.9%).

These laboratory changes were generally not associated with clinical signs and symptoms.  One SAE of hyperuricemia (for 1 patient on IFNα ) was reported; no SAEs of gout were reported.  There were 2 SAEs of pancreatitis (for 2 patients on sunitinib).

Results  for  sunitinib-treated  patients  from  Study  A6181034  are  consistent  with  the  most  common Grade 3 and 4 chemistry abnormalities reported previously in the SU for other ongoing studies.

There  were  few  Grade  4  hematologic  abnormalities  (3  patients  [0.8%]  had  decreases  in  absolute neutrophil count and 1 patient [0.3%] had a decrease in hemoglobin count on sunitinib while 1 patient [0.3%] had a decrease in hemoglobin count on IFNα ).

Grade 3 hematologic abnormalities for patients receiving sunitinib in Study A6181034 were decreases in  lymphocyte  count  (44  patients,  11.7%),  absolute  neutrophil  count  (41  patients,  10.9%),  platelet count  (30  patients,  8.0%),  total  white  blood  cell  count  (19  patients,  5.1%),  and  hemoglobin  (10 patients, 2.7%).  The most common Grade 3 hematologic abnormalities for patients receiving IFNα in Study A6181034 were decreases in lymphocyte count (79 patients, 21.9%), absolute neutrophil count (24  patients,  6.7%),  hemoglobin  (15  patients,  4.2%),  and  total  white  blood  cell  count  (8  patients, 2.2%).    Clinical  manifestations  of  these  hematologic  abnormalities  were  rare:  for  instance,  febrile neutropenia was reported as an SAE in only 1 patient (in the sunitinib group).

These  laboratory  abnormalities  for  sunitinib-treated  patients  from  Study  A6181034  were  consistent with those reported in the SU.

## QT Analysis

A dedicated  QT  Study  A6181005  ('A  Phase  l  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Effect  of  SU011248  on  QTc Interval in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors') was completed as of 15 November 2005.  Study A6181005  was  conducted  in  subjects  with  various  solid  malignant  tumors  to  assess  the  potential effects of sunitinib treatment on the QT/QTc interval at exposures approximately 2-fold higher than the  mean  exposures  observed  at  the  recommended  50-mg  QD  dose  of  sunitinib.    This  study  was  a single-blind,  nonrandomized,  3-treatment,  single-center  trial,  which  included  both  the  placebo  and positive (moxifloxacin) controls.  Time-matched serial triplicate ECGs were recorded at baseline and after  administration  of  sunitinib,  moxifloxacin,  and  placebo.    The  QT  intervals  were  corrected  for heart rate using Fridericia's correction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As described in the Study A6181005 CSR, QTcF prolongation was determined 24 hours after sunitinib administration on Day 3 (at therapeutic plasma concentrations of sunitinib and its active metabolite, SU012662)  and  at  multiple  time-points  on  Day  9  (at  2-times  therapeutic  plasma  concentrations  of sunitinib and SU012662).  On Day 3, the maximum mean prolongation of QTcF was 14.5 msec with a 90% CI upper limit of 19.5 msec after the placebo-adjusted within-day correction was used and 9.6 msec with a 90% CI upper limit of 15.1 msec after the placebo-adjusted time-matched correction was used.  On Day 9, the maximum mean prolongation of QTcF was 20.3 msec with a 90% CI upper limit of 27.1 msec after the placebo-adjusted within-day correction was used and 15.4 msec with a 90% CI upper limit of 22.4 msec after the placebo-adjusted time-matched correction was used.  The observed changes in QTcF correlated with the sunitinib, SU012662, and total (sunitinib+SU012662) exposures; however, maximum QTcF prolongation was observed later than the times at which maximum plasma concentrations of these analytes were observed, suggesting a delay in QTcF effect.

The  outlier  QTcF  values  greater  than  450  msec  were  generally  higher  among  women  than  men; however, no subject had a QTcF value greater than 500 msec.

The incidence of cardiac-related abnormalities was low as no subject's ECG was assessed as abnormal and no case of torsade de pointes was reported.  One subject each experienced nontreatment-related tachycardia, treatment-related bradycardia, and treatment-related syncope (the event of syncope was not related to cardiac causes in the investigator's opinion).

In conclusion, although an effect on QTcF was observed at the therapeutic plasma concentrations of sunitinib  and  SU012662  expected  after  the  recommended  starting  sunitinib  QD  dose  of  50  mg  (24 hours after sunitinib administration on Day 3), the clinical significance of this finding is unclear, since none of the subjects developed QTcF prolongation of at least Grade 3 severity at the therapeutic or 2times therapeutic exposures.

## Special Safety Topics

There have been no additional special safety concerns from those AEs of special interest reported in the initial marketing applications.

## Safety in Special Groups and Situations

## Use in Adolescents and Children

## Sunitinib is currently indicated in adults only.

Limited use in pediatric patients is permitted on a case-by-case basis for patients with GIST in the expanded-access Study A6181036.  Preliminary data for 7 pediatric patients up to 15 November 2005 reports  3 patients  (42.9%)  experienced  SAEs  of  acute  renal  failure,  abdominal  pain,  and  GI  tube removal.  None of these SAEs was considered related to sunitinib treatment by the investigator.  No robust conclusions specific to pediatric patients can be determined from this limited set of data up to 15 November 2005.

## Use in Elderly

Analysis of AE data shows that the safety profile of sunitinib was similar between the 2 age groups (ages 18 to 65 and ages 65 or older), with no particular safety concerns particular to either group.

## Use in Renal or Hepatic Impairment

Results from Study A6181079 determined that dose adjustments were not necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  A clinical study is ongoing to evaluate the PK of sunitinib in subjects  with  renal  impairment.    The  study  results  for  patients  with  renal  impairment  are  not  yet available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and Lactation

No  clinical  studies  with  sunitinib  have  been  conducted  in  pregnant  women,  and  no  pregnancies occurred during clinical studies of sunitinib.  Sunitinib and its metabolite, SU012662, are excreted in rat  milk,  but  it  is  not  known  whether  they  are  excreted  in  human  milk.  Women should be advised against breastfeeding while taking sunitinib.

## Overdose

No  overdose  of  sunitinib  was  reported  in  completed  clinical  studies.    In  Phase  1  dose-escalation studies with multiple doses of sunitinib, fatigue was the most commonly reported AE (experienced by approximately  70%  of  the  patients  overall);  other  AEs  included  GI  events  such  as  nausea  and vomiting.  Similar occurrences might be expected with sunitinib overdosage.

No specific antidote is known for treating the effects of sunitinib overdose.  Treatment should consist of  general  supportive  measures.    If  indicated,  elimination  of  unabsorbed  drug  can  be  achieved  by inducing emesis or by gastric lavage.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

Among all ongoing studies reported in the Safety Update, the majority of the on-study deaths were causally  attributed  to  study  disease  (disease  progression).    The  frequencies  of  treatment-emergent, SAEs reported in the SU were comparable with the respective SAE data reported previously.  Lack of efficacy (disease progression) was the most common reason for treatment discontinuations among the majority  of  patients,  consistent  with  the  respective  data  for  treatment  discontinuations  reported previously.

Safety information presented for the first time in the SU include safety data collected from patients receiving  continuous  doses  of  sunitinib  in  the  morning  or  in  the  evening  and  safety  assessments performed in a small number of the Japanese and paediatric (&lt;18 years of age) patients with GIST.  At this  time,  no  definitive  conclusions  with  regard  to  sunitinib  safety  for  patients  receiving  continuous sunitinib dosing (n=44) or the Japanese (n=11) and pediatric (n=7) patients can be made because of the  small  number  of  patients  and  the  relatively  short  period  of  exposure  to  sunitinib  up  to  15 November 2005.

With reference to Study A6181034, safety data (with the exception of drug exposure, demographics, and disposition data) are presented for the AT population of 735 patients who received at least 1 dose of  study  medication  with  treatment  assignments  designated  according  to  actual  study  treatment received (15 patients in the IFNα arm withdrew consent after randomization prior to starting the study treatment).

Data presented for Study A6181034 through 15 November 2005 are consistent with the general safety profile from previous studies; there have been no new safety trends or concerns identified since the initial marketing applications.

In  Study  A6181034,  the  majority  of  the  on-study  deaths  were  causally  attributed  to  study  disease (disease progression). The frequencies of SAEs for patients receiving sunitinib were comparable with the respective SAE data reported previously.  The higher overall frequency of SAEs in the sunitinib treatment group, as compared with that in the IFNα treatment group, may be attributed to the fact that patients in the sunitinib treatment group were exposed to drug for a longer period of time on average than  those  in  the  IFNα treatment  group  in  Study  A6181034.    As  a  result,  the  maximum  possible follow-up period for patients on sunitinib treatment was longer than for patients on IFNα treatment.

Lack of efficacy (disease  progression) was the  most common reason for treatment discontinuations among the majority of patients in Study A6181034, consistent with the respective data on treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuations reported in the original MAA.  The rate of treatment discontinuations resulting from disease  progression  in  the  IFNα treatment  group  was  approximately  double  that  in  the  sunitinib treatment group, accounting for the approximately 2-fold higher overall rate of treatment discontinuations  among  patients  on  IFNα treatment  versus  patients  on  sunitinib  treatment.    In addition,  the  rate  of  treatment  discontinuations  resulting  from  AEs  was  also  higher  in  the  IFNα treatment group than the rate in the sunitinib treatment group.

Fatigue, GI disorders (such as nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, dyspepsia, constipation, and vomiting), and anorexia were the most commonly reported all-causality AEs in patients receiving sunitinib.  Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were also noted, as was hypertension, the latter supported by vital sign  data.    Although  elevations  in  amylase  and  lipase  were  among  the  more  common  laboratory abnormalities, clinical manifestations of pancreatitis were rare.  Most AEs were manageable by dose interruptions or modifications and through specific therapies.

There was 1 death (1/375, 0.27%) considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug in sunitinib-treated patients in Study A6181034.  Two deaths in the IFNα group were considered by  the  investigator  to  be  at  least  possibly  related  to  IFNα (2/360,  0.56%).    One  hundred  sixteen (30.9%) of the patients versus 79 (21.9%) of the patients experienced SAEs on sunitinib versus IFNα treatment, respectively.  Sixty-six (17.6%) of the patients on sunitinib treatment and 18 (5.0%) of the patients on IFNα treatment experienced a treatment-related SAE.  However, only 23 (6.1%) of the patients on sunitinib and 34 (9.4%) of the patients on IFNα experienced a treatment-related AE that was  temporally  associated  with  discontinuation.    Of  these  57  patients  with  treatment-related  AEs temporally associated with discontinuation, 14 patients (3.7%) on sunitinib and 6 patients (1.7%) on IFNα had AEs that were serious.

In  summary,  prescribing  physicians  should  be  aware  of  sunitinib's  safety  profile,  including  the potential for GI, hematologic, and blood pressure effects.  However, SAEs with sunitinib treatment were manageable and generally did not lead to treatment discontinuation.

## Benefit/ Risk assessment

Patients with MRCC face a short expected survival with significant morbidity.

The only systemic first-line treatments available for MRCC are cytokines, but their efficacy is limited and they are often poorly tolerated. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for further treatment options and new therapies need to be assessed in the context of the affected target population.

At the time of the initial MAA, no satisfactory methods of treatment that had been authorised, existed in the Community for patients with MRCC who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment. Despite other agents that have shown activity in this setting, such as different regimens of cytokines and novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, there remained a large unmet medical need in the treatment of this patient population.

In the initial MAA, the demonstration of efficacy in patients with MRCC who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferonα was based on the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (i.e. a major shrinkage of the overall tumor burden) observed in two single-arm, open-label phase II studies. In one study the objective response rate (ORR) was 36.5% (95% C.I. 24.7% -49.6%).  In the second study, ORR was 35.8% (95% C.I. 26.8% - 45.7%). These results were observed in a homogenous group of progressive patients with a predictable outcome of the disease. The effect in terms of ORR was unprecedented, even with the most active available agents in a nonrefractory population for which response rates in the order of 5 to 15% have been reported. Also, the response rate observed for sunitinib was much higher than the reported proportion of patients with an objective response for the novel targeted kinase agent sorafenib (2.1%).

Overall, compared to other agents that have shown activity in MRCC, sunitinib had demonstrated a distinct  pharmacodynamic  profile,  and  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  an  objective  response observed for sunitinib in this  MRCC patient population was very high compared to what had been reported for other agents including sorafenib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the time of the initial CHMP opinion, the Committee considered that the data presented supported a clinical benefit for Sutent (sunitinib) in the treatment of patients with MRCC who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment. Taking into account the favourable safety profile observed, the benefit/risk of sunitinib in the MRCC indication was considered positive. However, comprehensive clinical data in the MRCC indication were not yet available, and the CHMP therefore recommended the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  efficacy  results  from  a  trial  in  a  first  line  setting  would  provide additional  comprehensive  clinical  data  to  confirm  that  treatment  with  Sutent  is  associated  with  an effect  on  important  time-related  clinical  endpoints,  such  as  progression-free  survival  and  overall survival. The demonstration of a favourable effect in first-line would be considered relevant also for patients with MRCC who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment confirming the existence of an effect in terms of relevant clinical endpoints even if the precise magnitude of this effect would not be known in this indication. The requested trial, Study A6181034, was ongoing at the time of the granting of the original MA, although recruitment had been completed.

Consequently  the  Marketing  Authorisation  was  granted  as  a  Conditional  Marketing  Authorisation pursuant  to  Article  14(7)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  applicant  agreed  to  provide,  as requested  by  the  CHMP,  the  results  of  Study  A6181034  in  cytokine-naive  patients  with  metastatic renal cell carcinoma as a Specific Obligation post-marketing.

The MAH has now submitted a Type II variation, which included the requested efficacy and safety data  from  an  analysis  of  Study  A6181034  (A  phase  III  randomised  study  of  sunitinib  versus interferon-alfa as first line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma) in order to fulfill the Specific Obligation.

The MAH, on the basis of the results of Study A6181034, requested to extend the indication to include first-line treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).

As  part  of  this  application,  the  MAH  also  requested  a  switch  from  a  conditional  to  a  'normal' marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006.

Following  the  assessment  of  the  data  provided,  the  CHMP  considers  that  a  positive  benefit-risk balance has been established for the proposed extended indication. Sunitinib has shown significantly superior  efficacy  as  demonstrated  by  a  prolonged  PFS  and  an  improved  ORR  compared  to  IFNα . Further, sunitinib was found to have a tolerable safety profile in patients with MRCC.  The low rates of  discontinuation  for  the  sunitinib-treated  patients  indicate  that  the  AEs  associated  with  sunitinib (fatigue,  GI  disorders,  and  myelosuppression)  were  generally  not  severe  enough  to  result  in discontinuation  of  therapy.  Most  AEs  can  be  managed  effectively  through  recourse  to  specific therapies,  supportive  care,  or,  when  required,  a  reduction  or  temporary  delay  in  dosing.  The  AEs reported with sunitinib are not considered unusual or unfamiliar, and physicians should therefore be able to recognize and manage them.

The proposed starting dose of sunitinib is 50 mg once daily, with 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/2).  The dosage may be decreased, in increments of 12.5 mg, if required for tolerability. The oral, once-daily administration of sunitinib lends itself to outpatient treatment, with attendant quality-of-life benefits and a tolerable safety profile that is comparable to or better than most other cancer treatments.

With reference  to  the  wording  of  the  new  indication,  the  Committee  considered  it  inappropriate  to include  outcome  variables  in  section  4.1  of  the  SPC  since  according  to  the  SPC  Guideline  such information  should  be  presented  in  section  5.1.  The  Committee  therefore  recommended  that  the indication be revised as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST)

Sutent  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  and/or  metastatic  malignant  gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib mesylate treatment due to resistance or intolerance.

## Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (MRCC)

Sutent is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC)'.

Further,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  new  efficacy  and  safety  data  available  for  patients  with treatment-naïve  RCC  are  consistent  with  the  data  presented  in  the  initial  MAA  for  patients  with cytokine-refractory MRCC. The data confirm the positive results presented in the initial MAA with a significant  improvement  in  PFS  and  a  robust  improvement  in  ORR  compared  with  IFNα in  the treatment-naïve MRCC patient population.  Patients in the sunitinib arm also reported better patient reported outcomes compared with patients in the IFNα arm.

Therefore, the Committee considered that the submitted data from Study A6181034 are sufficient to conclude that comprehensive clinical data on sunitinib have been provided.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  specific  obligation  for  Sutent  is  resolved  and  since  there  is  no remaining specific obligation, the Committee recommended a switch from a conditional to a 'normal' Marketing Authorisation under Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

## IV. CONCLUSION

On  19  October  2006  the  CHMP  agreed  to  extend  the  indication  and  on  the  amendments  to  be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the evidence of compliance with the Specific Obligation submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder.

Since all Specific Obligations stated in Annex II.C of the CHMP Opinion for the original MAA have been  fulfilled,  the  Committee  considers  that  there  are  no  remaining  grounds  for  a  Conditional Marketing  Authorisation  and  recommends  a  switch  to  a  'normal'  Marketing  Authorisation  in accordance with Article 7 of regulation (EC) No 507/2006. Annex II has been revised accordingly.
