## Annex IV

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  semaglutide,  the  scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In  view  of  the  available  data  on  dysgeusia  from  clinical  trials  and  spontaneous  reports,  the  PRAC considers  a  causal  relationship  between  semaglutide  p.o.  (Rybelsus)  and  dysgeusia  is  at  least  a reasonable possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of products  containing  oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) should be amended accordingly.

In view of the available data on delayed gastric emptying from clinical trials, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy) and delayed gastric emptying is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing semaglutide should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for semaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  semaglutide  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
