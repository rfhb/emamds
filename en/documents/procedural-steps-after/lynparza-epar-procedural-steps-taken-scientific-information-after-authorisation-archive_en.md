| II/0064   | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to update safety and efficacy results including a descriptive analysis of overall survival (OS) at seven years after the last patient was randomised in study D0818C0001 (SOLO1). This is a Phase III randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study in which advanced ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations who had responded following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised 2:1 to receive either Olaparib (300 mg bd, tablet formulation) or placebo. The RMP version 28.1 is approved. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update section D of Annex II. | 31/08/2023 | 25/01/2024 | SmPC and Annex II | In study SOLO1, a descriptive analysis performed at seven years after the last patient was randomized demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit in OS that numerically favoured the olaparib arm. The OS data were 38.1% mature (149 events/391 patients). Median OS was not reached in the olaparib arm and was 75.2 months in the placebo arm. The Hazard Ration (HR) (95% CI) was 0.55 (0.40-0.76). The risk of MDS/AML remains low in the first-line setting when olaparib maintenance treatment is given after one line of platinum chemotherapy for a duration of 2 years (1.5%) in SOLO1 study at 7 year follow up and 1.1% in PAOLA-1 study at 5 year follow up. |

| II/0057   | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the long-term safety data and the final OS analysis from PAOLA-1 study (D0817C00003). This is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial of Olaparib vs. Placebo in Patients with Advanced FIGO Stage IIIB - IV High Grade Serous or Endometrioid Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer Treated with Standard First Line Treatment, Combining Platinum-Taxane Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab Concurrent with Chemotherapy and in Maintenance. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor changes to the SmPC for clarity.

Although OS did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between treatment arms, the OS HR numerically favoured olaparib (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.22; p=0.3487). The median OS was 19.0 months in the olaparib arm and 19.2 months in the placebo arm. |

The overall incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) in patients treated in clinical trials with Lynparza monotherapy, including long term survival follow up, was <1.5%, with higher incidence in patients with BRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer who had received at least two prior lines of platinum chemotherapy and were followed up for 5 years (see SmPC section 4.8). The majority of events had a fatal outcome. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from < 6 months to > 4 years. |

| II/0020   | Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; patients should have previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. Patient with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy. As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of Lynparza tablets have been updated. The SmPC of Lynparza capsule has been revised to reflect updated safety information and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, RMP version 16.3 has also been accepted. Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the SmPC guideline and excipients guideline which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP.

| II/0008/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC with recommendations for patients with renal impairment based on the results of study D0816C00006 (MEA 006), that evaluated the influence of mild and moderate renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Olaparib. The Package Leaflet and RMP were updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update local representatives in the PL, to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version and introduce minor corrections in the PI. Furthermore, a grouping of two type IB variation is submitted to revise the study milestones dates for the category 3 study D0816C00005 and category 1 study D0816C00002 in the RMP. Annex II has been amended accordingly. The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling, Package Leaflet and Annex A and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 15/09/2016 | 21/10/2016 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The MAH provided a PK study conducted in patients with renal insufficiency (study D0816C00006). In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min), AUC increased by 24% and Cmax by 15% compared with patients with normal renal function. No Lynparza dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min), AUC increased by 44% and Cmax by 26% compared with patients with normal renal function. Lynparza dose adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment. These findings have been reflected in section 4.2 as follows: For patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) the recommended dose of Lynparza is 300 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg). Lynparza can be administered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) with no dose adjustment. Lynparza is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min) since there are no data in such patients. |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include further information related to pharmacokinetic interactions based on the in vivo interaction study D0816C00008, 3 in vitro interaction studies (ADME-AZS-Wave3-140714, ADME-AZS- Wave3-140725 and 140483) and data from previously submitted interaction studies. The provision of the final CSR for study D0816C00008 addresses the post-authorisation measure MEA 004. Further, the MAH provided the study report for in vitro study 8305083 as part of the application. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to add the published ATC code in section 5.1 of the SmPC, and to implement minor editorial changes in the SmPC, labelling and Package Leaflet. A revised RMP version 9 was agreed during the procedure, which includes consequential changes related to data on interactions. Further, the MAH took the opportunity to update the due dates for the provision of the final study reports of the category 3 | 25/02/2016 | 31/03/2016 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended and alternative agents should be considered. If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the recommended olaparib dose reduction is to 150 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg) with a strong CYP3A inhibitor or 200 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor. Olaparib co administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended. In the event that a patient already receiving olaparib requires treatment with a strong CYP3A inducer, the prescriber should be aware that the efficacy of olaparib may be substantially reduced. For further more detailed information, please consult section 4.5 of the SmPC. |
