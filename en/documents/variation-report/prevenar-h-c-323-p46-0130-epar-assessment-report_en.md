## I. Executive Summary

No SmPC and PL changes are proposed.

## II. Recommendation 1

The data from this study do not warrant any changes to the SmPC or PIL.

III. Introduction On 6 February 2012, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar and that there is no consequential regulatory action. IV. Scientific Discussion Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study In Europe, Prevenar (PCV7) is indicated for children aged 2 months to 5 year. Available commercial supply of PCV7 (routine use) was used in this study. Clinical aspects 1. Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for: -B1841001 (0887X1-4596-RU) Prevenar POST-licensure Safety Study in Russia: Frequency of Fever Post Vaccination 2. Clinical study  Description Pfizer's 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, Prevenar ® ), indicated for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , was granted a license by the Russian Ministry of Health and Social Development (Roszdravnadzor) on 29   January 2009.  As part of a postlicensure commitment requested  by  the  Regulatory  Authorities  of  the  Russian  Federation,  Pfizer  conducted  a prospective,  observational,  non-interventional  study  of  Prevenar  in  the  context  of  the  routine immunization schedules  of  the  Russian  Federation  (Protocol  0887X1-4596-RU).    The  study  has  now been completed, and final data are available.  The purpose of this Clinical Overview is to summarize the results of Study 0887X1-4596-RU.  Methods · Objective(s) Primary The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  estimate  the  incidence  of  febrile  reactions  of ≥ 38°C  to ≤ 39°C; &gt;39°C to ≤ 40°C; &gt;40°C occurring within 2 days following vaccination with Prevenar (PCV7) coadministered  with  other  routine  childhood  vaccines  under  the  conditions  of  routine  daily  use  in  the Russian Federation within the licensed indication.

- a)  Local  reaction:  Redness  or  induration ≥ 2cm  in  diameter,  swelling  including  extent  of  swelling, transient tenderness and tenderness that interfered with limb movement.
- b)  Systemic  event:  to  monitor  the  rate  of  other  systemic  events  such  as  restless  sleep,  decreased appetite, unusual irritability/fussiness/crying, vomiting, diarrhoea, drowsiness, other.

## · Study design

This  was  a  prospective,  observational,  non-interventional,  non-randomized  study  of  the  safety  of Prevenar (PCV7) in children from 3 months up to 23 months of age. See Figure 1 for a schematic view of the current study. Subjects received Prevenar vaccinations as standard care. Available commercial supply  of  PCV7  (routine  use)  was  used  for  this  study  and  the  schedule  within  the  prescribing information was followed.

The secondary endpoints were the frequency of other local reactions (redness, swelling, tenderness) and systemic events (restless sleep, decreased appetite, unusual irritability/fussiness/crying, vomiting, diarrhoea) occurring within the 2-day post vaccination period.

Subjects participated in the study for up to 1.5 years (maximum 18 months) duration to allow for 30 days follow up after the last dose. · Study population /Sample size One hundred (100) children were to be enrolled at four sites with 50 infants starting the primary series (3-11 months old) and another 50 infants/children receiving 'catch-up doses' starting at 12 months (12-23 months old). · Treatments As this was an observational study, no specific interventional procedures were performed at visits, but information  was  collected.  Visits  were  not  protocol  driven  and  corresponded  with  proposed  PCV7 vaccination schedule. Outcomes/endpoints The primary endpoint for this study was the incidence of febrile reactions of ≥ 38°C to ≤ 39°C; &gt;39°C to ≤ 40°C; &gt;40°C occurring within 2 days following vaccination with Prevenar.

## · Statistical Methods

The analysis was descriptive with no hypothesis testing.

Data tabulations: For quantitative data, number of subjects (n), mean and standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum, and number of missing data are presented. For qualitative data, number

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  subjects  (n),  frequency  and  percentage  on  available  data,  and  number  of  missing  data  are presented.

Within  cohorts,  2-sided  95%  confidence  limits  were  provided  for  rates  of  febrile  reactions.  These confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  based  on  the  one-sample  Wilson  Score  method  without  continuity correction.

##  Results

· Recruitment/ Number analysed One hundred (100) children were to be enrolled at four sites with 50 infants starting the primary series (3-11 months old) and another 50 infants/children receiving 'catch-up doses' starting at 12 months (12-23 months old). The number of subjects vaccinated with PCV7 at each dose is shown in Table 4 below. · Efficacy results Not applicable · Safety results Primary objective - Febrile reactions The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  estimate  the  incidence  of  febrile  reactions  (defined  as temperatures ≥ 38°C) occurring within 2 days after vaccination with PCV7 co-administered with other routine childhood vaccines. For each dose, the timeframe of interest comprised a total of 3 days, i.e., Day 1 through Day 3, with Day 1 being the day of vaccine administration (Table 7). All reports of fever were for temperatures of ≥ 38°C to ≤ 39°C, except for 3 reports of fever &gt;39°C to ≤ 40°C after dose 1 in the catch-up cohorts (Table 7). All 3 of the subjects with fever &gt;39°C to ≤ 40°C received concomitant vaccinations after dose 1. The highest incidence of any fever ≥ 38°C was observed after dose 2 for the primary  cohort  (3  subjects,  23.1%),  after  dose  1  for  the  7-11  month  catch-up  cohort  (6  subjects, 19.4%), and after dose 1 for the 12-23 month catch-up cohort (3 subjects, 5.5%). No clear influence of concomitant vaccinations on the incidence of febrile reactions was detected in this study; however, the numbers of subjects receiving concomitant vaccinations in each cohort were generally too low to draw conclusions.

Secondary objective The secondary objective of this study was to observe the frequency and severity of local reactions, systemic events, and undesirable effects (i.e., adverse events) occurring within 2 days after routine vaccination with PCV7. Information regarding these events was also collected and summarized for the period  through  7  days  after  vaccination  (i.e.,  Days  1  to  8).  Local  reactions  and  systemic  events reported for Days 1 to 3 and for Days 1 to 8 are summarized for all cohorts and all doses in Table 8. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Local  Reactions -  All  local  reactions  occurred  between  Day  1  and  Day  3,  and  therefore  the frequencies  of  local  reactions  reported  between  Day  1  and  Day  8  are  the  same  as  the  frequencies reported between Day 1 and Day 3. In the primary cohort (3-6 months), local reactions were reported for  1  to  3  subjects  (14.3%  to  23.1%)  after  each  dose.  In  the  catch-up  7-11  month  cohort,  the frequency of local reactions decreased with each dose (41.9%, 17.2%, and 11.5% for dose 1, dose 2, and  dose  3,  respectively).  In  the  catch-up  12-23  month  cohort,  local  reactions  were  reported  for 38.2% and 29.6% of subjects after dose 1 and dose 2, respectively. Most local reactions were of mild or  moderate intensity  (&lt;2.5  cm  or  [2.5  to  &lt;5  cm],  respectively,  for  measurable  reactions).  Severe reactions ( ≥ 5 cm for measurable reactions) were reported in the catch-up 12-23 month cohort only: after  dose  1,  severe  redness  was  reported  for  3  subjects,  while  severe  swelling,  tenderness,  and haematoma were reported for 1 subject each; after dose 2, severe swelling and severe induration were reported for 1 subject each.

Systemic  Events -  In  the  primary  cohort,  solicited  systemic  events  were  reported  for  42.9%  to 46.2% of subjects after each dose in the primary series and for 28.6% of subjects after the toddler dose. In the catch-up 7-11 month cohort, the frequency of systemic events decreased across the doses (54.8%,  27.6%,  and  19.2%  for  dose  1,  dose  2,  and  dose  3,  respectively).  In  the  catch-up  12-23 month cohort, systemic events were reported for 49.1% and 22.2% of subjects after dose 1 and dose 2,  respectively.  In  the  primary  cohort,  the  most  frequently  reported  types  of  systemic  events  were unusual irritability,  unusual  crying,  and  restless  sleep,  all of  which  were  reported  for  between  7.1% and  28.6%  of  subjects  after  each  dose,  except  after  dose  3,  when  restless  sleep  was  reported  for 46.2% of subjects. In each of the follow-up cohorts, the most frequently reported types of systemic events after each dose were restless sleep and unusual crying, each reported for between 11.5% and 32.3% of subjects after each dose. Most systemic events were reported as mild or moderate. Overall, there were 26 reports of severe systemic events, as summarized in Table 9.

Adverse Events - Adverse events (AEs) occurring within 7 days after administration of each dose of study  vaccine  and  serious  adverse  events  occurring  within  30  days  after  vaccination  were  to  be reported  and  recorded  on  CRFs.  In  addition,  information  regarding  AEs  and  serious  adverse  events occurring throughout the study was to be captured to the extent that this was feasible. The  numbers  and  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  adverse  events  and  adverse  events  considered related to study vaccine by the investigator are summarized in Table 10 for each dose and each cohort. In the primary cohort, the most frequently reported types of AEs included injection site erythema (3 reports) and atopic dermatitis (3 reports, 2 of which were considered related to study vaccine). In the catch-up cohort 7-11 months, the most frequently reported type of AEs was infections and infestations (7 reports). Related AEs included body temperature increase (2 reports), and crying, atopic dermatitis, and  gait  disturbance  (1  report  each).  In  the  catch-up  cohort  12-23  months,  the  most  frequently reported types of AEs were infections and infestations (6 reports) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  (5  reports).  AEs  considered  related  to  study  vaccine  were  rash  and  body  temperature increased (1 report each). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## VI. Request for supplementary information

Two serious adverse events were reported during the study, neither of which was considered to be related  to  study  vaccine.  One  subject  in  the  catch-up  7-11  month  cohort  was  hospitalized  with  an upper respiratory tract infection 4 days after dose 1. The infection resolved in 5 days. One subject in the catch-up 12-23 month cohort was hospitalized with acute sinusitis 7 days after dose 1. The subject recovered  within  2  weeks.  No  subjects  died  during  the  study  and  no  adverse  events  resulted  in withdrawal from the study. 3. Discussion on clinical aspects The safety data from Study 0887X1-4596-RU are consistent with the known safety profile of Prevenar (PCV7).  The  study  did  not  highlight  any  new  safety  concern  for  vaccination  with  Prevenar  coadministered with other routine childhood vaccines. V. Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion and recommendation  Overall conclusion The current study did not highlight any new safety concerns regarding the vaccination with Prevenar (PCV7) concomitantly with other routine childhood vaccinations in the subjects under study. However, the total number of subjects involved in this study is by far too small to draw a valid conclusion about the vaccine's safety profile among Russian infants and toddlers.  Recommendation The data from this study do not warrant any changes to the SmPC or PIL.
