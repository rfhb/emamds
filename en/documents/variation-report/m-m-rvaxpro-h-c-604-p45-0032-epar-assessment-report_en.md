## I. ASSESSMENT

## Introduction

This report concerns assessment of the final report of safety study CSR X04-VAR-402 (P061):

'A double-blind, randomised, controlled, multi-centre safety study of a refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX in healthy 12 to 15 month-old children, X04-VAR-402'

which is submitted in the frame of Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for M-M-RVAXPRO (former M-M-RII).

The present submission is a follow-up measure commitment related to R/027 (Renewal Procedure for M-M-RVAXPRO), for which the study synopsis was included in the Renewal dossier for this vaccine. In addition, this final study report was already submitted in the frame of Article 45 for Varivax on 18-072007 to the RMS, the AIFA.

## Assessment

##  Methods

- Study Objective:

The objective of this study is to fulfil a regulatory (French) commitment to describe the safety profile of a refrigerator-stable formulation of VARIVAX. The study therefore was to describe the safety profile of a single dose injection of VARIVAX in 12 to 15 month-old children in the 42-day follow-up period postvaccination.

Because of its demonstrated and well known safety profile, M-M-RII has been selected as the active control arm for this study.

The safety and tolerability of vaccines were determined by the frequency, severity, and duration of:

- -Solicited injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain) for 4 days after each vaccination
- -Spontaneously reported injection site reactions for 42 days after each vaccination
- -Varicella-like rash, Measles-like rash, Rubella-like rash, or Mumps-like symptoms for 42 days after each vaccination
- -Daily rectal or rectal equivalent temperature for 42 days after each vaccination
- -Other systemic adverse events (AEs) for 42 days after each vaccination
- -Serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study design
- o Description of overall study design and plan

This was a double-blind, randomised, two-arms, controlled, multi-centre study, with a 2x2 cross-over design.

Two vaccination schedules (first VARIVAX and then M-M-RII  vs. first M-M-RII  and then VARIVAX) were planned to be randomly allocated to 500 subjects.

- -Group 1 (250 subjects): A single subcutaneous dose (0.5 mL) of VARIVAX administered at Visit 1 and a single subcutaneous dose (0.5 mL) of M-M-RII administered 42 days later at Visit 2.
- -Group 2 (250 subjects): A single subcutaneous dose (0.5 mL) of M-M-RII administered at Visit 1 and a single subcutaneous dose (0.5 mL) of VARIVAX administered 42 days later at Visit 2

The study plan is summarized in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Study Groups'Vaccinationschedule

<!-- image -->

Subjects were to be observed in the physician's office by the physician for at least 15-20 minutes following each vaccination, then by the subject's parent(s)/ legal representative for 42 days following each vaccination with observations noted on the supplied diary card.

The parent(s)/ legal representatives were instructed to contact the investigator immediately if any serious adverse event occurred at any time from Day 0 until the last visit of his/her child. The investigator had to report all serious adverse events occurring from the time that the consent form had been signed until the last visit of the subject concerned to Sanofi Pasteur MSD within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.

In the event of measles-like rash, rubella-like rash, varicella-like rash (injection-site or non-injectionsite) or mumps-like symptoms during the 42-day follow-up period after each vaccination, an additional visit to the investigator will be set up as soon as possible (&lt; 72 hours) for a medical diagnosis.

Clinical research associates (CRA) from the CRO were given pre-study training on the study vaccines, the study protocol, the CRF and other study documents, study-specific instructions, Sanofi Pasteur MSD's and the CRO's standard operating procedures, serious adverse event (SAE) reporting and ICH-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GCP. Routine, on-site monitoring was carried out by the CRA (including source data verification, verification of study vaccines storage and accountability).

- o Study population / sample size

Healthy children were eligible for enrolment if they were 12 months to 15 months of age, with their Parent(s) / legal representatives providing signed consent form and able to understand the protocol requirements and to fill in the diary card.

Subjects meeting at least one of the following criteria were ineligible for inclusion:

1. Prior receipt of measles, mumps, rubella or varicella vaccine either alone or in a combination vaccine,
2. Known or suspected clinical history of infection with measles, mumps, rubella, varicella or zoster,
3. Any known recent (≤30 days) exposure to measles, mumps or rubella,
4. Any known recent (≤30 days) exposure to varicella or zoster involving:
5. continuous household contact, or
6. playmate contact (generally &gt;1 hour of play indoors), or
7. hospital contact (in same 2- to 4-bed room or adjacent beds in a large ward or face-toface contact with an infectious staff member or subject), or
8. contact with a newborn whose mother had onset of varicella 5 days or less before delivery or within 48 hours after delivery,
9. Any recent (≤3 days) history of febrile illness (rectal temperature ≥38.0°C),
10. Active untreated tuberculosis,
11. Any known blood dyscrasia, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems,
12. Any immune impairment or humoral/cellular deficiency, neoplastic disease or depressed immunity including those resulting from corticosteroid (any long-term [≥14 days] administration of systemic corticosteroid therapy given daily or on alternate days at high doses [≥2mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent or ≥20mg/day if weight &gt;10kg] within the previous 30 days) or other immunosuppressive therapy,
13. Any previous (≤150 days) receipt of immune serum globulin or any blood-derived products or scheduled to be administered through Visit 3,
14. Any recent receipt of an inactivated or a live vaccine (≤30 days) or scheduled vaccination through Visit 3,
15. Known allergy to egg proteins (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction after ingesting eggs) or history of anaphylactic reactions(e.g. hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension or shock) or prior known sensitivity/ allergy to any component of the vaccines,
16. Any recent participation (≤30 days) or scheduled participation in any other clinical trial through Visit 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With a planned safety population of 500 participants (also taking a 5% dropout rate into account), AEs occurring with a frequency of 1 in 1000 or 1 in 100 had an probability of 37.8% and 99.1%, respectively, to be observed. Within a single study group, AEs with population rate of 1 in 100 had a 90.8% chance of detection.

Between 02-December-2004 (first subject first visit) and 13-September-2005 (last subject last visit), a total of 507 subjects were enrolled at 39 centers in France and 1 center in Italy.

- o Randomization procedure

The randomization was stratified by center. Vaccine groups / vaccination schedules were randomly allocated to the subjects who would receive either VARIVAX® (Group 1) or M-M-R™II (Group 2) at Visit 1. Each subject was allocated a randomization number in chronological order of their inclusion at the center. Randomization numbers were not to be reassigned for any reason.

- o Blinding

Neither the parent(s) / legal representatives, the investigator, the study personnel, the laboratory staff, nor Sanofi Pasteur MSD personnel knew which vaccine the study subject was receiving. The allocation schedule was generated by a statistician not associated with the study.

The study nurse was designated as the unblinded vaccine coordinator:

- -had access to the allocation schedule;
- -was responsible for preparing and administering all study vaccines;
- -did all efforts to keep the parent(s)/ legal representatives blinded to the vaccine used during the vaccination;
- -was not allowed to collect study data or to discuss the study with the parent(s)/ legal representatives or other study personnel.

The investigator ensured that the allocation schedule was respected and was responsible for study vaccines accountability.

- o Treatments

The vaccines were supplied in French commercial packaging, stored between +2°C and +8°C, and delivered in refrigerated containers with electronic temperature measuring devices. Each dose of VARIVAX (0.5 mL) contains Varicella virus (Oka/Merck strain)  ≥1350 PFU; Each dose of M-M-RII (0.5 mL) contains Measles virus (Edmonston strain)  ≥1000 TCID50; Mumps virus (Jeryl Lynn strain) ≥5000 TCID50; Rubella virus (Wistar RA27/3 strain) ≥1000 TCID50.

For sequential vaccine administration (first VARIVAX at Vist 1 and then M-M-RII at Visit 2, or vice versa ), 0.5 mL of the vaccine were subcutaneously injected into the upper antero-lateral region of the thigh (but not in the same thigh).

- o Outcomes/Safety Criteria

During the 4 days after vaccination:

- Solicited injection site reactions (listed in the diary card and the CRF using MedDRA Lowest Level Term [LLT]): injection site redness, injection site swelling and injection site pain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the 42 days after vaccination:

- Spontaneously reported injection site reactions
- Varicella-like rashes (MedDRA LLT: varicella-like rash)
- Measles-like rashes (MedDRA LLT: measles-like rash)
- Rubella-like rashes (MedDRA LLT: rash rubelliform)
- Mumps-like symptoms (MedDRA LLT: mumps-like illness)
- Daily rectal or rectal equivalent temperature and
- Other systemic adverse events

Throughout the subject study period (from signature of the consent form until the last visit):

- Serious adverse events
- o Statistical and analytical plans

All subjects who received a study vaccine and who had safety follow-up data available were to be analyzed (defined as Safety Set ).  No subjects were to be excluded from analysis due to protocol deviations.

## Preliminary safety analysis:

Since the study had a cross-over design, a preliminary safety analysis was therefore performed in order to evaluate the presence of any period effect and/or any carry-over effect on the data, i.e., on overall rates of injection site reactions, vaccine-related systemic events and unrelated systemic adverse events during the Day 0 - Day 42 safety follow-up periods. This was to be done on the Safety Subset (defined as subjects who had received both injections and had safety follow-up data for both periods).

The carry-over effect was to be tested using the statistic first described by Altham. The period effect was to be tested using a modified Mainland-Gart test.

If no evidence of carry-over or period effect was found then the safety data following the two VARIVAX injections were to be pooled (Group 1 at Period 1 and Group 2 at Period 2). If carry-over and/or period effects existed, the data following the two VARIVAX® injections were not to be pooled but described separately by period. This analysis was also performed for the safety data following M-M-RII vaccination.

- o Protocol amendments

The clinical study protocol was not amended. No changes were made to the planned statistical analysis.

-  Results
- Recruitment/number analyzed

The disposition and analysis sets of study subjects is summarized in Figure 3 below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

507 subjects enrolled in the study were randomized into one of two vaccination schedule groups. All received a study vaccine and had safety follow-up data, and were therefore included in the safety set.

A total of 502 subjects received one single dose of M-M-RII vaccine, whereas 501 subjects received one single dose of VARIVAX.

A total of 10 out of 507 subjects (2.0%) withdrew from the study: 4/254 (1.6%) subjects in Group 1 and 6/253 (2.4%) subjects in Group 2. Nine of the 10 withdrawals were after the first injection.

## Assessor's comments:

The study was overall well conducted, with satisfactory accrual of study subjects and implementing vaccination with study vaccines and safety outcome analysis for 100% of randomized subjects. The dropout rate (2%) is low.

- Preliminary safety analysis

The presence/absence of a period effect and/or a carry-over effect was summarized in Tables 11, 12, 15, 16 below.

- -There were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) carry-over effect and period effect on overall injection site reactions
- -There was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) period effect on unrelated systemic adverse events
- -There was no carry-over effect on unrelated systemic adverse events

In addition, it was noted that neither carry-over effect nor period effect was shown for vaccine-related systemic adverse events.

Following the preliminary safety analysis results based on Safety Subset of subjects,

- -injection site reactions following VARIVAX are presented for the whole study (period 1 and period 2 pooled), but per period following M-M-RII.
- -Systemic adverse events, whether vaccine-related or unrelated, are presented for the whole study (period 1 and period 2 pooled) for VARIVAX and for M-M-RII.

For each type of event, results from period 1, period 2 and pooled results are shown.

- M-M-RII Safety Evaluation

During the safety follow-up period following M-M-RII administration:

- -There were no deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs reported during the study (Table 18)
- -A total of 378 participants (75.3%) reported at least one AE, and 225 of them (44.8%) reported at least one vaccine-related AE
- -For Injection site reactions (which cannot be pooled due to carry-over effect), Eighteen (18/251 - 7.2%) subjects in Group 1 and 38/251 (15.1%) subjects in Group 2 reported at least one injection site reaction
- o Thus, more injection site reactions were seen following M-M- RT MII injection given at the first Visit (Group 2) than when being given at the second Visit (Group 1)
- o Solicited injection site reactions were the most frequently reported: 17/251 (6.8%) subjects in Group 1 and 33/251 (13.1%) subjects in Group 2
- -A total of 364/502 (72.5%) subjects reported at least one systemic AE and 189/502 (37.6%) subjects reported at least one vaccine-related systemic AE
- -A total of 28/502 (5.6%) subjects reported at least one rash of interest (i.e. varicella/varicellalike rash, measles/measles-like rash or rubella/rubella-like rash). Rubella-like rash was most frequently reported by 12/502 (2.4%) subjects, whereas measles-like rash and varicel-lalike rash each being reported by 8/502 (1.6%) subjects
- -No subject presented with mumps-like illness after M-M-RII injection
- -Four (4) SAEs were reported following M-M-RII administration. All of them were assessed as not related to the study vaccine. All were hospitalizations either for injury (elbow fracture) or for an infectious disease (gastroenteritis for 2 subjects and acute pharyngitis and acute bronchitis for 1 subject which occurred at Day 4, Day 17 and Day 24 post-vaccination respectively)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Three (3) subjects (0.6%), all in Group 2, withdrew from the study following M-M-RII administration because of a non-serious AE coded as varicella-like rash: subjects 102006 characterised as wild type). Therefore, no participant discontinued from the study because of

(at Day 14 post-vaccination), 110006 (at Day 36 post-vaccination), and 505007 (at Day 48 post-vaccination). These events were assessed as not related to the study vaccine (For 2 subjects - 102006 and 505007, a lesion sample was collected and the viral strain was an vaccine-related AE.

## Solicited Local Adverse Reactions

Overall, solicited local reactions (pain, erythema, swelling) were more frequently reported in Group 2, i.e. when M-M-RII was given at the First visit followed by VARIVAX injection at the Second visit. For both Group 1 and Group 2, the most frequently reported solicited local reaction was injection-site pain.

These results are presented in Table 19.

database and not considered as a rash of interest by the investigator (i.e. not as varicella/ varicella-like rash, measles/ measles-like rah or rubella/ rubella-like rash)

The majority of solicited injection site reactions were ≤2.5 cm in size or of mild intensity and shortlived. In all the cases, injection site reactions were ≤5 cm in size and only a very low proportion (0.8% to 1.6%) of subjects reported injection site reactions of moderate intensity. No injection site reaction was reported with a size &gt;7.5cm or with a severe intensity.

## Systemic Adverse Events

Systemic AEs were reported by 72.5% of participants following M-M-RII administration; and 37.6% of participants reported at least one vaccine-related systemic AEs (see Table 18). Participants reported slightly more systemic AEs when M-M-RII was administered first at visit 1 (75.3% in Group 2 versus 69.7% in Group 1).

Overall systemic AEs (vaccine-related, vaccine-unrelated) were summarized in Table 20 below within the following MedDRA SOC1 (in descending frequency order):

- By ≥10% of subjects: General disorders and administration site conditions, Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders,
- By ≥1% and &lt;10% of subjects: Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Eye disorders, and Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported systemic AEs (vaccine-related, vaccine-unrelated) following M-M-RII administration were pyrexia (55.2%), followed by ear infection (12.9%), nasopharyngitis (9.8%), rhinitis (9.2%), cough (6.8%) and diarrhoea (5.6%, Table 20 below).

within the subjects vaccinated and providing safety follow-up at the corresponding injection

(1) Lymphadenopathy and Rhinitis were each reported as a vaccine-related systemic adverse event by 1.2% of subjects both in Group 2.

(2) Any episode of rectal (or rectal equivalent) temperature ≥39.4oC, any episode of feverish feeling without exact temperature and any temperature that led to withdrawal from the study were to be reported as an adverse event fever; additionally, any rectal (or rectal equivalent) temperature ≥38.0°C could be reported as a an adverse event fever as per investigator judgement rash rubelliform was analysed as a measles-like rash s  s    n  si   s  e narrative is presented in section 14.1.4.1.3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pyrexia was the only vaccine-related systemic AE reported with an incidence ≥10% of subjects (34.1%). However, if pyrexia is estimated based on a maximum rectal or rectal equivalent temperature (axillary temperature + 0.9°C) ≥39.4°C, it was reported by 24.3% of subjects. Nearly half was reported between Day 5 and Day 12 (13.2%, Table 21).

The difference between the fever rate reported as an AE and the rate of rectal or rectal equivalent temperature ≥39.4°C was due to the protocol definition of fever as an AE. For a subject reported to have been feverish or to have had a fever but for whom a numeric value of temperature was not provided, an AE of fever was to be reported as per the protocol definition. Additionally, if an investigator reported an AE of fever for a subject who presented a rectal or rectal equivalent temperature less than 39.4°C, this event was considered as an AE of fever but not as a rectal or rectal equivalent temperature ≥39.4°C.

MD: Missing data, SD: Standard deviation

Rashes of interest (i.e. varicella/ varicella-like rash, measles/ measles-like rash or rubella/ rubella-like rash) during the safety follow-up period following M-M-RII injection were reported in 5.6% of participants (Table 22). In all cases, they were non-injection site rashes. The most frequently reported rashes were rubella/ rubella-like (2.4%). Varicella/ varicella-like rashes and measles/ measles-like rashes each were reported by 1.6% of participants. All rashes of interest were mainly of mild intensity.

Varicella/ varicella-like rashes were evenly distributed throughout the period from Day 0 and Day 42 and the mean duration was 7.8 (SD ± 1.8) days. Measles/ measles-like rashes started mainly between Day 5 and Day 12 (5 subjects out of 8) and the mean duration was 6.6 (SD ± 6.6) days. Rubella/ rubella-like rashes started mainly between Day 5 and Day 12 (half of the 12 subjects) and the mean duration was 4.5 (SD ± 1.6) days.

## Assessor's comments:

M-M-RII was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in this study. The safety and reactogenicity profile of M-M-RII seen was as expected, based on previous experience with this vaccine. The rank order of frequency of each solicited local reaction observed in this study was the same as reported by other studies: pain was numerically more frequent than erythema, and swelling was the least frequent of the three. Also noteworthy is that all the vaccine-related systemic AEs reported in this study with an incidence ≥1% have already been listed in the SmPC for M-M-RVAXPRO.

- VARIVAX Safety Evaluation

During the safety follow-up periods following VARIVAX administration:

- -There were no deaths reported during the study. One SAE was reported to be possibly related to the study vaccine and assessed by Sanofi Pasteur MSD as unexpected.
- o a 13.5-month-old boy presented with Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 24 days post-immunization with VARIVAX, and was hospitalized. Platelets count was 1000/mm 3 .
- -Three additional SAEs (Gastroenteritis at Day 45, Pneumopathy at Day 12, Laryngospasm at Day 1 post-vaccination) were reported following VARIVAX administration, all were assessed as unrelated to vaccination
- -A total of 360 participants (71.9%) reported at least one AE and 239 of them (47.7%) reported at least one vaccine-related AE
- -For injection site reactions (Groups 1 and 2 pooled), 142/501 (28.3%) of subjects reported at least one injection site reaction: 13.0% of subjects reported at least one solicited injection site reaction from Day 0 to Day 4 and 17.2% of subjects reported at least one other injection site reaction from Day 0 to Day 42
- -A total of 326/501 (65.1%) of subjects reported at least one systemic AE, and 152/501 (30.3%) subjects reported at least one vaccine-related systemic AE

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -A total of 34/501 (6.8%) subjects reported at least one rash of interest (i.e. varicella/varicellalike rash, measles/ measles-like rah or rubella/ rubella-like rash): 16/501 (3.2%) subjects reported at least one varicella/ varicella-like rash, 5/501 (1.0%) subjects reported at least one measles/ measles-like rash and 14/501 (2.8%) subjects reported at least one rubella/ rubellalike rash
- -No subjects presented with mumps-like illness after VARIVAX injection
- -One (1/501 - 0.2%) subject, in Group 1, reported a non-serious AE (varicella-like rash of severe severity at Day 9 post-vaccination) leading to withdrawal from the study. The event was assessed as not related to the study vaccine

The overall results as well as results by group are presented in Table 23.

- (1) Number and percentage of subjects presenting the considered event at least once; percentages are calculated within the
42. Thus the systemic adverse event assessed as serious (Gastroenteritis - subject 210002) that occurred at Day 45 postvaccination was not taken into account in the 42-day safety follow-up period post-vaccination. A listing of all the adverse events reported after Day 42 post-vaccination is presented in 14.1.4.1.3.
- (4) Reported from Day 0 (Day of vaccination) to Day 4 post-vaccination
- (5) May include solicited Injection site reactions occurring from Day 5 to Day 42
- (6) Rash of interest is any varicella/ varicella-like rash, measles/ measles-like rash and rubella/ rubella-like rash either at the injection site or non-injection site
- (7) Overall adverse events i.e. including all injection site reactions and systemic adverse events
7. D1:Activeuntreatedtuberculosis
8. D2: Any known blood dyscrasia, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems
9. D3: Any immune impairment or humoral/ cellular deficiency, neoplastic disease
10. D5: Allergy to egg proteins (anaphylactic reaction after ingesting eggs) or history of anaphylactic (e.g. hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension or shock) reactions or prior known sensitivity to any component of the vaccines

## Solicited Local Adverse Reactions

Overall, solicited local reactions (erythema, pain, swelling) were reported at similar frequency (13.3% vs. 12.7%) in Groups 1 and 2. For both Groups, the most frequently reported solicited local reaction was injection-site erythema, whereas injection site swelling was least reported during the 4 days period. These results are presented in Table 24.

(1) May include injection site erythema, injection site swelling and injection site pain starting from Day 5 to Day 42

(2) Injection site rash were all considered as a rash of interest at the injection site by the investigators: 5 as varicella-like rash and 1 asmeasles-likerash

(3) Injection site vesicles were both considered as a rash of interest at the injection site by the investigators: both as varicellalike rash

Injection site reactions were mainly ≤2.5 cm in size or of mild intensity and short lived. Two types of injection site reactions could be seen following VARIVAX administration:

- -Injection site reactions with onset on the day following vaccination (incidence ≥1% for injection site erythema, pain and swelling) and mean duration of 1 to 3 days
- -Injection site reactions with onset 1 to 2 weeks post-vaccination (incidence ≥10% for injection site erythema; ≥1% for injection site swelling, pain and rash) and mean duration of 1 week

Only 1 (0.2%) subject reported an injection site erythema &gt;7.5 cm in size from Day 0 to Day 4. Injection site pain was mainly of mild intensity and only 1 (0.2%) subject reported injection site pain of severe intensity from Day 0 to Day 4. No other reaction was reported with a size &gt;7.5 cm in size or with severe intensity.

## Systemic Adverse Events

Systemic AEs were reported by 65.1% participants following VARIVAX administration, and vaccinerelated systemic AEs were reported by 152/501 (30.3%) subjects (Table 23). The frequency of vaccine-related systemic AEs reported in Group 1/period 1 versus Group 2/period 2 was similar (31.3% vs. 29.4%).

Overall systemic AEs (vaccine-related, vaccine-unrelated) were summarized in Table 26 within the following MedDRA SOC1 (in descending frequency order):

By ≥10% of subjects: General disorders and administration site conditions, Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders

By ≥1% and &lt;10% of subjects: Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and Eye disorders.

The most frequently reported systemic AEs (vaccine-related, vaccine-unrelated) following VARIVAX administration were pyrexia (45.3%), followed by ear infection (11.8%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%), rhinitis (8.2%), cough (6.8%) and diarrhoea (4.8%, Table 26 below).

(1) Any episode of rectal (or rectal equivalent) temperature ≥39.4°C, any episode of feverish feeling without exact temperature and any temperature that led to withdrawal from the study were to be reported as an adverse event of pyrexia ; additionally, any rectal (or rectal equivalent) temperature ≥38.0°C could be reported as a an adverse event of pyrexia as per investigator judgement

(2）Thecaseofseriousgastroenteritis thatoccurred atDay 45post-vaccination(subject 210o02)wasnot takenintoaccount in this table

Note: Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SoC1 was reported with an incidence ≥1% in any group however none this table.

Vaccine-related systemic AEs reported by ≥1% of subjects were mainly of mild intensity, usually started from Day 5 to Day 13 post-vaccination and generally lasted between 1 and 6 days. Unrelated systemic AEs were also of mild or moderate intensity and short lived (generally lasted between 3 and 10 days). Only 1 (0.2%) subject reported a vaccine-related systemic AE (ear infection) of severe intensity. Unrelated systemic AEs reported with a severe intensity included ear infection (1%), teething (0.4%), nasopharyngitis (0.2%), rhinitis (0.2%), rash vesicular (0.2%), and bronchitis (0.2%).

Pyrexia was the only vaccine-related systemic AEs reported with an incidence ≥10% of subjects (25.3%).

However, if pyrexia is estimated based on a maximum rectal or rectal equivalent temperature (i.e. axillary temperature + 0.9°C) ≥39.4°C, it was reported by 17.0% of subjects (Table 29). Vaccinerelated pyrexia was mainly less than 39.5°C, started mainly at 9.8 (SD ± 9.8) days post-vaccination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and had a mean duration of 2.7 (SD ± 2.1) days. Pyrexia started on average at 17.9 (SD ± 12.6) days post-vaccination: vaccine-related pyrexia at 9.8 (SD ± 9.8) days post-vaccination whereas unrelated pyrexia at 23.8 (SD ± 11.1) days post-vaccination. The mean duration of pyrexia was of 2.6 (SD ± 1.9) days: 2.7 (SD ± 2.1) days for vaccine-related pyrexia and 2.5 (SD ± 1.7) days, for unrelated pyrexia.

MD:Missing data,SD:Standard deviation

Rashes of interest (i.e. varicella/ varicella-like rash, measles/ measles-like rash or rubella/ rubella-like rash) during the safety follow-up period (Day 0 to Day 42) following VARIVAX injection were reported in 6.8% of participants (Table 23): 2.8% of subjects reported rubella/ rubella-like rashes (all were non-injections site rashes); 3.2% of subjects reported varicella or varicella-like rashes (7 injection site rashes and 9 Non-injection site rashes); 1.0% of subjects reported measles/ measles-like rashes (one injection site rash and 4 non-injection site rashes).

Varicella/ varicella-like rashes were reported with the most frequent number of lesions ranging from 1 to 20 for 12 rashes.  Three lesion samples from non-injection sites were laboratory-tested and all 3 were characterized as wild type viral strain. Rashes were mostly of mild intensity, with a maximum rectal or rectal equivalent temperature mainly less than 39.4°C or normal during the episode, and had a mean duration of 8.9 (SD ± 5.3) days (Table 31). Injection site rashes started between Day 3 and Day 9 post-vaccination whereas non-injection site rashes were distributed across the 42-day safety period.

(1) One subject can have several types of lesions for the same rash

(2) Maximum number of lesions per rash

(3) Maximum temperature in the corresponding rash onset period

SD: Standard deviation

The subject (a 14.5-month-old boy) reporting a varicella-like rash of severe intensity 9 days postimmunization withdrew from the study because of this AE. Laboratory testing of lesion sample demonstrated the viral strain has a charcateristic of  wild type GT B. thus, this AE was assessed as not related to the study vaccine.

Measles/ measles-like rashes were reported with the most frequent maximum number of lesions ranging from 1 to 20 for 3 rashes. All rashes were reported to be of mild intensity with a maximum rectal or rectal equivalent temperature &lt;38.0°C. Rashes had a mean duration of 6.2 (SD ± 4.3) days.

Rubella/ rubella-like rashes were reported with the most frequent maximum number of lesions ranging from 1 to 20 for 7 rashes. Rashes were reported to be of mild intensity in 10 cases, with majority of the subjects reporting a maximum rectal or rectal equivalent temperature &lt;39.4°C or normal. Rash had a mean duration of 5.0 (SD ± 4.1) days.

Assessor's comments:

The safety and reactogenicity profile of VARIVAX seen in this study is generally acceptable. The potential undersirable effect - the idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has already been included as an adverse event in the SmPC of the vaccine. Although the incidence of some of vaccine-related AEs was relatively higher than that described in SmPC for VARIVAX, such as conjunctivitis (1.6% in this study vs. uncommon in SmPC), cough (1% in this study vs. uncommon in SmPC), nasopharyngitis (1% in this study vs. uncommon in SmPC), this doesn't demand a SmPC update, because 1) this final study report was already submitted in 2007 in the frame of Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for Varivax and 2) differences exist between concerned age group in this study (12 - 15 months) and that referred to in SmPC (12 months - 12 years of age).

## II. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ACTION IF REQUIRED

The study was well conducted, with all randomized participants being vaccinated and analyzed for safety outcomes. The dropout rate (2%) is low.

Since the present submission is in accordance with Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for M-M-RVAXPRO, safety and reactogenicity data following M-M-RVAXPRO administration is more relevant to this assessment report.

M-M-RII was generally safe and well-tolerated in this paediatric study. The safety profile of this vaccine observed in this study was well comparable with the already established one for M-M-RII. The rank order of frequency of each solicited local reaction observed in this study was in line with that reported by other studies: pain was numerically more frequent than erythema, and swelling was the least frequent of the three. In addition, all the vaccine-related systemic AEs reported in this study with an incidence ≥ 1% have already been listed in the SmPC for M-M-RVAXPRO. Therefore, at present there is no need for updating the current SmPC for M-M-RVAXPRO.

PAC fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required.
