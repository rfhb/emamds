## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  on  4  December  2012  an  application  for  a  variation including an extension of indication.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Stelara              | USTEKINUMAB                           | See Annex A      |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Type                                                                                                                           |    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| C.1.6 a)              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II |

Addition of a new therapeutic indication - Psoriatic arthritis

'STELARA, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. Stelara has been shown to improve physical function (see section 5.1).'

The MAH applied for a new indication for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance.

The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision P/292/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/292/2012  was  not  yet  completed  as  some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Derogation(s) of market exclusivity

Not applicable.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Therapies  for  PsA  are  intended  to  ameliorate  disease  signs  and  symptoms  and  the  functional impairment  caused  by  the  disease,  inhibit  the  structural  damage  resulting  from  inflammation,  and improve quality of life in affected patients. Mild PsA can be effectively managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs).  DMARDs  are  the  standard  therapy  for  moderate  to  severe  PsA. Methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide have been used in the treatment of this condition, and several anti-TNF agents have been approved for the treatment of PsA.

From a clinical perspective a clear need remains for alternative treatment options for patients with PsA who have inadequately responded to or are intolerant to NSAIDs, DMARDs and/or anti-TNF agents. There  is  room  for  new  agents  with  a  novel  mechanism  of  action,  which  demonstrate  consistent  or improved  efficacy  across  all  components  of  PsA,  improved  safety,  and  a  more  convenient  dosing schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ustekinumab (STELARA) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that binds the p40 subunit common to the heterodimeric cytokines interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interleukin 23 (IL-23) and neutralizes their biological activities.

Ustekinumab has been authorised in the EU since 16 January 2009 and has received approval for the treatment of adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Ps) in over 65 countries. This  was  primarily  based  on  2  large,  Phase  3,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  (C0743T08  and C0743T09) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In addition, ustekinumab has been studied or is currently being studied in multiple indications including psoriatic arthritis (PsA), paediatric psoriasis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), primary biliary cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

- Tabular overview of clinical studies

An overview of the 3 clinical studies that comprise the PsA clinical development program, including study populations, dose regimens, and efficacy endpoints is briefly presented in Table 1.  Note that the older name for Stelara (ustekinumab) in the phase 2 Study C0743T10 is CNTO 1275.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

A comprehensive PK analysis was provided at the initial MAA in subjects with plaque psoriasis. The additional data provided in this application is summarised below.

## Assays

No updates were available for the assays used to detect serum ustekinumab concentrations.

There was a new validated assay developed for detection of antibodies to ustekinumab (Meso Scale Discovery ECLIA Method for Detection of Antibodies to Ustekinumab in Human Serum). The difference between this newer assay (ECLIA) and the older ADA assay provided in the initial MAA (EIA) is that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

this  newer  assay  incorporates  an  acid  dissociation  step  and  is  therefore  more  tolerant  to  drug substance.

The  older  EIA  and  new  ECLIA  ADA  methods  were  compared  in  a  cross-validation  that  evaluated method  sensitivity  and  ustekinumab  interference  in  the  ability  of  the  methods  to  accurately  detect antibodies to ustekinumab. The ECLIA method demonstrated greater sensitivity than the EIA method (1.97  ng/mL  vs.  125  ng/mL  respectively)  when  a  purified  cynomolgus  anti-ustekinumab  pAb  was serially diluted.

Based on the screening Method A cut-point (0.132 OD), 50 ng/mL Cyno 6747 was detected in the presence of up to 7 ng/mL ustekinumab (CNTO 1275), whereas for the newer ECLIA the low positive ADA  control  (50  ng/mL  Cyno  6747)  could  be  detected  in  the  presence  of  up  to  100,000  ng/mL ustekinumab (CNTO 1275), thereby showing more tolerance to serum ustekinumab for the new ECLIA assay.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Efficacy  for  plaque  psoriasis  (Ps)  was  the  main  PD  readout  in  the  original  MAA.    In  the  Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) studies the MAH conducted a variety of assessments for a PD effect other than clinical efficacy.

Assessments  of  serum  markers  previously  reported  to  be  associated  with  PsA  were  analysed.  The serum  inflammatory  markers  evaluated  were  VEGF,  sIL-2R,  MMP-3,  and  osteocalcin.  Despite  the reported association of elevated levels of these markers with PsA, in the study population the mean levels of all markers were not markedly elevated and were similar to those reported in the literature for  healthy  adults  (Fink  et  al,  2007;  Bons  et  al,  2007;  Brennan  et  al  1997; Gundberg  et  al,  1983). Overall,  there  were  minimal  changes  (&lt;  10%)  from  baseline  with  no  trend  for  change  following treatment with ustekinumab.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

## Population PK Analysis

A  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  examining  a  variety  of  demographics,  baseline  disease characteristics and concomitant medication.

There  were  334  (48.0%)  subjects  who  used  concomitant  MTX  during  the  study  period  and  were included in the population PK analysis. The median CL/F value in subjects who used concomitant MTX tended to be lower when compared with subjects who did not use concomitant MTX; the ratio of the median  CL/F  values  in  subjects  who  used  concomitant  MTX  versus  subjects  who  did  not  use concomitant  MTX  was  0.92  and  the  90%  CI  of  the  ratio  was  (0.88,  0.96).  Therefore,  the  use  of concomitant MTX did not appear to affect the CL/F of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA.

Of  the  demographic  factors  (e.g.,  weight,  gender,  race,  and  age),  baseline  subject  physical  or biochemical characteristics, medical or medication history, or concomitant medications evaluated in the current population PK analysis, only subject weight and positive antibody to ustekinumab status were confirmed  to  be  important  covariates  affecting  the  CL/F  and  therefore  systemic  exposure  to ustekinumab  in  subjects  with  active  PsA.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effects  of  these important covariates needs to be evaluated concurrently with the clinical efficacy and safety data. The PK  simulation  indicated  that  subjects  of  higher  weight  (&gt;100  kg)  had  lower  median  serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with subjects of lower weight (≤100 kg), whereby the systemic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure to ustekinumab in subjects &gt;100 kg treated with 90 mg doses was generally comparable to that in subjects ≤100 kg treated with the 45 mg doses. These findings are consistent with the results from the previous population PK analysis using data from Phase 3 plaque psoriasis studies. None of the other factors evaluated, such as concomitant medications (MTX, NSAIDs, or oral corticosteroids) and prior exposure to anti-TNF agents, appeared to have impacts on the CL/F of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The MAH developed and validated an improved assay the ECLIA for detection of ADA.  Serum samples were taken in all three trials described in this report. Data from the two pivotal trials were used for the population PK analysis.

The overall conclusions from these data are summarised below:

- In general, the PK and immunogenicity results from the PsA studies were consistent with those from the plaque psoriasis (Ps) studies submitted at the initial MAA.
- The median t1/2 of ustekinumab was estimated to be 22.4 days in the Phase 2 PsA study.
- Dose  proportionality  in  serum  ustekinumab  concentration  was  observed  in  the  PsA  studies when  comparing  mean  serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  between  the  45  mg  and  90  mg groups.
- There was no evidence of accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentrations over time when ustekinumab was given SC q12w in the PsA studies.
- A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  with  BQL  trough  serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  were observed in the 45 mg group compared with the 90 mg group in the PsA studies.
- Serum ustekinumab concentrations were affected by weight in subjects with PsA. Subjects &gt;100 kg had lower mean serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with subjects ≤100 kg. Notably, mean serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects &gt;100 kg in the 90 mg group were generally comparable to those observed in subjects ≤100 kg in the 45 mg group.
- This was supported by population PK modeling and simulation.
- In the population PK analysis using Phase 3 PsA data, among the demographic factors (e.g., weight,  gender,  race,  and  age),  baseline  subject  physical  or  biochemical  characteristics, medical or medication history, or concomitant medications evaluated, only subject weight and positive antibody to ustekinumab status were found to be important covariates affecting the CL/F and therefore systemic exposure to ustekinumab in subjects with PsA.
- o In the population PK analysis, the use of concomitant MTX did not appear to have a clinically relevant impact on the CL/F of ustekinumab.
- o In the population PK analysis, prior exposure to biologic anti-TNF agents did not appear to have a clinically relevant impact on the CL/F of ustekinumab.
- Subjects with higher pre-injection serum ustekinumab concentrations tended to have higher clinical efficacy in PsA studies. The proportion of subjects who achieved ACR 20, ACR 50, and PASI  75  responses  at  Week  24  was  higher  in  subjects  with  quantifiable  preinjection  serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 16 when compared with subjects with preinjection BQL serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 16.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Population  PK  modeling  showed  that  weight  impacted  systemic  exposure  to  ustekinumab. Population PK/PD modeling showed a clear exposure-response relationship and that the impact of weight on efficacy resulted only from its impact on exposure to ustekinumab. This supports the  concept  of  giving  heavier  subjects  a  higher  dose  of  ustekinumab  to  achieve  higher exposure to ustekinumab.
- The overall incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was 5.8% to 6.1% through Week 24 in the Phase 3 PsA studies.  The  incidence  of  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  was  generally  comparable between the 45 mg group and the 90 mg group in the PsA studies.
- o The  incidence  of  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  was  lower  in  subjects  receiving  MTX  at baseline  (3.3%  and  4.5%)  compared  with  subjects  not  receiving  MTX  at  baseline (8.1% and 7.6%) in the CNTO1275PSA3001  and CNTO1275PSA3002  studies, respectively.
- o The incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was higher in subjects who were previously treated with biologic anti-TNF agents (8.5%) compared with subjects who were naïve to biologic anti-TNF agents (3.1%) in CNTO1275PSA3002.
- Subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had lower mean serum ustekinumab concentrations  than  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  in  the  PsA studies.
- Systemic markers of inflammation were measurable in the serum at baseline and 4 markers (MDC, VEGF, MCSF-1, and YKL-40) showed modest differences in concentration in ustekinumab-treated subjects compared to placebo at Week 4. However, there were no strong associations observed between the serum biomarkers measured and baseline disease severity or joint and/or skin response.

Patients  with  diabetes  showed  an  apparent  slightly  increased  clearance.  The  MAH  performed  a subgroup analyses for subjects with diabetes for the primary efficacy endpoint and the results showed that the PK and exposure in diabetic patients is within the 90% CI interval within the defined range (0.8-1.25) and that diabetes is not in itself a covariate that impacts on exposure from population PK analysis.  The efficacy of  patients with diabetes was also presented and although reduced compared with  non-diabetic  patients,  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  in  view  of  the  small  numbers  with diabetes.

In Study C0743T10 use of a filter was introduced after the study commenced and had the effect of reducing the delivered dose of ustekinumab. The MAH clarified that the filter was introduced as a precaution following identification of particulate matter in other lyophilised products (not ustekinumab). Notably this lyophilised product used in study C0743T10 is not the marketed product. Although the dose administered was less (63 mg instead of 90mg as a result of loss of product in the filter), the PK data was as expected from the dose administered and there were no safety or efficacy concerns.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The PK results were as expected and similar to the PK data from the initial MAA as the posology was the  same  in  the  2  pivotal  trials  in  PsA  and  the  patient  population  are  similar.  The  only  difference between the PsA subjects and the Ps subjects was that in some PsA subjects there was concomitant MTX treatment.  The MAH also provided extensive PD studies and separate report for these but there were no clear relationships with baseline disease or response to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the correlation of efficacy with serum levels of Stelara for outcome measures of PsA was not as clear as the correlation seen in the Ps programme at initial MAA (where much larger numbers of subjects were studied), throughout the PsA clinical trials efficacy was higher in the high dose groups. As exposure is less in those &gt;100kg and a 90mg dose in those &gt;100kg results in exposure similar to the 45mg dose in those &lt;100kg, it is expected that those &gt;100kg will benefit from the 90mg dose which is already licensed for Ps in those &gt;100kg.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

## Study C0743T10

Study  C0743T10  was  a  Phase  2,  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Trial  of CNTO 1275 (CNTO 1275 was the name for ustekinumab at the time of study C0743T10), in Subjects with  Active  Psoriatic  Arthritis  (EudraCT  No.:  2005-003525-92)  24  sites  in  the  US,  Canada,  Finland, Denmark, and Switzerland Studied Period: 21 Dec 2005/20 Sep 2007

The Phase 2 study, C0743T10, was conducted to establish proof of concept for ustekinumab in PsA and to aid in determining the doses and dose regimens to be evaluated in Phase 3. Subjects enrolled in C0743T10  were  required  to  have  active  PsA  despite  previous  or  current  treatment  with  diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

## Methods

This was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 arm study of CNTO 1275 90 mg in subjects with active PsA who had an inadequate response to current standard therapies (e.g., methotrexate [MTX], corticosteroids, NSAIDs, anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents).

## · Study participants

140 planned (70 subjects per group); 146 subjects were randomized to treatment and analysed for efficacy and for safety; 133 were analysed for pharmacokinetics and 124 were analysed for antibodies to CNTO 1275.

Men and women aged 18 years or older with active PsA (defined as disease for at least 6 months prior to  study  drug  administration)  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to  standard  disease  modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), and/or NSAID, and/or prior exposure to anti-TNF therapies.

DMARD  therapy  is  defined  as  taking  a  DMARD  for  at  least  3  months,  or  evidence  of  DMARD intolerance. Use of MTX at a dose ≤25 mg/week was allowed during the study but was not mandatory. Up to 25% of subjects may have had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents.

## · Treatments

90 mg CNTO 1275 (or 63 mg after filtration) was administered by SC injection. Subjects randomized to CNTO 1275 x 4 were to receive CNTO 1275 at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3. At Week 12, subjects randomized to placebo were to receive CNTO 1275 63 mg at Weeks 12 and 16.

Placebo was administered by SC injection. Subjects randomized to placebo were to receive placebo injections Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3. To maintain the blind, subjects randomized to CNTO 1275 x 4 were to receive placebo injections at Weeks 12 and 16.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first to last administration of study agent was 16 weeks; pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and antibodies to CNTO 1275 were evaluated through Week 36.

A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. At Week 0, 146 subjects were randomized to SC  injections  of  either  ustekinumab  90  mg  or  placebo  at  Weeks  0,  1,  2,  and  3.  Placebo  subjects crossed over to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC at Week 12 and Week 16. After the first 36 subjects were enrolled in the study, the implementation of a filtration procedure during study dose preparation resulted in a dose volume reduction to approximately 0.70 mL, equivalent to approximately 63 mg for all  subsequent  doses.  Fifty-nine  of  the  76  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  ustekinumab  and  57 subjects randomized to placebo were administered ustekinumab after the addition of the filtration step.

## · Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  CNTO  1275  in  the treatment of subjects with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

The secondary objectives were to evaluate:

- (1) The efficacy of CNTO 1275 in achieving a high level of improvement in arthritis.
- (2) The impact of CNTO 1275 on quality of life.
- (3) The efficacy of CNTO 1275 on psoriatic skin lesions.
- (4) The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of CNTO 1275 in subjects with PsA.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

-  Primary endpoint: the proportion of subjects with an American College of Rheumatology (ACR 20) response at Week 12;

- Major secondary endpoints:
- proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 50 response at Week 12
- proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 70 response at Week 12
- change from baseline in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) score at Week 12
- for  subjects  with  baseline  ≥3%  body  surface  area  (BSA)  psoriatic  involvement,  the  change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at Week 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- for subjects with baseline ≥3% BSA psoriatic involvement, the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 12

Analyses  of  the  primary  and  major  secondary  endpoints  were  stratified  by  subjects'  prior  anti-TNF exposure status.

Other  efficacy  assessments  included  assessments  of  dactylitis,  enthesopathy,  morning  stiffness, Disease Activity Index (DAS) 28, and target lesions assessments. In addition, the relationship between serum CNTO 1275 concentration and efficacy was examined, as well as between antibodies to CNTO 1275 and efficacy.

Blood samples were collected from all subjects at each visit through Week 36 for the determination of serum CNTO 1275 concentration over time and t1/2. Antibodies to CNTO 1275 were determined from serum samples collected at Weeks 0, 12, and 36. Biomarkers were assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 36.

## Statistical Methods

Simple descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, SD, interquartile range, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables were used to summarize most data. Analyses were adjusted for subjects' status of anti-TNF exposure. All statistical procedures were performed 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05. The study was designed to maintain a Type I error  of  0.05  or  less  for  the  primary  analysis.  Nominal  p-values  were  to  be  reported  for  secondary analyses.

## Results

## · Participant flow

A total of 287 subjects were screened and 146 subjects were randomized, 76 subjects to CNTO 1275 and 70 subjects to placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 2 Subject disposition through Week 36 for subjects randomized at Week 0

<!-- image -->

Through  Week  12,  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  discontinued  study  agent  in  the  placebo  group (18.6%) compared with the CNTO 1275 x 4 group (5.3%).

The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  study  agent  in  the  placebo  group  were  AEs  and unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  (4  [5.7%]  each).  No  subjects  in  the  CNTO  1275  x  4  group discontinued  study  agent  for  an  AE  of  worsening  PsA,  psoriasis,  or  PsA  and  psoriasis.  The  most common reason for discontinuation in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect for PsA only (2.6%).

## · Baseline data

Baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  the  study groups. The majority of subjects were men (56.2%) and Caucasian (94.5%). The median age was 49.0 years, and the median weight was 90.91 kg. The median duration of PsA was 5.22 years while the median duration  of  Ps  was  16.92  years.  The  total  median  numbers  of  swollen  and  tender  joints  at baseline  were  9.0  and  18.0,  respectively.  The  total  median  HAQ  disability  index  was  0.8  and  total median  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  was  0.5  mg/dL.  In  subjects  with ≥ 3%  body  surface  area  (BSA) involvement at baseline, the median PASI score was 8.70 and the median DLQI score was 10.5.

As the PsA population is at higher risk for comorbidity when compared with the general population and the study population had significant comorbidities in addition to PsA:

-  past  or  current  history  of  cigarette  smoking  was  reported  by  59.6%  of  subjects,  with  29.5%  still smoking at the start of study participation;
- hypertension was reported by 34.2% of subjects, with 30.1% requiring medication to control their hypertension;
- hyperlipidaemia was reported by 26.0% of subjects, with 17.1% requiring medication to control their hyperlipidaemia;
- depression was reported by 21.2% of subjects;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

·  diabetes  mellitus  was  reported  by  12.3%  of  subjects,  with  2.7%  requiring  insulin  to  control  their diabetes.

At baseline, 48.6% of subjects were using NSAIDs, 5.5% of subjects were taking COX-2 inhibitors, and 20.5% of subjects were using MTX. There were no subjects who were using oral corticosteroids.

## · Summary of results

## PK results

Of the 146 subjects with serum samples, 133 subjects received CNTO 1275 at least once during the study period and thus had evaluable serum CNTO 1275 concentrations. On days when study agent was administered, samples were taken immediately before the injection.

## Serum CNTO 1275 Concentrations Over Time

After receiving 4 weekly doses of CNTO 1275 (at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3), the median serum CNTO 1275 concentrations generally peaked at Week 4 (the first available sampling time point after Week 3) and then declined exponentially through Week 20

Figure 3 Median serum CNTO 1275 concentrations (micrograms/mL) through Week 36; treated subjects

<!-- image -->

Median serum CNTO 1275 concentrations were below the LLOQ at Week 24 in subjects who received 63 mg x 4 and subjects who received 90 mg x 4. At each sampling time point from Week 1 through Week 4, serum CNTO 1275 concentrations were higher in subjects who received 90 mg x 4 than in subjects who received 63 mg x 4, with the difference between the 2 dosages showing an approximate dose-proportionality.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the placebo → CNTO 1275 x 2 group, after receiving the second dose of CNTO 1275 at Week 16, median serum CNTO 1275 concentrations generally peaked at Week 20 (the first available sampling time  point  after  Week  16)  and  then  declined  exponentially  through  Week  28.  Median  serum  CNTO 1275 concentrations were below the LLOQ at Week 36.

Similar  terminal  elimination  phases,  in  terms  of  the  descending  slopes  of  the  median  serum concentration versus time curves, were observed in the placebo → CNTO 1275 x 2 and CNTO 1275 x 4 groups regardless of dose.

Compared with subjects not receiving MTX at baseline, no consistent trends towards higher or lower serum  CNTO  1275  levels  were  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  MTX  at  baseline,  suggesting  that concomitant administration of MTX had no impact on the systemic exposure of CNTO 1275. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of subjects receiving MTX at baseline

## Serum CNTO 1275 Half-life

CNTO 1275 was eliminated from the circulation with a similar median t1/2 in subjects who received 63 mg x 4 and subjects who received 90 mg x 4. The overall median t1/2 of CNTO 1275 was 22.4 days.

## Effect of ADA on PK

The number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to CNTO 1275 was low, and these subjects exhibited median serum levels of CNTO 1275 that trended lower than those in subjects either negative or undetectable for antibodies to CNTO 1275.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 4 Median serum CNTO 1275 concentration over time by antibody to CNTO 1275 status and treatment groups; treated subjects

<!-- image -->

Although interpretation of the impact of immunogenicity on CNTO 1275 serum concentration is limited by the small study population and the small number of subjects positive for antibodies to CNTO 1275, there is a trend for lower serum levels in those who are ADA positive. This is similar to the results in the initial MAA for plaque psoriasis.

## Pharmacodynamics

Assessments  of  serum  markers  previously  reported  to  be  associated  with  PsA  were  analysed  (see section 2.3.3). Overall, there were minimal changes (&lt; 10%) from baseline with no trend for change following treatment with CNTO 1275.

## Efficacy results

Primary Endpoint

-  ACR 20 Response at Week 12

The proportion of subjects who achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, ACR 20 response at Week 12, was significantly greater in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group compared with the placebo group (42.1% vs. 14.3%, p &lt; 0.001.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A per protocol analysis including subjects who received all 4 correct injections within 2 weeks of the scheduled visit dates was performed.  ACR 20 response at Week 12 was significantly greater in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group compared with the placebo group (45.7% vs. 16.9%, p &lt; 0.001).

Major Secondary Endpoints:

-  ACR 50 and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12

ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses at Week 12 were also compared. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group achieved an ACR 50 response and an ACR 70 response at Week 12 compared with the placebo group (25.0% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.004 and 10.5% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.005, respectively).

-  Change From Baseline in the HAQ Score at Week 12

The functional status of subjects was assessed using the Disability Index of the HAQ. The improvement from baseline in the HAQ score is calculated such that negative values indicate improvement (i.e., less disability)  and  positive  values  indicate  worsening  (i.e.,  more  disability).  Reductions  of  ≥  0.22  are considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ  disability  index  at  Week  12  was significantly greater in the CNTO 1275 X 4 group compared with the placebo group (median: -0.25 vs. 0.00, p &lt; 0.001).

-  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Response at Week 12

In  the  subset  of  subjects  with  psoriasis  involving  ≥  3%  BSA  at  baseline,  a  significantly  greater proportion of subjects in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group achieved a PASI 75 response compared with the placebo group (52.4% vs. 5.5%, p &lt; 0.001).

-  Change From Baseline in DLQI at Week 12

DLQI  scores  range  from  0  to  30,  with  lower  scores  indicating  better  quality  of  life.  A  change  from baseline is calculated such that negative values indicate improvement (i.e., better quality of life), and a decrease of 5 or more points from the baseline score (i.e., a change of -5) has been demonstrated to be clinically meaningful (Kimball et al, 2004).

At Week 12, among subjects with Ps involving ≥ 3% BSA at baseline, those in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group had a significantly greater decrease (improvement) in DLQI scores compared with those in the placebo group (median: 6.0 vs. 0.0, p &lt; 0.001).

## 2.4.2. Main studies

Study CNTO1275PSA3001 (A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebocontrolled Trial of Ustekinumab, a Fully Human Anti-IL-12/23p40 Monoclonal Antibody, Administered Subcutaneously, in Subjects with Active Psoriatic Arthritis.)

## Methods

The  CNTO1275PSA3001  (3001)  study  is  an  ongoing  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter 3-arm study (with early escape at Week 16) of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA. Approximately 600 subjects were planned to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo  SC  at  Weeks  0  and  4  followed  by  q12w  dosing  with  the  last  dose  at  Week  88.  Subjects randomized  to  placebo  were  to  crossover  to  receive  ustekinumab  at  Weeks  24  and  28  followed  by q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. Subjects will be followed for efficacy through Week 100 and for safety through Week 108.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All PK, efficacy, and safety data through Week 24 with the exception of the radiographic data for all randomized  subjects  were  included  in  this  DBL.  In  addition,  subject  disposition  and  safety  data (including laboratory data) through Week 52 for subjects randomized prior to 26 Oct 2010 who were supposed to have completed Week 52 visit by the time of the 24-week DBL (either terminated the study or completed through Week 52), and referred thereafter as 'the Week 52 safety subset', were also included. Radiographic data through Week 52 will be available in a subsequent DBL.

The expected duration of exposure to ustekinumab for randomized subjects is 100 weeks. Completion of the Week 108 visit will be considered the end of the study. Additional DBLs will occur at Week 52 and Week 108 with future reports planned to summarize the data through these time periods.

The Study Schema through Week 108 is presented in Figure 6

## Study participants

Subjects eligible for this study were men and women (excluding pregnant or nursing women, and men and women planning a pregnancy) aged 18 through 99 years who had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months prior to first study agent administration and who had active PsA despite current or previous DMARD and/or NSAID therapy. Diagnosis of PsA must have included the diagnosis of active arthritis as defined by 5 or more swollen joints and 5 or more tender joints at screening and at baseline and high sensitivity  CRP ≥ 0.3  mg/dL  (decreased  from ≥ 0.6  mg/dL  per  Amendment  3;  upper  limit  of  normal [ULN]  1.0  mg/dL)  at  screening,  and  the  presence  of  active  plaque  psoriasis  (Ps)  or  a  documented history of Ps. As per study design, subjects were to be naïve with respect to anti-TNF therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition,  subjects  must  have  had  at  least  1  of  the  following  PsA  subtypes:  DIP  joint  arthritis, polyarticular arthritis with the absence  of rheumatoid  nodules,  arthritis  mutilans,  asymmetric peripheral arthritis, or spondylitis with peripheral arthritis.

Subjects were eligible to participate if they had no evidence of active TB and no history of past latent TB. Subjects with latent TB newly detected at screening were eligible if they were started on treatment for  latent  TB  prior  to  or  simultaneously  with  first  study  agent  administration.  The  study  design excluded  subjects  with  other  inflammatory  diseases  that  could  confound  the  evaluations  of  benefit from ustekinumab therapy. Subjects who previously had been treated with anti-TNF therapy, received systemic immunosuppressives, or DMARDs other than methotrexate (MTX) within 4 weeks prior to the first  study  dose,  were  to  be  excluded  from  participation.  Subjects  who  had  received  other  specific drugs as outlined in the protocol were also excluded. Subjects who had used or were currently on a stable dose of MTX, NSAIDs, or oral corticosteroids were eligible for enrolment in the study. Subjects who had received topical or systemic Ps treatments as outlined in the protocol within the first 2 or 4 weeks of administration of study agent were excluded from participation in the study.

## Treatments

Prior to the first injection, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows:

Ustekinumab 45 mg (n=205): Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.

Ustekinumab 90 mg (n=204) : Ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.

Placebo  (n=206): Placebo  at  Weeks  0,  4,  16,  and  20.  At  Weeks  24  and  28,  subjects  received ustekinumab 45 mg followed by q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88.

At Week 16, subjects with &lt;5% improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts were eligible to enter early escape in a double-blind fashion as follows:

Ustekinumab 45 mg: Ustekinumab 90 mg at Week 16, followed by 90 mg q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.

Ustekinumab 90 mg: The same dosage schedule was to be continued.

Placebo: Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 16, 20, and 28, followed by 45 mg q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. At Week 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.

An additional dose was administered in the early escape arm because of operational reasons and the timing  of  placebo/active  doses  in  the  arms.  The  efficacy  results  from  the  early  escape  arm  were descriptive only and not part of the formal comparisons between the treatment arms.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this study CNTO1275PSA3001 were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in subjects with active PsA by assessing the reduction in signs and symptoms of PsA and to evaluate the safety of ustekinumab in this population.

The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in:

- Improving physical function;
- Improving psoriatic skin lesions; and
- Inhibiting the progression of structural damage (this will be addressed in a future report).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The data on radiographic scores is not yet available. Regarding the efficacy of ustekinumab in reducing the rate of progression of structural damage in PsA, this will be established based on radiographic data collected  from  Phase  3  studies  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002.  A  meta-analysis  has recently been performed and a separate report is currently being prepared for inclusion in a variation submission, planned for later in 2013, in support of a STELARA PsA claim for structural damage.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 24.

Major secondary endpoints in the order of statistical testing were:

-  The change from baseline in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) score at Week 24;
- The proportion of subjects (with baseline ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] psoriatic involvement) who achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 24;
- The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24;
- The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 responses at Week 24;
-  The  change  from  baseline  in  total  radiographic  scores  of  the  hands  and  feet  at  Week  24  (to  be summarized in a later report).

Multiple  additional  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  including  Das28  response,  dactylitis,  enthesitis and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI).

The schedule of assessment is shown in the table below.

## Sample size

The study was powered to detect significant treatment differences in reducing the signs and symptoms of arthritis. With 600 subjects (200 subjects in each treatment group), assuming 50% MTX usage at baseline,  a  simulation  of  5,000  repetitions  was  used  to  calculate  the  power  to  detect  a  significant difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  ACR  20  response  using  a  CMH  test  with stratification by subjects' baseline MTX usage (yes/no). The study had over 99% power to detect the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment differences (α=0.05) in ACR 20 response for at least one ustekinumab group compared with the placebo group assuming the effect size of 20% to 25% for subjects not receiving MTX and 25% to 30% for subjects receiving MTX in achieving ACR 20 at Week 24. These assumptions were based on the data from the ustekinumab Phase 2 PsA study, C0743T10.

## Randomisation

The randomization was stratified by investigational site, baseline weight (≤100 kg or &gt;100 kg), and baseline MTX usage (yes/no) since these three factors could potentially affect the outcome measures. The randomization method was minimization with a biased-coin assignment in a 1:1:1 ratio, resulting in approximately 200 subjects to each group. This randomization method was chosen since some of the study sites may only enrol a few subjects and it would be difficult to ensure balanced treatment assignments within each combination of site stratum, weight stratum and baseline MTX stratum using a  traditional  block  randomization.  The  randomization  using  the  minimization  with  a  biased  coin assignment minimizes the imbalance in the distribution of the number of subjects across treatment groups within the levels of each individual stratification factor.

## Blinding (masking)

At the Week 24 database lock, the data was unblinded for analysis while subjects are still participating in the study. Identification of sponsor personnel who had access to the unblinded subject-level data was  documented  prior  to  unblinding.  Investigative  study  sites  and  subjects  remained  blinded  to treatment  assignment  until  the  last  subject  enrolled  completed  the  Week  108  evaluations  for CNTO1275PSA3001 and the Week 60 evaluations for CNTO275PSA3002 and the respective database was locked for each study. Data that could potentially unblind the treatment assignment (i.e., study agent serum concentrations, antibodies to study agent, treatment allocation) was handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind was maintained and the potential for bias was minimized. This could include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding.

## Statistical methods

All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed at α=0.05.

The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  all  randomized  subjects  according  to  their  assigned  treatment groups regardless of the actual treatment received.

The proportion of subjects with ACR 20 response at Week 24 was compared between the combined ustekinumab group (45 mg group and 90 mg group combined), each individual dose group and the placebo  group.  The  re-randomization  test  was  used  as  the  primary  statistical  testing  method  to determine  the  p-values  for  these  comparisons.  In  addition,  a  CMH  test,  stratified  by  baseline  MTX usage (yes/no), was also performed for these comparisons as a sensitivity analysis.

To maintain a Type I error rate of 0.05, the pairwise comparisons between each dose group and the placebo  group  were  performed  after  the  combined  group  showed  a  significant  treatment  effect compared with the placebo group at a significance level of 0.05.

To  control  for  multiplicity  for  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  and  the  major  secondary  endpoint analyses, the 5 major secondary analyses listed below were performed sequentially contingent upon the  success  of  the  primary  statistical  analysis.  That  is,  for  each  endpoint,  the  test  between  the combined ustekinumab group and the placebo group was performed first. If that test was significant at the  0.05  level,  then  the  pairwise  comparison  between  each  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  was performed. If at least one dose group comparison with placebo was significant at the 0.05 level, then the  test  for  the  next  endpoint  could  be  performed.  Otherwise,  the  p-values  for  the  subsequent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endpoints  would  be  considered  nominal.  The  following  prespecified  order  was  used  to  analyse  the major secondary endpoints:

1. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score at Week 24
2. The proportion of subjects (with baseline ≥3% BSA psoriatic involvement) who achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 24
3. The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24
4. The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 response at Week 24
5. The change from baseline in total radiographic scores of the hands and feet at Week 24 based on the pooled data from CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002, which are not available yet and will be summarized in a separate report after the Week 52 DBL.

Nominal  p-values  were  reported  for  all  other  endpoints.  The  ordering  of  the  secondary  endpoints prevents any problems of error inflation caused by testing multiple endpoints.

## Recruitment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  population  comprised  615  randomized  subjects  in  104  sites.  Sites  were  located  in  14 countries: Austria (3 sites), Australia (5 sites), Canada (19 sites), Finland (3 sites), Germany (6 sites), Hungary (6 sites), Latvia (2 sites), Lithuania (4 sites), New Zealand (4 sites), Poland (8 sites), Russia (12 sites), Spain (3 sites), United Kingdom (6 sites) and the United States (23 sites).

The majority of the subjects were enrolled in Europe (64.6%) followed by North America (28.5%) and Asia-Pacific  (7.0%)  which  includes  subjects  from  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  Consent  was  obtained from the first  subject  on  30  Nov  2009.  The  last  study-related  procedure  for  the  24-Week  CSR  was performed 27 Oct 2011.

## Conduct of the study

There were four amendments to the protocol. The first amendment was on 16 Oct 2009, the second was on 30 Apr 2010, the third was on 27 Oct 2010 and the fourth was on 16 Feb 2012.

## Baseline data

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups and indicative of  the  protocol-defined  population  of  subjects  with  active  PsA.  The  majority  of  randomized  subjects were men (53.7%) and the median subject age was 48 years. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian (96.6%). Subjects' median weight was 86.0 kg and median body mass index (BMI) was 29.7 kg/m 2 .

The  most  prevalent  PsA  subtype  was  polyarticular  arthritis  with  no  rheumatoid  arthritis  (37.9%  of subjects). As commonly observed in the PsA population, the median duration of Ps (13.2 years) was substantially greater than the median duration of PsA (4.03 years).

The majority of subjects (71.5%) had at least 3% BSA involved by Ps, a median percent of BSA skin involvement of 11.0% and the median PASI score was 8.0, indicative of a study population with active Ps.

The included population had moderate to severe disease with a median numbers of swollen and tender joints  of  10.0  and  20.0,  respectively,  a  median  HAQ-DI  score  of  1.25,  and  a  median  CRP  of  10.30 mg/L.

While using the DAS28 score may be problematic in PsA with oligoarticular disease or where the lower limbs are predominantly involved, it is clear that the median DAS28 score was high.

The mean BASDAI score was &gt;6/10 for those with spondylitis. 48.1% of subjects had dactylitis with a median  score  of  4.0  and  71.7%  of  subjects  had  enthesitis  with  a  median  score  of  4.0.  The  high proportions of subjects with dactylitis/enthesitis/skin disease and to a lesser extent spondylitis, allow assessment of efficacy across the many domains of psoriatic arthritis.

Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  (48.1%)  were  taking  MTX  at  baseline  at  a  median  dose  of  15.0 mg/week.  At  baseline,  15.6%  of  subjects  were  taking  oral  corticosteroids  at  median  doses  of  5.0 mg/day. The majority of  the subjects (74.5%) were taking NSAIDs at baseline and the majority of subjects (79.5%) had prior DMARD experience. Subjects were naïve with respect to anti-TNF therapy.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis

## ACR 20 Response at Week 24

At Week 24, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab, 45 mg, and 90 mg  groups  (46.0%,  42.4%,  49.5%,  respectively)  achieved  an  ACR  20  response  compared  with subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (22.8%).  Both  p-values  by  either  the  re-randomization  test  (primary analysis)  or  the  CMH  test  (sensitivity  analysis)  were  significant  (p&lt;0.001,  Table  2).  A  numerically higher  ACR  20  response  at  Week  24  was  observed  in  the  90  mg  group  compared  with  the  45  mg group.

The primary endpoint was clearly met and was clinically and statistically significant.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary endpoint and to assess the impact  of  missing  data.  All  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  showed  results  similar  to  the  main  analysis results, confirming efficacy and demonstrating that the conclusions were robust and not impacted by the data handling rules for missing data.

Benefit  in  terms  of  ACR  20  response  at  week  24  was  observed  in  both  subjects  receiving  MTX  at baseline (26.0%, 43.4%, and 45.5% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively), and not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (20.0%,  41.5%,  and  53.4%  in  the  placebo,  45  mg,  and  90  mg  groups, respectively).

## Major Secondary Endpoint Analyses

## Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Week 24

There was significantly greater improvement in HAQ-DI scores at Week 24 in subjects in the combined ustekinumab and ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (all with a median change from baseline of 0.25) compared with subjects in the placebo group (median of 0.00) by either the re-randomization test or the test of analysis on the van der Waerden normal scores (sensitivity analysis) (p&lt;0.001). The mean improvement in HAQ-DI score at Week 24 was numerically higher in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.

## PASI 75 Response at Week 24

In the combined, 45 mg, and 90 mg ustekinumab groups, 59.9%, 57.2%, and 62.4%, respectively, achieved a PASI 75 response compared with subjects in the placebo group (11.0%). Both p-values by either the re-randomization or CMH chi-square test (sensitivity analysis) were significant (p &lt;0.001). A numerically higher PASI 75 response at Week 24 was observed in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.

## ACR 50 and ACR 70 Response at Week 24

At Week 24, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab group and in each of the individual ustekinumab groups achieved either an ACR 50 or ACR 70 response compared with the placebo group. Both p-values by either the re-randomization test or the CMH chi-square test (sensitivity analysis) were significant and consistent with the primary endpoint (&lt;0.001). Numerically higher ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses at Week 24 were observed in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.

The primary and all major secondary endpoints were met and demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant evidence of efficacy. This held for those on and those not on concomitant MTX. For most endpoints efficacy trended higher for the 90mg dose.

## Other Secondary Endpoints

Other secondary analysis included the following:

## ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12

At Week 12, there was a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups who achieved an ACR 20 and ACR 50 response compared with subjects in the placebo group. There was a significantly greater proportion of subjects with an ACR 70 response in the combined ustekinumab and 90 mg groups (p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively) but not in the 45 mg group (p=0.127) compared with the placebo group.

## ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 Responses Over Time by MTX Use at Baseline

Randomization was stratified by baseline MTX use. Similar number of subjects were on baseline MTX (n=200) to those not on baseline MTX (n=209). Within each MTX stratum, higher ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses were consistently observed over time in the ustekinumab groups than in the placebo group. In general, the trends observed for onset of response and timing of the maximum response within each MTX stratum were similar to those observed in the overall population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A treatment effect was noted whether patients are on concomitant MTX or not, although the treatment effect is larger for those not on MTX. All efficacy results other than ACR20 in the 45 mg group trend to slightly  higher  values  in  those  not  on  concomitant  MTX.  However  efficacy  is  clearly  demonstrated regardless of MTX usage and the addition of ustekinumab to those on MTX therapy increases efficacy.

## ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 Responses by Weight

Randomization was stratified by baseline weight (≤100 kg vs. &gt;100kg). There were approximately 3 times as many subjects in the ≤100 kg group (n=307) as in the &gt;100 kg group (n=102). ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses were summarized over time by weight (≤100kg and &gt;100kg). In general, similar trends as the overall population were observed in terms of onset of action and timing of the maximum response within each weight stratum. Across all treatment groups, ACR responses generally trended higher for subjects in the ≤ 100 kg group especially for ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses.

The  trend  for  higher  efficacy  with  the  90mg  dose  for  both  weight  strata  and  for  higher  efficacy  in patients &lt;100kg is consistent with the data provided for Ps and also with the PK data.

## DAS28 Response Measurements

As  early  as  Week  4,  there  was  a  notable  difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  DAS28 response in the ustekinumab groups and the placebo group (44.5% in the 90 mg group and 42.9% in the 45 mg group achieved a DAS28 response compared with the 18.6% in the placebo group).

The proportion of subjects achieving a DAS28 response was significantly higher in both ustekinumab dose  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  both  Week  12  and  at  Week  24  (p&lt;0.001  for  all comparisons). At Week 24, the proportion of subjects achieving a DAS28 response was 66.7% in the combined ustekinumab group, 65.9% in the 45 mg group, and 67.6% in the 90 mg group compared with 34.5% in the placebo group.

## DAS28 Remission Over Time

DAS28 remission generally trended upward over time. DAS28 remission was achieved by a significantly greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  individual  ustekinumab treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  12  and  Week  24  (p&lt;0.001  for  all comparisons  except  for  p=0.002  for  90  mg  at  Week  12).  At  Week  24,  the  proportion  of  subjects achieving  DAS28  remission  was  20.0%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group,  20.5%  in  the  45  mg group, and 19.6% in the 90 mg group compared with 8.3% in the placebo group.

## Dactylitis at Week 24

At  baseline,  approximately  half  the  subjects  randomized  (48.1%)  reported  at  least  1  digit  with dactylitis. At Week 24, among the subjects with dactylitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with 1 or  more  digits  with  dactylitis  was  significantly  lower  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (56.2%, p=0.001), in the 45 mg group (56.6%, p=0.005), and in the 90 mg (55.8%, p=0.004) compared with the placebo group (76.1%).

## Enthesitis at Week 24

At baseline, 71.7% of the subjects randomized reported enthesitis. At Week 24, among the subjects with enthesitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with enthesitis was statistically significantly lower in the combined ustekinumab group (64.6%, p&lt;0.001), in the 45 mg group (68.6%, p=0.018), and in the 90 mg (60.8%, p&lt;0.001) compared with the placebo group (81.0%).

## Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index

At  Week  12,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  achieved  at  least  a  50%  improvement  in BASDAI in the combined ustekinumab group and in the 45 mg group, but not in the 90 mg group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared with the placebo group. At Week 24, a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieved at least a 50% improvement in BASDAI in the combined ustekinumab group (27.9%, p=0.023) and the 90 mg group (31.7%, p=0.014), but not in the 45 mg group (23.5%, p=0.133) compared with the placebo group (13.1%).

At both Week 12 and Week 24, a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieved at least a 70% improvement  from  baseline  in  BASDAI  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  each  of  the ustekinumab dose group as compared with the placebo group. At Week 24, the proportion of subjects achieving  at  least  a  70%  improvement  in  BASDAI  was  14.4%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group (p=0.002), 13.7% in the 45 mg group (p=0.003), and 15.0% in the 90 mg group (p=0.002) compared with 0% in the placebo group.

A small number of subjects showed at least 90% improvement in the 90 mg group (3/59 at Week 12 and 4/60 Week 24) while no subjects in either the 45 mg group or the placebo group achieved this level of improvement at either week.

## Impact of Ustekinumab on Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)

The  impact  of  ustekinumab  on  DLQI  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  change  in  DLQI  scores  from baseline for those subjects with ≥ 3% BSA at baseline. At Week 16 and Week 24, there was a significant improvement  from  baseline  in  DLQI  score  in  both  ustekinumab  dose  groups  as  compared  with  the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). At Week 24, the median change from baseline in DLQI score was -6.00 in both ustekinumab dose groups compared with -1.00 in the placebo group.

## Change From Baseline in SF-36 PCS and MCS at Week 16 and Week 24

At Week 16 and Week 24, the change from baseline in the SF-36 PCS scores was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group and in each of the individual ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group (p&lt;0.001).

At Week 16 and Week 24, the proportion of subjects that achieved a clinically meaningful improvement (≥5 from baseline in SF-36 PCS score), was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group and in each of the individual ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group.

At Week 16 and Week 24, the change from baseline in the SF-36 MCS scores was significantly greater in the ustekinumab 90 mg group compared with the placebo group (p=0.018 at Week 16 and p&lt;0.001 at  Week  24).  However,  the  comparison  between  the  45  mg  group  and  the  placebo  group  was significantly greater (p=0.005) at Week 16, but not at Week 24 (p=0.065).

## Ancillary analyses

## Subgroups Defined by Demographics

The  study  largely  enrolled  Caucasians  and  therefore  cannot  meaningfully  assess  the  ustekinumab effect on other races. For subgroups by age, gender, BMI and geographic regions, across both doses as well  as  in  the  combined  dose  group  versus  the  placebo  group,  consistent  and  significant  treatment effect  determined  by  ACR  20  at  Week  24  has  been  observed  across  different  subgroups  with  the exception  of  subjects  with  normal  BMI  and  subjects  from  Asian  Pacific  region  (New  Zealand  and Australia).  The  treatment  effect  for  both  doses  and  combined  group  versus  placebo  was  smaller  in subjects with normal BMI, in part due to higher placebo response rate (31.1%). The small sample size for subjects from Asian Pacific region limits the interpretation.

## Efficacy Responses by Subject Weight

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Randomization was stratified by baseline weight (≤100kg versus &gt;100kg). There were approximately 3 times as many subjects in the ≤100 kg group (n=461) as in the &gt;100 kg group (n=154).

Within each weight stratum, consistently higher ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses were observed over time in the ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group. Across all treatment groups, ACR responses generally trended higher for subjects in the ≤ 100 kg group compared with subjects in the  &gt;100  kg  group,  especially  for  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  responses.  At  Week  16  (trough  serum ustekinumab concentrations), the proportion of subjects with an ACR 20 response in the ustekinumab 45  mg  dose  group  decreased  in  both  weight  strata.  This  dip  was  not  observed  in  the  90  mg  dose group.

## Efficacy in Subjects by Prior DMARD Use

At  baseline,  79.5%  of  subjects  had  prior  DMARDs  exposure.  DMARD-naïve  subjects  had  a  larger treatment effect compared to subjects with previous DMARD experience.

## Efficacy in Subjects with Prior DMARD Use

For subjects with prior DMARD use, the primary endpoint (ACR 20 at Week 24) was consistent with the overall population. All major secondary endpoints (ACR 50 and ACR 70, PASI 75, and HAQ-DI) were also consistent with the overall population.

## Efficacy and Antibodies to Ustekinumab

Subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab (6.2%) tended to have lower clinical efficacy when compared with subjects who were negative for antibodies to ustekinumab. However, antibody positivity to ustekinumab did not preclude a clinical response.

The limited number of subjects positive for antibodies to ustekinumab precludes a definitive conclusion on the impact of antibody on efficacy.

A lower effect but still a response is seen in those with ADA positivity as in the original plaque psoriasis programme.

Study  CNTO1275PSA3002  (A  Phase  3  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebocontrolled  trial  of  Ustekinumab,  a  Fully  Human  Anti-IL-12/23p40  Monoclonal  Antibody, Administered  Subcutaneously,  in  Subjects  With  Active  Psoriatic  Arthritis  Including  Those Previously Treated With Biologic Anti-TNFα Agent(s))

Study  CNTO1275PSA3002  was  the  second  phase  3  trial  presented  in  support  of  the  indication  of psoriatic arthritis.

## Methods

The  CNTO1275PSA3002  (3002)  study  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel, multicenter, 3-arm study (with early escape at Week 16) of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA including those previously treated with biologic anti-TNF agent(s) (February 2010-March 2012). Approximately 300 subjects were planned to receive treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo SC at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by q12w doses with the last dose at Week 40. Subjects randomized to placebo were to cross over to receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by q12w doses with the last  dose  at  Week  40.  Subjects  were  to  be  followed  for  efficacy  through  Week  52  and  for  safety through Week 60. This report summarizes data included in the 24-week database lock (DBL); all PK, efficacy,  and  safety  data  through  Week  24,  with  the  exception  of  the  radiographic  data,  for  all randomized subjects were included in this DBL. Radiographic data through Week 52 will be available in a subsequent DBL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The expected duration of exposure to ustekinumab for enrolled subjects is 52 weeks.

Completion of the Week 60 visit will be considered the end of the study. An additional DBL will occur at Week 60, with a future report planned to summarize the data through that time period.

The  study  schema  through  Week  60  is  presented  in  Figure  8.  The  study  schema  for  study  3002  is similar to study 3001 except that it is shorter, has fewer subjects and also includes subjects with prior anti-TNF exposure.

At  least  150  but  not  more  than  180  subjects  could  have  been  previously  treated  with  1  or  more biologic anti-TNF agents. Subjects previously treated with anti-TNF agents must have received at least 8 weeks of therapy with etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, or certolizumab pegol, or at least 14 weeks of therapy with infliximab; or have documented intolerance to anti-TNF therapy for a shorter period of time. Additionally, subjects who were previously treated with anti-TNF agents and who had a history of latent TB were permitted to enrol in the study with adequate documentation about having completed appropriate treatment for latent TB within 3 years before the first administration of study agent (subjects who were anti-TNF naive were not eligible to participate if they had a previous history of latent TB).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Section  4  of  the  protocol  contains  the  complete  list  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  as  well  as prohibitions and restrictions to which subjects were required to adhere during the course of this study.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 groups and received treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo SC at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by q12w dosing, with the last dose at Week 40. Subjects randomized to placebo were eligible for crossover to receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by q12w dosing, with the last dose at Week 40.

## Objectives

The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ustekinumab  in  subjects  with active  PsA,  including  those  previously  treated  with  biologic  anti-TNF  agent(s),  by  assessing  the reduction in signs and symptoms of PsA and to evaluate the safety of ustekinumab in this population.

The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in:

-  Improving physical function;
-  Improving psoriatic skin lesions; and
-  Inhibiting  the  progression  of  structural  damage  (this  objective  will  be  addressed  in  a  future report)

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24

Major secondary endpoints and other secondary analyses were the same as for study CNTO1275PSA3001 with the additional endpoint of assessing Impact of Prior Anti-TNF Exposure on Efficacy outcomes (ACR), HAQ-DI and PASI.

## Sample size

The study was powered to detect significant treatment differences in reducing the signs and symptoms of arthritis. With 300 subjects (100 subjects in each treatment group), assuming 60% MTX usage at baseline,  a  simulation  of  5,000  repetitions  was  used  to  calculate  the  power  to  detect  a  significant difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  ACR  20  response  using  a  CMH  test  with stratification by subjects' baseline MTX usage (yes/no). The study had over 99% power to detect the treatment differences (α=0.05) in ACR 20 response for at least one ustekinumab group compared with the placebo group, assuming an effect size of 20% to 25% for subjects not receiving MTX and 25% to 30% for subjects receiving MTX, in achieving ACR 20 at Week 24. These assumptions were based on the data from the ustekinumab Phase 2 PsA study, C0743T10.

## Randomisation

Randomization  was  stratified  by  investigational  site,  baseline  weight  (≤100  kg  or  &gt;100  kg),  and baseline methotrexate (MTX) usage (yes/no) because these factors could have potentially affected the outcome  measures.  The  randomization  method  was  minimization  with  a  biased-coin  assignment (Pocock and Simon, 1975)23 in a 1:1:1 ratio, resulting in approximately 100 subjects in each group. This randomization method was chosen because some study sites might enrol only a few subjects and it would have been difficult to ensure balanced treatment assignments within each combination of site stratum,  weight  stratum,  and  baseline  MTX  stratum  using  a  traditional  block  randomization.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomization  using  minimization  with  a  biased-coin  assignment  minimizes  the  imbalance  in  the distribution  of  the  number  of  subjects  across  treatment  groups  within  the  levels  of  each  individual stratification factor. The measure used to calculate lack of balance in the minimization algorithm was the variance.

## Blinding (masking)

Blinding was as per Study CNTO1275PSA3001

## Statistical methods

All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed at α=0.05.

The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  all  randomized  subjects  according  to  their  assigned  treatment groups regardless of the actual treatment received.

The proportion of subjects with ACR 20 response at Week 24 was compared between the combined ustekinumab group (45 mg group and 90 mg group combined), each individual dose group and the placebo  group.  The  re-randomization  test  was  used  as  the  primary  statistical  testing  method  to determine  the  p-values  for  these  comparisons.  In  addition,  a  CMH  test,  stratified  by  baseline  MTX usage (yes/no), was also performed for these comparisons as a sensitivity analysis.

To maintain a Type I error rate of 0.05, the pairwise comparisons between each dose group and the placebo  group  were  performed  after  the  combined  group  showed  a  significant  treatment  effect compared with the placebo group at a significance level of 0.05.

To  control  for  multiplicity  for  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  and  the  major  secondary  endpoint analyses, the 5 major secondary analyses listed below were performed sequentially contingent upon the  success  of  the  primary  statistical  analysis.  That  is,  for  each  endpoint,  the  test  between  the combined ustekinumab group and the placebo group was performed first. If that test was significant at the  0.05  level,  then  the  pairwise  comparison  between  each  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  was performed. If at least one dose group comparison with placebo was significant at the 0.05 level, then the  test  for  the  next  endpoint  could  be  performed.  Otherwise,  the  p-values  for  the  subsequent endpoints  would  be  considered  nominal.  The  following  prespecified  order  was  used  to  analyse  the major secondary endpoints:

1. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score at Week 24

2. The proportion of subjects (with baseline ≥3% BSA psoriatic involvement) who achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 24

3. The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24

4. The change from baseline in total radiographic scores of the hands and feet at Week 24 based on the pooled data from CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002, which are not available yet and will be summarized in a separate report after the Week 52 DBL.

5. The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 response at Week 24

Nominal p-values were reported for all other endpoints.

The ordering of the secondary endpoints prevents any problems of error inflation caused by testing multiple endpoints.

Data handling rules and sensitivity analyses are as for study CNTO1275PSA3001

## Recruitment

The  study  was  conducted  at  71  sites  in  Europe  and  North  America.  Of  the  597  subjects  who  were screened,  312  subjects  were  randomized  into  the  study:  168  in  Europe  (53.8%)  and  144  in  North America  (46.2%).  Sites  were  located  in  10  countries:  Austria  (2  sites),  France  (4),  Germany  (6), Hungary (3), Poland (5), Russia (3), Sweden (4), the United Kingdom (9), Canada (11), and the United States (24)

## Conduct of the study

There were 4 amendments to the protocol, similar to those for Study CNTO1275PSA3001. The first amendment on 19 Oct 2009, the second on 30th  Apr 2010, the third amendment on 27 Oct 2010 and fourth amendment on 13 Apr 2012.

## Concomitant Therapy

Every  effort  was  to  be  made  to  keep  subjects  on  a  stable  concomitant  medication  regimen  (MTX, corticosteroids, and/or NSAIDs and other analgesics) through Week 52. The investigator was permitted to reduce or temporarily discontinue the concomitant medication dose because of abnormal laboratory values, side effects, concurrent illness, or the performance of a surgical procedure, but the change and reason for the medication was to be clearly documented in the subject's medical record.

## Baseline data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Demographic characteristics of subjects at baseline were similar across treatment groups. Approximately half of randomized subjects were women (52.6%) and the median subject age was 49 years.  Subjects  were  predominantly  Caucasian  (98.4%).  Subjects'  median  weight  was  88.3  kg  and median BMI was 30.3 kg/m 2 .

The  baseline  PsA  disease  characteristics  for  the  ACR  core  set  of  outcome  measurements  were indicative of subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and were generally comparable across the treatment groups, with median numbers of swollen and tender joints of 11.0 and 22.0, respectively, in the overall study population. Median VAS of patient's assessment of pain was 6.80; median VAS of patient's global assessment of disease activity was 6.20; median VAS of physician's global assessment of disease activity was 7.10; median HAQ-DI score was 1.25; and median CRP level was 9.32 mg/L.

Baseline disease characteristics of psoriasis measurements for subjects with ≥3% body surface area (BSA) involvement with psoriasis were generally comparable across the treatment groups and were indicative of significant psoriatic skin involvement with a substantial negative impact on health- related quality  of  life  (HRQoL):  median  percentage  of  BSA  psoriasis  skin  involvement,  12%;  median  PASI score, 8.30; and median DLQI score, 11.00.

Of the 312 randomized subjects, 180 (57.7%) had prior anti-TNFα exposure and 132 (42.3%) were anti-TNFα naive.

At baseline, 157 (50.3%) subjects were receiving MTX and 155 (49.7%) subjects were not receiving MTX.

Through Week 24, subjects who were randomly assigned to ustekinumab received a median dose of 180  mg.  Subjects  randomized  to  placebo  who  entered  early  escape  received  approximately  2 ustekinumab  injections,  while  subjects  randomized  to  ustekinumab  received  an  average  of  3 ustekinumab injections.

## Numbers analysed

Of  the  312  subjects  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  at  Week  0,  104  were  assigned  to  the  placebo group, 103 to the ustekinumab 45 mg group, and 105 to the ustekinumab 90 mg group.

At Week 16, 73 subjects met early escape criteria: 31 (29.8%) subjects in the placebo group entered early escape and received ustekinumab 45 mg; 20 (19.4%) subjects in the ustekinumab 45 mg group entered early escape and received ustekinumab 90 mg; and 22 (21.2%) subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg group entered early escape and continued on the same dose regimen. Most discontinuations occurred at or before Week 12, well before the reported peak effect at Weeks 20 or 24.

## Discontinuation of Study Agent Through Week 24

A total of 41 (13.1%) subjects discontinued across the randomized treatment groups, with a higher rate of discontinuation in the placebo group (23.1%) than in the ustekinumab 45 mg (5.8%) or 90 mg (10.5%) groups.

## Discontinuation of Study Agent for Subjects With Prior Anti-TNF Exposure

Among subjects with prior anti-TNF exposure (n=180), rates of discontinuation were higher through Week  16  and  Week  24  compared  with  the  overall  population,  driven  by  the  higher  proportion  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  who  discontinued  in  the  placebo  group:  22.6%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  compared with 3.3% and 8.6% in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups, respectively, through Week 16, and  30.6%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  5.0%  and  10.3%  of  subjects  in  the ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups,  respectively,  through  Week  24.  Similar  to  the  overall population,  the  difference  between  the  placebo  group  and  the  ustekinumab  groups  was  primarily driven by the higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group who discontinued for efficacy-related reasons (i.e., lack of efficacy and worsening of PsA and/or Ps).

## Termination of Study Participation

Through  Week  24,  33  (10.6%)  randomized  subjects  terminated  their  study  participation.  The  most common reason  for  termination  was  withdrawal  of  consent,  in  13  (12.5%)  subjects  in  the  placebo group and 12 subjects (5.8%) in the combined ustekinumab group.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis

## ACR 20 Response at Week 24

At  Week 24, a statistically  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab group and in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups achieved an ACR 20 response (43.8%, 43.7%, and 43.8%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group (20.2%; each p&lt;0.001), with no evidence of dose response.

The primary endpoint was clearly met and was clinically and statistically significant.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary endpoint and to assess the impact  of  missing  data.  All  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  showed  results  similar  to  the  main  analysis results, confirming efficacy demonstrating that the conclusions were robust and not impacted by the data handling rules for missing data.

Benefit  in  terms  of  ACR  20  response  at  week  24  was  observed  in  both  subjects  receiving  MTX  at baseline (28.6%, 50.0%, and 40.4% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively), and not receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (12.7%,  36.7%,  and  47.2%  in  the  placebo,  45  mg,  and  90  mg  groups, respectively.

## Major Secondary Endpoint Analyses

## Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Week 24

At Week 24, the improvement from baseline in HAQ-DI score was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (median change from baseline of -0.25, -0.13, and -0.25, respectively) compared with the placebo group (median improvement of 0.00; all p ≤ 0.002), based on the re-randomization test [secondary analysis] or the test of analysis of covariance on the van der Waerden normal scores [sensitivity analysis])).

## PASI 75 Response at Week 24

At Week 24, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 3% BSA Ps involvement at baseline who achieved a PASI 75 response was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (53.4%, 51.3%, and 55.6%, respectively; all p&lt;0.001) compared with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

placebo group (5.0%). A numerically higher PASI 75 response at Week 24 was observed in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.

Two  additional  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  assess  the  impact  of  missing  data  on  this endpoint. Both sensitivity analyses showed results similar to the main analysis, demonstrating that the main analysis results were robust and not impacted by the data-handling rules for the missing data.

## ACR 50 and ACR 70 Response at Week 24

At  Week  24,  a  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  achieved  an  ACR  50  response  in  the ustekinumab  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Numerically  higher  ACR  50  responses  were observed at Week 24 in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.

The proportion of subjects who achieved an  ACR 70 response at Week 24 was numerically but not significantly higher in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (7.7%, 6.8%, and 8.6 %, respectively) compared with the placebo group (2.9%).

## Other Secondary Endpoints

Other secondary analysis included the following:

## ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12

The  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  ACR  responses  at  Week  12  in  the  combined  ustekinumab group (and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups) versus the placebo group was as follows:

- ACR 20: 36.6% (39.6%, 33.7%) versus 17.5%
- ACR 50: 14.9% (13.9%, 15.8%) versus 4.1%
- ACR 70: 5.4% (6.9%, 4.0%) versus 1.0%

## ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses Over Time by MTX Use at Baseline

Among subjects treated with ustekinumab, response rates were generally comparable in subjects who were  and  were  not  receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (45.3%  and  42.2%,  respectively),  although  the treatment effect (i.e., the difference in response rates between the combined ustekinumab group and the placebo group) in ACR 20 at Week 24 was modestly greater in subjects who were not receiving MTX at baseline compared with subjects who were receiving MTX at baseline, because of the higher placebo response rate in subjects who were receiving MTX.

## ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses by Weight at Baseline

Randomization was stratified by baseline weight (≤100 kg vs. &gt;100 kg). ACR responses at Week 24 in the combined ustekinumab group (and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups) versus the placebo group were as follows for the 2 weight stratums:

- ACR 20:
- o ≤100 kg group: 44.9% (43.2%, 46.6%) versus 23.0%
- o &gt;100 kg group: 41.7% (44.8%, 38.7%) versus 13.3%
- ACR 50:
- o ≤100 kg group: 24.5% (20.3%, 28.8%) versus 8.1%
- o &gt;100 kg group: 10.0% (10.3%, 9.7%) versus 3.3%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ACR 70:
- o ≤100 kg group: 9.5% (8.1%, 11.0%) versus 4.1%
- o &gt;100 kg group: 3.3% (3.4%, 3.2%) versus 0.0%

The response in those &gt;100kg is less than for the lighter subjects. The expected increased efficacy at the 90mg dose is evident in the lighter groups. This is not seen for those &gt;100kg. There were 221 subjects &lt;100kg and only 90 subjects &gt;100kg and the relatively small number in each dose cohort for those &gt;100kg may have impacted on the results.

## DAS28 Response Measurements

When evaluated over time, the differences in response rates between the ustekinumab groups and the placebo group were evident as early as Week 4. By the second evaluation at Week 8, more than half (54.0%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  achieved  a  DAS28  good  or  moderate response, compared with 33.7% in the placebo group. The level of response was generally maintained through Week 24. Results for an LOCF analysis were similar.

## Dactylitis

Of  the  312  randomized  subjects,  127  (40.7%)  had  dactylitis  diagnosed  at  baseline.  At  Week  24, among  subjects  with  dactylitis  at  baseline,  a  numerically  but  not  significantly  lower  proportion  of subjects in the combined ustekinumab and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (61.9%, 65.2%, and 57.9%, respectively) had dactylitis compared with the placebo group (75.8%).

At Week 24, numerically but not significantly greater percentage improvements in the dactylitis score were observed in the combined ustekinumab and ustekinumab 90 mg groups (median: -46.41 and -64.58, respectively) compared with the placebo group (0.00); no difference was observed between the ustekinumab 45 mg group and the placebo group.

## Enthesitis

Of  the  312  randomized  subjects,  221  (70.8%)  had  enthesitis  diagnosed  at  baseline.  At  Week  24, among subjects with enthesitis at baseline, significantly lower proportions of subjects in the combined ustekinumab  group  and  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  (72.9%,  75.7%,  and  70.0%, respectively; all p&lt;0.05) had enthesitis compared with the placebo group (88.2%).

Among subjects with enthesitis at baseline, a significantly greater percentage improvement in MASES score was observed at Week 24 in the combined ustekinumab and ustekinumab 90 mg groups (percent change from baseline of -45.80 [p=0.017] and -48.33 [p=0.008], respectively) compared with the placebo  group  (0.00).  Numerically  but  not  significantly  greater  percentage  improvement  in  MASES score was observed at Week 24 for the ustekinumab 45 mg group (percent change from baseline of -33.33) compared with the placebo group.

## BASDAI

The change from baseline in BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) scores was calculated at Week 12 and Week 24 only for subjects with spondylitis with peripheral joint involvement as  their  primary  arthritic  presentation  of  PsA  at  baseline  and  was  limited  by  the  small  sample  size (n=70).  Among  subjects  with  spondylitis  with  peripheral  joint  involvement  at  baseline,  numerically greater  improvement  in  BASDAI  was  noted  at  Week  12  and  Week  24  in  subjects  treated  with ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg compared with placebo, although no consistently significant differences were observed for the proportion of subjects who achieved at least 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BASDAI  between  ustekinumab  groups  and  the  placebo  group.  Only  1  subject  in  the  90  mg  group achieved at least a 90% improvement in BASDAI from baseline at Week 12 and Week 24

The efficacy results for dactylitis spondylitis and enthesitis show similar trends as in study 3001.

## Impact of Ustekinumab on DLQI

The  impact  of  ustekinumab  on  DLQI  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  change  in  DLQI  scores  from baseline for those subjects with ≥3% BSA Ps skin involvement at baseline. At Week 16 and Week 24, a statistically significant  improvement  from  baseline  in  DLQI score  was  seen  in  the  combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (all p&lt;0.001). At Week 24, the median change from baseline in DLQI score was  -6.00 in  all  ustekinumab  groups  compared  with  a median of 0.00 in the placebo group.

## Change From Baseline in FACIT-F at Week 16 and Week 24

A  statistically  significant  change  from  baseline  in  FACIT-F  scores  was  observed  at  Week  24  in  the combined ustekinumab group and in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared with the placebo  group  (median  improvement,  all  3.0  vs.  0.0;  all  p≤0.007).  Similarly,  the  percentage  of subjects  with  clinically  significant  improvement  in  fatigue  at  Week  24  from  baseline  (≥4  points  in FACIT-F) was significantly higher in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (49% for all) compared with the placebo group (25.8%; all p&lt;0.001).

## Ancillary analyses

## Impact of Prior Anti-TNF Exposure on Efficacy

For  subjects  with  prior  anti-TNF  exposure,  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  reached  in  the proportion  of  ACR  20  responders  at  Week  24  for  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (35.6%, 36.7%, and 34.5%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (14.5%; all p&lt;0.05). This was also true for PASI 75 at Week 24 (47.1%, 45.5%, and 48.8%,  respectively,  vs.  2.0%;  all  p&lt;0.001).  For  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  at  Week  24,  however, numerically greater but not statistically significant results were noted for both ustekinumab doses in this population.

The improvement  from  baseline in HAQ-DI  score  was  significantly greater in the  combined ustekinumab and ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared with the placebo group at Week 24 (p&lt;0.02 in all groups) for subjects with prior anti-TNF exposure.

## Efficacy in Subjects with Prior DMARD Use

For subjects with prior DMARD use, the primary endpoint (ACR 20 at Week 24) was consistent with the overall population. All major secondary endpoints (HAQ-DI, PASI 75, and ACR 50 and ACR 70) were consistent with the overall population.

## Summary of main studies

The  following  tables  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the  present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

A  comparison  of  the  efficacy  data  through  Week  24  for  both  Phase  3  studies,  including  efficacy measures related to joint disease (ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70, DAS28, PsARC, and BASDAI) soft tissue (dactylitis  and  enthesitis),  skin  disease  (PASI  75),  physical  function  (HAQ-DI),  and  quality  of  life evaluations  (DLQI  and  SF-36),  were  presented    by  the  MAH.  The  comparisons  are  focused  on  an evaluation  of  the  consistency  in  the  overall  population  for  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect compared with placebo, dose-response, and the time course of a response. Data from CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002  were  also  pooled  to  increase  the  precision  in  the evaluation of efficacy in subpopulations. A summary of the results is provided below.

The treatment effects for ACR 50 and ACR 70 were higher in CNTO1275PSA3001, possibly related to the fact that CNTO1275PSA3002 enrolled a more treatment refractory population with prior anti-TNFα exposure.  Across  both  studies,  90  mg  resulted  in  numerically  higher  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  response rates than the 45 mg.

Both the Phase 3 study CNTO1275PSA3002 and the Phase 2 study C0743T10 enrolled subjects with previous anti-TNFα exposure. The proportion of subjects with an ACR 20 response was larger for all ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group with or without prior biologic anti-TNFα therapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exposure.  Of  note,  subjects  who  were  naïve  to  anti-TNFα  therapy  had  a  larger  treatment  effect compared with subjects who had previous anti-TNFα exposure across both C0743T10 and CNTO1275PSA3002 studies.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study C0743T10 supported proof of concept for ustekinumab in the treatment of PsA and also broadly supported the posology already licensed for plaque psoriasis (Ps).

Two well designed pivotal studies were provided in support of this extension of indication.  The larger pivotal  phase  3  study  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  the  second  smaller  study  CNTO1275PSA3002  had  a similar study design. The differences were as follows:

- Study Population: in addition to the anti-TNF naïve subjects as in CNTO1275PSA3001 study, CNTO1275PSA3002  study  also  enrolled  subjects  who  have  been  previously  treated  with biologic anti-TNF agent(s). At least 150, but no more than 180 of the 300 randomized subjects must have been previously treated with anti-TNF agents.
- Study  Duration:  the  last  dose  in  CNTO1275PSA3002  study  was  at  Week  40.  Subjects  were followed for efficacy through Week 52 and safety through Week 60. Database locks occurred at Week 24 and Week 60.
- Study Size: in study CNTO1275PSA3002 approximately 300 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo SC at Week 0 in this study whereas in study CNTO1275PSA3001 around 600 subjects were included.

Both  studies  included  ~50%  of  patients  taking  concomitant  MTX  and  assessed  a  large  number  of endpoints related to joints, heath related quality of life, dactylitis, enthesitis spondylitis and skin.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

All  primary  and  major  secondary  endpoints  were  met  and  clearly  demonstrated  clinically  and statistically significant results for both doses in both studies, with the exception of ACR 70 response in study CNTO1275PSA3002 which showed numerical improvement.

As 2 doses were used at the already licensed posology for Ps, analysis of efficacy by weight and dose was performed. Exposure in those &gt;100kg on the 90 mg dose is similar to exposure in those &lt;100kg on the 45mg dose. Efficacy was higher at the 90mg dose for ACR20 particularly in those &gt;100kg in study  CNTO1275PSA3001  but  not  for  the  smaller  second  study  CNTO1275PSA3002.  A  relationship between  exposure  (serum  trough  levels)  and  weight  was  shown  and  therefore  the  proposed recommendation to allow for the higher 90mg dose in those &gt;100kg is supported and is in line with the Ps licensed posology.

In  study  CNTO1275PSA3001,  efficacy  was  seen  in  all  subgroups  consistent  with  an  effect  from ustekinumab  across  a  range  of  baseline  medications  used  for  PsA.  The  included  population  had moderate to severe disease with a median numbers of swollen and tender joints of 10.0 and 20.0, respectively, a median HAQ-DI score of 1.25, and a median CRP of 10.30 mg/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While using the DAS28 score may be problematic in PsA with oligoarticular disease or where the lower limbs are predominantly involved, it is clear that the median DAS28 score was high.

The mean BASDAI score was &gt;6/10 for those with spondylitis. 48.1% of subjects had dactylitis with a median  score  of  4.0  and  71.7%  of  subjects  had  enthesitis  with  a  median  score  of  4.0.  The  high proportions of subjects with dactylitis/enthesitis/skin disease and to a lesser extent spondylitis, allows assessment of efficacy across many domains of psoriatic arthritis.

A treatment effect is noted whether patients are on concomitant MTX or not.  All ACR and PASI efficacy results,  other  than  ACR20  in  the  45  mg  group,  trended  to  slightly  higher  values  in  those  not  on concomitant  MTX.  The  differences  in  efficacy  are  not  consistently  higher  or  lower  when  comparing concomitant MTX with monotherapy. Efficacy is clearly demonstrated regardless of MTX usage.

Evidence  for  efficacy  in  each  of  the  components  of  the  ACR  is  demonstrated  also  showing  higher efficacy at the 90mg dose. This shows that efficacy is not restricted to symptoms only, as both clinical signs  (swollen  joint  count,  dactylitis)  and  measures  of  systemic  inflammation  (CRP)  all  show  a treatment effect.

Efficacy results are consistent for joints, dactylitis, enthesitis and spondylitis. A small reduction in the numbers with enthesitis is shown. The reduction in the severity of enthesitis is not as marked as seen in dactylitis. It is also noted that accurate assessment of enthesitis is difficult.

A clear exposure response relationship was observed for psoriasis, while it was less clear for PsA.

A lower effect but still a response is seen in those with ADA positivity as in the original plaque psoriasis programme. The conclusion that ADA positivity does not preclude a response is agreed.

The indication initially applied for by the MAH was as follows: 'STELARA, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. Stelara has been shown to improve physical function (see section 5.1)'. In line with the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics, the physical function claim was not included in the indication in section 4.1 but placed as an information in section 5.1.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Efficacy for the signs and symptoms of PsA have been clearly demonstrated across a wide range of disease manifestations (joint, soft tissue) in patients who have failed previous DMARDs as well as in those who have prior anti-TNF exposure. All primary and major secondary endpoints were met and clearly  demonstrated  clinically  and  statistically  significant  results,  with  the  exception  of  ACR  70 response  in  study  CNTO1275PSA3002  which  showed  numerical  improvement.  Efficacy  was  seen whether ustekinumab was given as monotherapy or as an add-on to MTX.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

## Patient exposure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in safety data pooled from the 2 ongoing, placebo-controlled Phase 3 PsA studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002). These studies have similar designs and the PsA data summarized are derived from the following 3 studies:

- CNTO1275PSA3001
- o Data through Week 24 for 615 randomized subjects as captured in the 24-Week data base lock (DBL).
- o Data through Week 52 for 356 subjects randomized prior to 26 Oct 2010 who were to have completed their Week 52 visit by the time of the 24-Week DBL (either terminated the study or completed study through Week 52). This group of subjects is referred to as the 52-Week safety subset.
- CNTO1275PSA3002
- o Data through Week 24 for 312 randomized subjects as captured in the 24-Week DBL.
- C0743T10
- o Data through Week 36 for 146 randomized subjects.

As  supportive  safety  information,  the  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  PsA  is  compared  with  the  safety  of ustekinumab  in  Ps.  Safety  data  from  Ps  studies  are  relevant  for  comparison  for  the  evaluating  the safety of ustekinumab in PsA for the following reasons:

-  Ps  and PsA commonly co-exist in the same patient, and patients with these diseases have similar comorbidities and medical risks as supported by the following:

-  Approximately 28% of the subjects in the Phase 3 Ps studies (C0743T08 and C0743T09) had a  baseline  medical  history  or  current  diagnosis  of  PsA.  Similarly,  approximately  75%  of  the subjects in the Phase 3 PsA studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002) had Ps with ≥3% body surface area (BSA) skin involvement at baseline.

-  The PsA and the Ps populations share certain risk factors such as increased cardiovascular (CV) risk, increased body weight, and increased body mass index (BMI).6;7;17

-  The  2  pivotal,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  Ps  studies  (C0743T08  and  C0743T09)  had  similar  SC dosing regimens as the 2 Phase 3 PsA studies.

Standard analyses of AEs focus on comparisons of pooled safety data from the combined Phase 3 PsA studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002) with pooled safety data from the 2 pivotal Phase 3 Ps studies (C0743T08 and C0743T09). For the analyses of less frequently occurring targeted events, pooled data from the global Ps studies (Phase 2 C0379T04 study and 3 Phase 3 studies [C0743T08, C0743T09,  and  C0743T12])  were  used,  unless  otherwise  stated.  These  studies  were  selected  for comparison since they were conducted in generally the same geographic regions as the PsA programs and  would  be  expected  to  have  recruited  subjects  with  similar  demographics  and  comorbidities.  In addition, the C0743T08 and C0743T09 studies incorporated 5-year long-term extension (LTE) phases providing  supportive  long-term  safety  data.  The  database  for  the  global  Ps  studies  includes  safety information  from  a  total  of  3117  subjects  with  approximately  9000  subject-years  of  follow-up  and provides extensive clinical study safety data of ustekinumab.

## Supportive Safety Data from Crohn's Disease Studies

The safety of ustekinumab in Crohn's disease was  considered relevant because the Crohn's disease studies  provide  additional  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  subjects  using  concomitant  immunosuppressant agents (e.g., corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA], azathioprine [AZA], and 6-mercaptopurine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[6-MP]). Moreover, safety was evaluated for higher doses of ustekinumab (up to 6 mg/kg IV) in the Crohn's disease studies than those administered in the PsA and Ps studies.  For these comparisons, safety  data  from  the  2  completed  Phase  2  studies  in  Crohn's  disease  were  used  (C0379T07  and C0743T26, Table 5).

## Adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, the proportions of subjects with AEs and the types of AEs were generally  comparable  across  all  treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose  response  or  pattern. Furthermore, there were no disproportionate increases in rates or notable changes in the patterns or types of AEs observed over time.

## Through the Placebo-controlled Period

## Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies

Through Week 16, the proportions of subjects with AEs after the first administration of study agent were similar across all treatment groups (47.9% in the placebo group, 48.4% in the 45 mg group, 49.4% in the 90 mg group, and 48.9% in the combined ustekinumab group).

In  general,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  and  the  types  of  AEs  were  comparable  across treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose  response.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (occurred  in ≥2% of subjects in any group) during the placebo-controlled period are presented in Table 6.

AEs of nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, oropharyngeal pain, and back pain were reported more frequently in ustekinumab-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects without clear evidence of a dose response.

These AEs are generally consistent with known ADRs for ustekinumab with the exceptions of nausea and arthralgia. The &gt;2% difference in the proportion of subjects with the PT of nausea in the combined ustekinumab and placebo groups accounts for the difference observed in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. Rates of nausea were &gt;4-fold higher in ustekinumab-treated groups in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies. Rates of arthralgia were 2.5-fold higher in ustekinumab-treated groups in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies (Table 6). These data supported the determination of arthralgia and nausea as new ADRs. Dental infections was also additionally identified as a new ADR.

The absence of a dose response in terms of safety profile was demonstrated in the 5 years long-term maintenance of efficacy and safety update provided for ustekinumab in Ps (type II variation 028).  In the PsA population new ADR of arthralgia, nausea and dental infections have been identified.

## Through Week 24

As observed in the placebo-controlled period, the proportions of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs through  Week  24  in  the  combined  Phase  3  PsA  studies  were  similar  between  placebo-treated  and ustekinumab-treated subjects and between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups (55.0% in the placebo group, 54.9% in the combined ustekinumab group, 59.7% in the 45 mg group, and 58.1% in the 90 mg group; Table 7).

AEs that occurred in ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group through Week 24 are presented in Table 7. The proportions of subjects with AEs and the types of AEs were generally comparable across the ustekinumab treatment groups without any clear dose response relationship with the exception of ALT elevations  which  were  reported  in  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  90  mg  group  (2.9%) compared with the 45 mg group (1.6%). Analyses of markedly abnormal clinical chemistry values did not suggest any association between ustekinumab treatment and ALT elevation.

## Through Week 52

Among  the  615  randomized  subjects  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study,  data  for  347  ustekinumabtreated  subjects  (52-Week  safety  subset)  and  data  from  1965  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  in  the combined  the  C0743T08  and  C0743T09  Ps  studies  through  Week  52  are  presented.  Safety  data through Week 52 are not currently available for the ongoing CNTO1275PSA3002 study. Consideration should be given for the difference in group sizes when comparing the 2 populations at Week 52.

Consistent with the results through Week 24, the SOCs with the highest proportions of AEs through Week 52 were Infections and infestations (39.2% in the combined ustekinumab group) followed by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (13.8%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group),  and gastrointestinal disorders (12.1% in the combined ustekinumab group).

AEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group through Week 52 are presented in Table 8.

Subjects who early escaped at Week 16 or crossed over at Week 24.

Subjects who crossed over at Week 12.

Includes allsubjects irrespective of early escape.

Note:For CNTO1275PsA3001,only includes subjects who were randomized priorto October 26, 2010

The  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  and  the  types  of  AEs  were  generally  comparable  across  the ustekinumab  treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose-responses.  Overall,  the  types  of  AEs  were similar to that reported at earlier time points.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in the PsA studies through the Week 24 DBLs and through 31 May 2012 in either  of  the  ongoing  CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 studies. Deaths were analysed as targeted events . Through the end of the reporting period, there were no deaths in the combined PsA studies.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

## Through the Placebo-controlled Period Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies

Through the controlled portion of the studies, all SAEs in the PsA studies and almost all SAEs in the Ps studies (with the exceptions of 2 subjects in placebo and 2 subjects in 90 mg with cellulitis, and 2 subjects in 45 mg with intervertebral disc protrusion) occurred as single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group in both the PsA and Ps populations (Table 9).

The proportions of subjects with SAEs were comparable across the placebo groups and all ustekinumab dose groups in both PsA and Ps (Table 9).

## Through Week 24

## PsA Compared with Ps

The proportions of subjects with SAEs were comparable in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg dose groups in the psoriasis studies with no disproportionate increases in the proportions of subjects with SAEs compared with the placebo-controlled period (Table 10).

Consistent  with  results  during  the  placebo-controlled  portion  of  the  studies,  through  Week  24  the majority of SAEs occurred as single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group in both the PsA and Ps populations (Table 10).

## Through Week 52

## Phase 3 CNTO1275PSA3001 PsA Study

Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  52-Week  safety  subset,  SAEs  occurred  in  4.6%  (16 subjects)  of  subjects  with  available  data  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (Table  11).  The proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was higher in the 45 mg treatment group (5.8% [7  subjects,  all  of  which  occurred  in  subjects  randomized  to  45mg  and  not  in  those  who  early escaped]),  compared  with  the  90  mg  treatment  group  (2.5%  [3  subjects])  although  the  overall incidence was low. Consistent with results through Week 24, the majority of SAEs occurred as single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group.

Consistent with results during the placebo-controlled period, markedly abnormal changes in haematology  laboratory  values  through  Week  24  in  the  combined  psoriasis  studies  were  generally infrequent occurring in comparable proportions of subjects among the treatment groups without any dose-related or clinically-concerning patterns.

Through Week 52 in the CNTO1275PSA3001 52-Week safety subset, markedly abnormal changes in haematology  laboratory  values  remained  generally  infrequent  with  comparable  types  as  observed through  Week  24  and  comparable  rates  among  the  treatment  groups  without  any  dose-related  or clinically-concerning patterns.

## Clinical Chemistry

In  the  combined  PsA  studies,  markedly  abnormal  changes  in  chemistry  laboratory  values  were generally infrequent with comparable rates among the treatment groups through Week 16 without any dose-related  or  clinically-concerning  patterns  In  the  combined  PsA  studies,  markedly  abnormal changes in chemistry laboratory values were generally infrequent with comparable rates among the treatment groups through Week 24 without any dose-related or clinically-concerning patterns.

Through Week 52 in the CNTO1275PSA3001 52-Week safety subset, markedly abnormal changes in chemistry laboratory values remained generally infrequent with comparable types as observed through Week 24. The number of subjects with events did not increase disproportionately, and the proportions of  subjects  with  events  were  comparable between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups without any doserelated or clinically-concerning patterns

## Immunological events

## Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions (Including Anaphylaxis and Serum Sickness)

There were no subjects who experienced anaphylaxis or serum sickness reactions in the CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 studies through Week 24.

In the CNTO1275PSA3001 study, none of the ustekinumab injections in subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with an injection-site reaction, while 10 of 1671 (0.6%) ustekinumab injections in subjects who were negative for antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with an injection-site reaction (all mild).

In the CNTO1275PSA3002 study, none of the ustekinumab injections in subjects who were positive for antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  associated  with  an  injection-site  reaction,  while  7  of  602  (1.2%) ustekinumab injections in subjects who were negative for antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with injection-site reactions (all mild).

Therefore, there was no apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the occurrence of injection-site reactions in the Phase 3 PsA studies.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The  overall  numbers  of  subjects  with  serious  adverse  event  (SAEs)  in  CNTO1275PSA3001  and CNTO1275PSA3002 through Week 24 were low. Among ustekinumab-treated subjects, the proportion of subjects with 1 or more SAEs through Week 24 was similar between subjects receiving concomitant MTX  and  those  without  concomitant  MTX  (1.8%  vs.  1.9%,  respectively).  A  higher  proportion  of placebo-treated subjects reported an SAE in the concomitant MTX group (4.8%) compared with the non-concomitant MTX group (1.8%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To evaluate whether there is a difference in the types of SAEs that occurred between subjects treated with concomitant MTX vs. those who received ustekinumab monotherapy, a summary table is provided that presents the proportions of subjects with 1 or more SAEs through Week 24 for subjects with or without concomitant MTX by MedDRA system-organ class and preferred term (PT). Within subgroups of subjects with or without concomitant MTX, SAEs occurred as single events in each treatment group, without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group. The only SOCs with SAEs occurring in more than 1 subject in a treatment group were the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC  (2  [0.6%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  who  were  receiving  concomitant  MTX),  the  Nervous system  orders  SOC  (2  [0.5%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  without  concomitant  MTX),  and  the Psychiatric  disorders  SOC  (2  [0.5%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  without  concomitant  MTX). Additionally, there were no differences observed between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups, regardless of baseline MTX stat.

In summary, the SAE data presented by SOC and PT term through Week 24 do not indicate that the nature  of  SAEs  is  different  between  subjects  treated  with  concomitant  MTX  and  those  treated  with ustekinumab  monotherapy.  SAEs  were  generally  singular  in  nature  and  no  patterns  of  SAEs  were observed  regardless  of  concomitant  MTX  use.  The  nature  of  the  SAEs  in  those  with  or  without concomitant MTX show no major differences and the numbers were limited.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Through the placebo-controlled period (0-16 weeks) in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was low. The proportion of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE was higher in the placebo group (3.6% [11 subjects])  compared  with  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (1.1%  [7  subjects].  The  proportions  of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE were similar in the 45 mg (1.0% [3 subjects]) and 90 mg (1.3% [4 subjects]) groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SOCs with the highest proportions of discontinuations were Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.3% [7 subjects] in the placebo group and 0.3% [2 subjects] in the combined ustekinumab group) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.6% [2 subjects] in the placebo group and 0.3% [2 subjects] in the combined ustekinumab group) most likely reflecting a lack of treatment benefit in the  placebo  group.  Consistent  with  this,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  agent  of  psoriatic arthropathy and psoriasis were highest in the placebo group followed by the 45 mg group and were absent in the 90 mg group (Other AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent generally occurred as single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC or type of event and did not occur more

## Through Week 52

## Phase 3 CNTO1275PSA3001 PsA Study

Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study  in  the  52-Week  safety  subset,  AEs  leading  to discontinuation  of  study  agent  occurred  in  2.0%  (7  subjects)  of  subjects  with  available  data  in  the combined ustekinumab group. The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was higher in the 45 mg group (3.3% [4 subjects]), compared with the 90 mg group (0.8% [1 subject])  although  the  overall  incidence  was  low.  Consistent  with  results  through  Week  24,  the majority of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent occurred as single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group.

## Adverse events of Special interest

## Infections

## Through the Placebo-controlled Period

## PsA Compared with Ps

The  proportions  of  subjects  with  infections  were  comparable  across  the  placebo  groups  and  all ustekinumab dose groups within the PsA and Ps studies, and the types of infections were generally comparable across all treatment groups without any clear dose response, with the exception of dentalrelated  infections.  Consistent  with  the  analysis  from  the  Phase  3  PsA  studies,  more  dental-related infections (tooth infection and tooth abscess) occurred in ustekinumab-treated subject compared with placebo-treated  subjects  in  the  Phase  3  Ps  studies,  which  supported  the  identification  of  dental infections as an ADR. The most frequently occurring types of infections (occurred in ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group) were similar between the PsA and Ps populations without any notable differences in  the  types  of  infections  across  treatment  groups  or  between  study  populations.  Infections  that occurred  in  ≥2%  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  in  both  PsA  and  Ps  were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis.

## Through Week 24

## PsA Compared with Ps

Through Week 24 in the Ps and PsA studies, the most frequently occurring types of infections in the combined  ustekinumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  sinusitis, gastroenteritis, and influenza. There were no clear dose responses observed between 45 mg and 90 mg groups in all the PsA and Ps studies.

## Through Week 52

## Phase 3 CNTO1275PSA3001 PsA Study

Through Week 52 in the CNTO1275PSA3001 52-Week safety subset, treatment-emergent infections occurred in 37.8% (131 subjects) of subjects with available data in the combined ustekinumab group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  infections  was  similar  in  the  45  mg  (42.5%)  and  90  mg  (42.4%) treatment groups. Consistent with results through Week 24, the most frequently occurring infections were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections.

## Serious infections

Through the end of the reporting period in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, there was 1 serious infection in the placebo group (interstitial lung disease in the CNTO1275PSA3002 study), and 4 serious infections  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (cholecystitis  in  the placebo → 45 mg group, acute cholecystitis and salpingitis in the 45 mg group and pharyngolaryngeal abscess in the 90 mg group).

## Malignancies

Through the placebo-controlled period (0-16 weeks) in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, there was 1 subject in the ustekinumab 90 mg group with squamous cell carcinoma in situ in an area of cleared plaque psoriasis.

## Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)

As  in  Ps,  patients  with  PsA  are  reported  to  be  at  increased  risk  for  occlusive  vascular  diseases, including MI and stroke.  At least part of this increased risk results from higher rates of cardiovascular risk  factors  such  as  hypertension,  hyperlipidaemia,  diabetes,  obesity,  and  smoking  in  the  PsA population. While Ps patients with PsA appear to have higher rates of CV comorbidities compared with Ps patients without PsA, whether PsA is an independent CV risk factor still requires further study.

To evaluate the potential impact of ustekinumab on this population risk, the incidence of adjudicated MACE (cardiovascular  death,  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke)  were  evaluated  in  the placebo-controlled period and through the end of the reporting period in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies.

## Through the End of the Reporting Period

Through the end of the reporting period across indications, there were:

-  4  MACE  in  the  PsA  studies  (1  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction  in  placebo,  1  nonfatal  myocardial infarction and 1 nonfatal stroke in 45 mg, 1 nonfatal stroke in 90 mg),

- 41 MACE in the Ps studies (1 nonfatal myocardial infarction in placebo which occurred 3 days after Week  12  in  a  subject  in  the  placebo  group  who  never  crossed  over  to  receive  ustekinumab;  3 cardiovascular deaths, 15 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 3 nonfatal strokes in the 45 mg group; and 3 cardiovascular deaths and 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions in the 90 mg group), and

## - no MACE in the Crohn's disease studies

In the PsA studies, the event rates of MACE per 100 subject-years in the placebo, 45 mg group, 90 mg group, and combined ustekinumab groups were 0.70, 0.78, 0.34, and 0.55, respectively. In the Ps studies, the event rates of MACE per 100 subject-years in the placebo, 45 mg group, 90 mg group, and combined ustekinumab groups were 0.55, 0.56, 0.36, and 0.44, respectively. When the rate of MACE was evaluated by the time period of exposure, (Years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), the event rates per 100 subject-years of follow-up showed no evidence of a dose response or an increase in event rates with increased  exposure  to  ustekinumab.  However,  the  interpretation  is  limited  by  the  small  number  of events and the modest year-to-year variability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  PsA  studies  (C0743T10,  CNTO1275PSA3001,  and CNTO1275PSA3002), the SIR in the combined ustekinumab group was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.26, 3.63), and the  SIR  in  the  placebo  group  was  1.81  (95%  CI:  0.05,  10.08);  however,  CIs  were  wide  and overlapping.

## Serious Neurologic Disorders

There were no events of RPLS reported in any PsA study with ustekinumab.

## Injection-site Reactions

## Through Week 24

## Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies

Through  Week  24,  the  number  of  injections  associated  with  injection-site  reactions  was  low  in  the combined Phase 3 PsA studies regardless of the study agent administered, although a modest increase was observed in injections of 90 mg, (0.4% of injections of placebo, 0.6% of injections of 45 mg, and 1.0% of injections of 90 mg). All injection-site reactions were mild, and none were moderate or severe or serious. The most common injection-site reactions through Week 24 were erythema and pain which are known ADRs.

## PsA Compared with Ps

Through Week 24, there were similar average numbers of injections in each study agent group across the PsA and Ps populations. The proportion of injections associated with injection-site reactions was low across all study agent groups and comparable between the PsA studies and Ps studies. There were no moderate or severe injection-site reactions in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, and 3 moderate and 1 severe injection-site reactions in the combined C0743T08 and C0743T09 Ps studies. The most common injection-site reactions through Week 24 in both the PsA and Ps populations were erythema and pain.

Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  52-Week  safety  subset,  the  proportion  of  injections associated with injection-site reactions was low and generally comparable across all groups (0.3% of injections of placebo, 0.5% of injections of 45 mg, and 0.6% of injections of 90 mg). All injection-site reactions  were  mild,  and  none  were  moderate  or  severe.  The  most  common  injection-site  reaction through Week 52 was pain.

## Post-marketing experience

Post-marketing information has been accruing since the first approval of ustekinumab on 12 Dec 2008. As of 30 Jun 2012, ustekinumab has subsequently been approved in over 65 countries. Global postmarketing  exposure  through  30  Jun  2012  has  been  estimated  as  120,462  person-years.  Biannual Periodic Safety Update reports (PSURs) have been generated for this product reflecting the assessment of active ongoing post-marketing surveillance of targeted safety events as described in clinical study safety analyses, as well as broad overall safety surveillance as described below.

Aggregate data from post-marketing reports are reviewed at defined intervals in conjunction with the preparation of the PSUR to monitor for changes in the overall AE pattern for ustekinumab over time, and for changes in the reporting frequency or severity of selected AEs in order to identify potential new safety  concerns.  In  addition,  trending  and  review  of  lot-related  AEs  or  product  quality/technical complaints  with  AEs  from  the  global  safety  database  are  conducted  at  defined  intervals  to  identify signals  related  to  product  quality  and  manufacturing.  Finally,  surveillance  with  trending  of  reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

event frequency over time, as well as comparison of event reporting disproportionality with other drugs from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA AERS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Vigibase databases is performed routinely.

Through  30  June  2012,  7  PSURs  have  been  completed.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (including  rash, urticaria) and serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema occurring in conjunction with ustekinumab therapy were identified from spontaneous reports and were identified as ADRs. The safety concerns of serious infections, including TB and Salmonella, malignancies, MACE, RPLS, facial palsy, and pregnancy outcomes are under heightened surveillance. While the complete evaluation of NMSC has  not  suggested  a  causal  relationship,  a  post-marketing  case  report  was  published  in  the Australasian  Journal  of  Dermatology  which  described  2  patients  older  than  60  years  of  age,  who developed  multiple  cutaneous  SCCs  after  each  receiving  2  doses  of  ustekinumab.  Based  on  this information  the  sponsor  has  recently  added  a  warning  advising  prescribers  to  monitor  patients,  in particular those greater than 60 years of age, those with a history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy  or  those  with  a  history  of  psoralen  plus  ultraviolet  A  light  (PUVA)  treatment,  for  the appearance  of  non-melanoma  skin  cancer.  No  additional  ADRs  have  been  identified  from  postmarketing reports through 30 Jun 2012.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

The  MAH  assessed  safety  and  compared  the  relatively  small  safety  database  in  PsA  (213  patients for &gt;12months) with the larger Ps safety database. In view of the similarity in patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics that supportive information from the ~9000 patient years of data for  Ps  is  informative.  As  ustekinumab  is  licensed  as  monotherapy  for  Ps,  the  additional  information from Crohn's disease is relevant although demographics differ markedly with those of Ps patients.

There were no new safety signals arising from the data, no evidence for a dose-effect and no evidence for a more severe adverse profile for those on concomitant MTX. New ADRs reported in the PsA studies were arthralgia, nausea and dental infection.

The absolute number of MACE events in the PsA studies are low but the event rates of MACE per 100 subject-years  appears  higher  than  in  the  Ps  indication  where  there  is  over  9000  patients  years  of experience.  In view of the small absolute numbers it is not possible to conclude on any difference for MACE incidence in PsA from the data through to the end of the reporting period. It is also not expected that there should be a different safety profile for patients treated for PsA as opposed to those treated for  Ps  as  there  is  significant  overlap  in  the  manifestations  of  psoriasis  and  the  background demographics  and  baseline  risk  factors  for  MACE  are  similar  in  those  with  skin  and/or  joint manifestations of psoriasis.  Of note is that an additional 6 cases of MI (3 in each study) (5 recovered, for one case recovery was not reported) were reported after the 24week DBL and for 5 subjects the treatment was blinded. All subjects had at least 2 CV risk factors and half were on MTX. Monitoring of MACE events continues as part of the ongoing pharmacovigilance activities and further data on the safety profile of ustekinumab in PsA will become available from the two ongoing pivotal studies.

In terms of the assurance from the Ps safety data the main different for the PsA indication is the use of concomitant MTX. While supportive safety data from the Crohn's disease database was provided, as these patients were taking additional immunosuppressive medication, there remains the potential for a worse safety profile with ustekinumab is given with MTX in this patient population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

There were no new safety signals arising from the data, no evidence for a dose-effect and no evidence for a more severe adverse profile for those on concomitant MTX.

The  RMP  provided  is  considered  appropriate  for  the  PsA  indication  and  the  same  risk  minimisation activities  than  for  Ps,  which  include  a  ustekinumab  educational  programme, are  required.  All  safety concerns are appropriately reflected in the Contraindications, Special Warnings and Precautions for Use, and Undesirable Effects sections of the Product Information.

Comparison of rates  of  important  safety  concerns  subject  to  specific  monitoring  (serious  infections, malignancies and MACE) events from clinical trials and external datasets in the psoriasis population does  not  suggest  any  excess  risk  associated  with  ustekinumab  treatment.  This  is  conclusion  is supported by data from comparisons between the different patient cohorts in PSOLAR.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The beneficial effects demonstrated in PsA with ustekinumab include improvement of rapid onset in joint disease, plaque psoriasis, health related quality of life, and in addition some improvement in dactylitis, spondylitis and enthesitis. The positive effects on all these outcomes were maintained at 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weekly dosing up to week 24. The two pivotal trials were supportive of the proposed posology which is similar to that licensed in plaque psoriasis.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Demonstration of long-term maintenance of effect remains to be provided from the ongoing main studies. Submission of these data is defined in the risk management plan.

The data on radiographic scores to support efficacy of ustekinumab in reducing the rate of progression of  structural  damage  in  PsA  is  not  yet  available.  Radiographic  data  will  be  available  from  Phase  3 studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 and will be provided as defined in the RMP.

## Risks Unfavourable effects

The most common unfavourable effects of ustekinumab include infections, fatigue and injection site reactions. Other adverse events such as skin malignancies and MACE occur at a rate seen in the psoriasis population. Three new ADRs were identified in the PsA programme: arthralgia, nausea and dental infection. No new SAEs no opportunistic infections and no deaths were seen in the PsA programme.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

As in Ps, patients with PsA are reported to be at increased risk for occlusive vascular diseases, including MI and stroke. However, in view of the small absolute numbers it is not possible to conclude on any difference for MACE incidence in PsA from the data through to the end of the reporting period. It is also not expected that there should be a different safety profile for patients treated for PsA as opposed to those treated for Ps as there is significant overlap in the manifestations of psoriasis and the background demographics and baseline risk factors for MACE are similar in those with skin and/or joint manifestations of psoriasis.  Monitoring of MACE events continues as part of the ongoing pharmacovigilance activities as defined in the risk management plan.

There is &gt;9000 patients years of safety data for ustekinumab monotherapy in plaque psoriasis. The longer term safety profile for add on therapy to MTX remains to be collected in PsA. Further data on the safety profile of ustekinumab in PsA will become available from the two ongoing from Phase 3 studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002   studies.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

The beneficial effects of ustekinumab in joint, skin, and in addition improvement in dactylitis, spondylitis and enthesitis skin and in quality of life endpoints are considered relevant. As there are limited treatments available for patients who have failed DMARDs for PsA, a treatment which has shown efficacy in multiple domains of the disease and in quality of life is a useful additional treatment option.

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The favourable effect of rapid onset efficacy in those who have failed previous treatment for PsA is considered a very useful addition to therapies for PsA. Data on structural damage is not yet available

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hence limiting the demonstrated benefit but this data is expected to be available in the future. This information will be established based on radiographic data collected from Phase 3 studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002.

The unfavourable effects are described in the SmPC and no new SAEs no opportunistic infections and no deaths were seen in the PsA programme.  No additional safety concerns are evidence at this stage for combined therapy with MTX. Longer term data will provide further information on this.

Overall at this stage the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable ones, particularly as efficacy and safety in Ps are well established and there have been no post-marketing signals for any adverse effects on joint.  In addition although the safety data base for Ps is limited to ~9000 patient years as compared with anti-TNFs, at this stage the safety profile of ustekinumab is considered favourable.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The beneficial effects of ustekinumab in joint, skin and in quality of life endpoints are considered relevant. As there are limited treatments available for patients who have previously failed DMARDs for PsA, a treatment which has shown efficacy in multiple domains of the disease and in quality of life is a useful additional treatment option.

The unfavourable effects of ustekinumab include infections, fatigue and injection site reactions.  Other adverse events such as skin malignancies and MACE occur at a rate seen in the psoriasis population. Three new ADRs were identified in the PsA programme: arthralgia, nausea and dental infection. No new SAEs no opportunistic infections and no deaths were seen in the PsA programme.

The favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The B/R balance for ustekinumab in PsA is considered positive by the CHMP.

## 4. Recommendations

## Final Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends, by consensus, the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variation requested   | Type                                                                                                                           |    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| C.1.6 a)              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II |

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of psoriatic arthritis for Stelara.

'STELARA, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate (see section 5.1).'

As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.
