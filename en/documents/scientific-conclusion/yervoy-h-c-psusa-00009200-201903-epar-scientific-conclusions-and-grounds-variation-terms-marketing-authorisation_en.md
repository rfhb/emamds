## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ipilimumab, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

From the review of the 21 cases reporting retinal detachment in both ipilimumab monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, the relative close time to onset of the event and the improvement of the condition following corticosteroid treatment in some of these cases point towards an inflammatory nature of the event and a likely role of ipilimumab therapy. Moreover, it is known that serous retinal detachment is often associated with inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, serous retinal detachment should be added to the list of adverse drug reactions with a frequency 'rare' based on 6 reports of serous retinal detachment in clinical trials applicable to both the monotherapy and the combination therapy.

The reported cases of transient vision loss without confounding factors (in monotherapy and combination therapy) seemed to occur in patients with other inflammatory events which in 4 of the 6 patients were in the eye or eye artery. The other 2 cases experienced transient vision loss regardless of an eye infection, but this resolved after steroid treatment which is considered indicative of an immune related reaction. The available evidence is not sufficient to conclude a causal relation between transient vision loss and ipilimumab. Based on the available case reports, transient blindness is considered a secondary event of the eye infections that are known ADRs of ipilimumab. For this reason, the relevant warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ipilimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ipilimumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
