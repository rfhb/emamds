1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Reproductive studies with artemisinin derivatives have demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk during early gestation. Piperaquine was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit. Therefore, Eurartesim should not be used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where other suitable and effective anti-malarials are available. A large amount of data (more than 3000 exposed outcomes) from the use of artenimol/piperaquine during the 2nd and 3rd trimester indicate no fetotoxicity. In perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, piperaquine was associated with delivery complications. However, there was no delay in neonatal development following exposure in utero or via milk. Consequently, if Eurartesim is more suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin- based combination therapies with a higher range of experience (or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine), Eurartesim may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester.   |
