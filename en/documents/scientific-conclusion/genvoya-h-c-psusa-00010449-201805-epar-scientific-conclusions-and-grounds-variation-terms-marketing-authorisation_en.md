## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Based on two reports received of altered mental state with impairment in speech, gait, tremor although with limited information (both reporting potential cobicistat FDC and lurasidone interaction), a contraindication with lurasidone due to CYP3A inhibition with cobicistat was identified in medicinal products containing cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide and therefore the PRAC agreed that the product information should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
