## STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION

For procedures finalised after1 March 2004 please refer to module 8B .

- On  25  February  1998,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  applied  for  a  Type  I variation  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  542/95.  The  MAH  applied  for  a change in the content of the manufacturing authorisation. On 2 April 1998 the EMEA issued a notification.
- Regulation (EC) No 542/95 as amended, related to the update of the SPC and as a consequence the Package Leaflet following the review of the first periodic safety update report (PSUR). The variation  was  adopted  by  the  CPMP  on  21  October  1998,  and  the  respective  Commission Decision was issued on 26 January 1999.
- On 1 September 1998, the MAH applied, in accordance to the Regulation, for a Type I variation related to the change in in-process controls during the manufacture of the product. The EMEA issued a notification on 29 September 1998.
- On  12  October  1998,  the  MAH  applied,  in  accordance  to  the  Regulation,  for  two  Type  I variations  related  to  changes  in  the  test  procedure  of  the  product.  The  EMEA  issued  two notifications on 11 November 1998.
- The MAH submitted on 26 June 1998 an application for a marketing authorisation for Viramune 50  mg/  5  ml  oral  suspension  under  Annex  II  to  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95  as amended. This oral suspension was intended to be indicated for children and adults who have difficulties  to  swallow.  The  procedure  started  on  24  July  1998  and  the  CPMP  agreed  on  a consolidated  list  of  questions  on  19  November  1998.  Additional  data  were  submitted  by  the MAH on 12 January 1999. During its March meeting, the CPMP, in light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued by consensus a positive opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation to Viramune 50 mg/5 ml oral suspension on 25 March 1999. The CPMP opinion was forwarded to the European Commission, which adopted the respective Decision on 18 June 1999.
- On 11 January 1999 the MAH submitted two Type II variation applications. The first variation application related to the update of the safety information of the SPC and as a consequence the Package Leaflet based on the evaluation of the second periodic safety update report (PSUR). The second variation application related to the update of the interaction information of the SPC and  the  Package  Leaflet  based  on  the  evaluation  of  additional  interaction  study  reports.  The CPMP agreed the changes to be incorporated and adopted two Opinions on the Type II variation on 25 March 1999. The respective Commission Decisions were issued on 8 July 1999.
- Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2309/93 as amended and Part 4G of Annex  to  Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  provided  throughout  the  year  additional efficacy and safety data as stated in Annex IIC to Commission Decision, which formed the basis of the annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Viramune (e.g. results from the clinical endpoint  studies).  On  11  February  1999,  the  MAH  provided  an  updated  expert  report summarising  the  different  specific  obligations  already  submitted  within  the  period  February 1998-January  1999.  The  procedure  started  on  26  February  1999.  During  its  April  plenary meeting, the CPMP agreed with the Rapporteur's assessment report that the risk/benefit profile of  Viramune  remained favourable and that the MA  should  remain  under  exceptional circumstances  until  all  the  specific  obligations  are  fulfilled.  The  CPMP  adopted  on  22  April 1999  an  opinion  on  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  specific  obligations  and  the  risk/benefit ratio,  stating  that  no  amendments  of  Annexes  I  and  III  to  the  Community  Marketing Authorisation  were  necessary.  The  Annex  II  has  been  updated.  Respective  Commission Decision was issued on 29 July 1999.
- On 19 May 1999, the MAH applied for a Type I variation related to change in batch size of the active substance. The EMEA issued a notification on 24 June 1999.

- On 2 August 1999, the MAH submitted a Type II variation application related to the update of the  safety  information  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  as  a  consequence  the Package Leaflet based on the evaluation of the third periodic safety update report (PSUR), and the  newly  available  results  of  the  animal  carcinogenicity  studies.  The  CPMP  agreed  on  the changes to be incorporated and adopted the Opinion on the Type II variation on 18 November 1999. The respective Commission Decisions were issued on 16 March 2000.
- On 2 August 1999, the MAH submitted a Type II variation application related to the update of the  SPC  and  as  a  consequence  the  Package  Leaflet  with  paediatric  information.  The  CPMP agreed on the changes to be incorporated and adopted the Opinion on the Type II variation on 18 November 1999. The respective Commission Decisions were issued on 16 March 2000.
- On  27  September  1999,  the  MAH  applied  for  a  Type  I  variation  related  to  a  change  in  the plastic  adapter  which  fits  between  the  bottle  and  oral  syringe  of  the  oral  suspension  dosage form. The EMEA issued a notification on 15 October 1999.
- On  12  April  2000,  additional  cases  of  severe  and  life-threatening  cutaneous  and  hepatic reactions have been reported despite the warnings already included in the product information. The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  requested an  update  of  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  through  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  procedure  in accordance with article 1(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 as amended.

The  scope  of  the  procedure  was  to  reinforce  the  cutaneous  and  liver  monitoring  of  patients treated  with  nevirapine.  New  warnings  have  been  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics (sections 4.2 Posology and method of administration, 4.3 Contraindications, 4.4 Special  warnings  and  special  precautions  for  use  and  4.8  Undesirable  effects)  and  in  the Package Leaflet.

- Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2309/93 as amended and Part 4G of Annex  to  Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  provided  throughout  the  year  additional efficacy and safety data as stated in Annex IIC to Commission Decision, which formed the basis of  the  annual  re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Viramune. On 8 February 2000, the MAH provided an updated expert report summarising the different specific obligations already submitted within the period February 1999-January 2000. The procedure started on 18 February 2000.  During  its  April  plenary  meeting,  the  CPMP  agreed  with  the  Rapporteur's  assessment report  that  the  risk/benefit  profile  of  Viramune  remained  favourable  and  that  the  MA  should remain  under  exceptional  circumstances  until  all  the  specific  obligations  are  fulfilled.  The CPMP  adopted  on  12  April  2000  an  opinion  on  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  specific obligations  and  the  risk/benefit  ratio,  stating  that  amendments  of  Annexes  I  and  III  to  the Community  Marketing  Authorisation  were  necessary.  The  Annex  II  has  been  updated. Respective Commission Decision was issued on 27 July 2000.
- Pursuant  to  CPMP  discussion  on  the  potential  of  St  John's  wort  ( Hypericum  perforatum )  to interact  with  protease  inhibitors  (PIs)  and  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors (NNRTIs), the MAHs for the respective PIs and NNRTIs submitted to the EMEA an application for  a  Type  II  variation  to  include  a  class  labelling  wording  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics and Package leaflet. On 29 June 2000, the CPMP adopted an Opinion on this variation and the respective Commission Decision was issued on 30 October 2000.
- On 15 May 2000, the MAH submitted three Type II variation applications related to the update of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  when  relevant.  The  changes concerned the safety information following the April 2000 urgent safety restriction procedure, new information on interactions with medicinal products and pharmacodynamic information on the  perinatal  transmission  and  resistance  data.  The  CPMP  agreed  on  the  changes  to  be incorporated  and  adopted  an  Opinion  on  the  three  Type  II  variations  on  27  July  2000.  The respective Commission Decisions were issued on 18 November 2000.
