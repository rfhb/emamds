## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Zavesca. This scientific discussion  has  been  updated  until  1  April  2003.  For  information  on  changes  after  this  date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Zavesca contains  the  active  substance,  miglustat.  Miglustat  is  a  synthetic  derivative  of  a  family  of polyhydroxylated alkaloids or imino sugars extracted from plants and microorganisms.  The chemical name for miglustat is 1,5 (Butylimino)-1,5-dideoxy-D-glucitol.  Miglustat has a molecular weight of 219 and the following chemical structure:

Miglustat reduces the biosynthesis of glucosylceramide from ceramide through the inhibition of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase. Glucosylceramide is the first committed step in the synthesis of some 300 to 400 glycosphingolipids. This inhibitory action forms the rationale for substrate reduction therapy  in  Gaucher  disease  for  which  excessive  accumulation  of  glucosylceramide  underlies  the pathogenesis.

In  spite  of  being  ubiquitous  components  of  eukaryotic  cells,  the  exact  biological  functions  of glycosphingolipids  have  not  been  clarified. In  vitro studies  have  indicated  that  glycosphingolipids (GSLs)  can  contribute  to  cell  growth,  differentiation,  cell  to  cell  and  cell  to  matrix  interactions, membrane  organisation  and  signalling.  Ceramide,  apart  from  being  one  of  the  building  blocks  for sphingolipids (GSLs and sphingomyelins), is also a potent signalling molecule. Glucosylceramide has been  shown  to  be  important  in  maintaining  axonal  growth  in  experimental in  vitro systems.  The consequences of glucosylceramide depletion in human are not well understood.

Miglustat also inhibits the  following enzymes  at  different IC50: α -glucosidase I and  II, the disaccharidases sucrase and maltase, lactase (weak  inhibition), lysosomal and non-lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. α -glucosidases  are N -linked  oligosaccharide  processing  enzymes  important  for protein  folding  and  protein  function.  The  inhibition  of  disaccharidases  probably  accounts  for  the abdominal symptoms and osmotic diarrhoea that complicate miglustat treatment (see pre-clinical and clinical  sections  of  this  report).  Non-lysosomal  glucocerebrosidase  may  have  a  role  in  ceramide mediated signal transduction and the potential effects of this inhibition are unknown.

Gaucher disease is the most common glycosphingolipid lysosomal storage disorder and the first to be treated  by  enzyme  replacement.  It  is  an  inherited  functional  deficiency  of  glucosylceramidase, alternatively known as glucocerebrosidase, a β -glucosidase. The lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase is responsible for the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) into free glucose and ceramide.  Reduced activity of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of GlcCer in macrophages and underlies the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease.

The  inheritance  of  Gaucher  disease  is  autosomal  recessive  and  is  most  commonly  found  among Ashkenazi Jews. It is estimated that the prevalence of Gaucher disease - all types - was less than 0.6 per  10,000  in  the  EU  at  the  time  the  application  was  made.  The  relationships  between  the  mutant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alleles,  consequent  enzyme  variants,  activator  proteins  and  the  phenotypes  of  the  disease  remain poorly understood.

Classification of Gaucher disease is based on the age of onset and clinical features.  Type 1 disease (adult) is characteristically non-neuronopathic and accounts for approximately 99% of cases.  Type 2 (infantile) is the most severe neuronopathic form and is generally fatal by 2 years of age.

Type 3 disease (juvenile) is characterised by subacute neuropathological symptoms  and is intermediate in severity.

Patients  with  type  1  Gaucher  disease  can  be  affected  by  visceral  enlargement,  bleeding  tendency caused  by  thrombocytopenia,  recurrent  infections  and  repeated  episodes  of  bone  pain  caused  by infarction.    Bone  infarction  can  lead  to  growth  retardation  and  skeletal  deformities.  Osteoporosis  is nearly universal in these patients. The course of type 1 Gaucher disease is variable. Most patients have a normal life expectancy, though overwhelming sepsis, possibly exacerbated by the loss of the spleen, can be the cause of death.  Patients with type 1 Gaucher disease also appear to have an excess risk for the development of malignancies, especially lymphoproliferative disorders.

The management of type 1 Gaucher disease was based on supportive measures until the 1990's.  These included  orthopaedic  procedures  and  splenectomy.  Various  dose  regimens  of  recombinant  enzyme (Cerezyme)  are  now  used.  Although  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  has  been  successful  in alleviating the effects of the type 1 Gaucher disease, the response may be incomplete in some patients with  a  degree  of  residual  organomegaly,  haematological  abnormalities  or  elevated  biochemical markers  of  disease.  The  skeletal  response  to  ERT  is  slower  and  less  robust  than  the  response  of visceral organs. About 15% of patients develop IgG antibodies to ERT but anaphylactoid reactions are very rare. Pulmonary hypertension has also been observed in patients receiving ERT but that is also a rare feature of the disease independent of ERT. The need for regular intravenous administration is an important consideration for the affected patients.

Zavesca is indicated for the oral treatment of mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease. Zavesca may be used only in the treatment of patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC). Therapy with Zavesca should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher disease. The recommended starting dose for the treatment of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is 100 mg administered orally three times a day.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Zavesca  contains  100  mg  of  miglustat  as  active  ingredient  and  it  is  presented  in  the  form  of  hard capsules.

Conventional pharmaceutical excipients (sodium starch glycollate, povidone, and magnesium stearate) have been selected and the rationale for the selection of the individual excipients is also given. The capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide. The printing ink contains black iron oxide, shellac, soya lecithin and antifoam.

The product is packaged in Aclar/Alu blisters.

## Active Substance

Miglustat  is  a  single  stereoisomer  of  an  imino  sugar.  It  is  a  white  crystalline  material,  which  is highly soluble in water (greater than 1 g/ml at ambient temperature).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are 4 chiral centres; miglustat is used in this application in the RRRS-enantiomer. The structure has been established unequivocally by single x-ray crystallography, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, Mass spectroscopy and specific optical rotation.

Various routes of synthesis have been applied in the manufacture of the active substance during the pharmaceutical,  pre-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  the  product.  The  proposed  commercial synthesis of miglustat is a 4-stage process starting with (D+)- glucose and n-butylamine. This process has been validated particularly with regard to stereoisomerism.

Batch analysis results indicate that the batches manufactured using all the different synthetic routes are practically identical with respect to quality and, particularly, the impurity profile.

## Active substance specification

The active substance specification includes tests for identity (infrared spectroscopy,  HPLC, polarimetry), assay (HPLC, 98 - 102%) and a number of purity tests for related substances (HPLC and TLC), residual solvents (GC). The specification also includes a test for microbiological control. The analytical methods used in the routine controls are suitability described. The validations studies submitted are in accordance with the ICH Guidelines.

Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies relevant to the chosen method of synthesis.

Batch analyses include eleven batches of active substance. The batch analysis data show that miglustat can be synthesised reproducibly according to the agreed specification.

## Stability

Stability  studies  have  been  performed  on  seven  full  manufacturing  scale  batches  of  miglustat. These batches were stored following the guidelines of the ICH at accelerated and long-term storage conditions.

The  parameters  studied  were  appearance,  colour  and  clarity,  melting  point  and  range,  miglustat identity by HPLC, specific optical rotation, HPLC assay of miglustat content, HPLC assay and TLC determination of miglustat related substances, moisture content by LOD and KF, total viable aerobic count  (every  12  months).  The  test  methods  employed  during  the  stability  studies  are  stabilityindicating and the same methods that were used for the control of active substance at release.

The tests carried out in these studies are sufficient to establish the retest period for miglustat.

## Other Ingredients

Sodium starch glycollate, povidone, and magnesium stearate are of Ph Eur/USP quality. Certificates of analyses are provided and show compliance with respective monographs.

The Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin, and statements concerning the absence of risk for TSE transmission  are  provided.  Certificates  of  Suitability  by  the  EDQM  on  minimising  the  risk  of transmission  of  TSE  for  the  gelatine  are  also  supplied.  Specifications  of  the  capsule  shells  are provided, including an identification test for titanium dioxide.

The  printing  ink  used  for  the  capsules  is  a  proprietary  mixture  and  its  specification  includes  an identification test for black iron oxide.

Zavesca  capsules  are  supplied  in  Aclar/Alu  blister  packs.  The  suppliers  have  provided  technical specifications, which comply with the current EU requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Finished Product

The development pharmaceutics have taken into consideration the physicochemical characteristics of the active drug substance, such as high aqueous solubility, hygroscopic properties, stability, particle size, polymorphism and biopharmaceutical issues such as dissolution rate.

The  compatibility  of  the  active  drug  substance  with  excipients,  content  uniformity  and  chemical stability  in  the  presence  of  excipients  was  also  examined.  Conventional  pharmaceutical  excipients have been selected and the function of each individual excipient is standard and well-known.

The  process  for  the  manufacturing  of  the  finished  product  follows  conventional  pharmaceutical practices, which utilise a blending step, granulation, encapsulation, and packaging. The manufacturing process has been adequately validated and is satisfactory. The in process controls are adequate for this capsule  preparation.  Based  on  data  presented  it  is  concluded  that  the  blending  and  granulation processes have been satisfactorily qualified according to the parameters conventionally applied to a product of this type.

The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  capsules  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## Product Specification

The  specification  includes  tests  by  validated  methods  for  identification  (IR  and  HPLC),  assay (standard limits, i.e. 95-105% by HPLC of the labelled quantity of miglustat), degradation products and impurities (HPLC and TLC), uniformity of mass and uniformity of contents.

The tests and limits of the release and shelf life specification for the finished product are appropriate to control the quality of Zavesca 100 mg capsules for their intended purpose.

## Stability of the Product

In total three batches of Zavesca 100 mg capsules were evaluated for stability using a range of challenge ICH stability conditions (25 ° C/60% RH, 30 ° C/60% RH and 40 ° C/75% RH) stored for up to 12 months in Aclar/Alu packs.

Supportive stability data are also available for three batches of Zavesca 100 mg capsules and Zavesca 50 mg capsules stored at ICH conditions in double aluminium blisters for up to six months, and three batches of Zavesca 50 mg stored in Aclar packs for up to 12 months.

As a conclusion from the stability studies, the results indicate satisfactory stability and support the shelf life stated in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  Zavesca  100  mg  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for the marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

In general, this is a standard oral formulation of a very soluble active substance, and no problems of bioavailability may arise from pharmaceutical quality aspects of the product.

The active substance is well characterised and documented. The excipients are commonly used in this kind of formulation; the packaging material is well documented and meets Ph Eur requirements. The manufacturing  process  of  finished  product  has  been  adequately  described.  The  quality  defined  is supported by all data provided in the dossier.

The stability data of the finished product in the proposed packaging has been adequately demonstrated and supports the proposed expiry date.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

The  proposed  mode  of  action  of  miglustat  in  the  treatment  of  Gaucher  disease  is  based  on  its inhibitory  activity  against  glucosylceramide  synthase,  an  enzyme  in  the  first  synthetic  step  of numerous glycosphingolipids and a key component in the regulation of intracellular levels of ceramide and  glycosphingolipids. In  vitro, IC 50 s  of  20-40 µ M against  glucosylceramide  synthase  have  been reported. The proposed clinical dosing regimen is related to plasma Cmax values of approximately 9 µ M. The IC50 values for miglustat with respect to glucocerebrosidase, the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease and a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity, an integral membrane protein, were  520  and  0.31 µ M,  respectively.  The  potential  physiological/pathological  responses  to  an inhibition of the latter enzyme are not known.

Possible biochemical consequences of an inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis include increased levels of ceramide and diversion of glycosphingolipid synthesis into the galactosylceramide pathway. One literature study reports increased levels of sphingomyelin in mouse liver, suggesting conversion of  excess  ceramide  along  this  axis.  Under  conditions  where  the  galactosylceramide  pathway  is inhibited,  diversion  into  the  glucosylceramide  synthase  route  has  been  shown,  but  the  opposite reactions seem less likely although there are indications that this is possible.

The  pharmacological  studies  conducted  with  miglustat  are  rather  limited.  The  lack  of  studies  with respect to the desired target enzyme is explained by its specific intracellular localisation in the Golgi apparatus. Studies on the specificity and selectivity with respect to cell types and enzymes could have been valuable. In the literature it is reported that miglustat inhibits the glycogen debranching enzyme 4α -glucanotransferase  with  an  IC50 of  4.5 µ M. Miglustat is  also  a  potent  inhibitor  of  glucosidases with  an,  IC 50 for α -glucosidases  in  porcine  and  rat  liver  of  0.36 µ M.  Limited  experimental  data indicates  that  the  difference  in  potency  against  glucosylceramide  synthase  and  glucosidase in  vitro may not translate to the in vivo situation  possibly in part depending on different subcellular sites of location of the two enzymes. Miglustat also has inhibitory activity against the intestinal disaccharidases sucrase and maltase. The lack of specificity and the fact that the enzyme targeted is the  first  in  an  extensive  synthetic  pathway  may  provide  an  explanation  for  some  of  the  adverse reactions  associated  with  miglustat  therapy.  A  correlation  between  the  extent  of  enzyme  inhibition, changes in glycosphingolipid synthesis and pathological reactions is not possible. In mouse, depletion of  approximately  50%  of  liver  and  spleen  glycosphingolipids,  achieved  after  about  4  months  of treatment, was tolerated without any overt signs of toxicity, but body weight decreased.

## In vivo studies

In  normal mice, miglustat administration in the diet was well tolerated without diarrhoea, but body weights were significantly lower compared with control mice. Ganglioside GM2 depletion measured after  10  days  treatment  was  about  25%  in  liver  at  a  dose  of  600  mg/kg/day.  There  are  no  animal models of Gaucher disease. In mouse embryos, survival was not compatible with homozygosity for the glucosylceramide synthase gene, indicating that activity is essential for normal development and differentiation.  In  mouse  models  of  related  diseases,  such  as  Tay-Sachs  and  Sandhoff,  miglustat treatment seemed to ameliorate disease progression. The doses in these studies, up to 4800 mg/kg for up to 12 weeks, were near maximum possible doses. In Tay-Sachs mice, with central nervous system storage of glycosphingolipids, brain levels of abnormally stored glycosphingolipids were reduced after oral  doses  of  miglustat.  Small  spleens  and  thymuses were noted, but  no  overt toxicity. In Sandhoff mice  treated  with  up  to  4800  mg/kg/day,  life  expectancy  was  increased  by  approximately  40%. Miglustat treatment in Niemann-Pick C mice, in which the gene defect is associated with defective intracellular trafficking and accumulation of cholesterol in the liver and spleen, and gangliosides (GM2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and GM3), lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide in neuronal tissue, prolonged the life-span of mice and decreased the storage of lipids. Type 1 Gaucher disease is considered to have no involvement on the central nervous system (CNS).

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Recombinant  glucocerebrosidase  given  by  intravenous  injection  is  a  current  treatment  for  type  1 Gaucher disease. Potential interactions with miglustat were studied in mice treated for 5 weeks with miglustat and then given 5-10 U/kg of glucocerebrosidase intravenously and activity and enzyme halflife  were  determined.  Data  indicated  enhanced  activity  of the  enzyme  as  well  as  increased  half-life (2.1 min in controls and 3.36 min in treated mice).

## General and safety pharmacology programme

General pharmacology studies were limited and functional effects on the CNS, cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal system, only, were investigated. Single doses of up to 27 mg/kg iv in dog, 700 mg/kg ig in rat and 600 mg/kg ig in mouse had no remarkable effect on the parameters studied. Effects on renal and respiratory systems were not studied. The potential for immunotoxicity was considered in relation to repeated dose toxicity studies. Only the perbutyrated analogue was tested and the study was rather  limited.  The  limited  scope  of  general  pharmacology  studies  is  accepted,  as  acute  effects  are unlikely and repeated dose toxicity studies overall covered relevant aspects.

In vitro studies using foetal fibroblasts and peritoneal macrophages indicated that miglustat at levels up to 6 mg/ml did not affect PGE2 synthesis. No anti-inflammatory activity was thus evident.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  miglustat  and  its  perbutyrated  analogue  were  studied.  Tritium-labelled miglustat  was  used  in  part  of  these  studies  and  results  are  based  on  radioactivity  measurements.  In other studies on metabolism and disposition, 14 C-labelled compound was used.

Pharmacokinetic  data  are  available  for  most  species  used  in  toxicology  studies,  but  are  somewhat limited. There are no data on excretion into breast milk. Distribution studies have not been conducted with miglustat, but with the perbutyrated prodrug, only. Systemic bioavailability of total radioactivity, the  majority  of  which  was  accounted  for  by  miglustat,  was  approximately  82%  in  rat  and  64%  in rhesus monkey after administration of 14 C-labelled perbutyrated analogue. At molar equivalent doses systemic availability of miglustat from the perbutyrated analogue in monkey was about 38% of that of the active substance. However, at equimolar doses in dogs, maximum plasma levels of miglustat after administration of the prodrug, were 5% of levels obtained with the parent compound. In monkey and dog there was some evidence of partially de-esterified intermediates in plasma, faeces or urine. These data indicate that miglustat toxicity after administration of the prodrug may be better characterized in rat and monkey models than in dog.

Pharmacokinetics of miglustat seem overall fairly uncomplicated with essentially no or very limited metabolism,  no  protein  binding  and  excretion  predominantly  into  urine.  Less  than  10%  of  a radioactive dose was found in faeces in mouse and rat. Renal clearance in mouse and rat was greater than creatinine clearance, consistent with active renal secretion. This was not seen in rhesus monkey or dog. The volume of distribution (Vd) was 0.76 and 0.71 l/kg in dog and monkey, respectively. In mouse and rat, Vd was greater. Distribution of label after administration of the prodrug at 137 mg/kg was extensive with high levels detected in the GI-tract, urinary bladder and kidney. Tissue to plasma ratios of AUC ranged from 10 to 50. Maximum plasma levels were reached in 1 to 2.7 hours in rat and monkey, respectively. Corresponding value in human was 2 hours. The AUC in brain in a mouse study accounted  for  about  20%  of  the  plasma  AUC  and  35%  in  a  rat  study  in  which  the  perbutyrated analogue  was  administered.  Overall,  these  characteristics  indicated  that  species  used  in  toxicology studies  could  all  be  considered  as  relevant  models.  In  rat  and  monkey,  there  was  evidence  of accumulation of miglustat. In rat, steady-state values appeared to be reached in 26 weeks. In general

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

there were no significant difference in systemic exposure of males and females, but in the 52-week rat study males tended to have values higher than females.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  studies  with  miglustat  comprise  of  2  mouse  and  1  rat  study  and  were  not conducted  according  to  current  practices.  Nevertheless,  the  studies  allow  the  conclusion  that  the compound has a low potential for acute toxic effects by the oral route.

## Repeated dose toxicity

The  toxicity  of  miglustat  and  the  perbutyrated  analogue  was  investigated  in  studies  in  mouse,  rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. Doses of 20-4200 mg/kg/day in rat, 20-825 mg/kg/day in dog and 60-1650 mg/kg/day in monkey were tested. The NOEL was 20-60 mg/kg/day in a rat 13-week study and 60 mg/kg/day  in  a  5-week  intravenous  monkey  study,  corresponding  to  AUCs  approximately  x1  and approximately x5 the expected clinical value, respectively. Exposure at the low dose in other studies ranged  from  approximately  x2-x5  the  expected  clinical  level  and  it  seems  clear  that  no  significant margins of exposure will exist at a NOEL. Chronic toxicity studies are available in the rat only, but a 12-month toxicity study in monkey using the prodrug has been submitted. Toxicokinetic data in the monkey study showed exposure to the active substance and the study could be accepted as the nonrodent chronic toxicity study.

Severe toxicity, deterioration of clinical condition and/or gastrointestinal toxicity, was apparent in rats at repeated doses of over 840 mg/kg/day and in dogs at approximately 85 mg/kg/day, corresponding to AUC levels x8-x18 the expected clinical levels. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity with bloody stools, congestion of the mucosa of small/large intestine, hyperaemia and occasional necrosis of villus tips was most prominent in dogs. Tolerance was better towards the perbutyrated analogue. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are also reported in the clinic and may be related to the inhibitory activity of miglustat on disaccharidases. In most repeated dose toxicity studies decreased body weight gain was recorded. The gastrointestinal effects of miglustat are reflected in section 5.3 of the SPC.

Serum chemistry changes e.g. increases in AST and ALT were noted in rat studies, and also in dog and  monkey.  A  histopathological  correlate  in  the  liver  was  evident  only  in  rare  cases.  In  rhesus monkey,  single  cell  necrosis  was  noted  after  4  weeks  and  doses  of  1650  mg/kg/day.  In  a  doseescalating study in dogs as well as in the 10-week rat study ALP increased while in most other studies decreases  were  reported.  A  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  at  high  doses  cannot  be  excluded.  Toxicity may be secondary to other effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity. The effects on transaminase levels of miglustat are adequately addressed in the SPC.

Haematological  examinations  showed  decreases  in  red  blood  cell  parameters.  White  blood  cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes were also decreased. Platelets were lowered in most studies. In rat, the appearance  of  giant  platelets  was  reported.  In  the  52-week  monkey  study,  2  high  dose  animals exhibited depletion of granulocytic cell line storage pool. In vitro studies in human bone marrow cells indicated effects of miglustat on neutrophils.

Decreased thymus and spleen weights were reported in several studies in the rat, and in one monkey study (4-week, gastric intubation study). Lymphocyte depletion in submaxillary and mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus and spleen was reported in the rat and in the thymus and spleen in the monkey. The data  indicate  that  miglustat  may  have  a  potential  for  interaction  with  the  immune  system,  but  the findings were likely secondary to debilitation after long-term, high-dose miglustat treatment. This has been considered in the SPC.

Cardiovascular  and  autonomic  parameters  were  not  remarkably  affected  after  a  single  intravenous infusion  of  miglustat  in  dogs.  In  the  52-week  study  in  rat,  cardiac  myopathy,  or  myocardial degeneration  and  fibrosis  complex,  was  considered  an  exacerbation  of  a  strain  specific  pathology. Myocarditis  was  noted  in  some  monkeys  (rhesus)  in  a  4-week  study.  In  the  52-week  monkey

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(cynomolgus)  study  at  the  high  dose  that  provided  systemic  exposure  levels  of  miglustat  of approximately x 4-7 the expected clinical exposure, males exhibited prolonged QRS and one animal had  a  second  degree  AV  block.  No in  vitro electrophysiological  studies  have  been  performed. Literature data show that ceramide may inhibit L-type calcium channels. Taken together the results suggest a potential for myocardial changes cannot be excluded and this is reflected in the SPC.

Tail  lesions,  scaly  tail  and  acanthosis/hyperkeratosis,  were  noted  in  3  rat  studies  after  oral  dosing. Literature  data  report  that  sphingolipid  content  and  ratios  in  the  stratum  corneum  are  essential  for maintenance of epidermal permeability barrier. Effects on the tail were not seen in other studies in e.g. mice, and taken together the data do not indicate any generalised effect on skin function. A difference in rodent and human skin barrier biology suggests that skin changes and consequent reactions may not be expected in humans .

Equatorial cataracts were noted in the 1-year rat study. Changes were transitory at AUC levels x 6-7 the expected clinical AUC, indicating a lower level of cause for concern. The reason for the transitory nature  of  cataracts  in  the  rat  is  not  clear.  The  finding  seems  coupled  to  high  doses  and  prolonged exposure. The cataracts have been addressed in section 5.3 of the SPC.

An increased incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy was also reported for treated rats in the six-month toxicity study with the perbutyrated analogue. Furthermore, kidney changes were seen at the  microscopic  examination  in  all  treatment  groups  in  one  13-week  study  in  male  rats.  Although effects  on  the  kidneys  did  not  appear  consistent  over  studies  it  is  difficult  to  exclude  a  possible treatment-related effect. A statement on the potential nephropathy has been included in the SPC .

Effects on the CNS were not evident in short-term tests. The potential for long- term effects is difficult to assess from  available repeated dose toxicity studies. Brain is rich in glycosphingolipids. Distribution studies showed  that penetration into brain occurs and progressive depletion of gangliosides may take place. Given the nature of the compound and the diverse pathways involved, a theoretical potential for adverse neurological effects is difficult to exclude. Relevant sections in the SPC consider these aspects (also see clinical discussion).

Vacuolation of various organs, thyroid, pancreas and the GI-tract, was reported both with miglustat and  its  perbutyrated  analogue.  According  to  the  literature,  vacuolation  seen  with  the  perbutyrated analogue  resembles  that  seen  in  humans  with  genetic  glycogenosis  Type  II  or  Pompe's  disease, conditions  where  1,4α -glucosidase  is  lacking.  Inhibition  of  host α -glucosidase  may lead to altered glycoprotein processing and accumulation of incompletely metabolised oligosaccharides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of affected cells. The consensus appears to be that it is likely these kinds of changes can be accommodated and are not coupled to functional effects.

## Reproduction toxicity

A range of reproduction toxicity studies was conducted in rat and rabbit. None of the studies included toxicokinetic  measurements.  If  systemic  exposure  data  from  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  are extrapolated to these studies, the high dose of 180 mg/kg/day in some studies would correspond to approximately  2-3  times  the  expected  clinical  exposure.  A  major  target  organ  in  rat  was  the  male reproductive tract, with impairment of fertility and specific studies addressed the issue. A NOEL could not be identified, but effects were apparent at the low dose of 20 mg/kg/day. In repeated dose toxicity studies the effects were characterised by decreased spermatogenesis, hypospermia in the epididymides, decreased sperm concentrations and increased incidence of abnormal sperm morphology.    The  pivotal  reproduction  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  GLP principles.  In  the  male  fertility  study,  the  velocity,  morphology  and  concentration  of  sperms  were adversely affected, but the ability to fertilise an ovum was unchanged. Ova that were fertilised seemed to develop normally. A \"bell-shaped\" dose-response was noted with an increase in number of headless sperm  and  sperms  with  reduced  hook.  Specific  studies  showed  that  in  rat,  13-weeks  of  treatment followed  by  a  similar  treatment  free  period  was  sufficient  to  reverse  the  effects  on  male  fertility. Reversibility  after  long-term  treatment  is  not  clear.  Sections  4.4,  4.6  and  5.3  of  the  SPC  include appropriate warnings on the potential reproduction toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reproductive effects in females included increased post-implantation loss and early embryonic death, increased  duration  of  gestation  and  dystocia.  There  is  thus  a  potential  that  teratogenicity  may  be superseded by toxicity at high doses. Studies indicate that miglustat crosses the placenta. An increase in incomplete ossification was seen in embryotoxicity studies. In rabbits, a dose-dependent increase in foetuses with an additional blood vessel arising from the aortic arch was noted. This was categorised as  a  variant  and  stated  to  be  a  common  observation  in  rabbits.  Offspring  from  dams  treated  with miglustat exhibited lower body weights and survival and tended to perform less well in the rotarod test.  Delayed  maturity  was  evident  in  development  of  female  reproductive  systems.  These  findings have been adequately reflected in the SPC.

## Genotoxicity

The potential for genotoxicity was evaluated in gene mutation tests in bacteria, tests for chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus study. Cytotoxic levels were reached with the perbutyrated analogue, but not with miglustat. Both compounds gave overall negative results in the tests.

## Oncogenic/Carcinogenic Potential

Studies  on  the  potential  for  genotoxicity  were  negative.  No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been conducted  in  accordance  with  a  CPMP  scientific  advice.  However,  the  applicant  is  currently conducting a 104-Week Rat Carcinogenicity Study as part of an agreement with the FDA.

## Local Tolerance

The sensitisation potential of miglustat was studied in a mouse ear-swelling test. Miglustat dissolved in distilled water was non-irritating at 10% to abdominal skin and 30% was non-irritating to the ear. Miglustat was not a sensitiser in this test.

Primary dermal irritation of miglustat was investigated in an exploratory rabbit study. Miglustat was classified as \"very mildly irritating\".

## Special Toxicity Studies

In  female  mice treated  with  miglustat for  118  days at 600, 1200 and 1800  mg/kg/day as escalating doses,  spleen  and  thymus  weights  were  reduced  by  treatment  and  this  was  coupled  to  reduced cellularity. Plasma levels ranged from 18 to 57 µ M, levels considerably higher than expected clinical levels. The cellular composition was altered such that cells positive for T-cell markers were increased and  B-cells  reduced.  The  changes  showed  reversibility.  The  mechanism  of  these  changes  is  not known. Potential effects on the immune system were considered particularly during the development of miglustat as an anti-HIV therapy. Miglustat reduced CD4 levels in human lymphoid cell line H9. Treatment for 10 days by intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg did not affect splenocytes. The studies concluded that there were no direct toxic effects on the immune system.

In  vitro ,  miglustat  inhibits  the  glycogen  debranching enzyme  4α -glucanotransferase (IC50=4.5 µ M) and related compounds have been shown to inhibit α -1,6-glucosidase. At doses of 2400 mg/kg/day miglustat  may  impair  glycogen  breakdown  as  shown  in  studies  in  mice  where  glycogen  content  in starved  treated  mice  was  more  than  twice  as  high  as  in  control  starved  mice.  However,  apparently there is no progressive accumulation and no associated pathology in mice treated over 6 months.

## Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment

An environmental risk assessment has been considered. Due to the rarity of the disorder and the doses proposed to be used no toxic hazard to the general population can be anticipated and the dilution in normal domestic waste stream ensures that biota in the environmental media will not be at risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GLP Status

Pivotal  studies  on  repeated  dose  toxicity,  reproduction  toxicity  and  genotoxic  potential  were conducted in accordance with GLP principles. Studies on general pharmacology were limited and not in  compliance  with  GLP  principles;  the  Company  provided  an  acceptable  justification  for  this deficiency.

## Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects

The documentation on the pharmacology of miglustat is somewhat limited while toxicology studies overall  provide  an  adequate  characterisation  of  the  toxic  effects  that  the  compound  can  produce. Miglustat has shown in vitro activity against an enzyme in a pathway relevant for Gaucher disease. The  inhibitory  activity  is  not  specific  for  glucosylceramide  synthase.  The  target  enzyme  is  a  key component in the regulation of intracellular levels of ceramide and glycosphingolipids and this as well as the non-selectivity, may be related to toxic effects seen at high doses. There is no in vivo animal model for Gaucher disease. Efficacy in in vivo animal models has been shown in related models of lysosomal storage diseases, including those with a neurological involvement.

Repeated dose toxicity studies showed a wide range of potential targets both with the active substance and the perbutyrated analogue. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity was evident in dogs. Serum chemistry changes, haematological changes and decreased body weights were noted in other studies. Vacuolation  of  various  organs  including  thyroid,  pancreas  and  liver  were  recorded.  Reproduction toxicity  studies  showed  embryo/foetotoxic  potential  and  impaired  fertility  in  males,  which  showed reversibility after a treatment free period. Organ  weight  changes  occurred.  Cardiomyopathy, nephropathy,  possible  exacerbations  of  an  underlying  pathology,  were  other  findings  in  rat  studies. Equatorial cataracts were noted at high doses in the 1-year rat study. A potential for interference with the  immune  system  has  been  discussed.  Miglustat  did  not  seem  to  have  any  genotoxic  activity.  A NOEL, corresponding to x1 to x5 the expected clinical AUC could only be identified in 2 repeat dose toxicity studies of 13 and 5 weeks duration, respectively. Margins of exposure at doses associated with pathophysiological findings can be expected to be modest in general, but as studies were conducted in healthy/normal  animals,  higher  values  might  be  expected  under  conditions  of  glycosphingolipid storage in cases where toxicity can be coupled to an exaggerated pharmacological effect.

The  available  experimental  data  are  not  sufficient  to  allow  any  definitive  conclusion  on  the relationship  of  all  toxic  effects  and  treatment  with  miglustat.  In  this  context  additional  studies  on target organ toxicity in relation to the planned long-term studies would be valuable. The applicant has committed to conduct a preclinical study to further assess the neurotoxic potential of miglustat and will also conduct a Juvenile Growth Study in the Rat.  Until the results have been evaluated, the use in children cannot be recommended (see clinical discussion). In addition, the applicant is conducting a further pre-clinical dose range finding study in the mouse  to support the planned mouse carcinogenicity study.

It is possible that some of the findings, e.g. nephropathy and cardiac myopathy may not be clinically relevant and  represent artefactual  changes,  chance  occurrences  or  exacerbation  of  underlying pathology.  General  debilitation  of  animals  may  also  be  a  factor.  However,  a  direct  relation  to treatment considering the biochemical pathways involved cannot be excluded. These effects appeared at  the  high  doses,  but  in  terms  of  systemic  exposure  margins  to  clinical,  levels  were  not  that  high. Other  factors  to  consider  are  that  changes  can  be  expected  to  exhibit  progressive  development  as depletion of glycosphingolipids is expected to occur progressively and that the capacity of homeostatic mechanisms to counteract intracellular disturbances may be unpredictable.

The  extent  of  enzyme  inhibition  as  well  as  the  amount  of  residual  enzyme  activity  likely  exhibits considerable interindividual differences. This together with individual variations in general sensitivity suggests that until additional data becomes available the safety of the compound should be carefully monitored  (see  clinical  discussion).  Pre-clinical  findings  have  been  appropriately  considered  in  the SPC based on currently available data.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

The rationale for the investigation of miglustat in clinical trials in glycosphingolipid storage diseases is  based  on  i n  vitro data  showing  that  miglustat  reduces  glycosphingolipid  synthesis  by  inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase (GCS).

The Zavesca capsules proposed for marketing are identical to the formulation used in clinical studies.

## Pharmacodynamics

The site of action of miglustat in the biosynthetic pathways of glycosphingolipids:

<!-- image -->

The human pharmacodynamic data are limited. The effects of miglustat on glycosphingolipids were shown  using  estimation  of  GM1  ganglioside  and  plasma  glucosylceramide  in  a  small  number  of patients. GM1 ganglioside on leukocytes is the main source of stored glycolipids. These limited data lend  support  to  an in  vivo effect  of  miglustat  in  reducing  plasma  glucosylceramide  but  there  is  no information  on  the  amount  of  inhibition  of  the  enzyme  glucosylceramide  synthase  at  the  proposed dose.

GM1  analysis  on  leukocytes  was  performed  for  7  subjects  and  there  was  no  notable  change  from baseline  in  GM1  at  Month  6,  with  a  mean  percentage  increase  of  0.5%  (p=0.981).    At  Month  12, however, there was a statistically significant mean percentage decrease of 4273 binding sites per cell or  38.5%  from  baseline  (p=0.006).    This  decline  in  cell  surface  GM1  expression  on  leukocytes confirmed  the  ability  of  miglustat  to  lower  the  rate  of  glycolipid  biosynthesis.  The  results  showed consistency between reductions in cell surface GM1 in the clinical setting and the results of the preclinical  studies  given  that,  during  treatment,  miglustat  serum  concentrations  ranged  approximately between trough levels of 0.8 µ g/ml and peak levels of 1.6 µ g/ml.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Plasma  concentrations  of  glucosylceramide  were  measured  in  a  subgroup  of  eight  subjects  on miglustat.  The mean GlcCer concentration at baseline was 14.2 nmol/ml. There were mean decreases from  baseline  of  2.2  and  2.8 nmol/ml  at  Months  6  and  12  respectively  (p=0.074  and  p=0.172, respectively).

Plasma  oligosaccharide  analysis  was  carried  out  in  6  patients  on  miglustat  to  assess  the  effect  of miglustat on α -glucosidase. There was no notable increase in the percentage of N -linked glycosylated glycan  and  it  was  concluded  that  there  was  no  major  inhibitory  effect  on N -glycan-processing α -glucosidases at the concentration used.

No  formal  dose-finding  studies  have  been  performed  for  miglustat.  The  justification  for  a  dose regimen in humans aiming at a plasma level of 1-2 µg/ml is based on data obtained from a human cell line.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  miglustat  has  been  characterised  in  three  clinical  studies  in  82 Gaucher subjects (studies OGT 918-001, -003, and -004), one clinical study in 16 Fabry subjects (study OGT 918-002), and five clinical  studies in  over  100  HIV  positive  or  AIDS  subjects  (studies NS8-93-06-001,  NS8-93-06-004,  NS8-94-06-009,  NS8-93-06-010,  and  NQ3-94-06-101).  A  relative bioavailability  and  food  effect  study  has  been  performed  in  healthy  volunteers.  Data  from  patients with Gaucher and Fabry diseases were included in a population pharmacokinetic evaluation to assess the influence of demographic characteristics and renal and hepatic function on miglustat pharmacokinetics. In Gaucher disease single and multiple doses (TID) of 50 and 100 mg were used and in HIV/AIDS patients doses up to 1000 mg TID.

In study OGT 918-001 and the studies in HIV patients, miglustat was determined in plasma and urine by HPLC and electrochemical detection. In studies OGT 918-002, 3 and 4 an LC-MS method was used. Linearity in plasma and urine was demonstrated for miglustat over the range 30-5000 ng/ml for the HPLC-EDT method and 5-400 ng/ml for the LC-MS method.

Non-compartmental  analysis  was  usually  used  for  calculation of  pharmacokinetic  parameters. Population pharmacokinetics was performed using NONMEM. Descriptive statistics were used.

Miglustat  was  shown  to  be  rapidly  absorbed  and  maximum  plasma  concentrations  are  reached  on average 2-2.5 h after dose. The absolute bioavailability has not been determined.

tmax values are median with range of values in parentheses The dosing interval was 6/6/12 h

The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was estimated to be 83 ± 22 l. Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is 230 ± 39 ml/min. The average half-life is 6-7 h.

Miglustat  displays  dose-proportional  pharmacokinetics.  Results  from  between  study  comparison  in Gaucher  subjects  have  shown  that  the  pharmacokinetics  is  approximately  proportional  following dosing  with  50 mg  and  100 mg  (single  doses  and  TID  dosing),  see  table  below.  Additionally,  data from a study in AIDS subjects have shown that miglustat pharmacokinetics is dose proportional in the dose  range  2  to  16 mg/kg  (approximately  140-1120 mg  total  dose).  AUC0τ at  steady-state  (TID dosing) is comparable to AUC0-∞ following a single dose, see table below, which is a rough indication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that miglustat exhibits linear, time-invariant pharmacokinetics. Approximate Cmax (concentration at 2.5 h  after  dose)  and  C min measured  for  up  to  12 months  on  TID  dosing  are  stable,  further  supporting pharmacokinetic linearity.

The inter-individual variability in AUC is 22% and in Cmax about 10-15%.

The  data  provided  regarding  urinary  excretion  suggest  that  about  50%  of  an  oral  dose  is  excreted unchanged in urine. Without information regarding the bioavailability of miglustat these data cannot be  properly  assessed.  Data  from  preclinical  studies  and  a  mass  balance  study  of  the  prodrug  of miglustat strongly indicate renal elimination of miglustat. Thus, there is no major concern regarding the elimination of miglustat, but further data are needed and the Company has committed to perform appropriate studies to elucidate the elimination of miglustat in man.

Renal clearance is about 150 ml/min, suggesting that the renal elimination is mainly through filtration and that the risk for interactions with drugs eliminated by active secretion is low.

Several  markers  of  efficacy  (liver  response,  spleen  response,  platelet  response,  and  haemoglobin response, measured at the 6-month time point in the Gaucher population) and two adverse events of interest  (diarrhoea  and  tremor)  were  evaluated  using  logistic  regression,  to  determine  if  plasma concentrations were predictive of any particular adverse event or efficacy outcome.

A relationship between the efficacy marker reduction in spleen volume and plasma concentration of miglustat was demonstrated. Data from the extension studies have shown that significant improvements  in  haemoglobin  and  platelets  take  longer  time  to  develop  (up  to  18 months); consequently  the  6-month  analysis  was  probably  at  a  too  early  time  point  to  discern  a  significant effect.

No significant relationship was found between steady-state concentrations and the incidence of tremor. However, subjects with higher steady-state concentrations were  more likely to experience a greater intensity of diarrhoea than subjects with low concentrations.

## Interaction studies

Limited information is available regarding potential pharmacokinetic interactions.

A food effect study performed in healthy volunteers showed that concomitant administration of food decreases the rate of absorption of miglustat (Cmax was decreased by 36% and tmax delayed 2 h) but has no statistically significant effect on the extent of absorption. (AUC decreased by 14%). A moderate effect  of  carbohydrate  intake  on  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  of  miglustat  (approximate  36% decrease in mean Cmax and 32% decrease in mean AUC(0τ ))  was observed in HIV patients at a high miglustat dose (1000 mg TID).

Data from in vitro studies indicate a low potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with CYP450 isoenzymes.

An in  vivo interaction  study  with  Cerezyme  (recombinant  glucocerebrosidase)  suggested  decreased absorption rate (tmax increased to 4 h) and extent (Cmax and AUC decreased 22 and 14%, respectively). However,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  any  reasonable  rationale  for  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

between  recombinant  glucocerebrosidase  and  miglustat.  The  study  was  a  parallel  group  study  in  a small number of subjects, and interpretation of the results should be made with caution. This study also indicates that Zavesca has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of Cerezyme. Relevant information has been included in section 4.5 of the SPC.

## Special groups

Limited data in patients with Fabry disease and impaired renal function showed that CL/F decreases with decreasing renal function. The data suggest an approximate decrease in CL/F of 40% and 60%, respectively, in mild and moderate renal impairment.  Data in severe renal impairment are limited to two patients with creatinine clearance in the range 18-29 ml/min and suggest a decrease in CL/F by at least 70% in such patients, but cannot be extrapolated to below creatinine clearance of 18 ml/min. In response  to  questions  raised,  the  applicant  recommends  a  reduction  of  the  dosage  interval  to administration twice daily in mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-70 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and once  daily  in  moderate  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  30-50  ml/min/1.73  m 2 ),  which  is acceptable. Data are too limited to give dosage recommendations in severe renal impairment. Relevant information has been included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC.

There is no pharmacokinetic information in decreased hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated no influence of gender, age (18 to 69 years), weight, body mass index or race on the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The pharmacokinetics of miglustat has not been evaluated in children and adolescents, or in elderly above the age of 69 years.

The lack of pharmacokinetic data in children, adolescents (&lt;18 years) and elderly (&gt;70 years)  is sufficiently reflected in the SPC.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Zavesca in type 1 Gaucher disease was investigated in three studies with extension phases,  consisting  of  two  open  non-comparative  trials  (OGT  918-001  and  OGT  918-003)  and  one open  randomised  study  in  comparison  with  enzyme  replacement  given  as  Cerezyme  and  as combination  therapy  of  Zavesca  and  Cerezyme  (OGT 918-004).  Efficacy  analyses  were  performed primarily on the evaluable population, that is, subjects with non-missing values.

## Dose response studies

No dose-response studies have been performed although a comparison of the results from OGT 918001 and OGT 918-003 using different doses would suggest that 100 mg TID could be more effective than 50 mg TID based on larger reductions in organ volumes. The effectiveness of doses below 50 mg TID has not been explored.

## MAIN CLINICAL STUDY

## OGT 918-001 and extension

## Description of the study

Study OGT 918-001, the main efficacy study, was a multi-centre, non-comparative, Phase I/II study of open-label  Zavesca  in  adult  subjects  with  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  The  trial  was  exploratory  and  a large  number of  variables  were  measured.  An  exploratory statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  the key efficacy measures and changes were compared with baseline values. The applicant justified the use of a non-comparative design because the trial was designed to study subjects unwilling or unable to receive ERT.

The inclusion criteria were designed to select patients with at least moderate disease, eligible for ERT according to current standards: (1) Gaucher disease confirmed by a glucocerebrosidase assay; (2) 18 years of age or older; (3) measurable organomegaly (liver or spleen); (4) Haemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dl or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

platelets &lt;100 x 10 9 /l for those with intact spleen or; hepatomegaly with liver weight &gt;2.5% of body weight for splenectomised subjects.

Among the exclusion criteria were treatment with Ceredase/Cerezyme within 3 months of screening, clinically significant diarrhoea or lactose intolerance.

Among  the  withdrawal  criteria  were  Ceredase/Cerezyme  therapy,  unacceptable  treatment-related toxicity or other adverse events and disease progression.

A starting dose of 100 mg TID of Zavesca was studied. The dose could be increased by increments of 100 mg TID  per  month  up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  300  mg  TID  or  until  the  target  trough  level  of 2 µ g/ml  was  reached  or  toxicity  (other  than  Grade  1  gastrointestinal  symptoms)  were  noted.    In addition, dose levels could be reduced if a subject experienced any unacceptable side effect that was thought to be related to Zavesca.

The extended use phase of this study (OGT 918-001X) allowed subjects to continue taking Zavesca 100 mg.  Data on the same endpoints collected up to Month 24 are reported. In addition, during the evaluation, the applicant submitted additional 36-month data on eleven patients.

## Primary endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  organ  volume  response  using  MRI  or  CT  studied  6-monthly, monthly  assessments  of  haematological  and  biochemical  responses  and  overall  response.  The biochemical  responses  included  chitotriosidase,  hexosaminidase,  acid  phosphatase  and  angiotensin converting  enzyme.  Elevations  of  these  enzymes  have  been  reported  in  Gaucher  disease  but  their significance  has  not  been  clearly  elucidated.  Other  exploratory  variables  included  leukocyte  GM1 analysis on a small number of patients. The chosen endpoints were clinically relevant and similar to those used in the assessment of enzyme replacement therapy.

## Patients characteristics and disposition

28 patients who were unable or unwilling to be treated with Ceredase/Cerezyme were recruited. 22 of them were treatment naive. They had at least moderate disease as reflected by the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 44.0 years. There were equal numbers of males and females. 54% were Ashkenazi Jews. 26 were genotyped for Gaucher disease and N370S/N370S was found in 11. 6 of these patients had  received  previous  Ceredase/Cerezyme  use.  7  patients  were  splenectomised.  24  subjects  had  at least  one  concurrent  illness  at  screening.  10  had  unspecified  osteonecrosis  and  8  had  unspecified osteoporosis.

Five subjects withdrew before 6 months and one withdrew after 6 months. Reasons for withdrawals were one serious adverse event, two unacceptable adverse events, and three withdrawals for reasons other than adverse  events. There  was  one  protocol  deviation, one  patient  was  included  for hepatosplenomegaly despite having haemoglobin and platelet counts that were higher than those stated in  the  inclusion  criteria.  This  patient  was  believed  to  suffer  from  pulmonary  hypertension  as  an explanation for the elevated blood counts despite significant splenomegaly.

OGT 918-001 extension: Eighteen of the 22 subjects who completed OGT 918-001 were enrolled into the extension study. Doses ranged from 100 mg daily to 200 mg TID during this extended treatment period. The most common dose regimen was 100 mg TID. Fourteen subjects were evaluable after 24 months treatment and thirteen of these have data available at 36 months. Two subjects withdrew due to peripheral neuropathy, two due to diarrhoea, and others due to combinations of adverse events and personal reasons or serious adverse events that were unrelated to treatment.

## RESULTS

Organ  volumes: The  pre-specified  criteria  for  assessing  liver  and  spleen  volumes  response  were categorisation  of  responses  into  good,  moderate  or  no  response  based  on  criteria  formulated prospectively by clinicians in the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam. A good response was a reduction from baseline organ volume of 30% or greater, a moderate response between 10%  and  30%  reduction.  Reductions  of  less  than  10%  were  considered  within  or  close  to  the variability of the method of assessment, and were therefore classified as no response. Either MRI or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CT scan could be used. The study protocol allowed assessments to be made according to the clinical practice of the individual centre.

Liver organ volume: Baseline mean liver organ volume was 2.38 L (1.49-3.7 L) and the excess liver volume  factors  were  1.1-2.7  times  normal.  Using  the  above  response  criteria  for  changes  in  liver volume, a response was seen in 7/22 evaluable patients at 6 months and 8/12 at 24 months. Further reductions in liver volumes in the extension phase were small and the mean reduction in liver volume from baseline was 14.5% (p&lt;0.001) after 24 months and 17.5% after 36 months.

Spleen organ volume: Baseline mean spleen organ volume was 1.658 L (0.68- 3.36 L) and the excess spleen volume factors were 5.44-24.8 times normal. For changes in spleen volumes, a response was seen in 14/19 evaluable patients at 6 months and 16/18 patients at 12 months. The mean reduction in spleen volume from baseline was 26.4% (p&lt;0.001) after 24 months and 29.6% after 36 months.

Haematological parameters: For haemoglobin concentration and platelet count, a response assessment was based on an increase of these indices from baseline as prospectively defined. Good response was defined by an increase of greater than 1.5 g/dl in haemoglobin concentration or 30 x 10 9 /l in platelet count. Moderate response was an increase &gt;0.5 g/dl-1.5 g/dl in haemoglobin concentration or increase of &gt;15-30 x 10 9 /l in platelet count.

Baseline  mean  haemoglobin  concentration  was  12.28  g/dl  (9.30  -  15.05  g/dl).  Overall,  there  were small increases in mean haemoglobin concentration.

Values at 36 months were stable with a mean increase from baseline of 0.95 g/dl.

Anaemic subjects (baseline haemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dl) had a mean increase of 1.28 g/dl at Month 24 (p=0.007), higher than for the complete cohort.

Baseline means platelet count was 88.1 x 10 9 /l (33.0 - 334.0 x 10 9 /l). Throughout the 24 month period, there was a small gradual increase in platelet count from baseline. They were 3.6 x 10 9 /l (p=0.146) at 6 months,  8.28  x  10 9 /l    (p=0.014)  at  12  months,  11.16  (p=0.009)  at  18  months  and  13.58  x  10 9 /l (p&lt;0.001) at 24 months. At 36 months, the mean increase in patients remaining on therapy was 22.2 x10 9 /l.

In  OGT  918-001,  21  of  the  evaluable  patients  were  thrombocytopenic  at  baseline  (platelet  count &lt;150 x10 9 /l) and the lowest count was 34 x10 9 /l. Among the 17 non-responders in platelet responses, five showed a reduction but only two had a reduction greater than or equal to 10 x10 9 /l. None of these patients had a platelet count that fell below 30 x10 9 /l.

Biochemical  parameters: Very  high  levels  of  chitotriosidase  activity  are  characteristic  of  Gaucher disease and are thought to relate to the numbers of abnormal storage cells. Reductions in the levels of chitotriosidase  are  therefore  indicative  of  improvement  in  disease  severity.  Mean  decrease  of  2,142 nmol/ml.h or 16.4% (p&lt;0.001) from a baseline of 15,105 nmol/ml.h after 12 months compared with a reduction of 21.9% (p&lt;0.001) or 3,713 nmol/ml.h after 24 months was observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other, less specific disease markers, such as hexosaminidase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities showed less significant but favourable changes. For hexosaminidase, the reduction also continued and was  11.9%  at Month 24  (p=0.001). Acid phosphatase showed a mean increase of 597.6 nmol/ml.h from baseline to Month 24 (p=0.023).  Mean decreases in ACE were seen throughout the study.

Plasma  concentrations  of  glucosylceramide  (GlcCer),  which  represent  the  storage  material  that accumulates in Gaucher disease, were measured in a subgroup of eight subjects.  The mean GlcCer at baseline  was  14.2  nmol/ml.    GlcCer  analysis  showed  mean  decreases  from  baseline  of  2.2  and 2.8 nmol/ml  at  6  and  12  months  respectively  (p=0.074  and  p=0.172,  respectively).  Analysis  of glucosylceramide beyond 12 months was not performed.

Overall  response: This  is  determined  by  a  combination  of  the  individual  response  parameters consisting of organ volume response, haemoglobin response and platelet response. Good response is defined as a good response for at least 2 of the 3 above parameters, moderate response is defined as a moderate response for 2 of the 3 above parameters and no response is neither of the former two. At 12 months, 5 of the 22 subjects had a good response, 10 subjects had a moderate response and 7 had no response.

Skeletal  disease  assessment: Dual  energy  X-ray  absorptiometry  (DEXA)  was  performed  on  some patients but the data were not analysed as a 24-month interval was not considered to be sufficient for assessing response by this method.  Quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI) was assessed for two subjects at Centre 2 in three vertebrae of the spine (L3-5).  The results showed an improvement in bone marrow fat fraction from baseline to 12 months and a further improvement at 24 months, with values returning to the normal range.

## Supportive studies

## OGT 918-003 and extension

## Description of the study

Study  OGT  918-003  was  a  non-comparative  study  of  6-month  duration  that  examined  a  dose  of Zavesca 50 mg TID. The study was conducted in two centres. Dose levels of miglustat were to be reduced to 50 mg twice daily if a subject experienced any unacceptable adverse event that was thought to  be  related  to  the  study  medication  or  if  their  trough  plasma  concentrations  exceeded  2 µ g/ml. Quality of life was also assessed as a secondary variable. Organ volume assessment was based on CT scan.

In total, 16 subjects continued into the extended treatment phase and treatment was increased up to a maximum of 100 mg TID in the majority, although many of these dose increases did not occur until Month 9 or Month 12. Data up to Month 12 are reported for 13 subjects.

## Patient demographics

18 subjects  were  enrolled  in  OGT 918-003. The mean age was 42.4 years, 13 (72%) subjects were female and 15 (83%) subjects were Ashkenazi Jews. 17 of the 18 subjects were genotyped for Gaucher disease and the most frequent amino acid genotype was N370S/N370S reported in 7 of the patients. Two  reported  previous  Ceredase/Cerezyme  use.  50%  had  undergone  surgery  for  Gaucher  disease. 7 were  splenectomised.  89%  had  at  least  one  manifestation  of  Gaucher  disease  at  screening.  The commonest symptoms were fatigue, bone and joint pain/stiffness.

## Patient disposition

Seventeen (94%) subjects completed OGT 198-003. One subject withdrew at his own request after 13 weeks  because  of  diarrhoea  and  flatulence.  Sixteen  subjects  entered  the  extension  study.  Four withdrew. There was one unacceptable GI side effect, one case of progressive hepatosplenomegaly (subsequently found to have lymphoma), one lack of improvement and fatigue, and one dissatisfaction and desire for childbearing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

In comparison with the results of OGT 918-001 at 6 months, subjects who received 50 mg Zavesca TID  showed  smaller  reductions  in  liver  organ  volumes  and  spleen  organ  volumes  than  those  who received  100  mg  Zavesca  TID.  The  mean  decrease  in  liver  organ  volume  was  5.9%  and  the  mean decrease in spleen organ volume was 4.5% at 6 months. Only small mean changes from baseline in haemoglobin  concentration  were  seen  at  both  dosage  levels  and  responders  were  few.  In  total,  six (35%)  subjects  had  a  moderate  overall  response  and  11  (65%)  subjects  had  no  overall  response  at Month 6. Six of the 17 subjects had a moderate response or at least 2 moderate responses for organ volume and any of the two haematological parameters. The rest was classified as no response. The efficacy of an even lower dose than 50 mg TID has not been investigated.

Biochemical responses: There were mean decreases from baseline in chitotriosidase (15.3%, p=0.001) and hexosaminidase at 6 and 12 months.

Quality  of  Life  (QoL): Clinically  significant  improvements  were  seen  from  baseline  to  Month  6  in physical  function,  enhanced  role  limitations  due  to  physical  problems,  general  health  perceptions, vitality and social function.  The improvement in mean score for vitality was 16.5% (p=0.004) and the improvement of in physical functioning was 9.4% (p=0.052).  There were no other changes of note.

## OGT 918-004 and extension

## Description of the study

In  study  OGT  918-004,  a  single  centre,  open-label,  comparative  study,  36  patients  currently maintained on a minimum of 2 years of Cerezyme therapy were recruited and randomised to switch to either Zavesca (100 mg TID), or continuation of Cerezyme regimen or a combination of Zavesca and current  Cerezyme  regimen  for  a  period  of  6  months.  The  randomisation  was  done  according  to  a minimisation  procedure,  which  included  a  random  component  and  was  implemented  to  achieve balance  across  gender,  age,  splenectomy,  avascular  necrosis  and  length  of  time  on  ERT,  as  these factors were thought to have an impact on Gaucher disease. No formal sample size calculation was performed.  Subjects were eligible if they had Gaucher disease (confirmed by a glucocerebrosidase assay),  had  received  continuous  Ceredase/Cerezyme  therapy  for  a  minimum  of  2  years  prior  to screening and had received their current dose for a minimum of 6 months; and were 18 years of age or older at the time of consent.

The exclusion criteria and withdrawal criteria were similar to those for the non-comparative studies.

29 subjects entered the optional extended  treatment phase  of 6 months  to  receive  Zavesca monotherapy.  Therefore  data  on  switching  to  Zavesca  from  enzyme  or  combination  therapy  were available in 19 subjects for 6 months and in 10 subjects for 12 months and. During the evaluation the applicant submitted additional 18-month data.

## Patient characteristics and disposition

36 subjects were enrolled in the study and were included in the safety population; 33 were included in the  efficacy  population.    92%  of  the  patients  were  Ashkenazi  Jews.  97%  of  the  patients  were genotyped for Gaucher disease and 23 of the 35 subjects had N370S/N370S amino acid genotype. The mean age was 37.2 years. The mean duration of ERT in this population was 5.8 years. The mean baseline  organ  volumes,  haematological  parameters  and  biochemical  markers  were  in  keeping  with stabilised disease on treatment.

Thirty-three (92%) subjects completed the study; three subjects withdrew due to unacceptable adverse events. One patient developed tremor in the right hand than both hands and expressed desire to have children.  One  patient  was  dissatisfied  with  her  quality  of  life  since  commencing  Zavesca  and  had unacceptable symptoms from concomitant infectious mononucleosis. One withdrew due to diarrhoea. There was no withdrawal from the Cerezyme treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

The changes at 6 months were small for organ volume responses and haematological parameters. Of note  was  a  reduction  in  platelet  count  upon  switching  to  Zavesca  from  enzyme  replacement.  The extension study  also  showed  a  fall  in  platelet  count  and  a  rise  in  chitotriosidase  upon  switching  to Zavesca, while the changes in liver and spleen organ volumes and haemoglobin concentrations were small. Mean hexosaminidase, acid phosphatase and ACE levels all increased numerically on switching to Zavesca monotherapy although there was a large variability in these results.

## OGT 918-004 Extension Study

29 subjects who completed the initial 6-month treatment period entered the 6-month extension phase to receive Zavesca monotherapy.  Approximately half of these subjects received 100 mg TID whilst the other half received a reduced dose of 100 mg BID.  No subject required re-institution of Cerezyme treatment during the extended treatment period due to deteriorating disease.  No subject withdrew due to lack of efficacy and 28 subjects continued on Zavesca monotherapy beyond the extension phase. A summary of the changes in organ volumes and haematological parameters at 12 months compared to baseline is provided in the following table.

Overall, the difference between the results at 6 and 12 months for the primary variables was marginal. The mean percentage changes in organ volumes were small and none were statistically significant. No clear deterioration in haemoglobin response was observed after switching to Zavesca but there were mean reductions  in  platelet  count  from  baseline  to  Month  12  for  all  three  treatment  groups.    This decrease was greater for the Zavesca/Zavesca group and approached statistical significance (p=0.062). For  the  Cerezyme/Zavesca  and  Combination/Zavesca  groups,  switching  to  Zavesca  monotherapy resulted  in  statistically  significant  mean  decreases  in  platelet  count  from  Month  6  to  Month  12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(p=0.014 and p=0.024, respectively).  For the Zavesca/Zavesca group, there was a much smaller mean decrease in platelet count from Month 6 to Month 12, which was not statistically significant.

For  all  three-treatment  groups,  there  were  mean  increases  in  chitotriosidase  from  baseline  to  12 months after switching to Zavesca monotherapy. The mean percentage increase in chitotriosidase for the Zavesca/Zavesca group was statistically significant (84.5% increase, p=0.011). The mean increase in chitotriosidase was statistically significant for the Zavesca/Zavesca and Cerezyme/Zavesca groups (p=0.008 and p=0.042, respectively) and approached statistical significance for the Combination/Zavesca group (p=0.064). The increases after switching to Zavesca monotherapy were statistically significant for the ERT and combination treatment groups.

In summary, the limited follow-up data suggest that miglustat monotherapy may not be sufficient to maintain the same control of disease activity in all patients.

## Clinical studies in special populations

## None has been performed.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The pharmacokinetic information in humans is limited. The elimination of miglustat has been poorly studied and the applicant has committed to perform appropriate studies to elucidate the elimination of miglustat  in  humans.  As  supportive  data  from  preclinical  studies,  human  studies  with  the  prodrug (OGT 924) and data in Fabry patients strongly suggest renal elimination mainly unchanged, it was considered  sufficient  to  address  the  issue  during  the  post-marketing  phase.  The  SPC  includes recommendations in severe renal impairment. In addition, a statement is included in the SPC on the lack of pharmacokinetic data in patients with liver impairment, in children or adolescents (&lt;18 years) and in elderly (&gt;70 years).

The pharmacodynamic information of miglustat in man is limited and no dose finding studies have been performed.

36  to  42  months  of  non-comparative  data  are  available  on  treatment  naïve  patients  with  mild  to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease. Fifty percent of the original cohort has remained on treatment in excess  of  3 years.  The  chosen  endpoints  are  relevant  for  clinical  care  as  well  as  for  monitoring. Modest, sustained reductions in organomegaly, increases in haemoglobin concentration and platelet counts,  as  well  as  reductions  in  chitotriosidase  activities  were  seen.  At  24  months,  8  of  the  12 evaluable patients had ≥ 10% reduction in liver volume and the mean response was 14.5%. All of the 10 evaluable patients had ≥ 10% reduction in spleen volume and the mean reduction was 26.4%. 8 out of 13 evaluable patients had a ≥ 0.5 g/dl increase in haemoglobin concentration but only two of these had a response ≥ 1.5 g/dl. A platelet response of between 15-30 x 10 9 /l  was observed in 6 of the 13 evaluable  patients,  but  none  of  these  had  a  response  above  30  x  10 9 /l.  The  mean  reduction  in chitotriosidase activities in the 14 evaluable subjects was 21.9%. Other biochemical markers such as hexosaminidase showed similar though lesser changes.

A volume response was evident within one year while the haematological response rate was lower and became noticeable after  18 to 24  months of treatment. It was reassuring that there was no obvious deterioration  among  the  non-responders.  The  size  of  the  effect  of  miglustat  is  difficult  to  estimate because of the heterogeneity of the disease, the small number of evaluable patients and the lack of a placebo controlled arm for comparison.

The results from the pivotal study OGT 918-001 and its extension show that Zavesca has a modest sustained effect on patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease. As the pivotal trial was an open uncontrolled trial, there were methodological limitations to the radiological assessment, and the overall  interpretation  of  the  results  could  have  been  affected  by  the  withdrawals  of  non-responding patients. An intention to treat (ITT) analysis with last observation carry forward (LOCF) imputation provided during the review gives some reassurance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effect of Zavesca as a maintenance treatment is even less well studied. The results showed small mean  percentage  decreases  in  organ  volumes  but  also  a  fall  in  platelet  count  and  a  rise  in chitotriosidase  upon switching from ERT  to Zavesca. There was no statistically significant deterioration  in  haemoglobin  response.  These  results  suggest  that  miglustat  monotherapy  is  less effective than ERT in suppressing disease activity.

In summary, defining an indication for Zavesca is difficult because of the limited trial data. The study in treatment naive patients included only those with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease AND who are unsuitable or unwilling to receive ERT. Therefore the potential target population is already limited.  Enzyme  replacement  therapy  is  the  current  treatment  of  choice  in  treatment-naive  patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. Despite a lack of direct comparative studies, it appears that Zavesca does not offer any efficacy advantage over ERT. It is unknown if Zavesca can achieve the same effect as ERT. The role of Zavesca as a  maintenance  treatment  is  even  less  defined.  In  fact  the  trial  results suggest that miglustat is less effective in suppressing disease activity in patients stabilised on ERT. Efficacy and safety of Zavesca has not been evaluated in patients with severe Gaucher disease, defined as  a  haemoglobin  concentration  below  9  g/dl  or  a  platelet  count  below  50  x  10 9 /l  or  active  bone disease is also discussed. There is no experience with the use of Zavesca in patients under the age of 18 and over the age of 70.

The effect of Zavesca on bone disease and painful infarctive bone crises was not an endpoint in the Gaucher studies.  DEXA data was collected  for  future  analysis  only.  The  data  on  bone  disease  and Zavesca treatment are therefore still incomplete and further data are needed since little is known on the  response  of  skeletal  disease  to  enzyme  replacement  therapy  despite  the  relatively  more  rapid improvement in organ volumes and haematological parameters. The bone data from the pivotal study (OGT 918-001) will be made available by the applicant within a predefined timeframe.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

The safety data are primarily based on 12 to 24-month data from the three completed studies in 80 subjects with type 1 Gaucher disease. In addition, safety data on 16 Fabry subjects and 224 HIV patients in three phase II studies utilising either miglustat or the pro-drug have also been considered. The dosages used in these studies varied

Adverse events and serious adverse event/deaths

## Gaucher patients

There were no deaths reported in the three Gaucher studies or their extended treatment periods. There were a total  of  13  withdrawals  and  9  were  considered  Zavesca-related  in  the  Gaucher  studies.  The Zavesca-related withdrawals included two cases of at least moderately severe peripheral neuropathy that  were  confirmed  by  electrodiagnostic  testing  (EMG/nerve  conduction  studies),  three  cases  of diarrhoea, two cases of gastrointestinal adverse events, one case of gastrointestinal adverse events and tremor, one withdrawal due to tremor (and to have a family). The withdrawals assessed to be unrelated to  Zavesca  were  one  each  of  partial  thrombosis  of  the  portal  vein  complicating  undiagnosed hepatocellular  carcinoma,  concerns  about  pre-existing  pulmonary  hypertension,  progressive  weight loss and unacceptable disease progression caused by undiagnosed intra-abdominal sepsis and B-cell lymphoma, and EBV infection.

There  were  a  total  of  8  serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  in  the  Gaucher  studies  of  which  2  cases  of neuropathy  were  considered  to  be  treatment-related.  There  were  6  SAEs  considered  unrelated  to Zavesca  and  they  were  1  bone  crisis,  1  partial  thrombosis  of  the  portal  vein  (undiagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma at entry), 2 orthopaedic surgeries, 1 hospitalisation for elective respiratory tests and 1 elective tonsillectomy.

Nearly all subjects experienced at least one event that was considered related to study medication. The adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity for the  majority of subjects. Diarrhoea  has been reported by 86% of subjects in the Gaucher study, followed by weight loss (64%), flatulence (43%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  abdominal  pain  (40%).    The  incidence  of  diarrhoea  decreased  during  therapy,  but  reports  of flatulence  and  abdominal  pain  did  not  decrease  to  the  same  extent.  Tremor,  headache,  nausea  and dizziness were reported by 10 to 20% of subjects.

## Fabry patients

In  the  Fabry  studies  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  those  of  the  gastrointestinal  system, affecting all 16 subjects. The most frequent event was diarrhoea, reported by 15 (94%) subjects. The time course of this event suggests that it was  study  treatment-related despite the fact that gastrointestinal disturbances are common manifestations of Fabry disease. Tremor was reported by 13 (81%) subjects and weight decrease was reported by 11 (69%) subjects. In the Fabry study, there were 2 withdrawals due to tremor, one diarrhoea, and one withdrawal due to tremor, diarrhoea and weight loss.

## HIV patients

The safety  data  clearly  showed  a  comparatively  higher  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  events complicating  miglustat  treatment.  92%  of  patients  who  received  miglustat  reported  diarrhoea compared  with  36%  in  the  placebo  group.  A  mean  weight  loss  was  noted  in  the  miglustat  arm compared with 1 kg weight gain in the placebo arm. Granulocytopenia was also twice as often in the miglustat arm in this study.

## Neurological Adverse events

Neurological  adverse  events  were  common  and  at  least  35  Gaucher  subjects  reported  tremor,  leg cramps, or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. There were 8 reports of paraesthesia and 23 reports of tremor, with an onset of symptoms before, during or after the study. Such symptoms and signs are not generally  recognised  as  part  of  the  natural  course  of  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  Among  the  16  Fabry patients, 11 developed a tremor during the study period and 2 had an exacerbation of existing tremor, 2 complained of treatment emergent paraesthesia and there was 1 report of sexual dysfunction and are difficult to interpret in this patient population.  In phase II HIV studies using OGT 918 or its prodrug 924,  there  were  higher  incidences  of  paraesthesia,  neurologic  dysfunction,  peripheral  neuropathy, tremor and ataxia in the miglustat/AZT arm compared to the placebo/AZT arm. Although relatively more  HIV  patients  who  received  miglustat/AZT  than  those  who  received  placebo/AZT  reported neurological adverse events, it should be be taken into account that these patients were at risk of other co-existing illnesses. In general, a relatively lower percentage of HIV patients reported a neurological event but the exposure was only 6 months. Ataxia was only observed in this patient group for whom much higher doses of Zavesca were used. No definitive conclusion can be drawn based on the data provided but possible Zavesca-related ataxia cannot be excluded.

There was clearly a temporal relationship between miglustat therapy and tremor, either in the onset or as an exacerbating factor. There were also two withdrawals each in the Gaucher and Fabry studies due to  tremor.  In  contrast  with  the  HIV  studies,  tremor  was  common  among  the  Fabry  and  Gaucher patients despite the use of a lower dose of miglustat.

The applicant has suggested that the development of peripheral neuropathy is related to the presence of co-morbidities associated with peripheral neuropathy, including monoclonal gammopathy, vitamin B12  deficiency, diabetes  mellitus and congenital abnormalities. Although co-morbidities such as B12 deficiency and monoclonal gammopathy were thoroughly investigated as alternative causes, Zavesca as a probable cause cannot be excluded in all of the cases of treatment emergent neuropathy. Three patients  with  tremor  underwent  assessment  and  no  central  nervous  component  to  the  tremor  was observed during treatment with the drug. The exact mechanism of the tremor remains unknown.

Seventy-two of the 80 patients exposed to Zavesca had EDX testing performed. The same operator performed the tests at each centre and all were subject to central review by a single expert. The results of both local and central assessment were provided. Abnormal electrodiagnostic findings were found in  6  of  the  8  patients  who  reported  paraesthesia  following  commencement  of  miglustat.  These abnormal findings were consistent with peripheral neuropathy or changes suggestive of demyelination on  EMG/nerve  conduction  studies.  There  were  also  at  least  8  subjects  who  had  not  complained  of paraesthesia  but  were  found  to  have  abnormal  EDX  results.  To  complicate  the  analysis,  abnormal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

EDX  findings  were  found  in  2  of  8  Gaucher  patients  who  had  never  received  miglustat  but  had received Cerezyme, although one of these patients had also received non-neurotoxic chemotherapy for multiple myeloma previously.

Five patients developed complaints of memory loss during or following participation in the Zavesca clinical trial program in Gaucher type 1 disease. Cognitive impairment was found in two of the five patients.  The diagnosis of B12 deficiency has been proposed as the aetiology of cognitive dysfunction in  one  patient  but  Zavesca  as  a  possible  cause  could  not  be  excluded.  The  aetiology  of  cognitive impairment in the other patient was unclear.

Based  on  the  observed  adverse  neurological  events,  the  current  standing  of  the  importance  of glycosphingolipids as structural  and functional  molecules,  and  the  incomplete  understanding  on  the actions of miglustat on glycosphingolipids pathway, neurotoxicity of miglustat cannot be excluded.

## Laboratory findings

The majority of mean changes from baseline in haematology and biochemistry parameters were less than 10%. Apart from the changes in haemoglobin and platelets, greater than 10% mean percentage increases  or  decreases  in  the  following  parameters  were  reported  in  one  of  more  of  the  studies: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, white cell count, ALP, LDH, and creatinine. Greater than 10% increases were seen for ACE, AST, ALT, bilirubin and acid phosphatase.

Weight loss was consistently observed in the clinical trial program. The mean loss in weight during OGT 918-001 was 4.5 kg and the mean weight at baseline was 67.9 kg, representing a 7% weight loss over 12 months. Apart from a few subjects, most subjects had less than 10% decrease in weight from screening to endpoint.

## Safety in special populations

No specific studies have been performed and this has been appropriately reflected in the SPC.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The  number  of  adverse  neurological  events  including  peripheral  neuropathy,  cognitive  dysfunction and tremor is of great concern considering the limited number of subjects treated and the duration of treatment. In the study population, treatment emergent neurological adverse events were frequent and affected over 30% of the patients. Tremor was usually mild and transient, responded to dose reduction and only few patients had to withdraw due to tremor. Of those patients who withdrew from the trials, Zavesca-related tremor also subsequently subsided. There seems to be a clear association between the use  of  miglustat  and  development  of  tremor.  The  underlying  mechanism  for  tremor  is,  however, unknown,  although  it  could  not  be  distinguished  from  an  exaggerated  physiological  tremor.  This contrasts with peripheral neuropathy, as that has not been shown to be reversible in all of the affected patients.  Although  co-morbidities  such  as  B12  deficiency  and  monoclonal  gammopathy  were thoroughly investigated as alternative causes, Zavesca as a probable cause cannot be excluded in all of the cases of treatment emergent neuropathy. Therefore, all patients should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluation.  Patients who develop symptoms such as numbness and tingling should have a careful re-assessment of risk-benefit and may require cessation of treatment.

Overall,  five  of  the  Gaucher  patients  complained  of  memory  loss  during  the  study  and  two  were subsequently  found  to  have  developed  cognitive  impairment,  including  one  case  with  reduced functional  capability.  The  possibility  of  drug-related  neurotoxicity  could  not  be  totally  excluded  in these  two  patients.  The  need  for  baseline  and  periodic  assessment  of  cognitive  functions  is recommended in all patients on Zavesca treatment.

It is difficult to discuss causality and biological plausibility given the small number of patients studied, and with the limited knowledge on the effects of Zavesca on glycosphingolipids metabolism. Taking together  the  development  of  tremor,  unexplained  peripheral  neuropathy  and  cognitive  impairment affecting about one-third of the study patients in the Gaucher program, it is impossible to dismiss that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

there are signals of Zavesca-related neurotoxicity. The information from the HIV trials is limited but useful. Even if an alternative cause could be established for peripheral neuropathy, Zavesca is likely to have an effect on the central nervous system. Preclinical  studies  have  also  shown  that  Zavesca  can penetrate  into  the  brain. The  long-term  safety  implications  of  Zavesca  treatment  are  unknown  and there is therefore clearly a need to prospectively assess and follow up patients on Zavesca treatment longitudinally.

Diarrhoea occurred in 86% of all patients and weight loss in about 70%. The diarrhoea, flatulence and abdominal pain are probably due to inhibition of disaccharidases in the small intestine. The symptoms are  mild  and  the  diarrhoea  decreases  in  prevalence  over  time,  probably  due  to  up-regulation  of intestinal enzymes and modifications in diet. Some patients do find these symptoms intolerable and gastrointestinal  symptoms  were  a  prominent  cause  of  withdrawal.  However,  these  symptoms disappeared promptly on cessation of treatment.

Studies in the rat have shown that miglustat adversely affects spermatogenesis, sperm parameters and reduces  fertility  (see  pre-clinical  discussion).    Until  further  information  is  available,  it  is  further advised  that  before  seeking  to  conceive,  male  patients  should  cease  Zavesca  and  maintain  reliable contraceptive methods for 3 months thereafter.

The clinical trial program has not involved any children. The neurological adverse events would raise questions  on  the  use  of  miglustat  in  children  and  women  of  childbearing  age.  There  are  no  studies planned to investigate the use of Zavesca in either of those groups.

There are no data from the use of miglustat in pregnant women.  Studies in animals, however, have shown effects on reproduction, including dystocia (see pre-clinical discussion). Miglustat crosses the placenta.  Zavesca should therefore not be used during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use contraceptive measures.

Since  it  is  not  known  if  miglustat  is  secreted  in  breast  milk,  Zavesca  should  not  be  used  during breast-feeding.

## 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way and the product  is  formulated,  manufactured  and  controlled.  The  specifications  and  batch  analytical  results indicate a consistent product with a uniform clinical performance from batch to batch. There are no outstanding quality issues, which have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence relating  to  miglustat  in  the  indication,  which  is  the  scope  of  this  application.  The  preclinical pharmacological documentation is somewhat limited. In vitro activity of miglustat against an enzyme in a pathway relevant for Gaucher disease has been shown. There are no animal models of Gaucher disease  but  efficacy in  vivo animal  models  has  been  shown  in  related  models  of  lysosomal  storage diseases.

The main effects common to all species were weight loss and diarrhoea, and, at higher doses, damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa (erosions and ulceration). Further, effects seen in animals at doses that result in exposure levels moderately higher than the clinical exposure level were: changes in lymphoid organs in  all  species  tested,  transaminase  changes,  vacuolation  of  thyroid  and  pancreas,  cataracts, nephropathy  and  myocardial  changes  in  rats.  These  findings  were  considered  to  be  secondary  to debilitation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  showed  effects  on  the  seminiferous  epithelium  of  the  testes. Other  studies  revealed  changes  in  sperm  parameters  (motility  and  morphology)  consistent  with  an observed reduction in fertility. These effects occurred at exposure levels similar to those in patients but showed reversibility. Miglustat affected embryo/foetal survival in rats and rabbits; dystocia was reported;  postimplantation  losses  were  increased  and  an  increased  incidence  of  vascular  anomalies occurred in rabbits. These effects may be partly related to maternal toxicity. Changes in lactation were observed in female rats in a 1-year study.  The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Miglustat did not show any potential for mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the standard battery of genotoxicity tests.  Long-term studies on the carcinogenic potential have not been conducted but the applicant  has  made  appropriate  commitments  to  undertake  further  studies.  Overall,  the  pre-clinical findings have been adequately reflected in the SPC based on currently available data.

## Efficacy

For  treatment  naïve  type  1  Gaucher  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  disease,  the  36-month  noncomparative  data  available  indicate  that  miglustat  conferred  a  modest  sustained  benefit  relative  to baseline.  Although  no  direct  comparisons  with  Enzyme  Replacement  Therapy  (ERT)  have  been performed in treatment naive patients, it appears that it would take longer to achieve an effect with Zavesca and Zavesca does not offer any efficacy advantage over ERT.  It is yet unknown if treatment with  Zavesca  would  achieve  the  same  effect  obtainable  with  ERT,  the  current  standard  of  care  for patients who require treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease. The efficacy and safety of Zavesca has not been evaluated in patients with severe Gaucher disease, defined as a haemoglobin concentration below 9 g/dl or a platelet count below 50 x 10 9 /l or active bone disease.

Among patients with disease stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy, a reduction in platelet count and a rise in chitotriosidase activity after switching to miglustat from ERT were consistently observed and that would suggest that miglustat could not maintain the previously achieved disease stabilisation in all patients. Further data are needed to clarify the clinical relevance of the small effects in the three potential  target  groups,  namely  in  treatment  naïve  patients,  combination  treatment  with  ERT,  or  as maintenance treatment in patients with stable disease following response to a minimum of 2 years of ERT.

of Zavesca treatment (see discussion on benefit/risk assessment below).

There is no experience with the use of Zavesca in patients under the age of 18 and over the age of 70.

## Safety

The gastrointestinal adverse events are not unexpected and can be managed while the aetiology of the neurological adverse events has not been clarified.

Diarrhoea occurred in 86% of all patients and weight loss in about 70%. The diarrhoea, flatulence and abdominal pain are probably due to inhibition of disaccharidases in the small intestine. The symptoms are mild and the diarrhoea decreases in prevalence over time.

The  number  of  reports  of  peripheral  neuropathy  and  tremor  is  of  concern  considering  the  limited number of subjects treated and duration of treatment. There seems to be a clear association between the use of miglustat and development of tremor. Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with Zavesca with or without concurrent conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency and monoclonal gammopathy.  In view of the number of adverse neurological events in the trial population and the incidence of B12 deficiency among Gaucher patients in general, there is a need for regular monitoring  of  vitamin  B12  and  all  patients  should  also  undergo  baseline  and  repeat  neurological evaluation.  Patients who develop symptoms such as numbness and tingling should have a careful reassessment  of  risk-benefit  and  may  require  cessation  of  treatment.  An  effect  of  Zavesca  on  higher cerebral functions cannot be excluded based on the reports of cerebral dysfunction. There is a need to conduct baseline and periodic neurological assessment as well as re-evaluation of the risk-benefit of treatment should adverse neurological events develop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit/risk assessment

Following the assessment of the documentation that did not show any efficacy or safety advantage over  standard  ERT  in  treatment  naive  patients  and  even  less  defined  benefit  as  a  maintenance treatment, it was concluded that additional input was required from external experts to define the role of Zavesca treatment. The Company was also invited to clarify a number of efficacy and safety issues, as  previously  defined  by  the  CPMP,  at  the  CPMP  ad  hoc  Expert  meeting  as  well  as  at  an  oral explanation before the CPMP.

## The conclusions from the Experts were:

'With reference to the use of Zavesca in treatment naive patients, Zavesca has an effect on the study endpoints  and  that  effect  may  be  clinically  relevant.  The  results  may  be  difficult  to  generalise, however, because the majority of the study population has a predilection for milder disease. There is no agreement on the effect size of Zavesca as compared with ERT. One view is that the effect size is about 30 % of that achievable with ERT but the other is that a relatively smaller response is expected in treating patients with mild disease compared with more severe disease.  Zavesca exerts sustained effect with continued treatment and it seems to take longer to achieve an effect compared with ERT. There  is  a  place  for  oral  treatment  and  Zavesca  may  be  indicated  because  of  patient  inability/ unwillingness  to  accept  ERT  or  in  the  rare  case  of  intolerance  to  ERT.  The  lack  of  data  on  bone disease  is  a  clear  deficiency.  So  far  the  only  data  available  is  increase  in  fat  fraction  suggestive  of clearance of Gaucher cells, whether that can predict course of bone disease is unknown.

With reference to Zavesca as maintenance treatment, it was agreed that the results are less robust and elevation  in  chitotriosidase  is  a  concern.  Based  on  the  currently  available  data  it  is  not  possible  to identify those patients who might have sufficient disease control with Zavesca. Close monitoring is necessary  because  of  probable  need  to  restart  ERT.  It  is  agreed  that  further  studies  need  to  be conducted  and  there  is  insufficient  data  to  support  an  indication  for  Zavesca  as  a  maintenance treatment of Gaucher disease.

Regarding combination treatment, only 6 months of data on a small number of patients are available. It is agreed that the data are inconclusive. There may be a need for combination treatment if there is severe poorly responsive disease but this should be studied further.

With reference  to  Zavesca  as  rescue  treatment,  there  is  no  known  case  of  no-response  to  ERT  but suboptimal response could be a matter of dose and dosing schedule.

There is a lack of systematic survey of neurological symptoms and signs in Gaucher disease, therefore no  conclusion  can  be  drawn.  Different  experiences  were  exchanged.  One  view  is  that  neurological symptoms can occur in type 1 Gaucher disease but different from those of types 2 and 3. Another is that the extent of electrophysiological abnormalities reported in the Zavesca study is much larger than expected from  previous  experience.  Regarding  the  data  submitted  by  the  company,  there  are  either methodological  deficiencies  or  lack  of  electrophysiological  data  that  make  it  difficult  to  draw conclusions on the background prevalence of neurological events in type 1 Gaucher disease.

It was further agreed that miglustat cannot be excluded as a possible cause for peripheral neuropathy and vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely to be the sole explanation.

With  reference  to  cognitive  disfunction,  there  were  again  different  views  expressed.  Two  of  the  5 cases  of  memory  loss  are  still  unresolved,  of  which  one  case  is  not  typical  of  early  Alzheimer's disease.  The  opposite  view  is  that  none  of  the  cases  can  be  attributed  to  Zavesca.  It  is  agreed  that baseline neuropsychological testing with follow-up should be undertaken.

With reference to possible future studies, the Experts agreed that the efficacy data primarily apply to treatment naive patients with mild to moderate disease, even though it is difficult to define mild to moderate disease. There is little  or  no  efficacy  data  to  support  maintenance,  combination  or  rescue treatment. There are unresolved safety concerns that need to be addressed. Therefore follow-up studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

should  be  considered.  In  view  of  the  small  number  of  patients,  the  preference  for  larger  benefit achieved  with  ERT  and  the  'open'  studies  that  will  be  conducted,  any  future  studies  would  have difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of patients.'

Following the review of the submitted documentation, the final revised SPC and the post-marketing commitments made by the applicant, and taking into account the advice from the expert meeting, the CPMP agreed that although ERT is the standard of care for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, there is a population of patients, however few, for whom ERT is not suitable and where there is an unmet medical  need.  Zavesca  has  shown  efficacy  in  such  patients  that  may  be  clinically  relevant  and  an acceptable benefit/risk ratio would apply only to those patients for whom ERT is deemed unsuitable by  a  physician  knowledgeable  in  the  management  of  these  patients,  provided  diligent  prospective monitoring is put in place to anticipate the adverse neurological events. The SPC has been revised to convey the limited role of Zavesca and give the treating physician a clearer overview of its anticipated clinical effects as well as the need for careful monitoring.

The  CPMP,  thus,  concluded  that  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Zavesca  would  be  granted  under exceptional  circumstances,  subject  to  fulfilling  the  clinical  and  pre-clinical  follow-up  measures  and clinical specific obligations undertaken by the applicant. The indication for which the medical product in  question is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence/data on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. In order to collect additional data, the applicant has committed to complete an extensive programme of clinical studies post-authorisation within pre-specified time frames, the results of which shall form the basis of an annual reassessment of the benefit/risk profile.

The  applicant  has  committed  to  undertake  the  following  post-marketing  programme  to  address  all open efficacy and safety issues:

- A randomised, open label, case-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of Zavesca versus Enzyme  Replacement  Therapy  (ERT)  in  the  Maintenance  of  Patients  with  type  1  Gaucher disease.
- A  natural  history  observational  studies  of  200  patients  with  type  1  Gaucher  disease,  in conjunction with the European Working Group for Gaucher disease (EWGGD).
- A  comprehensive  Post-Marketing  Surveillance  Plan  (PMSP)  in  the  EU  which  will  educate prescribers on the appropriate use of Zavesca and actively solicit safety information on as many patients as possible who receive Zavesca to supplement the PSURs.
- A capture protocol for all patients currently receiving Zavesca in the ongoing type 1 Gaucher disease clinical studies.
- Extension of the currently ongoing OGT 918-005 study in the USA from the current 12 months to 24 months.  This study is an ongoing phase II monotherapy study of open-label Zavesca in adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.

## Recommendation

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by majority decision  that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Zavesca  in  -  the  oral  treatment  of  mild  to  moderate  type  1 Gaucher  disease.
