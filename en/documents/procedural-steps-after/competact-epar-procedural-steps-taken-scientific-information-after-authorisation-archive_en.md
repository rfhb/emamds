Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Competact, which requires the submission of 6 monthly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should, on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds, submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the Product Information to bring it in line with the current EMEA/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guidelines, which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Annex II has been amended to reflect the need for 6 monthly PSUR submissions.   |

Pioglitazone and its major metabolites were not genotoxic, as established in a comprehensive battery of genotoxicity assays. Through re-examination of retained bladder specimens in fixative, calculi were found in the bladder and it was hypothesized that urinary calculi formation with subsequent irritation, hyperplasia and metaplasia may be responsible for the carcinogenic responses observed in male rats.

The presence of microcrystals exacerbates the hyperplastic response but is not considered to be the cause of the hyperplastic changes. Updated part of Section 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristic: Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years. The formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was postulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A 24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly decreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals, although exacerbating the hyperplastic response is not considered to be the primary cause of the hyperplastic changes. The relevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded. There was no tumorigeni   |

| II/0022 | Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect data from the OPIMET study investigating the safety and efficacy of the Fixed Dose Combination tablet of pioglitazone and metformin. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 23/07/2009 | 21/08/2009 | SmPC                | The MAH has completed the first clinical study (OPIMET- 008) to compare the efficacy and safety of the pioglitazone/metformin FDC tablet therapy with each of its components in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The fixed dose combination tablet of pioglitazone 15 mg/metformin 850 mg BID (N=201), pioglitazone 15 mg BID (N=189), and metformin 850 mg BID (N=210) were evaluated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with mean baseline HbA1C of 9.5% in a randomised double-blind, parallel-group study. Previous anti-diabetic medication was discontinued for 12 weeks prior to baseline measurements. After 24 weeks of treatment, the primary endpoint of mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -1.83% in the combination group versus -0.96% in the pioglitazone group (p<0.0001) and -0.99% in the metformin group (p<0.0001). The safety profile seen in this study reflected the known adverse reactions seen with the individual products and did not suggest any new safety issues. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated. |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 20/09/2007 | 24/10/2007 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The MAH submitted this Type II variation to remove the contraindication for the use of pioglitazone in combination with insulin, primarily as a result of clinical trial data from the completion of a large macrovascular outcome study of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, known as 'PROactive' (protocol reference AD-4833/EC444), performed following a commitment made to the CPMP in June 2000. The MAH also submitted, as part of the present variation application, data from three efficacy and safety studies of pioglitazone used in combination with insulin. The main concern of the CHMP was the fact that both insulin and pioglitazone alone are associated with fluid retention and heart failure. However, it appears that combination therapy with pioglitazone and insulin is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, but not |

The degree of heart failure would most likely be mild, and could be monitored symptomatically or by weight gain. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the exposure data presented was adequate to support the deletion of the contraindication with insulin, provided that the risk of heart failure is reflected in detail in the product information and in the Risk Management Plan. Section 4.3 of the Summary of Products Characteristics was updated to remove the contraindication for the use of pioglitazone in combination with insulin.

| II/0012 | Update of section 5.1 of the SPC to describe the results of a large macrovascular outcome study of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (PROactive study). Section 4.4 has been updated to add information on the risk of heart failure, as per the results of the mentioned study. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 20/09/2007 | 24/10/2007 | SmPC | At the time of the original Marketing Authorisation of Actos (pioglitazone), the MAH committed to perform a large macrovascular outcome study of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The MAH submitted the results of this macrovascular outcome study (PROactive study). The PROactive study failed regarding it's pre-specified primary endpoint, and any benefit suggested by the secondary endpoint suggests an effect in a type 2 diabetic population with extensive disease and being treated concurrently with multiple anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines, and treated with 45mg of pioglitazone. As would be expected, there were increases in weight in the pioglitazone group, and an increase in hypoglycaemia corresponding with better control of diabetes. There was also an increase in cardiac failure in the pioglitazone group. |

Although the PROactive study suggested that administration of pioglitazone was not associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, the study failed to document a clear benefit, and the safety concerns mentioned above remain, particularly in the context of the new indication of pioglitazone in combination with insulin.

| II/0007 | Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and Package Leaflet (PL) to include information on the risk of bone fractures in female patients treated with pioglitazone. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 24/05/2007 | 20/08/2007 | SmPC and PL | Further to the review of available information on increased incidence of fractures among female patients with type 2 diabetes taking a TZD, the CHMP was of the view that this issue should be further investigated and requested the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to provide information on all cases of fractures in patients taking pioglitazone, as well as an overview of all clinical and non- clinical studies with glitazones in which bone metabolism was investigated or in which an effect on bone has been reported. Upon evaluation of the data provided by the MAH, the CHMP was of the view that there are theoretical reasons why thiazolidinediones could be associated with increased risk of fracture. Severity and duration of diabetes are risks factors for osteoporosis, and it is difficult to draw |

However, considering the clinical trial database, there appears to be a small but definite increased risk of fracture in the female patients treated with pioglitazone and analyses of the pooled data from controlled, double-blind, randomised, comparative clinical studies suggest a relative increase in fracture risk with time. Based on the available data, the CHMP requested the MAH to update the product information for Actos to reflect the risk of bone fractures. Sections \"Special warnings and precautions for use\" and \"Undesirable effects\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were updated with the available data from clinical trials regarding bone fractures and with a warning reflecting that the risk of fractures should be considered in the long-term care of women treated with pioglitazone. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.   |

| II/0001  | Update of sections 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use), 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) and 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties sections) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect information regarding the potential interaction between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil and                                                                                                  | 16/11/2006   | 04/01/2007 | SmPC and PL | The MAH applied for this variation to reflect potential interactions with gemfibrozil and with rifampicin based on the publication of 3 drug-interactions studies describing the effect of CYP2C8 inhibition or induction on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone in humans.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |     | raised the mean total area under the plasma concentration- time (AUC) curve of pioglitazone 3.2 fold and prolonged its elimination half-life (T1/2) from 8.3 to 22.7 hours (P<0.001), but had no significant effect on its peak concentration (Cmax) compared with placebo (control). The Deng et al. study reported that gemfibrozil raised the mean total AUC of pioglitazone 3.4 fold and prolonged its T1/2 from 6.5 to 15.1 hours (P<0.001), but had no significant effect on Cmax. In regards to Pioglitazone and Rifampicin interaction, Jaakkola, et al 2006 reported that rifampicin caused a decrease in the plasma concentration of pioglitazone, probably by induction of CYP2C8. The Jaakkola publication showed that the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole did not affect pioglitazone pharmacokinetics. Although the review of safety data did not provide any evidence of significant effects associated with interactions between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil and pioglitazone and rifampicin, there is a potential for interaction. Based on these data sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SPC   |
