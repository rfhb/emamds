Study GP11-301 was a Phase 3 randomised, double- blind study assessing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of GP1111 and infliximab-EU in combination with methotrexate in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis | 05/12/2019   | n/a          |               | The MAH has submitted complete comparative clinical safety and immunogenicity data up to week 78 together with a comprehensive analysis of the data in patients with RA. The treatment period 3 (TP3) relates to Week 54 onwards, where all patients received Zessly until the end of the treatment period at Week 78. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the three treatment groups in TP3. The treatment exposure, discontinuation, adverse event and laboratory value patterns are in line with what was reported from TP1 |
