After the review of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin containing products should include warning on increased cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL.

| II/0043 | To update section 4.2 of the SPC following the assessment of the MAHs application to include a three times daily regimen for NovoMix 30 in the dosing guideline. In addition, minor changes to section 4.2 and 4.6 has been made. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 24/04/2008 | 19/06/2008 | SmPC             | The CHMP reviewed the results from four clinical trials (1707, 1325, 1554 and 2174) that studied three times daily regimen with NovoMix 30. From an efficacy point of view, the CHMP did not consider that the data submitted supports the TID regimen in type 2 diabetes patients with advanced diabetes who have failed to achieve good metabolic control on oral antidiabetics. However, the TID regimen may have a potential to lower the frequency of hypoglycaemias in patients requiring high doses of insulin. The CHMP therefore considered that the wording\"If twice daily dosing with NovoMix 30 results in recurrent daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, the morning dose can be split into morning and lunchtime doses (thrice daily dosing).\" is supported by the data and therefore is acceptable. |

| II/0040  | Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include information about paediatric use. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been amended accordingly. Minor editorial changes were also made throughout all of the product information. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 15/11/2007   | 18/12/2007 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted in this variation three main clinical trials (studies 1240, 1073 and 1459) evaluating the efficacy and safety of NovoMix 30 in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years of age) with type 1 diabetes. The MAH also submitted a retrospective trial (study 1676) which provides data from children and adolescents treated with insulin aspart (IAsp) over a period of 30 months. Upon evaluation of the submitted data, the CHMP was of the view that the use of premixed insulin may be beneficial for some children as it reduces the number of injections. However, based on the results from the submitted studies, the efficacy of NovoMix 30 in the treatment of children younger than 10 years could not be considered as sufficiently established. There were no unexpected safety signals in the submitted studies, and there were indications that NovoMix 30 may be associated with less weight gain and less hypoglycaemia compared to human insulin. However, long-term safety data in children and adolescents are missing. Thus, the CHMP concluded that the product information for |

| II/0038 | Inclusion of the combination use of Novomix 30 with any oral antidiabetics (OAD) for which the combination with insulin is authorised. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 19/07/2007 | 27/08/2007 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Novomix 30 is already authorized for use in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To extend the use of Novomix 30 in combination with any OAD for which the combination with insulin is authorised, the MAH submitted the results of studies investigating Novomix 30 in combination with either metformin + sulphonylurea, or pioglitazone, or metformin + pioglitazone. Overall, the addition of Novomix 30 to ongoing treatment with metformin, pioglitazone or a combination of these compounds resulted in clinically relevant reductions of HbA1c. Incidence of weight gain and oedema was higher with the regimen of NovoMix 30 and thiazolidinedione (TZD) together than with TZD, TZD-OAD combinations or NovoMix 30 alone. In the litterature the use of this combination has also been associated with an increased incidence of cardiac failure. Therefore, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when NovoMix 30 is used in combination with pioglitazone. |

| II/0031 | The MAH applied with this variation for an update of the product information to include a dosing guidance for the product to assist practitioners in starting up and optimising the treatment based on a combination of clinical practice and results from relevant clinical experience available from the three trials included in this application. This implied revisions to section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC and relevant sections of the PL. In addition, minor amendments to harmonise the NovoMix30, NovoMix50 and NovoMix70 product information have been introduced together with additional details as how to store and discard the products. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, | 23/02/2006 | 29/03/2006 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The MAH submitted with this application clinical data from two controlled trials randomised, multi-centre, open-label parallel group trials designed to evaluate short-term efficacy and safety of BIAsp 30 initiation in people with type 2 diabetes who were insulin naïve and inadequately controlled on current OHA therapy. A third trial was included as a supportive trial. This was an open-label, multi-centre, consecutive, three-phase, observational trial with no comparator. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the applicability of a step-wise therapeutic approach to insulin therapy with NovoMix30 similar to standard clinical practice. The main trial triggering the update of the product information is a study with patients with type 2 diabetes, |

With NovoMix 30, 66% and 42% of the patients reached HbA1c levels below 7% and 6.5%, respectively, and mean FPG was reduced by about 7 mmol/L (from 14,0 mmol/L at baseline to 7,1 mmol/L).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| X/0019 | The present line extension application refers to two new premixed dosage forms of rapid-acting IAsp and protamine co-crystallised IAsp, biphasic insulin aspart 70 (BIAsp 70) Annex I_2.(c) Change or addition of a new strength/potency | 23/06/2005 | 05/10/2005 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The present line extension application refers to a new premixed dosage forms of rapid-acting IAsp and protamine co-crystallised IAsp, biphasic insulin aspart 70 (BIAsp 70). BIAsp 70 have been developed to supplement the already marketed BIAsp 30. This will increase flexibility in treatment options, allowing for treatments tailored to the individual needs of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Except for the limited number of points, which can be addresed as part of the post authorisation commitments, the quality of this new premixed dosage form is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions in the SPC. The pivotal study demonstrated that a BIAsp three times daily regimen is a treatment alternative that can provide acceptable glycaemic control and that postprandial blood glucose elevations can be reduced if such a regimen is compared with a BHI 30 twice daily regimen. The efficacy of these new compositions has been sufficiently well demonstrated and the pharmacodynamic action/time profiles are in agreement with what could be expected from the amounts and properties of the two components. |
