Advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the development and on the Phase III studies' design as part of the dossier. 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were: Rapporteur: Harald Enzmann Co-Rapporteur:   Jayne Crowe The application was received by the EMA on 24 November 2017 The procedure started on 25 December 2017 The Rapporteurs circulated the Joint Assessment Report on the responses to the List of Questions to all CHMP members on 29 January 2018 The PRAC agreed on the PRAC Assessment Overview and Advice to CHMP during the meeting on 8 February 2018 The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to RIARIFY on 22 February 2018 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement 2.1.1. Disease or condition COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries the male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open fires. The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence and social status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, easy, and noninvasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of screening for COPD. Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and societal efforts have been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.

## 2.1.2. Biologic features

<!-- image -->

COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes strain and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle. 2.1.3. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis Clinical presentation tends to be as cough and breathlessness in a heavy cigarette smoker and is unusual before approximately the age of forty. Exacerbations in COPD are driven by episodes of acute inflammation, usually following a viral or bacterial infection. While current maintenance therapies prevent exacerbations in many COPD patients, exacerbation events in others remain poorly controlled, resulting in frequent use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics and, in many cases, recurrent hospital admissions. This is particularly exemplified in a sub-population of patients termed frequent exacerbators. Despite treatment, some patients do not regain their baseline lung function following an exacerbation and repeated events can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, resulting in a worsening overall quality of life for patients and a significant burden on healthcare resources. The prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality is directly linked to the extent of lung damage. 2.1.4. Management Management is through smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with bronchodilators and antiinflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, physical rehabilitation is aimed primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term domiciliary oxygen administration is helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are suitable for lung volume reduction surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed the condition is only partly reversible so more treatment options are always welcome.

Riarify 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation. The MAH for the authorised medicinal product and for the product applied for in the informed consent application is the same, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. A letter of consent to grant full and permanent access to the dossier (module 1 to 5) of the reference product Trimbow to fulfil its obligations as MAH as described in Directive 2001/83/EC has been provided with this submission. 2.2. Compliance with GLP, GMP, GCP GLP All pivotal non-clinical studies were performed to GLP GMP inspection(s) No GMP inspection is requested based on this application. GCP With respect to GCP compliance the Applicant stated within the MAA that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with local regulation and guidance, with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations. Study subjects/patients were accorded all rights granted by the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.3. Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Trimbow application, the quality data in support of the Beclometasone / Formoterol / Glycopyrronium bromide Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Trimbow dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 2.4. Non Clinical RIARIFY is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to TRIMBOW (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208). The applicant refers to module 4 of the TRIMBOW MA. Therefore, the non-clinical data in support of the RIARIFY MAA are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of TRIMBOW dossier, which have been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new non-clinical data has been submitted. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore,  according  to  the  EMA  guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  a  tailored  environmental  risk  assessment  strategy  should  be  followed  to address its specific mechanism of action irrespective of the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. The  Applicant  provided  acceptable  experimental  values  on  log  KOW  of  -0.02  and  -1.35  for  FF  and  GB, respectively. No further PBT assessment is required. For B17MP an experimental value of 3.49 is available and accepted by the assessor. The potential to bioaccumulate should be considered in Phase II Tier B for this active ingredient.

The applicant confirms that the name of the medicinal product will be printed in Braille format on the carton box in accordance with article 56a of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. For the multipack presentations (i.e. 2 canisters of 120 actuations and 3 canisters of 120 actuations), the product name in Braille will be printed both on outer packaging and inner boxes. 3. Overall conclusion and risk benefit assessment RIARIFY  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms  pressurised  inhalation,  solution  (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate  dihydrate/glycopyrronium) is submitted  under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. The  reference  product  for  this  application  is  TRIMBOW  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms pressurised inhalation, solution (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208). RIARIFY and TRIMBOW have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances and the same pharmaceutical form. Therefore, the benefit-risk of RIARIFY is considered to be positive in the following indication: Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1) 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Riarify is favourable in the following indication: Riarify is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).
