## BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark submitted on 2 September 1999 to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), an application to obtain a marketing authorisation in accordance with the Centralised Procedure for the medicinal product NovoMix 30 (insulin aspart) falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Council Regulation No (EC) 2309/93.

NovoMix 30 is a mixture of 30% soluble insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals.

On  7  September  1999,  a  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  has  been  granted  for  100%  soluble insulin aspart, named NovoRapid (EU/1/99/119/001-008). In order to avoid misleading information on the release profile of the mixture, the applicant wishes to market the mixture under a different name ('NovoMix 30' instead of 'NovoRapid'). On this basis, a separate full application in accordance with Directive 65/65/EEC, as described in the Notice to Applicants, was submitted.

The CPMP appointed the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur as follows:

Rapporteur:

Dr. Per Sjöberg

Dr. Per Nilsson

Co-Rapporteur:

Dr. Gorm Jensen

Dr. Mark Ainsworth

## Licensing status:

The product was not licensed in any country inside or outside the EU at the time of submission of the application.
