## REYATAZ 300 mg hard capsules

Opaque red and blue capsule printed with white ink, with \"BMS 300 mg\" on one half and with \"3622\" on the other half.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

REYATAZ capsules, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are indicated for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.2).

Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations).

The choice of REYATAZ in treatment-experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on individual viral resistance testing and the patient's treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

## Adults

The recommended dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food. Ritonavir is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). (See also section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions).

## Paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)

The dose of atazanavir capsules for paediatric patients is based on body weight as shown in Table 1 and should not exceed the recommended adult dose. REYATAZ capsules must be taken with ritonavir and have to be taken with food.

Table 1: Dose for paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) for REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir

| Body Weight (kg)   | REYATAZ once daily dose   | ritonavir once daily dose a   |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 15 to less than 35 | 200 mg                    | 100 mg                        |
| at least 35        | 300 mg                    | 100 mg                        |

a Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution.

Paediatric patients (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg): REYATAZ oral powder is available for paediatric patients at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ oral powder). Switching to REYATAZ capsules from REYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as patients are able to consistently swallow capsules.

When transitioning between formulations, a change in dose may be needed. Consult the dosing table for the specific formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ oral powder).

Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed. REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4, and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

REYATAZ with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with ritonavir must not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the initial recommended ritonavir-boosted regimen (see section 4.4), unboosted REYATAZ could be maintained in patients with mild hepatic impairment at a dose of 400 mg, and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment with a reduced dose of 300 mg once daily with food (see section 5.2). Unboosted REYATAZ must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Pregnancy and Postpartum

During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy:

REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may not provide sufficient exposure to atazanavir, especially when the activity of atazanavir or the whole regimen may be compromised due to drug resistance. Since there are limited data available and due to inter-patient variability during pregnancy, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) may be considered to ensure adequate exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The risk of a further decrease in atazanavir exposure is expected when atazanavir is given with medicinal products known to reduce its exposure (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil or H2-receptor antagonists).

-  If tenofovir disoproxil or an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered (see sections 4.6 and 5.2).
-  It is not recommended to use REYATAZ with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir disoproxil and an H2-receptor antagonist.

(See section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions).

## During postpartum:

Following a possible decrease in atazanavir exposure during the second and third trimester, atazanavir exposures might increase during the first two months after delivery (see section 5.2). Therefore, postpartum patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

-  During this time, postpartum patients should follow the same dose recommendation as for nonpregnant patients, including those for co-administration of medicinal products known to affect atazanavir exposure (see section 4.5).

## Paediatric patients (less than 3 months of age)

REYATAZ should not be used in children less than 3 months because of safety concerns especially taking into account the potential risk of kernicterus.

## Method of administration:

For oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

REYATAZ is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2).

Co-administration with simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.5).

Combination of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only (see section 4.5). For co-administration of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

Co-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), lomitapide, and ergot alkaloids, particularly, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 due to the potential for loss of therapeutic effect and development of possible resistance (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's wort, apalutamide, encorafenib, ivosidenib, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin) (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see Interaction with other Medicinal Products below).

## Patients with coexisting conditions

Hepatic impairment: Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma concentrations were observed in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of REYATAZ has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products (see section 4.8).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.

Renal impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, REYATAZ is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

QT prolongation: Dose-related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with REYATAZ have been observed in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing REYATAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).

Haemophiliac patients: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and haemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.

## Weight and metabolic parameters

An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.

In clinical studies, REYATAZ with ritonavir has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser extent than lopinavir with ritonavir in either treatment-naïve patients (Study 138) or treatmentexperienced patients (Study 045), (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hyperbilirubinaemia

Reversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving REYATAZ should be evaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended because it may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.

Indinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT. Combinations of REYATAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions

The recommended standard treatment is REYATAZ boosted with ritonavir, ensuring optimal pharmacokinetic parameters and level of virologic suppression.

The withdrawal of ritonavir from the boosted regimen of REYATAZ is not recommended, but may be considered in adults patients at the dose of 400 mg once daily with food only under the following combined restrictive conditions:

-  absence of prior virologic failure
-  undetectable viral load during the last 6 months under current regimen
-  viral strains not harbouring HIV resistance associated mutations (RAMs) to current regimen.

REYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and with other concomitant medications that reduce atazanavir bioavailability (see section 4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of perceived challenging compliance.

REYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be used in pregnant patients given that it could result in suboptimal exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and vertical transmission.

## Cholelithiasis

Cholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms of cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.

## Chronic kidney disease

Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8).

## Nephrolithiasis

Nephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.

## Rash and associated syndromes

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks of starting therapy with REYATAZ.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops.

The best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of any suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of REYATAZ, REYATAZ may not be restarted.

## Interactions with other medicinal products

The combination of REYATAZ with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of REYATAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the co-administration of REYATAZ with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both REYATAZ and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring.

Atazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of REYATAZ and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see section 4.5).

PDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving REYATAZ. Co-administration of REYATAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5-associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes, and priapism (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ may result in increased cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol. Co-administration of salmeterol and REYATAZ is not recommended (see section 4.5).

The absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is increased irrespective of cause.

Co-administration of REYATAZ with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded.

Co-administration of REYATAZ with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate or norethindrone has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided (see section 4.5).

## Paediatric population

## Safety

Asymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. Asymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia).

## Efficacy

Atazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.

## Excipients

## Lactose

Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

When REYATAZ and ritonavir are co-administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for ritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The Summary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with REYATAZ and ritonavir.

Atazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, REYATAZ is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, lomitapide, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of REYATAZ with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased grazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecapreir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).

## Other interactions

Interactions between atazanavir and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as '↑', decrease as '↓', no change as '↔'). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted atazanavir, which is not the recommended regimen of atazanavir (see section 4.4).

If withdrawal of ritonavir is medically warranted under restrictive conditions (see section 4.4), special attention should be given to atazanavir interactions that may differ in the absence of ritonavir (see information below Table 2).

Interactions between atazanavir and other medicinal products, including those for which coadministration is contraindicated, are listed in the table below:

Total rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin AUC: ↑119% (↑78% ↑169%). In previous studies, the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was not altered by rifabutin. | When given with REYATAZ, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday- Wednesday-Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.

The decrease in AUC, C max , and C min was not mitigated when an increased dose of REYATAZ/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors. | unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded (see section 4.4). |

| Amiodarone, Systemic lidocaine, Quinidine | Concentrations of these antiarrhythmics may be increased when co-administered with REYATAZ. The mechanism of amiodarone or systemic lidocaine/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A inhibition. Quinidine has a narrow therapeutic window and is contraindicated due to potential inhibition of CYP3A by REYATAZ. | Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended when available. The concomitant use of quinidine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids (all routes of administration) | Co-administration with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of REYATAZ and development of resistance to atazanavir and/or ritonavir. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by dexamethasone and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.                                                                                                                                                 | Co-administration with corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A, particularly for long-term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. The potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects should be considered.

| Fluticasone propionate intranasal 50 μ g 4 times daily for 7 days (ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily) And Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids | The fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82% - 89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway, e.g., budesonide. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are yet unknown. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. Concomitant use of REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) and other Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids is expected to produce the same effects. | Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and these glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period. Concomitant use of Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids and REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) may increase plasma concentrations of Inhaled/Nasal corticosteroids. Use with caution.

| Ethinyloestradiol 25 μg + norgestimate (atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily) | Ethinyloestradiol AUC: ↓19% (↓25% ↓13%) Ethinyloestradiol C max : ↓16% (↓26% ↓5%) Ethinyloestradiol C min : ↓37% (↓45% ↓29%) Norgestimate AUC: ↑85% (↑67% ↑105%) Norgestimate C max : ↑68% (↑51% ↑88%) Norgestimate C min : ↑102% (↑77% ↑131%) While the concentration of ethinyloestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinyloestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir. The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side-effects (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance. | If an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 μg of ethinyloestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided.

Co- administration with REYATAZ may cause a large increase in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co- administration of REYATAZ with benzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4-fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. | Co-administration of REYATAZ with triazolam or orally administered midazolam is contraindicated (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of REYATAZ and parenteral midazolam. If REYATAZ is co- administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir-boosted regimen (see section 4.4)

The same recommendations for drug interactions would apply except:

-  that co-administration is not recommended with tenofovir, proton pump inhibitors, and buprenorphine and contraindicated with carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.
-  that co-administration with famotidine is not recommended but if required, atazanavir without ritonavir should be administered either 2 hours after famotidine or 12 hours before. No single dose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed 40 mg.
-  the need to consider that:
-  co-administration of apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban and REYATAZ without ritonavir may affect apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban concentrations
-  co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ without ritonavir may affect atazanavir concentrations
-  co-administration of fluticasone and REYATAZ without ritonavir may increase fluticasone concentrations relative to fluticasone given alone
-  if an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain no more than 30 μ g of ethinyloestradiol
-  no dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A moderate amount of data in pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative toxicity of atazanavir. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of REYATAZ with ritonavir may be considered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.

In clinical trial AI424-182 REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine was administered to 41 pregnant women during the second or third trimester. Six of 20 (30%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and 13 of 21 (62%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grades 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinaemia. There were no cases of lactic acidosis observed in the clinical trial AI424-182.

The study assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment (which did not include REYATAZ) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the time of delivery and/or during the first 6 months postpartum. Three of 20 infants (15%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and four of 20 infants (20%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grade 3-4 bilirubin. There was no evidence of pathologic jaundice and six of 40 infants in this study received phototherapy for a maximum of 4 days. There were no reported cases of kernicterus in neonates.

For dosing recommendations see section 4.2 and for pharmacokinetic data see section 5.2.

It is not known whether REYATAZ with ritonavir administered to the mother during pregnancy will exacerbate physiological hyperbilirubinaemia and lead to kernicterus in neonates and infants. In the prepartum period, additional monitoring should be considered.

## Breast-feeding

Atazanavir has been detected in human milk. In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

In a nonclinical fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with regimens containing REYATAZ (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

REYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal products in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily (1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 96 weeks median duration and 108 weeks maximum duration).

Adverse reactions were consistent between patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and patients who received REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, except that jaundice and elevated total bilirubin levels were reported more frequently with REYATAZ plus ritonavir.

Among patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a possible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), diarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (13%). Among patients receiving REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg, the frequency of jaundice was 19%. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a few days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.4).

a  These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance, however, the frequencies were estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to REYATAZ in randomised controlled and other available clinical trials (n = 2 321).

b See description of selected adverse reactions for more details.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).

## Rash and associated syndromes

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks of starting therapy with REYATAZ.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of REYATAZ (see section 4.4).

## Laboratory abnormalities

The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin was noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. Among naïve patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations (see section 4.4).

Other marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low neutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic -oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%).

Two percent of patients treated with REYATAZ experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations.

In a clinical study AI424-020, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age who received either the oral powder or capsule formulation had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ of 115 weeks. The safety profile in this study was overall comparable to that seen in adults. Both asymptomatic firstdegree (23%) and second -degree (1%) atrioventricular block were reported in paediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in paediatric patients receiving REYATAZ was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) which occurred in 45% of patients.

In clinical studies AI424-397 and AI424-451, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 11 years of age had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ oral powder of 80 weeks. No deaths were reported. The safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to that seen in previous paediatric and adult studies. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving REYATAZ oral powder was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 34; 16%) and increased amylase (Grade 34; 33%), generally of non -pancreatic origin. Elevation in ALT levels were more frequently reported in paediatric patients in these studies than in adults.

## Other special populations

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

Among 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those without chronic viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed between these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of treatment emergent hepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable between REYATAZ and comparator regimens (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Human experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up to 1,200 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects. At high doses that lead to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high drug exposures, jaundice due to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia (without associated liver function test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Treatment of overdose with REYATAZ should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG), and observations of the patient's clinical status. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. There is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ. Since atazanavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicinal product.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE08

## Mechanism of action

Atazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions and infection of other cells.

Antiviral activity in vitro: atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 activity in cell culture.

## Resistance

## Antiretroviral treatment naïve adult patients

In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution for atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of phenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients treated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI substitutions. The N88S substitution has been rarely observed in patients with virologic failure on atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir when it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead to phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy.

## Table 3: De novo substitutions in treatment-naïve patients failing therapy with atazanavir + ritonavir (Study 138, 96 weeks)

| Frequency   | de novo PI substitution (n = 26) a   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| > 20%       | none                                 |

a Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL).

The M184I/V substitution emerged in 5/26 REYATAZ/ritonavir and 7/26 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic failure patients, respectively.

## Antiretroviral treatment experienced adult patients

In antiretroviral treatment experienced patients from Studies 009, 043, and 045, 100 isolates from patients designated as virological failures on therapy that included either atazanavir, atazanavir + ritonavir, or atazanavir + saquinavir were determined to have developed resistance to atazanavir. Of the 60 isolates from patients treated with either atazanavir or atazanavir + ritonavir, 18 (30%) displayed the I50L phenotype previously described in naïve patients.

a Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL).

b Ten patients had baseline phenotypic resistance to atazanavir + ritonavir (fold change [FC]&gt; 5.2). FC susceptibility in cell culture relative to the wild-type reference was assayed using PhenoSense TM  (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, California, USA)

None of the de novo substitutions (see Table 4) are specific to atazanavir and may reflect reemergence of archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study 045 treatment-experienced population.

The resistance in antiretroviral treatment experienced patients mainly occurs by accumulation of the major and minor resistance substitutions described previously to be involved in protease inhibitor resistance.

## Clinical results

In antiretroviral naïve adult patients

Study 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of treatment-naïve patients comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). The REYATAZ/ritonavir arm showed similar (non-inferior) antiviral efficacy compared to the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, as assessed by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (Table 5).

Analyses of data through 96 weeks of treatment demonstrated durability of antiviral activity (Table 5).

In an open-label, randomised, comparative study following a 26- to 30-week induction phase with REYATAZ 300 mg + ritonavir 100 mg once daily and two NRTIs, unboosted REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and two NRTIs administered during a 48-week maintenance phase (n = 87) had similar antiviral efficacy compared with REYATAZ + ritonavir and two NRTIs (n = 85) in HIV-infected subjects with fully suppressed HIV replication, as assessed by the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL : 78% of subjects on unboosted REYATAZ and two NRTIs compared with 75% on REYATAZ + ritonavir and two NRTIs.

Eleven subjects (13%) in the unboosted REYATAZ group and 6 (7%) in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group, had virologic rebound. Four subjects in the unboosted REYATAZ group and 2 in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group had HIV RNA &gt; 500 copies/mL during the maintenance phase. No subject in either group showed emergence of protease inhibitor resistance. The M184V substitution in reverse transcriptase, which confers resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine, was detected in 2 subjects in the unboosted REYATAZ and 1 subject in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group.

There were fewer treatment discontinuations in the unboosted REYATAZ group (1 vs. 4 subjects in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group). There was less hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice in the unboosted REYATAZ group compared with the REYATAZ + ritonavir group (18 and 28 subjects, respectively).

## In antiretroviral experienced adult patients

Study 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and REYATAZ/saquinavir (400/1,200 mg once daily), to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/100 mg fixed-dose combination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) and one NRTI, in patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at least one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI. For randomised patients, the mean time of prior antiretroviral exposure was 138 weeks for PIs, 281 weeks for NRTIs, and 85 weeks for NNRTIs. At baseline, 34% of patients were receiving a PI and 60% were receiving an NNRTI. Fifteen of 120 (13%) patients in the REYATAZ + ritonavir treatment arm and 17 of 123 (14%) patients in the lopinavir + ritonavir arm had four or more of the PI substitutions L10, M46, I54, V82, I84, and L90. Thirty-two percent of patients in the study had a viral strain with fewer than two NRTI substitutions.

The primary endpoint was the time-averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA through 48 weeks (Table 6).

Through 48 weeks of treatment, the mean changes from baseline in HIV RNA levels for REYATAZ + ritonavir and lopinavir + ritonavir were similar (non-inferior). Consistent results were obtained with the last observation carried forward method of analysis (timeaveraged difference of 0.11, 97.5% confidence interval [-0.15, 0.36]). By as-treated analysis, excluding missing values, the proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL (&lt; 50 copies/mL) in the REYATAZ + ritonavir arm and the lopinavir + ritonavir arm were 55% (40%) and 56% (46%), respectively.

Through 96 weeks of treatment, mean HIV RNA changes from baseline for REYATAZ + ritonavir and lopinavir + ritonavir met criteria for non-inferiority based on observed cases. Consistent results were obtained with the last observation carried forward method of analysis. By as-treated analysis, excluding missing values, the proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL (&lt; 50 copies/mL ) for REYATAZ + ritonavir were 84% (72%) and for lopinavir + ritonavir were 82% (72%). It is important to note that at time of the 96 -week analysis, 48% of patients overall remained on study.

REYATAZ + saquinavir was shown to be inferior to lopinavir + ritonavir.

## Paediatric population

Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of REYATAZ is based on data from the open-label, multicenter clinical trial AI424-020 conducted in patients from 3 months to 21 years of age. Overall in this study, 182 paediatric patients (81 antiretroviral-naïve and 101 antiretroviral-experienced) received once daily REYATAZ (capsule or powder formulation), with or without ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs.

The clinical data derived from this study are inadequate to support the use of atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) in children below 6 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy data observed in the 41 paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years that received REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 7. For treatment-naïve paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 344 cells/mm 3 (range: 2 to 800 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.70 to 5.00 log10 copies/mL). For treatmentexperienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 522 cells/mm 3 (range: 100 to 1157 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.09 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.28 to 5.00 log10 copies/mL).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-infected patients; significant differences were observed between the two groups. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir exhibit a non-linear disposition.

Absorption: in HIV-infected patients (n = 33, combined studies), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir, Cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/mL, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.5 hours. The geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir C min and AUC was 654 (76%) ng/mL and 44185 (51%) ng·h/mL, respectively.

In HIV-infected patients (n = 13), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 400 mg (without ritonavir) once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir C max of 2298 (71) ng/mL, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.0 hours. The geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir C min and AUC were 120 (109) ng/mL and 14874 (91) ng·h/mL, respectively.

Food effect: co-administration of REYATAZ and ritonavir with food optimises the bioavailability of atazanavir. Co-administration of a single 300-mg dose of REYATAZ and 100-mg dose of ritonavir with a light meal resulted in a 33% increase in the AUC and a 40% increase in both the C max and the 24 hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state. Co-administration with a high-fat meal did not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11% of fasting values. The 24-hour concentration following a high-fat meal was increased by approximately

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

33% due to delayed absorption; the median T max increased from 2.0 to 5.0 hours. Administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir with either a light or a high fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately 25% compared to the fasting state. To enhance bioavailability and minimise variability, REYATAZ is to be taken with food.

Distribution: atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration range of 100 to 10,000 ng/mL. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin to a similar extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/mL). In a multiple-dose study in HIVinfected patients dosed with 400-mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, atazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen.

Metabolism: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic pathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma have been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity.

Elimination: following a single 400 mg dose of 14 Catazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% and 7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult patients (n = 33, combined studies) the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was 12 hours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light meal.

## Special populations

Renal impairment : in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7% of the administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with renal insufficiency. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been studied in adult patients with severe renal impairment (n = 20), including those on haemodialysis, at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily. Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not studied), results suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to 50% in patients undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown. (See sections 4.2 and 4.4.)

Hepatic impairment : atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been studied in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment (14 Child-Pugh Class B and 2 Child-Pugh Class C subjects) after a single 400-mg dose. The mean AUC(0-∞) was 42% greater in subjects with impaired hepatic function than in healthy subjects. The mean half-life of atazanavir in hepatically impaired subjects was 12.1 hours compared to 6.4 hours in healthy subjects. The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir after a 300 mg dose with ritonavir have not been studied. Concentrations of atazanavir with or without ritonavir are expected to be increased in patients with moderately or severely impaired hepatic function (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4).

Age/Gender: a study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in 59 healthy male and female subjects (29 young, 30 elderly). There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender.

Race: a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Phase II clinical trials indicated no effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir.

## Pregnancy:

The pharmacokinetic data from HIV-infected pregnant women receiving REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 8.

a  Atazanavir peak concentrations and AUCs were found to be approximately 2640% higher during the postpartum period (4-12 weeks) than those observed historically in HIV-infected, non-pregnant patients. Atazanavir plasma trough concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher during the postpartum period when compared to those observed historically in HIV-infected non-pregnant patients.

b Cmin is concentration 24 hours post-dose.

## Paediatric population

There is a trend toward a higher clearance in younger children when normalised for body weight. As a result, greater peak to trough ratios are observed, however at recommended doses, geometric mean atazanavir exposures (Cmin, Cmax, and AUC) in paediatric patients are expected to be similar to those observed in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were generally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic singlecell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses associated with hepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. In female mice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 12 times the exposure in humans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were minimally to mildly increased in rats but not in mice or dogs.

During in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a concentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30-fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in humans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD 90 ) in rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR interval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an initial 2-week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9-month oral toxicity studies in dogs showed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data is unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose (see section 4.9).

In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic doses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or moribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive embryodevelopment study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir produced a transient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic exposure to atazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly greater than that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily.

Atazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled DNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro .

In long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas in female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and is considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no tumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats.

Atazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may be an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

REYATAZ oral powder, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1-infected paediatric patients at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg (see section 4.2).

Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations). The choice of REYATAZ in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on individual viral resistance testing and the patient's treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

Posology

Paediatric patients (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg)

The doses of atazanavir oral powder and ritonavir for paediatric patients are based on body weight as shown in Table 1. REYATAZ oral powder must be taken with ritonavir and has to be taken with food.

Table 1: Dose of REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir for paediatric patients a  (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg)

| Body weight (kg)            | REYATAZ once daily dose   | ritonavir once daily dose   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| at least 5 to less than 15  | 200 mg (4 sachets b )     | 80 mg c                     |
| at least 15 to less than 35 | 250 mg (5 sachets b )     | 80 mg c                     |

a  The same recommendations regarding the timing and maximum doses of concomitant proton pump inhibitors and H2receptor antagonists in adults also apply to paediatric patients (see section 4.5).

b  Each sachet contains 50 mg of atazanavir.

c Ritonavir oral solution.

d Ritonavir oral solution or capsule/tablet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

REYATAZ capsules are available for paediatric patients at least 6 years of age who weigh at least 15 kg and who are able to swallow capsules (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ capsules). Switching from REYATAZ oral powder to REYATAZ capsules is encouraged as soon as patients are able to consistently swallow capsules.

When transitioning between formulations, a change in dose may be needed. Consult the dosing table for the specific formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for REYATAZ capsules).

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed. REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

REYATAZ with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. REYATAZ with ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. REYATAZ must not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2).

## Pregnancy and Postpartum

## During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy:

REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may not provide sufficient exposure to atazanavir, especially when the activity of atazanavir or the whole regimen may be compromised due to drug resistance. Since there are limited data available and due to inter-patient variability during pregnancy, Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) may be considered to ensure adequate exposure.

The risk of a further decrease in atazanavir exposure is expected when atazanavir is given with medicinal products known to reduce its exposure (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil or H2-receptor antagonists).

-  If tenofovir disoproxil or an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered (see sections 4.6 and 5.2).
-  It is not recommended to use REYATAZ with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir disoproxil and an H2-receptor antagonist.

## During postpartum:

Following a possible decrease in atazanavir exposure during the second and third trimester, atazanavir exposures might increase during the first two months after delivery (see section 5.2). Therefore, postpartum patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

-  During this time, postpartum patients should follow the same dose recommendation as for nonpregnant patients, including those for co-administration of medicinal products known to affect atazanavir exposure (see section 4.5).

## Paediatric patients (less than 3 months of age)

REYATAZ has not been studied in children less than 3 months of age and is not recommended because of the potential risk of kernicterus.

## Method of administration

## For oral use.

REYATAZ oral powder should be taken/given with food (e.g., applesauce or yogurt) or drinks (e.g., milk, infant formula, or water) for infants who can drink from a cup. For young infants (less than 6 months) who cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, REYATAZ oral powder should be mixed with infant formula and given using an oral syringe, which can be obtained from a pharmacist. Administration of REYATAZ and infant formula using an infant bottle is not recommended because the full dose may not be delivered.

For details on preparation and administration of the REYATAZ oral powder and Instructions for Use, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Patients with moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Co-administration with simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only (see section 4.5). For co-administration of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

Co-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., quetiapine, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, lurasidone, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), lomitapide and ergot alkaloids, particularly, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 due to the potential for loss of therapeutic effect and development of possible resistance (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's wort, apalutamide, encorafenib, ivosidenib, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin) (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination (see section 4.5).

Co-administration with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination (see section 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see Interaction with other Medicinal Products below).

## Patients with coexisting conditions

## Hepatic impairment

Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma concentrations were observed in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of REYATAZ has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products (see section 4.8).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## QT prolongation

Dose-related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with REYATAZ have been observed in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing REYATAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/or in patients with preexisting risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).

## Haemophiliac patients

There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and haemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding.

## Weight and metabolic parameters

An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.

In clinical studies, REYATAZ with ritonavir has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser extent than lopinavir with ritonavir in either treatment-naïve patients (Study 138) or treatmentexperienced patients (Study 045), (see section 5.1).

## Hyperbilirubinaemia

Reversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving REYATAZ should be evaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended because it may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.

Indinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT. Combinations of REYATAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Cholelithiasis

Cholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms of cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.

## Chronic kidney disease

Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8).

## Nephrolithiasis

Nephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.

## Rash and associated syndromes

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks of starting therapy with REYATAZ.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops.

The best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of any suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of REYATAZ, REYATAZ may not be restarted.

## Interactions with other medicinal products

The combination of REYATAZ with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of REYATAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the co-administration of REYATAZ with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both REYATAZ and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring.

Atazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PDE5-inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving REYATAZ with concomitant low-dose ritonavir. Co-administration of REYATAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5-associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes, and priapism (see section 4.5).

Co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole.

In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).

Concomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ/ritonavir may result in increased cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol. Co-administration of salmeterol and REYATAZ is not recommended (see section 4.5).

The absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is increased irrespective of cause.

Co-administration of REYATAZ with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded.

Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided (see section 4.5).

## Paediatric population

## Safety

Asymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. Asymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia).

## Efficacy

Atazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.

## Excipients

## Phenylketonuria

REYATAZ oral powder contains aspartame as a sweetening agent. Aspartame provides a source of phenylalanine and, therefore, may not be suitable for persons with phenylketonuria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Diabetic population

REYATAZ oral powder contains 1 305.15 mg of sucrose per sachet. For the recommended paediatric dosage, REYATAZ oral powder contains 3 915.45 mg sucrose per 150 mg atazanavir, 5 220.60 mg sucrose per 200 mg atazanavir, 6 525.75 mg sucrose per 250 mg atazanavir, and 7 830.90 mg sucrose per 300 mg atazanavir. This should be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption, or sucrase isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

When REYATAZ and ritonavir are co-administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for ritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The Summary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with REYATAZ and ritonavir.

Atazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, lomitapide, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased grazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecapreir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).

## Other interactions

Interactions between atazanavir/ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors, and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as '↑', decrease as '↓', no change as '↔'). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted atazanavir, which is not the approved regimen of atazanavir.

Interactions between atazanavir and other medicinal products, including those for which coadministration is contraindicated, are listed in the table below:

Total rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin AUC: ↑119% (↑78% ↑169%). In previous studies, the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was not altered by rifabutin. | When given with REYATAZ, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesday-Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for REYATAZ. |

| Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids (all routes of administration) | Co-administration with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of REYATAZ and development of resistance to atazanavir and/or ritonavir. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by dexamethasone and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir. | Co-administration with corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A, particularly for long-term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. The potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects should be considered. For co-administration of cutaneously administered corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the corticosteroid for condition or uses that augment its systemic absorption. |

| Fluticasone propionate intranasal 50 μg 4 times daily for 7 days (ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily) And Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids | The fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82% - 89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway, e.g., budesonide. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are yet unknown. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. Concomitant use of REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) and other Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids is expected to produce the same effects. | Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and these glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.

| Ethinyloestradiol 25 μg + norgestimate (atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily) | Ethinyloestradiol AUC: ↓19% (↓25% ↓13%) Ethinyloestradiol C max : ↓16% (↓26% ↓5%) Ethinyloestradiol C min : ↓37% (↓45% ↓29%) Norgestimate AUC: ↑85% (↑67% ↑105%) Norgestimate C max : ↑68% (↑51% ↑88%) Norgestimate C min : ↑102% (↑77% ↑131%) While the concentration of ethinyloestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinyloestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir. The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side effects (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance. | If an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 μg of ethinyloestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided.

If the use of atorvastatin is considered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with careful safety monitoring (see section 4.4). |
| Pravastatin Fluvastatin                                                | Although not studied, there is a potential for an increase in pravastatin or fluvastatin exposure when co-administered with protease inhibitors. Pravastatin is not metabolised by CYP3A4.

Concentrations of atazanavir (when given with ritonavir) were not significantly affected. | Co-administration with REYATAZ with ritonavir warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects. A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered.                                                                                                 |

| Midazolam Triazolam                      | Midazolam and triazolam are extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Co- administration with REYATAZ may cause a large increase in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co- administration of REYATAZ with benzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4-fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. | Co-administration of REYATAZ with triazolam or orally administered midazolam is contraindicated (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co- administration of REYATAZ and parenteral midazolam. If REYATAZ is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. |

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A moderate amount of data in pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative toxicity of atazanavir. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of REYATAZ may be considered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.

In clinical trial AI424-182 REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine was administered to 41 pregnant women during the second or third trimester. Six of 20 (30%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and 13 of 21 (62%) women on REYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grades 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinaemia. There were no cases of lactic acidosis observed in the clinical trial AI424-182.

The study assessed 40 infants who received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment (which did not include REYATAZ) and were negative for HIV-1 DNA at the time of delivery and/or during the first 6 months postpartum. Three of 20 infants (15%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 300/100 mg and four of 20 infants (20%) born to women treated with REYATAZ/ritonavir 400/100 mg experienced grade 3-4 bilirubin. There was no evidence of pathologic jaundice and six of 40 infants in this study received phototherapy for a maximum of 4 days. There were no reported cases of kernicterus in neonates.

For dosing recommendations see section 4.2 and for pharmacokinetic data see section 5.2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is not known whether REYATAZ administered to the mother during pregnancy will exacerbate physiological hyperbilirubinaemia and lead to kernicterus in neonates and infants. In the prepartum period, additional monitoring should be considered.

## Breast-feeding

Atazanavir has been detected in human milk. In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants.

## Fertility

In a nonclinical fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with regimens containing REYATAZ (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

REYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal products in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily (1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 96 weeks median duration and 108 weeks maximum duration).

Adverse reactions were consistent between patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and patients who received REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, except that jaundice and elevated total bilirubin levels were reported more frequently with REYATAZ plus ritonavir.

Among patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a possible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), diarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (13%). Among patients receiving REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg, the frequency of jaundice was 19%. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a few days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

Chronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Assessment of adverse reactions for REYATAZ is based on safety data from clinical studies and postmarketing experience. Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

b See description of selected adverse reactions for more details.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rash and associated syndromes

Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks of starting therapy with REYATAZ.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of REYATAZ (see section 4.4).

## Laboratory abnormalities

The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated indirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin was noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. Among naïve patients treated with REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations (see section 4.4).

Other marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low neutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic -oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%).

Two percent of patients treated with REYATAZ experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations.

## Paediatric population

In a clinical study AI424-020, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age who received either the oral powder or capsule formulation had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ of 115 weeks. The safety profile in this study was overall comparable to that seen in adults. Both asymptomatic firstdegree (23%) and second -degree (1%) atrioventricular block were reported in paediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving REYATAZ was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) which occurred in 45% of patients.

In clinical studies AI424-397 and AI424-451, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 11 years of age had a mean duration of treatment with REYATAZ oral powder of 80 weeks. No deaths were reported. The safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to that seen in previous paediatric and adult studies. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving REYATAZ oral powder was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 34; 16%) and increased amylase (Grade 34; 33%), generally of non -pancreatic origin. Elevation in ALT levels were more frequently reported in paediatric patients in these studies than in adults.

## Other special populations

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

Among 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those without chronic viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed between these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of treatment emergent hepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable between REYATAZ and comparator regimens (see section 4.4).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Human experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited. Single doses up to 1,200 mg have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects. At high doses that lead to high drug exposures, jaundice due to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia (without associated liver function test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Treatment of overdose with REYATAZ should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG), and observations of the patient's clinical status. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. There is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ. Since atazanavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicinal product.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE08

## Mechanism of action

Atazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions and infection of other cells.

Antiviral activity in vitro: atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 activity in cell culture.

## Resistance

## Antiretroviral treatment naïve adult patients

In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution for atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of phenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients treated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline PI substitutions. The N88S substitution has been rarely observed in patients with virologic failure on atazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to atazanavir when it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does not always lead to phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical efficacy.

The M184I/V substitution emerged in 5/26 REYATAZ/ritonavir and 7/26 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic failure patients, respectively.

## Antiretroviral treatment experienced adult patients

In antiretroviral treatment experienced patients from Studies 009, 043, and 045, 100 isolates from patients designated as virological failures on therapy that included either atazanavir, atazanavir + ritonavir, or atazanavir + saquinavir were determined to have developed resistance to atazanavir. Of the 60 isolates from patients treated with either atazanavir or atazanavir + ritonavir, 18 (30%) displayed the I50L phenotype previously described in naïve patients.

- a Number of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL).

b Ten patients had baseline phenotypic resistance to atazanavir + ritonavir (fold change [FC]&gt; 5.2). FC susceptibility in cell culture relative to the wild-type reference was assayed using PhenoSense TM  (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, California, USA)

None of the de novo substitutions (see Table 4) are specific to atazanavir and may reflect reemergence of archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study 045 treatment-experienced population.

The resistance in antiretroviral treatment experienced patients mainly occurs by accumulation of the major and minor resistance substitutions described previously to be involved in protease inhibitor resistance.

## Clinical results

## In antiretroviral naïve adult patients

Study 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of 883 antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily). The REYATAZ/ritonavir arm showed similar (non-inferior) antiviral efficacy compared to the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, as assessed by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (Table 5).

Analyses of data through 96 weeks of treatment demonstrated durability of antiviral activity (Table 5).

The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 214 cells/mm 3 (range: 2 to 810 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.94 log10 copies/mL (range: 2.6 to 5.88 log10 copies/mL). The REYATAZ/ritonavir arm has similar (non-inferior) antiviral efficacy compared to the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, as assessed by the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48: 78% of patients on REYATAZ/ritonavir compared to 76% on lopinavir/ritonavir (difference estimate of ATV/RTVLPV/RTV: 1.7% [95% CI, 3.8%, 7.1%] according to the Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR) Non-Completer = Failure (NC = F) definition of response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a per protocol analysis which excluded non-completers (i.e., patients who discontinued before the Week 48 HIV RNA assessment) and patients with major protocol deviations, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 86% (338/392) for REYATAZ/ritonavir and 89% (332/372) for lopinavir/ritonavir (difference estimate of ATV/RTV -LPV/RTV: 3% [95% CI, -7.6%, 1.5%].

## In antiretroviral experienced adult patients

Study 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and REYATAZ/saquinavir (400/1,200 mg once daily), to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/100 mg fixed-dose combination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) and one NRTI, in patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at least one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI. For randomised patients, the mean time of prior antiretroviral exposure was 138 weeks for PIs, 281 weeks for NRTIs, and 85 weeks for NNRTIs. At baseline, 34% of patients were receiving a PI and 60% were receiving an NNRTI. Fifteen of 120 (13%) patients in the REYATAZ + ritonavir treatment arm and 17 of 123 (14%) patients in the lopinavir + ritonavir arm

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

had four or more of the PI substitutions L10, M46, I54, V82, I84, and L90. Thirty-two percent of patients in the study had a viral strain with fewer than two NRTI substitutions.

The primary endpoint was the time-averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA through 48 weeks (Table 6).

Through 48 weeks of treatment, the mean changes from baseline in HIV RNA levels for REYATAZ + ritonavir and lopinavir + ritonavir were similar (non-inferior). Consistent results were obtained with the last observation carried forward method of analysis (timeaveraged difference of 0.11, 97.5% confidence interval [-0.15, 0.36]). By as-treated analysis, excluding missing values, the proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL (&lt; 50 copies/mL) in the REYATAZ + ritonavir arm and the lopinavir + ritonavir arm were 55% (40%) and 56% (46%), respectively.

Through 96 weeks of treatment, mean HIV RNA changes from baseline for REYATAZ + ritonavir and lopinavir + ritonavir met criteria for non-inferiority based on observed cases. Consistent results were obtained with the last observation carried forward method of analysis. By as-treated analysis, excluding missing values, the proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL (&lt; 50 copies/mL ) for REYATAZ + ritonavir were 84% (72%) and for lopinavir + ritonavir were 82% (72%). It is important to note that at time of the 96 -week analysis, 48% of patients overall remained on study.

REYATAZ + saquinavir was shown to be inferior to lopinavir + ritonavir.

## Paediatric population

## Paediatric trials with REYATAZ capsules

Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of REYATAZ is based on data from the open-label, multicenter clinical trial AI424-020 conducted in patients from 3 months to 21 years of age. Overall in this study, 182 paediatric patients (81 antiretroviral-naïve and 101 antiretroviral-experienced) received once daily REYATAZ (capsule or powder formulation), with or without ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs.

The clinical data derived from this study are inadequate to support the use of atazanavir capsules (with or without ritonavir) in children below 6 years of age.

Efficacy data observed in the 41 paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years that received REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 7. For treatment-naïve paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 344 cells/mm 3 (range: 2 to 800 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.70 to 5.00 log10 copies/mL). For treatment experienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 522 cells/mm 3 (range: 100 to 1157 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.09 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.28 to 5.00 log10 copies/mL).

## Paediatric trials with REYATAZ oral powder

Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and virologic response of REYATAZ oral powder was based on data from two open-label, multicenter clinical trials.

-  AI424-397 (PRINCE I): In paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 6 years of age
-  AI424-451 (PRINCE II): In paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 11 years of age

In these studies, 155 patients (59 antiretroviral-naïve and 96 antiretroviral-experienced) received once daily REYATAZ oral powder and ritonavir, in combination with two NRTIs.

For inclusion in both trials, treatment-naïve patients had to have genotypic sensitivity to REYATAZ and two NRTIs, and treatment-experienced patients had to have documented genotypic and phenotypic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sensitivity at screening to REYATAZ and at least 2 NRTIs. Patients exposed only to antiretrovirals in utero or intrapartum were considered treatment-naïve. Patients who received REYATAZ or REYATAZ/ritonavir at any time prior to study enrollment or who had a history of treatment failure on two or more protease inhibitors, protease inhibitor resistance or evidence of pre-existing cardiac abnormalities were excluded from the trials. Protease inhibitor resistance was defined as genotypic resistance to atazanavir or either component of the local NRTI backbone based on the criteria of 1) any major mutations: I50L, I84V, N88S and 2) ≥ 2 of the following minor or cross resistant mutations: M46I/L, G48V, I54L/V/M/T/A, V82A/T/FI, L90M, V32I.

At Week 48 there were 134 paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 11 years that received REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir that were evaluated for efficacy. These data are presented in Table 8. For treatment-naïve paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 930 cells/mm 3 (range: 46 to 2291 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.81 log10 copies/mL (range: 3.4 to 5.9 log10 copies/mL). For treatment-experienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 1441 cells/mm 3 (range: 84 to 5703 cells/mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/mL (range: 2.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/mL).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Absorption: in HIV-infected patients (n = 33, combined studies), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir, Cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/mL, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.5 hours. The geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir C min and AUC was 654 (76%) ng/mL and 44185 (51%) ng·h/mL, respectively.

Food effect: co-administration of REYATAZ and ritonavir with food optimises the bioavailability of atazanavir. Co-administration of a single 300-mg dose of REYATAZ and 100-mg dose of ritonavir with a light meal resulted in a 33% increase in the AUC and a 40% increase in both the C max and the 24-hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state. Co-administration with a high-fat meal did not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11% of fasting values. The 24-hour concentration following a high-fat meal was increased by approximately

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

33% due to delayed absorption; the median T max increased from 2.0 to 5.0 hours. Administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir with either a light or a high-fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately 25% compared to the fasting state. To enhance bioavailability and minimise variability, REYATAZ is to be taken with food.

Distribution: atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration range of 100 to 10,000 ng/mL. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin to a similar extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/mL). In a multiple-dose study in HIV-infected patients dosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, atazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen.

Metabolism: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic pathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma have been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity.

Elimination: following a single 400-mg dose of 14 Catazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% and 7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult patients (n = 33, combined studies) the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was 12 hours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light meal.

Linearity/non-linearity: the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV infected patients; significant differences were observed between the two groups. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir exhibit a non-linear disposition.

## Special populations

Renal impairment : in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7% of the administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients with renal insufficiency. REYATAZ (without ritonavir) has been studied in adult patients with severe renal impairment (n = 20), including those on haemodialysis, at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily. Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not studied), results suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to 50% in patients undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function. The mechanism of this decrease is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.).

Hepatic impairment : atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir after a 300 mg dose with ritonavir have not been studied. Concentrations of atazanavir with or without ritonavir are expected to be increased in patients with moderately or severely impaired hepatic function (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4).

Age/Gender: a study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in 59 healthy male and female subjects (29 young, 30 elderly). There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender.

Race: a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Phase II clinical trials indicated no effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir.

## Pregnancy:

The pharmacokinetic data from HIV-infected pregnant women receiving REYATAZ capsules with ritonavir are presented in Table 9.

a  Atazanavir peak concentrations and AUCs were found to be approximately 2640% higher during the postpartum period (4-12 weeks) than those observed historically in HIV-infected, non-pregnant patients. Atazanavir plasma trough concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher during the postpartum period when compared to those observed historically in HIV-infected non-pregnant patients.

b Cmin is concentration 24 hours post-dose.

## Paediatric population

There is a trend toward a higher clearance in younger children when normalised for body weight. As a result, greater peak to trough ratios are observed; however at recommended doses, geometric mean atazanavir exposures (Cmin, Cmax, and AUC) in paediatric patients are expected to be similar to those observed in adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were generally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic singlecell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses associated with hepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. In female mice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 12 times the exposure in humans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were minimally to mildly increased in rats but not in mice or dogs.

During in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a concentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30-fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in humans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD 90 ) in rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR interval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an initial 2-week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9-month oral toxicity studies in dogs showed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data is unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose (see section 4.9).

In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic doses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or moribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive embryodevelopment study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir produced a transient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic exposure to atazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly greater than that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily.

Atazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled DNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro .

In long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas in female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and is considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no tumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats.

Atazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may be an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye.

food may be used for dosing. It should be ensured that the patient eats or drinks all the infant formula, beverage or food that contains the powder.

- A: To mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder sachets with liquid infant formula in a small medicine cup or small container and to administer with an oral syringe, which can be obtained from a pharmacist:
-  A spoon is used to mix the content of the appropriate number of sachets (4 or 5 sachets depending on infant weight) with 10 mL of prepared liquid infant formula in the medicine cup or small container. The full amount of the mixture is drawn up into an oral syringe and administered into either right or left inner cheek of the infant. Another 10 mL of formula is poured into the medicine cup or small container to rinse off remaining REYATAZ oral powder in the cup or container. The residual mixture is drawn up into the syringe and administered into either the right or left inner cheek of the infant.
- B: To mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder sachets with a beverage such as milk or water in a small drinking cup:
-  A spoon is used to mix the content of the sachets with 30 mL of the beverage. The child is to drink the mixture. An additional 15 mL of beverage is added to the drinking cup for thorough rinsing of the cup and contents are mixed. The child is to drink the entire residual mixture.
-  If water is used, food should also be taken at the same time.
- C: To mix the recommended number of REYATAZ oral powder sachets with food such as applesauce or yogurt in a small container:
-  One tablespoon of food is used to mix the content of the sachets. The mixture is fed to the infant or young child.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for

REYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease inhibitors . These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a protein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

REYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has prescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ is best for you.

## 2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ

## Do not take REYATAZ

-  if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
-  if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ
-  if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ
-  rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)
-  astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines may be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes called heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to correct heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland)
-  quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder); lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)
-  medicines containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum , an herbal preparation)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve anxiety)
-  lomitapide, simvastatin, and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-  grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination, and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection)
-  apalutamide (used to treat prostate cancer), encorafenib (used to treat cancer) and ivosidenib (used to treat cancer)
-  carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (used to treat seizures)

Do not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Tell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you.

## Warnings and precautions

REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses linked to HIV infection.

Some people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows:

-  if you have hepatitis B or C
-  if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach)
-  if you have type A or B haemophilia
-  if you require haemodialysis

REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work.

Kidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your doctor immediately.

In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor, or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder), and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately.

If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. Children receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide this.

## Children

Do not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The use of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been studied due to the risk of serious complications.

## Other medicines and REYATAZ

You must not take REYATAZ with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take REYATAZ, at the start of Section 2.

There are other medicines that may not mix with REYATAZ. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these:

-  other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g., indinavir, nevirapine, and efavirenz)
-  sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C)
-  sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction))
-  if you are taking an oral contraceptive ( \"the Pill\" ) with REYATAZ to prevent pregnancy, be sure to take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses
-  any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g., antacids to be taken 1 hour before taking REYATAZ or 2 hours after taking REYATAZ, H2-blockers like famotidine and proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole)
-  medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, diltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil)
-  atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-  salmeterol (used to treat asthma)
-  cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune system)
-  certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin)
-  ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals)
-  apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor (used to reduce blood clots)
-  lamotrigine (antiepileptic)
-  irinotecan (used to treat cancer)
-  elagolix (gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonists, used to treat severe pain from endometriosis)
-  fostamatinib (used to treat chronic immune thrombocytopenia)
-  sedative agents (e.g., midazolam administered by injection)
-  buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain)
-  corticosteroids (all routes of administration; including dexamethasone).

Some medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with REYATAZ. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking an inhaled or nasal (given in the nose) corticosteroid, including fluticasone or budesonide (given to treat allergic symptoms or asthma).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## REYATAZ with food and drink

It is important that you take REYATAZ with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the body absorb the medicine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

Atazanavir, the active substance of REYATAZ, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breastfeed while taking REYATAZ.

Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.

If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible .

## Driving and using machines

If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately.

## REYATAZ contains lactose.

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g., lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.

## 3. How to take REYATAZ

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus developing resistance to the treatment.

The recommended adult dose of REYATAZ capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may adjust the dose of REYATAZ according to your anti-HIV therapy.

For children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based on your child's weight. The dose of REYATAZ capsules for children is calculated by body weight and is taken once daily with food and 100 mg ritonavir as shown below:

| Body Weight (kg)   |   REYATAZ Dose once daily (mg) |   Ritonavir Dose* once daily (mg) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 15 to less than 35 |                            200 |                               100 |
| at least 35        |                            300 |                               100 |

*Ritonavir capsules, tablets, or oral solution may be used.

REYATAZ is also available as an oral powder for use in children at least 3 months old and weighing at least 5 kg. Switching to REYATAZ capsules from REYATAZ oral powder is encouraged as soon as patients are able to consistently swallow capsules.

A change in dose may occur when switching between oral powder and capsules. Your doctor will decide the right dose based on your child's weight.

There are no dosing recommendations for REYATAZ in paediatric patients less than 3 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by the other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice anything unusual about your health.

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

Tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects:

-  Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears within 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed in association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flulike illness symptoms, blisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face, inflammation of the eye which causes redness (conjunctivitis), painful, warm, or red lumps (nodules).
-  Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes caused by high levels of bilirubin in your blood has been commonly reported. This side effect is usually not dangerous in adults and infants older than 3 months of age; but it might be a symptom of a serious problem. If your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately.
-  Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be symptoms of a serious heart problem.
-  Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start REYATAZ and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection, you may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes, pain around the stomach, pale-colored stools, or nausea.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. What REYATAZ is and What it is used for

REYATAZ is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease inhibitors . These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a protein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way REYATAZ reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.

REYATAZ capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor has prescribed REYATAZ for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with REYATAZ is best for you.

## 2. What you need to know before you take REYATAZ

## Do not take REYATAZ

-  if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
-  if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding whether you can take REYATAZ
-  if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and REYATAZ
-  rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis)
-  astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines may be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes called heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to correct heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland)
-  quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder); lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)
-  medicines containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum , an herbal preparation)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve anxiety)
-  lomitapide, simvastatin, and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)
-  grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed-dose combination, and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed-dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection)
-  apalutamide (used to treat prostate cancer), encorafenib (used to treat cancer) and ivosidenib (used to treat cancer)
-  carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (used to treat seizures)

Do not take sildenafil with REYATAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Tell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you.

## Warnings and precautions

REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses linked to HIV infection.

Some people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows:

-  if you have hepatitis B or C
-  if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach)
-  if you have type A or B haemophilia
-  if you require haemodialysis

REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work.

Kidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your doctor immediately.

In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor, or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder), and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately.

If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. Children receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide this.

## Children

## Warnings and precautions

REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses linked to HIV infection.

Some people will need special care before or while taking REYATAZ. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking REYATAZ and make sure your doctor knows:

-  if you have hepatitis B or C
-  if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach)
-  if you have type A or B haemophilia
-  if you require haemodialysis

REYATAZ may affect how well your kidneys work.

Kidney stones have been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your doctor immediately.

In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor, or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder), and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.

Serious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking REYATAZ. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately.

If you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. Children receiving REYATAZ may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will decide this.

## Children

Do not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The use of REYATAZ in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been studied due to the risk of serious complications.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When treating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by REYATAZ, by the other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you notice anything unusual about your health.

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

Tell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects:

-  Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually disappears within 2 weeks without any change to your REYATAZ treatment. Severe rash may be developed in association with other symptoms which could be serious. Stop taking REYATAZ and talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a severe rash or a rash with flulike illness symptoms, blisters, fever, mouth sores, muscle or joint pain, swelling in the face,
