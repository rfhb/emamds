<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 07-jun-2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for NOXAFIL, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure-P46/031

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

NOXAFIL posaconazole is approved for prophylaxis and salvage treatment of invasive fungal infection in adult and paediatric patients 2 to &lt;18 years of age. It is also approved for the primary treatment of IA but only in adults. Currently approved NOXAFIL (POS) formulations include an IV solution and 3 oral formulations (an oral suspension, a gastro-resistant Powder For Oral Suspension [PFS], and a tablet).

The MAH stated that the paediatric clinical development program, including the present study P104 is described in the PIP (PIP000468-PIP02-12-M08). The P104 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of NOXAFIL IV and oral formulations in paediatric participants 2 to &lt;18 years of age with IA, as defined by EORTC/MSG consensus disease definitions.

The MAH is reviewing the results and intends to submit a type II variation in Q1 2025, consisting of the full relevant data package with amendments, to extend the indication to paediatric patients 2 years and older for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The following study medications will be used in the trial:

- Posaconazole solution for infusion (IV)
- Posaconazole powder for oral suspension (PFS)
- Posaconazole tablets

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

· P104MK5592 A Phase 2, Open-Label, Non-Comparative Clinical Trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of Posaconazole (POS, MK-5592) in Pediatric Participants Aged 2 to Less Than 18 Years With Invasive Aspergillosis (IA).

| Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy/Immunogenicity/ Pharmacokinetic Analyses   | The key efficacy endpoint -- overall proportion of participants in the FAS population with a favorable global clinical response at the Week 6, the Week 12, and the EOT Visits - will be estimated and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) provided using the Clopper-Pearson method. In addition, the overall proportion of participants in the Responder Population who had a relapse of IA through 28 days post-treatment will be provided along with other descriptive statistics. A population PK analysis will be conducted as described in a separate Modeling Analysis Plan based on population PK models developed from prior pediatric and adult PK data for each formulation. Model-predicted individual concentration-time profiles will be used to derive Cmax. Cmim, Cavg. AUC, and Tmx. PK parameters for POS (Cmx, Cmin, Cavg. AUC, Tmaxs) derived from the population PK analysis will be listed and summarized by formulation using descriptive statistics.   |

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 16 clinical investigator study sites in 9 countries enrolled participants.

A total of 34 participants were screened, and 31 participants were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of study intervention.

Most participants in Age Cohort 1 discontinued study intervention prior to Week 12 due to physician decision. About half the participants (47.1%) in Age Cohort 2 discontinued study intervention prior to Week 12; the most common reasons were physician decision and death. The high rates of discontinuation from study intervention due to physician decision were expected because even though participants could receive study intervention for up to 12 weeks, the actual treatment duration for each participant was ba sed on the investigator's clinical judgment.

In both age cohorts, most participants completed the study, and the only reason for discontinuation from the study was death.

Three participants who were screened but not enrolled were screen failures who did not meet inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria.

No participants from either age cohort discontinued from study intervention or the study due to COVID-19.

## Recruitment

First Participant enrolled: 02-JUL-2020

Last participant last visit: 18-DEC-2023

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the age cohorts, except for sex. Age Cohort 1 had an equal number of male and female participants while almost all participants in Age Cohort 2 were male.

Overall, approximately half the participants were white, and the majority of participants were not Hispanic or Latino. The median age for Age Cohort 1 was 8.0 years old (2 to 11 years) and for Age Cohort 2 was 14.0 years old (12 to 17 years). Overall, 71.0% of participants had possible IA, 22.6% of participants had probable IA, and 6.5% of participants had proven IA. More participants in Age Cohort 1 had possible or proven IA than in Age Cohort 2.

## Number analysed

- Thirty-one participants were enrolled (14 in Age Cohort 1; 17 in Age Cohort 2) and included in the APaT (safety) and FAS (efficacy) analysis populations.
- Twenty-five participants were included in the responder population to evaluate relapse of IA.
- Twenty-eight participants (13 in Age Cohort 1; 15 in Age Cohort 2) were included in the primary PK population.

The invcstigator assesscd global clinical response using the 2008 European Organization for Rescarch and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) discase delinition at the Weck 6 and Week 12 visits; in the event of early therapy discontinuation, global clinical response was assessed at the EOT Visit (prior to Wecks 6 or 12 visit).

The Weck 6 assessment included a visit window of+/- 2 wecks; participants who stopped study therapy prior to the Weck 6 Visit and had an end of treatment (EOT) visit were included in the Weck 6 outcome (ie,if no Weck 6 Visit, assessment at EOT Visit prnior to Weck 6 Visit was carried forward). Any death prior toWeck 6was considered as aFailure atWeck 6.

The Weck 12 assessment included a visit window of +/- 4 wecks; participants who stopped study therapy prior to the Weck 12 Visit and only had a Weck 6 Visit or an cnd of treatment (EOT) Visit affer the Weck 6Visit were included in the Weck 12 outcome (ie,ifno Weck 12 visit, assessment at Weck 6 Visit or EOT Visit after the Weck 6Visit was cairied forward).

Any death prior to Weck 12 was considered as a Failure at Weck 12.

## · Relapse of IA

No participant in the responder population had a relapse of IA through 28 days post-treatment. One participant died at 11 days post-treatment due to leukemic infiltration extramedullary so relapse of IA through 28 days post-treatment was not assessed.

## Pharmacokinetic Results:

The primary PK population included 28 (13 in Age Cohort 1 and 15 in Age Cohort 2) participants who had at least 1 postdose plasma concentration obtained after receiving at least 5 days of treatment with any  POS  formulation.  In  the  provided  report  descriptive  statistics  were  determined  for  POS  plasma concentrations at each time point for all participants stratified by age cohort and POS formulation.

Mean POS predose (trough) plasma concentrations were generally similar with values of approximately 1000-2000 ng/mL across the 3 formulations (IV, PFS, tablet) and between the 2 age cohorts as illustrated below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A population PK analysis will be conducted based on population PK models from prior paediatric PK data for each formulation. PK parameters for POS (Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, AUC, and Tmax) derived from the population PK analysis will be reported in a separate modelling and simulation report. An analysis of exposure-response (efficacy and safety) relationship, as available data allow, will be conducted as part of the population PK analysis, and will also be reported separately.

## Assessor's Comments:

Only sparse sampling was planned for the PK investigation. Therefore, the descriptive statistics derived from it could only sought as indicative and no reliable conclusions could be drawn from it. The applicant is  planning an integrative analysis of the available data through the development of a population-PK model. The aim is to allow elucidation of PKs of Posaconazole in paediatric patients and identify the covariates influencing it. This model, if developed successfully, will allow prediction of systemic exposure in  paediatric  patients.  Based  on  these  predictions,  the  Exposure-Response  relationship  will  be  also explored in order support the dosing scheme in infants.

The  planned  analysis  is  agreed.  It  is  expected  that  those  data  will  be  submitted  in  support  of  the forthcoming type II variation to extend the indication in children from 2 years of age.

## Palatability and Acceptability Results

Assessment of palatability and acceptability of the POS PFS formulation on the first and last days of the PFS treatment phase was reported for 10 participants. Most participants (90%) reported PFS as tasting ' very good, ' ' good, ' or ' neither good nor bad ' on the first and last days of PFS. None of the participants reported any problems taking the PFS dose.

## All-cause Mortality

The incidence of all-cause mortality in the APaT population was 12.9% through Day 42 and remained the same through the end of the study (Day 114). More participants died in Age Cohort 2 than Age Cohort 1.

## Assessor comments

In  P104,  open-label,  non-comparative study efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints and the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing.

The global clinical response analyses through Weeks 6 and 12 were performed on the FAS population consisting of all 31 enrolled participants who had possible, probable, or proven IA (based on modified 2020 EORTC/MSG definitions) as classified by the investigator, had ≥ 1 postallocation observation for the analysis endpoint after ≥ 1 dose of study intervention, and had baseline data for those analyses that require baseline data.

The majority (67.7%, 95% CI: 48.6, 83.3) of participants in the FAS population achieved a favorable global clinical response (success) through Week 6. A greater percentage of participants achieved a favorable global clinical response through Week 12 (77.4%, 95% CI: 58.9, 90.4) compared with Week 6. The percentage of participants who achieved complete response increased from 29.0% through Week 6 to 48.4% through Week 12.

Among participants with possible IA (n=22):

- The percentage of participants with a favorable global clinical response through both time periods (Week 6 and Week 12) was 68.2% (n=15),
- The percentage of participants with an unfavorable global clinical response through both time periods was 22.7% (n=5),
- The percentage of participants with an unfavorable global clinical response through Week 6 but a favorable global clinical response through Week 12 was 4.5% (n=1), and
- The percentage of participants with missing data through Week 6 and a favourable global clinical response through Week 12 was 4.5% (n=1).

Among participants with probable IA (n=7):

- The percentage of participants with a favorable global clinical response through both time periods was 71.4% (n=5), and
- The percentage of participants with an unfavorable global clinical response through both time periods was 28.6% (n=2).

Among participants with proven IA (n=2):

- One participant  (50%)  had  an  unfavorable  global  clinical  response  through  Week  6  but  a favorable global clinical response through Week 12, and
- The other participant (50%) had a favorable global clinical response through both time periods.

No participant in the responder population had a relapse of IA through 28 days post-treatment

Assessment of palatability and acceptability of the POS PFS formulation on the first and last days of the PFS treatment phase was reported for 10 participants. Most participants (90%) reported PFS as tasting ' very good ' , ' good ' , or ' neither good nor bad ' on the first and last days of PFS. None of the participants reported any problems taking the PFS dose.

The incidence of all-cause mortality in the APaT population was 12.9% through Day 42 and remained the same through the end of the study (Day 114). More participants died in Age Cohort 2 than Age Cohort 1.

Overall,  these  results  are  consistent  with  the  efficacy  results  observed  in  the  previous  studies performed. However, no formal conclusion on efficacy in this population can be made since the study was not designed for that (open-label, non-comparative study with safety as primary endpoint and a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

limited  sample  size).  In  any  case  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  efficacy/safety  in  children  is  to  be predicted based on similar PK exposure in adults.

## Safety results

In P104, the evaluation of safety of POS (IV and oral formulations overall) was the primary objective of the study and drug-related AEs were the primary endpoint.

Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population, which included all 31 enrolled participants who received ≥1 dose of study intervention, regardless of their IA classification. All AEs were reported from the time of intervention allocation through 14 days following cessation of treatment. Survival assessment was reported through Day 114.

## Brief Summary of AEs

As anticipated for this severely ill population with IA, AEs were reported for most of the participants (87.1%) in the APaT population. Overall, 22.6% of participants had AEs that were considered drugrelated by the investigator.

SAEs were reported for 38.7% of participants; none of the SAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. Four participants (12.9%) had AEs resulting in death during the study; none of the deaths were considered drug-related by the investigator.

Two (6.5%) participants discontinued study intervention due to an AE: 1 in Age Cohort 1 with a fatal outcome (leukemic infiltration extramedullary) and 1 in Age Cohort 2, which was an ECI and resolved (liver function test increased).

## Most Frequently Reported AEs

The 4 most frequently reported AEs were vomiting (32.3%), pyrexia (29.0%), hypertension (25.8%), and abdominal pain (19.4%).

Among 8 (25.8%) participants with an AE of hypertension, none were considered drug related by the investigator, study intervention was continued without interruption, and all events resolved. Three of the 8 participants also had AEs of hypokalemia co-reported with hypertension during the treatment period. Hypokalemia was reported after hypertension for 1 participant (5 days later), and before hypertension for 2 participants (4 days prior and 12 days prior, respectively). No cases of hypokalemia were considered drug-related by the investigator, and study intervention was continued without interruption during these events. All events were considered non-serious; hypokalemia was resolved for 2 of the 3 participants while still on study intervention, but not resolved for 1 participant.

The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (6.5%) were ALT increased and AST increased, both in 2 participants in Age Cohort 2. All drug-related AEs were Grades 1 or 2 in severity and resolved.

The 2 most frequently reported SAEs (6.5%) were febrile neutropenia and sepsis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Confounding factors were noted among all 3 participants, all of whom were hospitalized with complicated oncologic histories.

## Toxicity Grade of Adverse Events

Overall, approximately one-third of participants had AEs with maximum Grades 1 or 2 severity.

Approximately one-third of participants had maximum Grade 3 AEs. The most frequently reported (&gt;2 participants in both age cohorts combined) Grade 3 AEs was febrile neutropenia.

Two (6.5%) participants had maximum Grade 4 AEs. One participant in Age Cohort 1 had gastroenteritis clostridial that was not considered drug-related by the investigator and resolved; another participant in Age Cohort 2 had pneumonia, adenovirus infection, and viral sepsis that were not considered drugrelated by the investigator and resolved.

Four (12.9%) participants had maximum Grade 5 (death) AEs.

## Serious Adverse Events

## Deaths Due to Adverse Events

Deaths due to AEs were reported for 4 (12.9%) participants during the study. There was 1 death in Age Cohort 1 due to leukemic infiltration extramedullary and 3 deaths in Age Cohort 2 due to pulmonary hemorrhage, hematemesis, and thrombocytopenia. None of the deaths were considered drug-related by the investigator.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

Overall, SAEs were reported for 12 (38.7%) participants. The 2 most frequently reported SAEs (6.5%) were febrile neutropenia and sepsis. No SAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. One participant  in  Age  Cohort  1  discontinued  study  intervention  due  to  an  SAE  (leukemic  infiltration extramedullary) with a fatal outcome.

## Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events

Two participants discontinued study intervention due to an AE: 1 in Age Cohort 1 with a fatal outcome (leukemic infiltration extramedullary) and 1 in Age Cohort 2 with an ECI that resolved (liver function test increased).

## AEs of Special Interest

A  drug-related  AE  meeting  the  criteria  for  an  ECI  (liver  function  test  increased)  was  reported  for  1 participant in Age Cohort 2. This participant discontinued study intervention due to the event. The event was considered drug-related by the investigator and resolved; the participant completed the study.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

No clinically meaningful changes were observed in any laboratory parameters from baseline over time for both age cohorts. For the majority of participants, there were no clinically meaningful findings in laboratory values (hematology and chemistry) that met predefined limits of change criteria based on Common Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  version  5.0.  Hepatic  laboratory  findings  that  met predetermined  criteria  showed  that  the  majority  of  participants  in  both  age  cohorts  combined  had elevations in ALT or AST (67.8%), while a smaller percentage of participants had elevations in bilirubin (16.1%) and alkaline phosphatase (12.9%).

## Vital Signs and Other Observations Related to Safety

No  clinically  meaningful  changes  were  observed  in  mean  changes  in  vital  sign  measurements  (ie, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate) from baseline over time for both age cohorts. Overall, 2 participants (1 in eac h age cohort) had QTc value ≥500 msec during the treatment phase. The prolonged QTc values in both participants resolved. Both participants remained on

study intervention without interruption and completed the study. Confounding factors were noted among both participants.

## Safety Results Summary

In pediatric participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years with IA who received POS:

## Overall AEs

- AEs were reported for most of the participants in the APaT population (85.7% in Age Cohort 1 and 88.2% in Age Cohort 2).
- The 4 most frequently reported AEs were vomiting (32.3%), pyrexia (29.0%), hypertension (25.8%), and abdominal pain (19.4%).
- AEs considered drug-related by the investigator were reported for 7 participants (2 in Age Cohort 1 and 5 in Age Cohort 2). All drug-related AEs were Grades 1 or 2 in severity and resolved.

## SAEs and Other Clinically Meaningful AEs

- Deaths due to AEs were reported for 4 (12.9%) participants during the study. None of the deaths were considered drug-related by the investigator.
- SAEs were reported for 12 (38.7%) participants. The 2 most frequently reported SAEs (6.5%) were febrile neutropenia and sepsis. No SAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator.
- Two participants discontinued study intervention due to an AE.
- -One participant in Age Cohort 1 due to an SAE (leukemic infiltration extramedullary) with a fatal outcome.
- -One participant in Age Cohort 2 due to an AE (liver function test increased), which was considered drug-related by the investigator and met criteria for an ECI. The event resolved and the participant completed the study.
- Overall, 2 participants (1 in each age cohort) had a QTc value ≥500 msec during the treatment phase. The prolonged QTc values in both participants resolved. Both participants remained on study intervention without interruption and completed the study.

Safety data from P104 demonstrate that POS is generally well tolerated in pediatric participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years with IA. No new safety concerns were identified in pediatric participants from P104.

## Assessor comments

In P104, the evaluation of safety of POS (IV and oral formulations overall) was the primary objective of the study and drug-related AEs were the primary endpoint.

Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population, which included all 31 enrolled participants who received ≥1 dose of study intervention

The 4 most frequently reported AEs were vomiting (32.3%), pyrexia (29.0%), hypertension (25.8%), and abdominal pain (19.4%).

AEs considered drug-related by the investigator were reported for 7 participants (2 in Age Cohort 1 and 5 in Age Cohort 2). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (6.5%) were ALT increased and AST increased, both reported for 2 participants in Age Cohort 2. A drug-related AE meeting the criteria for an ECI (liver function test increased) was reported for 1 participant in Age Cohort.

All drug-related AEs were Grades 1 or 2 in severity and resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Deaths due to AEs were reported for 4 (12.9%) participants during the study. There was 1 death in Age  Cohort  1  due  to  leukemic  infiltration  extramedullary  and  3  deaths  in  Age  Cohort  2  due  to pulmonary hemorrhage, hematemesis, and thrombocytopenia. None of the deaths were considered drug-related by the investigator.

SAEs were reported for 12 (38.7%) participants. The 2 most frequently reported SAEs (6.5%) were febrile neutropenia and sepsis. No SAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator.

Overall, 2 participants (1 in each age cohort) had a QTc value ≥500 msec during the treatment phase. The  prolonged  QTc  values  in  both  participants  resolved.  Both  participants  remained  on  study intervention without interruption and completed the study. Safety data from P104 demonstrate that POS is generally well tolerated in pediatric participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years with IA. No new safety concerns were identified in pediatric participants from P104.

The safety profile of POS in this study was consistent with the participants' underlying disease and treatment, and the known safety profile of the drug.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Overall, the clinical response rates results are consistent with those observed in the previous studies performed. However, based on this study results alone, no formal conclusion on efficacy in this paediatric population can be made since the study was not designed for this (open-label and noncomparative study with safety as primary endpoint and a limited number of subjects enrolled). In any case it is acknowledged that the efficacy/safety in children is to be predicted based on similar PK exposure in adults.

POS was generally well tolerated in pediatric participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years with IA as both IV and oral (PFS or tablet) formulations. No new safety signals were identified during the study.

In this study, POS was shown to be well tolerated and associated with high clinical response rates in pediatric participants aged 2 to &lt;18 years with IA.

The safety  profile  of  POS  in  this  study  was  consistent  with  the  participants ' underlying  disease  and treatment, and the known safety profile of the drug. The AE rates reported in this study compared favorably with POS and VOR in the adult pivotal Phase 3 study MK-5592- 069, which showed the non inferiority of POS to VOR in adult participants with IA. Rates of SAEs, AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention in this study were comparable with MK-5592-069.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Based on the data provided by the MAH regarding the final results of P104MK5592 study, no new safety or efficacy concerns have been identified as compared to previous studies and experiences in adults and children from 2 years of age treated with POS.

No change to the Product Information (PI) for Noxafil based on this paediatric study is claimed by the MAH however the MAH is reviewing the results and intends to submit a type II variation in Q1 2025, consisting of the full relevant data package with amendments, to extend the indication to paediatric patients 2 years and older for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
