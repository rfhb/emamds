## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Spinraza 12 mg solution for injection

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each 5 ml vial contains nusinersen sodium equivalent to 12 mg nusinersen. Each ml contains 2.4 mg of nusinersen.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection.

Clear and colourless solution with pH of approximately 7.2.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Spinraza should only be initiated by a physician with experience in the management of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The decision to treat should be based on an individualised expert evaluation of the expected benefits of treatment for that individual, balanced against the potential risk of treatment with Spinraza. Patients with profound hypotonia and respiratory failure at birth, where Spinraza has not been studied, may not experience a clinically meaningful benefit due to severe survival motor neuron (SMN) protein deficiency.

## Posology

The recommended dosage is 12 mg (5 ml) per administration. Spinraza treatment should be initiated as early as possible after diagnosis with 4 loading doses on Days 0, 14, 28 and 63. A maintenance dose should be administered once every 4 months thereafter.

## Duration of treatment

Information on long term efficacy of this medicinal product is not available. The need for continuation of therapy should be reviewed regularly and considered on an individual basis depending on the patient's clinical presentation and response to the therapy.

## Missed or delayed doses

If a loading or a maintenance dose is delayed or missed, Spinraza should be administered according to the schedule in Table 1 below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1: Recommendations for delayed or missed dose

| Delayed or missed dose   | Timing of Dosing Administration   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Loading dose             | Loading dose                      |

- Administer the delayed or missed loading dose as soon as possible with at least 14 days between doses; continue with subsequent doses on the prescribed intervals from the last dose.

e.g. if the third loading dose is administered 30 days late at Day 58 (instead of the original schedule at Day 28), then the fourth loading dose should be administered 35 days later at Day 93 (instead of the original schedule at Day 63) with a maintenance dose 4 months thereafter.

| Maintenance dose                   | Timing of Dosing Administration                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| > 4 to < 8 months from last dose   | • Administer the delayed maintenance dose as soon as possible; then • The next maintenance dose per the original scheduled date, as long as these two doses are administered at least 14 days apart * ; |
| ≥ 8 to < 16 months from last dose  | • Administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then the next dose 14 days later * ;                                                                                                               |
| ≥ 16 to < 40 months from last dose | • Administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then the next dose 14 days later, followed by a third dose 14 days later * ;                                                                       |
| ≥ 40 months from last dose         | • Administer the entire loading regimen on the prescribed intervals (Days 0, 14, 28 and 63) * ;                                                                                                         |

- *then subsequently to the above recommendations, a maintenance dose 4 months after the last dose should be administered and repeated every 4 months.

## Special populations

## Renal impairment

Nusinersen has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The safety and efficacy in patients with renal impairment has not been established and they should be closely observed.

## Hepatic impairment

Nusinersen has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Nusinersen is not metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, therefore dose adjustment is unlikely to be required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).

## Method of administration

Spinraza is for intrathecal use by lumbar puncture.

Treatment should be administered by health care professionals experienced in performing lumbar punctures.

Spinraza is administered as an intrathecal bolus injection over 1 to 3 minutes, using a spinal anaesthesia needle. The injection must not be administered in areas of the skin where there are signs of infection or inflammation. It is recommended that the volume of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), equivalent to the volume of Spinraza to be injected, is removed prior to administration of Spinraza.

Sedation may be required to administer Spinraza, as indicated by the clinical condition of the patient. Ultrasound (or other imaging techniques) may be considered to guide intrathecal administration of Spinraza, particularly in younger patients and in patients with scoliosis; see instructions for use in section 6.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Lumbar puncture procedure

There is a risk of adverse reactions occurring as part of the lumbar puncture procedure (e.g. arachnoiditis, headache, back pain, vomiting; see section 4.8). Potential difficulties with this route of administration may be seen in very young patients and those with scoliosis. The use of ultrasound or other imaging techniques to assist with intrathecal administration of Spinraza, can be considered at the physician's discretion. Should arachnoiditis be suspected, an MRI should be performed to confirm arachnoiditis and the extent of the inflammation. Identification of arachnoiditis precludes the use of the injection site until local inflammation has been ruled out.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities

Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have been observed after administration of other subcutaneously or intravenously administered antisense oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, platelet and coagulation laboratory testing is recommended prior to administration of Spinraza.

## Renal toxicity

Renal toxicity has been observed after administration of other subcutaneously and intravenously administered antisense oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, urine protein testing (preferably using a first morning urine specimen) is recommended. For persistent elevated urinary protein, further evaluation should be considered.

## Hydrocephalus

There have been reports of communicating hydrocephalus not related to meningitis or bleeding in patients treated with nusinersen in the post-marketing setting. Some patients were implanted with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. In patients with decreased consciousness, an evaluation for hydrocephalus should be considered. The benefits-and risks of nusinersen treatment in patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt are unknown at present and the maintenance of treatment needs to be carefully considered.

## Excipients

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Potassium

This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 5 ml vial, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed. In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP450 mediated metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that the likelihood for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interactions with nusinersen due to competition for plasma protein binding, or competition with or inhibition of transporters is low.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of nusinersen in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of nusinersen during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether nusinersen/metabolites are excreted in human milk.

A risk to the newborn/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from nusinersen therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

In toxicity studies in animals no effects on male or female fertility were observed (see section 5.3). There are no data available on the potential effects on fertility in humans.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Nusinersen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most common adverse reactions (ADRs) associated with the administration of Spinraza by lumbar puncture were headache, vomiting and back pain.

The safety of Spinraza was assessed in clinical trials based on two Phase 3 clinical studies in infants (CS3B) and children (CS4) with SMA, together with one Phase 2 study in infants and children with SMA (CS7) and open-label studies including presymptomatic infants (CS5) genetically diagnosed with SMA and infants and children with SMA. Study CS11 enrolled infantile and later-onset patients including those who had completed studies CS3B, CS4 and CS12. Of the 352 patients who received Spinraza up to a maximum of 10.8 years, 256  patients received treatment for at least 5 years.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety assessment of Spinraza is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from postmarketing surveillance. The ADRs associated with Spinraza administration are summarised in Table 2.

The assessment of undesirable effects is based on the following frequency data: Very common (≥ 1/10) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* Adverse reactions considered related to the lumbar puncture procedure. These reactions can be considered manifestations of post-lumbar puncture syndrome. These adverse reactions were reported in CS4 (later onset SMA) with an incidence at least 5% higher in patients treated with Spinraza (n=84) compared to Sham control.

** e.g. angiodema, urticaria and rash.

Events of communicating hydrocephalus have been observed in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.4).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Adverse reactions associated with the administration of Spinraza by lumbar puncture have been observed. The majority of these are reported within 72 hours of the procedure. The incidence and severity of these events were consistent with events expected to occur with lumbar puncture. No serious complications of lumbar puncture, such as serious infections, have been observed in the clinical trials of Spinraza.

Some adverse reactions commonly associated with lumbar puncture (e.g. headache and back pain) could not be assessed in the infant population exposed to Spinraza due to the limited communication appropriate for that age group.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose associated with adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies.

In the event of an overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including consulting with a healthcare professional and close observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: M09AX07

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) which increases the proportion of exon 7 inclusion in survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts by binding to an intronic splice silencing site (ISS-N1) found in intron 7 of the SMN2 pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA). By binding, the ASO displaces splicing factors, which normally suppress splicing. Displacement of these factors leads to retention of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and hence when SMN2 mRNA is produced, it can be translated into the functional full length SMN protein.

SMA is a progressive neuromuscular disease resulting from mutations in chromosome 5q in the SMN1 gene. A second gene SMN2, located near SMN1, is responsible for a small amount of SMN protein production. SMA is a clinical spectrum of disease with disease severity linked to fewer numbers of SMN2 gene copies and younger age of symptom onset.

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenic response to nusinersen was evaluated in 342 patients with post-baseline plasma samples for ADAs. Overall, 36 Spinraza-treated patients (11%) developed treatment-emergent ADAs, of which 14 (4%) were transient and 22 (6%) were persistent. No discernible effects of ADAs on efficacy or safety have been observed as measured by incidence of AEs including hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, and angio-oedema.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Symptomatic patients

## Infantile onset

Study CS3B (ENDEAR) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study conducted in 121 symptomatic infants ≤ 7 months of age, diagnosed with SMA (symptom onset before 6 months of age). CS3B was designed to assess the effect of Spinraza on motor function and survival. Patients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (as per the approved dosing regimen) or sham-control, with a length of treatment ranging from 6 to 442 days.

The median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of SMA was 6.5 weeks and 8 weeks for Spinraza treated versus sham-control patients respectively, with 99% of patients having 2 copies of the SMN2 gene and therefore deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age when patients received their first dose was 164.5 days for treated patients, and 205 days for sham-control. Baseline disease characteristics were largely similar in the Spinraza treated patients and sham-control patients except that Spinraza treated patients at baseline had a higher percentage compared to sham-control patients of paradoxical breathing (89% vs 66%), pneumonia or respiratory symptoms (35% vs 22%), swallowing or feeding difficulties (51% vs 29%) and requirement for respiratory support (26% vs 15%).

At the final analysis, a statistically significant greater percentage of patients achieved the definition of a motor milestone responder in the Spinraza group (51%) compared to the sham-control group (0%) (p&lt; 0.0001). Time to death or permanent ventilation (≥ 16 hours ventilation/day continuously for &gt; 21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or tracheostomy) was assessed as the primary endpoint. Statistically significant effects on event-free survival, overall survival, the proportion of patients achieving the definition of a motor milestone responder, and the percentage of patients with at least a 4-point improvement from baseline in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP INTEND) score were observed in patients in the Spinraza group compared to those in the sham-control group (Table 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the efficacy set, 18 patients (25%) in the Spinraza group and 12 patients (32%) in the sham-control group required permanent ventilation. Of these patients, 6 (33%) in the Spinraza group and 0 (0%) in the sham-control group met the protocol-defined criteria for a motor-milestone responder.

To allow for long term follow up of these patients, at the end of Study CS3B, 89 patients (Spinraza: n=65; sham-control: n=24) enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE). Study CS11 is an open-label extension study for SMA patients who previously participated in the other Spinraza clinical studies. In patients randomised to Spinraza in Study CS3B and including the extension of treatment with Spinraza in Study CS11, patients received the medication for 6 to 3043 days (median 2443 days). In patients randomised to sham in Study CS3B and initiating Spinraza in Study CS11, patients received the medication for 65 to 2520 days (median 2090 days).

Improvements in motor function were observed among patients continuing Spinraza from Study CS3B, as well as those who initiated Spinraza in Study CS11 (Figure 3), with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment initiation. The majority of patients were alive at their last visit after initiating treatment with Spinraza in either Study CS3B or Study CS11.

Patients initiating Spinraza in Study CS3B were of median age 5.5 months (range 1.7 to 14.9 months). From Spinraza initiation and including extension of treatment in Study CS11, the median time to death or permanent ventilation was 1.4 years. At the end of Study CS11, 60 out of 81 patients (74%) were alive and 41 out of 81 patients (51%) were alive and had not met the Study CS11 definition of permanent ventilation. Mean HINE-2 total motor milestonescore increased by 5.3 (SD 4.6; n=52) and CHOP INTEND score increased by 18.4 (SD 14.7; n=38) points from initiation of Spinraza to follow up visit day 394 and 2198 respectively.

Patients randomised to sham in Study CS3B and initiating Spinraza in Study CS11 were of a median age of 17.8 months (range 10.1 to 23.0 months). Prior to Spinraza initiation 12 out of 24 patients (50%) had met the Study CS11 definition of permanent ventilation. The median time to death or permanent ventilation was 2.76 years after initiation of Spinraza in Study CS11. At the end of Study CS11, 19 out of 24 patients (79%) were alive and 6 out of 12 patients (50%) were alive without permanent ventilation. Improvement in mean total motor milestone score of 1.4 (SD 1.8; n=12) and CHOP INTEND score of 11.5 (SD 12.2, n=10) scores were observed from Study CS11 baseline to follow up visit day 394 or 2198 respectively.

These results are supported by an open-label Phase 2 study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with SMA (CS3A). Median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms was 56 days and patients had either 2 SMN2 gene copies (n=17) or 3 SMN2 gene copies (n=2) (SMN2 gene copy number unknown for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 patient). Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age at first dose was 162 days.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved in one or more categories in motor milestones (according to HINE section 2: ≥2 point increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick or voluntary grasp or ≥1 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing or walking). Twelve out of 20 patients (60%) in the study met the primary endpoint with improvement in mean motor milestone achievement over time. An improvement in mean CHOP INTEND score over time was observed from baseline to day 1072 (mean change 21.30). Overall, 11 out of 20 patients (55%) met the endpoint of an increase in total CHOP INTEND score of ≥4 points as of the last study visit. Of the 20 subjects enrolled, 11 (55%) were alive and free of permanent ventilation at the last visit. Four patients met the criteria for permanent ventilation and five patients died during the study.

## Later onset

Study CS4 (CHERISH) was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study conducted in 126 symptomatic patients with later-onset SMA (symptom onset after 6 months of age). Patients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (dosed with 3 loading doses and maintenance doses every 6 months) or sham-control, with a length of treatment ranging from 324 to 482 days. The median age at screening was 3 years, and the median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of SMA was 11 months. The majority of patients (88%) have 3 copies of the SMN2 gene (8% have 2 copies, 2% have 4 copies, and 2% have an unknown copy number). At baseline, patients had a mean Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score of 21.6, a mean revised upper limb module (RULM) of 19.1, all had achieved independent sitting, and no patients had achieved independent walking. Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type II or III SMA. Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar with the exception of an imbalance in the proportion of patients who had ever achieved the ability to stand without support (13% of patients in the Spinraza group and 29% in sham-control) or walk with support (24% of patients in the Spinraza group and 33% in sham-control).

At the final analysis, a statistically significant improvement in HFMSE score from baseline to Month 15 was seen in the Spinraza group compared to the sham-control group (Table 4 , Figure 2). The analysis was conducted in the ITT population (Spinraza: n=84; sham-control: n=42), and post-baseline HFMSE data for patients without a Month 15 visit were imputed using the multiple imputation method. An analysis of the subset of patients in the ITT population who had observed values at Month 15 demonstrated consistent, statistically significant results. Of those with observed values at Month 15, a higher proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had improvement (73% vs 41%, respectively) and a lower proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had worsening (23% vs 44%, respectively) in total HFMSE score compared to sham-control. Secondary endpoints including functional measures and WHO motor milestone achievement were formally statistically tested and are described in Table 4.

Initiation of treatment sooner after symptom onset resulted in earlier and greater improvement in motor function than those with delayed treatment initiation; however, both groups experienced benefit compared to sham control.

Upon completion of Study CS4 (CHERISH), 125 (83 Spinraza and 42 sham) patients enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE) where all patients received Spinraza. The majority of Spinraza treated patients experienced stabilization or improvement in motor function, with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment initiation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients initiating Spinraza in Study CS4 were of a median age 4.1 years (range 2.1 to 9.2 years). From Spinraza initiation and including extension of treatment in Study CS11, patients received the medication for a median time of 7.2 years (range 1.3 to 8.4 years). HFMSE mean score increased 1.3 (SD 9.4 n=54) and RULM mean score increased by 6.4 (SD 6.5 n=54) at follow up visit day 2070.

Patients randomised to sham in Study CS4, initiated treatment with Spinraza in Study CS11 at a median age of 4.9 years (range 3.3 to 9.0 years). From Spinraza initation in Study CS11, patients received the medication for a median time of 5.8 years (range 2.7 to 6.7 years). HFMSE mean score decreased by 1.3 (SD 9.3 n=22) and RULM, score increased by 4.2 (SD 4.4 n=23) points at follow up visit day 2070.

In contrast, the natural disease course of untreated patients of similar age and clinical characteristics shows a progressive loss of motor function over time, with an estimated mean decline in HFMSE of 6.6 points over a similar period of 5 years.

These results are supported by 2 open label studies (study CS2 and study CS12). The analysis included 28 patients who received their first dose in study CS2, and then transferred to the extension phase, study CS12. The studies enrolled patients who were between 2 to 15 years of age at first dose. Of the 28 patients, 3 were at least 18 years of age at their last study visit. 1 out of 28 patients had 2 SMN2 gene copies, 21 had 3 copies, and 6 had 4 copies.

Patients were assessed over a 3 year treatment period. A sustained improvement was seen in patients with Type II SMA who experienced a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 5.1 (SD 4.05, n=11) at Day 253, and 9.1(SD 6.61, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 26.4 (SD 11.91) at Day 253 and 31.3 (SD 13.02) at Day 1050, no plateau was observed. Patients with Type III SMA demonstrated a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 1.3 (SD 1.87, n=16) at Day 253 and 1.2 (SD 4.64, n=11) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 49.8 (SD 12.46) at Day 253 and 52.6 (SD 12.78) at 1050 days.

In patients with Type II SMA the Upper Limb Module test was conducted with mean improvement of 1.9 (SD 2.68, n=11) at Day 253 and 3.5 (SD 3.32, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was13.8 (SD 3.09) at Day 253 and 15.7 (SD 1.92) at Day 1050.

The 6MWT (six-minute walk test) was conducted for ambulatory patients only. In these patients, a mean improvement of 28.6 meters (SD 47.22, n=12) at Day 253 and 86.5 metres (SD 40.58, n=8) at Day 1050. The mean 6MWT distance was 278.5 meters (SD 206.46) at Day 253 and 333.6 metres (SD 176.47) at Day 1050. Two previously non-independent ambulatory patients (Type III) achieved independent walking, and one non-ambulatory patient (Type II) achieved independent walking.

An additional clinical study, CS7 (EMBRACE) was opened for patients not eligible for participation in Study CS3B or Study CS4 due to screening age or SMN2 copy number. CS7 is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with infantileonset SMA (≤6 months) or later -onset SMA (&gt;6 months) and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 (Part 1), followed by a long-term open-label extension phase (Part 2). In Part 1 of the study, patients were followed for a median of 302 days.

All patients who received Spinraza were alive as of the early termination of Part 1, however, one patient in the control arm died at Study Day 289. In addition, no patients in the Spinraza or shamcontrol group required the use of permanent ventilation. Of the 13 patients with infantile-onset SMA, 7 of out 9 patients (78%; 95%CI: 45, 94) in the Spinraza group and 0 out of 4 patients (0%; 95%CI: 0, 60) in the sham group met the criteria for motor milestone response (according to HINE section 2: ≥2 point increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick OR ≥1 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing or walking and improvement in more categories of motor milestones than worsening). Of the 8 patients with later-onset SMA, 4 out of 5 patients (80%; 95% CI: 38, 96) in the Spinraza group and 2 out of 3 (67%; 95% CI: 21, 94) in the sham-control group met this definition of response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adult

Real world clinical findings support the effectiveness of nusinersen to stabilize or improve motor function in some SMA adult Type II and III patients.

By month 14 of nusinersen treatment, the number of patients with a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline on HFMSE (≥ 3 points) was 53 out of 129 patients, the number of patients with clinically meaningful improvement on the RULM (≥ 2 points) was 28 out of 70 and among walkers 25 out of 49 for the 6MWT (≥ 30 meters).

The safety data in the adult population are consistent with the known safety profile of nusinersen and with co-morbidities associated with the underlying disease of SMA.

## Presymptomatic infants

Study CS5 (NURTURE) is an open-label study in presymptomatic infants genetically diagnosed with SMA, who were enrolled at 6 weeks of age or younger. Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type I or II SMA. Median age at first dose was 22 days.

An interim analysis was conducted when patients had been on study for a median of 48.3 months (36.6 to 57.1 months) and were of a median age at last visit of 46.0 months (34.0 to 57.1 months). At the interim analysis, all 25 patients (2 SMN2 gene copies, n=15; 3 SMN2 gene copies, n=10) were alive without permanent ventilation. The primary endpoint, time to death or respiratory intervention (defined as invasive or noninvasive ventilation for ≥6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 consecutive days or tracheostomy), could not be estimated as there were too few events. Four patients (2 SMN2 copies) required respiratory intervention &gt;6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 days, all of whom initiated ventilatory support during an acute reversible illness.

Patients achieved milestones unexpected in Type I or II SMA and more consistent with normal development. At the interim analysis, all 25 (100%) patients had achieved the WHO motor milestone of sitting without support, 23 (92%) patients were walking with assistance and 22 (88%) had achieved walking alone. Twentyone (84%) patients achieved the maximum attainable CHOP INTEND score of 64. All patients had the ability to suck and swallow at last visit (Day 788), with 22 (88%) infants achieving a maximal score on the HINE Section 1.

Patients developing clinically manifested SMA was assessed at Day 700 visit. The protocol-defined criteria for clinically manifested SMA included age-adjusted weight below the fifth WHO percentile, a decrease of 2 or more major weight growth curve percentiles, the placement of a percutaneous gastric tube, and/or the inability to achieve expected age-appropriate WHO milestones (sitting without support, standing with assistance, hands-and-knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone). At day 700, 7 out of 15 patients (47%) with 2 SMN2 gene copies and 0 out of 5 patients (0%) with 3 SMN2 copies, met the protocol-defined criteria of clinically manifested SMA, however, these patients were gaining weight and achieving WHO milestones, inconsistent with Type I SMA. A comparison of motor milestone achievement among the patients with symptomatic infantile-onset SMA and presymptomatic SMA is shown in Figure 3.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nusinersen, administered via intrathecal injection, were determined in paediatric patients diagnosed with SMA.

## Absorption

Intrathecal injection of nusinersen into the CSF allows nusinersen to be fully available for distribution from the CSF to the target central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The average increase in trough CSF levels from the start of the maintenance phase through to the last observation timepoint across all patients was approximately 3.2-fold and 2.3-fold in the later-onset and infantile-onset populations respectively. Overall, cumulative CSF PK data collected through to the end of CS11 indicated that in infantile and later onset SMA patients, the standard dosing regimen (12 mg every 4 months) leads to a steady state CSF concentration by 7 to 8 years of treatment. Following intrathecal administration trough plasma concentrations of nusinersen were relatively low compared to the trough CSF concentration. Median plasma Tmax values ranged from 1.7 to 6.0 hours. Mean plasma Cmax and AUC values increased approximately dose proportionally over the evaluated dose range. There is no accumulation in plasma exposure measures (Cmax and AUC) after multiple doses.

## Distribution

Autopsy data from patients (n=3) show that nusinersen administered intrathecally is broadly distributed within the CNS achieving therapeutic levels in the target spinal cord tissues. Presence of nusinersen was also demonstrated in neurons and other cell types in the spinal cord and brain, and peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney.

DATE:18MAR2024

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Nusinersen is metabolized slowly and predominantly via exonuclease (3'- and 5') -mediated hydrolysis and is not a substrate for, or inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzymes.

## Elimination

The mean terminal elimination half-life in CSF is estimated at 135 to 177 days. The primary route of elimination is expected via urinary excretion of nusinersen and its metabolites.

## Interactions

In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP450-mediated oxidative metabolism and therefore should not interfere with other medicinal products for these metabolic pathways. Nusinersen is not a substrate or inhibitor of human BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP transporters.

## Characteristics in specific patient populations

## Renal and hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of nusinersen in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. The effect of hepatic or renal insufficiency as covariates could not be thoroughly evaluated in the population PK model given the rarity of patients displaying clinically relevant liver or kidney insufficiencies. Population PK analyses revealed no apparent correlation between hepatic and renal clinical chemistry markers and inter-subject variability.

## Race

The majority of patients studied were Caucasian. The population PK analysis suggests that race is unlikely to affect the PK of nusinersen.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenity

Nusinersen demonstrated no evidence of genotoxicity. Nusinersen was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in mice at plasma exposure levels 104-fold higher than in patients receiving 12 mg of maintenance nusinersen.

## Reproductive toxicity

Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted using subcutaneous administration of nusinersen in mice and rabbits. No impact on male or female fertility, or embryo-foetal development, or pre/post-natal development was observed.

## Toxicology

In repeat-dose toxicity studies (14-weeks and 53-weeks) of intrathecal administration to juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, nusinersen was well tolerated. The exception was an acute, transient deficit in lower spinal reflexes which occurred at the highest dose levels in each study (3 or 4 mg per dose; equivalent to 30 or 40 mg per intrathecal dose in patients). These effects were observed within several hours post-dose and generally resolved within 48 hours.

In the 53-week intrathecal dosing study in cynomolgus monkeys no toxicity effects were seen at levels up to 14-fold the recommended annual clinical maintenance dose.

## 1. What Spinraza is and what it is used for

Spinraza contains the active substance nusinersen which belongs to a group of medicines known as antisense oligonucleotides . Spinraza is used to treat a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN) in the body. This results in the loss of nerve cells in the spine, leading to weakness of the muscles in the shoulders, hips, thighs and upper back. It may also weaken the muscles used for breathing and swallowing.

Spinraza works by helping the body to produce more of the SMN protein that people with SMA are lacking. This reduces the loss of nerve cells and so may improve muscle strength.

## 2. What you need to know before you or your child are given Spinraza

## Spinraza must not be given

- If you or your child are allergic to nusinersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Spinraza.

## Warnings and precautions

There is a risk of side effects occuring after Spinraza is given by a lumbar puncture procedure (see section 3). This can include headaches, vomiting and back pain. There may also be difficulties with giving a medicine by this method in very young patients and those with scoliosis (twisted and curved spine).

Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the cells in the blood which help clotting. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to do a blood test to check that your or your child's blood can clot properly. This may not be required every time you or your child are given Spinraza.

Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the kidneys. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide to do a urine test to check that your or your child's kidneys are working normally. This may not be required every time you or your child are given Spinraza.

There have been a small number of reports of patients developing hydrocephalus (a build-up of too much fluid around the brain) after Spinraza is given. Some of these patients had needed to have a device called a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implanted to treat the hydrocephalus. If you notice any symptoms of increase in head size, decreased consciousness, persistent nausea, vomiting or headache; or other symptoms that cause you concern, please inform your or your child's doctor to seek necessary treatment. The benefits and risks of continuing Spinraza whilst having a \"ventriculo-peritoneal shunt\" in place are not known at present.

Talk to your doctor before you or your child are given Spinraza.
