## 1. Introduction

On  27/01/2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  tofacitinib  for  treatment  of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

This submission is in fulfilment of the Article 46 requirement. Study A3921104 is a deferred study in the JIA  PIP  (Study  6)  with  a  completion  date  by  February  2020.  Study  A3921104  was  a  randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofacitinib  for  treatment  of  polyarticular  course  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  in  children  and adolescent subjects.

A consequential Type II variation to update the SmPC with the relevant results is planned for submission in June 2020.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Two formulations of tofacitinib have been used in study A3921104 to enable weight-based dosing and achieve comparable tofacitinib area under the curve (AUC) for all patients:

- Tofacitinib citrate IR film-coated 5 mg tablet
- Tofacitinib citrate 1 mg/mL oral solution

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## Study design

<!-- image -->

All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). At the end of the 18-week run-in phase, only subjects who achieved at least a JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response were randomized to the 26-week double-blind, placebocontrolled  phase.  Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  a  JIA  ACR  30  response  at  this  time  point  were discontinued from the study. Subjects who experienced a single episode of disease flare (according to Pediatric Rheumatology Clinical Study Group/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization [PRCSG/PRINTO] Disease Flare criteria) at any time during the study (including the open-label run-in and double-blind phase) were also discontinued from the study.

Subjects who were eligible for the 26-week double-blind phase were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo.

## Study population /Sample size

A total of 286 subjects enrolled in the study, 185 subjects completed the open-label run-in phase, with 173 subjects being randomized into the double-blind phase (88 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 85 subjects to placebo).

There were 12 subjects that were withdrawn upon completion of the initial treatment phase because they did not meet the criteria to be randomized into the double-blind phase (insufficient clinical response for 11 subjects and protocol deviation for 1 subject). Of these subjects, 10 were rolled over into Study A3921145 and 2 discontinued (1 subject was not eligible for Study A3921145 and 1 subject refused participation).

A total of 99 subjects completed the double-blind phase (61 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 38 in the placebo group). Of those subjects, 97 were rolled over into the A3921145 study and 2 were discontinued.  Since  flares  led  to  discontinuation  during  the  double-blind  phase,  insufficient  clinical response was the most common discontinuation reason for double-blind discontinuation in both arms, with a higher percentage in the placebo group.

## Treatments

Tofacitinib was provided as oral tablets (tofacitinib citrate 5 mg) and as an oral solution (CP-690,550-10 [tofacitinib citrate] 1 mg/mL) by the Sponsor. Open-label bottles of tofacitinib tablets and tofacitinib citrate oral solution were provided for the run-in phase of the study. Blinded-label bottles of tofacitinib tablets, tofacitinib citrate oral solution, and matching placebo, for oral administration, were provided for the double-blind phase of the study.

Randomization : For subjects with PJIA, randomization was stratified by JIA category and baseline CRP. For subjects with PsA and ERA, randomization was stratified by JIA category.

Dose The dose of tofacitinib in adolescents with body weight ≥ 40 kg was set to 5 mg BID. Oral solution (1 mg/mL) was used for subjects weighing &lt;40 kg. The tofacitinib doses for the younger JIA subjects were selected to match the predicted steady state concentrations in JIA subjects with body weight ≥ 40 kg after administration of a 5 mg BID dose.

responses, LOCF was used to impute the missing component(s) to derive these endpoints at the visits prior to study treatment discontinuation if any component was missing. The LOCF method was also used to impute the binary status of flare, JIA ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, 100 responses, JADAS minimum disease activity, JADAS inactive disease, and JIA ACR inactive disease at intermediate visits with missing values, preceding study treatment discontinuation. Flare, JIA ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, 100 responses, and other binary endpoints (JADAS minimum disease activity and inactive disease, JIA ACR inactive disease) were set  to  flare/non-responder/active  disease,  respectively,  for  observed  assessments  on  or  after  the treatment discontinuation. Visits without observed assessments after study treatment discontinuation were not imputed.

Analysis of the primary endpoint. Tofacitinib was to be considered superior to placebo in reducing flares if testing the difference between the proportion of subjects with flares by Week 44/end of study (Week 26 of the double-blind phase) would result in a two-sided p-value &lt;0.05. The difference between flare rates in the double-blind phase by Week 44 of the study for subjects with polyarticular course (polyarthritis RF+/RF-, E Oligo, and sJIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features) JIA was  tested  using  the  normal  approximation  approach  for  binomial  populations.  Subjects  who discontinued from the study treatment for any reason were considered as having a disease flare, except subjects  who  discontinued  after  maintaining  JIA  ACR  inactive  disease  for  at  least  24  weeks.  These discontinuations were considered as non-disease flare.

Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were carried out in support of the primary analysis of flare as follows:

- Using a general linear model with binary outcome (flare/no flare) as response, JIA category and open-label baseline CRP category as factors,
- Using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach with stratification factors of JIA category and open-label run-in baseline CRP category,
- Analysis where all discontinuations, including those of subjects in clinical remission (at least 24 weeks of inactive disease), were treated as flares,
- Per protocol analysis

Tipping point analyses using 2 model-based multiple imputation approaches (Weibull regression and binomial distribution) to assess the impact of drop-outs (for reasons other than flare) on the primary results.

All secondary endpoints that were collected in the double-blind withdrawal phase were analyzed by treatment group. For the binary endpoints, the normal approximation approach for the binary populations, as used for the primary analysis, was performed. For the continuous secondary endpoints, a mixed effect model was applied. Time to event analyses used Kaplan-Meier methodology and the logrank test.

Tipping point analyses were conducted for the type I error controlled secondary endpoints using model-based multiple imputation-binomial method for ACR 50, 30, 70 responses at Week 44 of the study and missing not at random (MNAR) multiple imputation for the change from baseline in the CHAQ disability index at Week 44 of the study.

For subjects with ERA and subjects with PsA, efficacy endpoints were assessed separately using summary and descriptive statistics by treatment group at each time point in the double-blind phase. The taste acceptability assessment questionnaire was included in the CRF, and summary statistics were provided for each category of the taste acceptability by treatment and by time point.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sample size Approximately 170 subjects (in the polyarticular course cohort) were to be enrolled in the open-label active treatment run-in phase to provide a power of approximately 90% or above to detect a difference in the rate of disease flares between tofacitinib versus placebo in the double-blind phase, assuming a 54% to 65% response rate of ACR Pedi 30 from the run-in active treatment phase, a 2-sided 5% Type I error, and a true difference of at least 31% in flare rates between tofacitinib and placebo, with a placebo flare rate of 57%. Sample sizes for the PJIA categories were determined from a combination of prevalence data and precedents in the literature.

## Biopharmaceutics

Two formulations of tofacitinib have been used in study A3921104 to enable weight-based dosing and achieve comparable tofacitinib area under the curve (AUC) for all patients:

- Tofacitinib citrate IR film-coated 5 mg tablet
- Tofacitinib citrate 1 mg/mL oral solution

The 5 mg tablet formulation has the same qualitative and quantitative composition as the commercial 5 mg tablet formulation and differed only with respect to debossing. Details of tofacitinib 5 mg tablet biopharmaceutics can be found in the Summary of Biopharmaceutic Studies (SBP) in the regulatory submission for RA patients. The clinical oral solution formulation is bridged to the tablet formulation used in the pJIA program using a relative bioavailability study in healthy adults (A3921354).

The composition of the oral solution and the tablet is listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The resulting  tofacitinib  plasma  concentration  from  both  formulations  will  be  analysed  by  population pharmacokinetic (PK) approach and reported separately.

## Clinical pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PK evaluations are as described in Appendix, to Protocol of clinical study A3921104 and 2 bioanalytical study reports for the determination of tofacitinib in human plasma were submitted one performed at PPD and one performed at Wuxi.

Since there were 2 analytical labs (PPD and Wuxi) used to conduct tofacitinib sample analysis for this study, the applicant stated that a cross validation was conducted to ensure assay equivalency between the 2 labs.

Plasma samples for PK analysis of tofacitinib were collected from all subjects enrolled in the study at various time points.

## Analytical methods

## PPD Project No. AKPG: THE DETERMINATION OF CP-690550 IN HUMAN PLASMA SAMPLES BY LC-MS/MS FROM PFIZER CLINICAL PROTOCOL A3921104.

A 50μL matrix aliquot is fortified with 50 μL of 10.0 ng/mL PF -04994438 internal standard working solution. Analytes are isolated through solid phase extraction using Phenomenex Strata-X-C (10 mg, 33 μm) 96 -well SPE plates and eluted with 400 μL of ethanol/ammonium hydroxide (87:13, v/v). The eluate is evaporated under a nitrogen stream at approximately 50 °C, and the remaining residue is reconstituted with 100 μL of methanol/water (50:50, v/v).

The final extract is analyzed via HPLC and MS/MS detection using positive ion electrospray. A linear, 1/concentration² weighted, least-squares regression algorithm is used to quantitate unknown samples. A summary of assay methodology is provided in the following table:

An Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) assessment was conducted for this study as per Pfizer WWPDM SOP No. 25. The incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 41 study samples, from 33 subjects. Samples were reanalyzed using the same analytical method and same dilution factors as used for the original reported results. The ISR assessment was conducted within freeze/thaw and LTS limits. Incurred sample repeats were considered acceptable if the original and re-assay values from two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of within ±20.0% for LC-MS/MS assays. Less than two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of within ±20.0% for LCMS/MS assays during the initial ISR assessment. A laboratory investigation to evaluate the data was initiated. The investigation resulted in reanalysis of sample runs 2AKPG, 4AKPG, and 5AKPG. After the investigation  and  reanalysis  of  runs  2AKPG,  4AKPG,  and  5AKPG,  the  results of  the  incurred  sample repeats met the ISR acceptance criteria. The original analytical results will be reported and used for pharmacokinetic assessments. Results of the ISR study will not be utilized as the reportable values of the samples used for PK analysis.

Incurred sample repeats were considered acceptable if the original and re-assay values from two-thirds of the repeated samples had a relative percent difference of within ± 20.0% for LC-MS/MS assays. The results of the incurred sample repeats met the ISR acceptance criteria. The original analytical results will

be reported and used for pharmacokinetic assessments. Results of the ISR study will not be utilized as the reportable values of the samples used for PK analysis.

## Pharmacokinetic Results

The result of the population PK analysis (a pooling analysis of data from study A3921104 and other previous studies)  will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA. Moreover, the Applicant stated  that,  a  Phase  1  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  of  tofacitinib  in  JIA  subjects  (A3921103)  was completed  in  2015,  and  an  open-label,  non-comparative,  long-term  extension  study  (A3921145)  is ongoing,  as part of this paediatric program. Subjects from Study A3921104 were eligible to enter Study A3921145 to continue treatment with tofacitinib 5 mg BID IR tablets or weight equivalent dose of oral solution.

## Taste Acceptability

Most subjects either liked  the  taste  'very  much'  (34  [40.00%]  subjects)  or  'a  little'  (32  [37.65%] subjects). There were few subjects who disliked the taste 'a little' (8 [9.41%] subjects) or 'very much' (4 [4.71%] subjects) (A3921104 Study Report Section 11.1.1.3.11).

The Open-Label Run-in phase is the study period before randomization day (Week 18).

If a subject does not meet randomization criteria and is discontinued, the study period will all be considered Open-Label Run-in phase.

n - Number of subjects on oral solution at Week 2, the corresponding percentage is based on Open Label Full Analysis Set (OLFAS).

The percentage for the taste assessment is based on the number of subjects on oral solution at Week 2 (n).

One subject (i.e., Subject 10081005) on oral solution, did not have taste assessment done at Week 2.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

All 225 subjects that were assigned to treatment were included in the OLFAS. All 225 subjects in the OLFAS were analyzed for AEs.

All 173 subjects that were treated in the double-blind phase were included in the DBFAS. A total of 142 (82.1%) subjects were included in the double-blind polyarticular course JIA analysis set (DBJAS). There were 127 (73.4%), 16 (9.2%), and 15 (8.7%) subjects in the double-blind per protocol (DBJPP), double-blind ERA (DBERA) and double-blind PsA (DBPsA) analysis sets, respectively. The proportion of subjects excluded from the DBJPP analysis set was similar in both treatment groups. All 173 subjects in the DBFAS were analyzed for safety.

n represents the number of subjects with a flare occurrence at any time from Day 1 to Day 196 of the Double-Blind phase. Once a subject flares or discontinues for any reason except while in clinical remission (24 weeks of inactive disease) the subject will be counted in the flare category at the discontinuationvisit

and at all the subsequent visits in the Double-Blind phase.

The DB phase is the study period on and after randomization day.

Europe includes: Poland, Belgium, Great Britain, and Spain; Ali Other includes: Ukraine, Turkey, Russia, Australia, and Israel.

LOCF was used for imputing intermitent missing components and assessments. Subjects discontinued study treatment for any reason, except while in clinical remission, were counted as flares as of their discontinuation visit through Week 44. For subjects who discontinued study treatment and met clinical remission at the time of discontinuation, they were considered as non-disease flare from that visit onward through Week 44.

95% CI was not calculated when the flare rates were either 0% in both groups or 100% in both groups.

Sensitivity analyses are consistent with results from the primary analysis.

The OL run-in phase is the study period before randomization day (Week 18). If a subject did not meet randomization criteria and was discontinued, the study period was considered the open-label run-in phase. LOCF was used for imputing intermittent missing components and assessments. Discontinuations for any reasons were treated as flares at the visit where they occurred. Figure presents n(%) of subjects with flares at each OL visit.

There were 13 (8.44%) subjects that experienced disease flare at Week 18.

The DB phase is the study period on and after randomization day. LOCF was used for imputing intermittent clinical remission, were counted as flares as of their discontinuation visit through Week 44. For subjects who discontinued study treatment and met clinical remission at the time of discontinuation, they were considered as non-disease flare from that visit onward through Week 44.

## Time to flare

The Kaplan-Meier median time to event estimate was 155 days for the placebo group and could not be estimated for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group because there were too few flare events and the probability of flare free was 70.8% (&gt;50%) in this group.

## JIA ACR 50, 30, 70, 90, and 100 Responses

ACR50: During the double-blind phase, a significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 50 response was first observed between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0034). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 50 response compared to the placebo group at each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0166).

ACR30: A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 30 response was first observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib

5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0108). Compared to the placebo group, significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 30 response at each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0031).

ACR70: A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 70 response was first observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 32 (p=0.0258). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 70 response compared to the placebo group at Weeks 36, 40, and 44 (p=0.0149, p=0.0149, and p=0.0387, respectively).

ACR90: significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 90 response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to the placebo group at Week 32 (p=0.0356) and Week 36 (p=0.0115). A numerically higher proportion of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 90 response compared to the placebo at Weeks 20, 24, 28,

40, and 44.

ACR100: There was a significantly higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group achieving a JIA ACR 100 response at the start of the double-blind phase (Week 18) compared to subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group. At each subsequent time point in the double-blind phase, a numerically higher proportion of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 100 response compared to the placebo.

## Change from Baseline in JADAS-27 CRP, JADAS-27 ESR, and Achieving JADAS Minimum Disease Activity, and Inactive Disease

## Open-Label

Mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 CRP score decreased from baseline to Week 18 (from -6.35 at Week 2 to -15.80 at Week 18).

A similar trend was observed for mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 ESR score (mean changes, 6.38 at Week 2 to -15.94 at Week 18).

The proportion of subjects with JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score increased from baseline at Week 2 and continued through Week 18 (4 [2.19%] to 68 [44.16%] subjects).

A similar trend was observed for JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 ESR score (7 [3.83%] at Week 2 to 72 [46.75%] subjects at Week 18).

Inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score was first achieved at Week 8 by 5 (2.84%) of the subjects and the proportion of subjects with inactive disease increased to 12 (7.79%) subjects at Week 18.

JADAS inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 ESR score was observed in 2 (1.09%) subjects at Week 2 and increased to 36 (23.38%) subjects at Week 18.

## Double-Blind Phase

-The LS mean change from the double-blind baseline in JADAS-27 CRP score was significantly lower from Week 20 (p-value=0.0088) through Week 44 (p- value=0.0027) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group.

-The LS mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 ESR score was also significantly lower in the (p=0.0018).

-A similar numerical trend was observed for JADAS inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS27 ESR score in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group.

## JIA ACR Inactive Disease at Each Scheduled Visit and Clinical Remission at Week 44 Open-Label

During the open-label run-in phase, there were 2 (1.09%) subjects with JIA ACR inactive disease at Week 4, which increased to 26 (16.88%) subjects at Week 18.

## Double-Blind Phase

-The proportion of subjects with JIA ACR inactive disease increased from Week 18 to Week 44 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and decreased in the placebo group during the double-blind phase. There were 3 (4.17%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 3 (4.29%) subjects in the placebo group with JIA ACR clinical remission (24 weeks of inactive disease, which may have begun during the open-label phase) by Week 44.

most severe occurrence is counted.

Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the subject experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity is summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Treatment (Trt) column gives study treatment at time of adverse event.

Includes data up to 28 days after last dose of study drug. Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.

MedDRA 22.0 coding dictionary applied.

SOCs with no PT &gt;=2% are excluded.

If the same subject in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most severe occurrence is counted.

Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the subject experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity is summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Treatment (Trt) column gives study treatment at time of adverse event.

Includes data up to 28 days after last dose of study drug. Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.

MedDRA 22.0 coding dictionary applied.

The Double-Blind phase is the study period on and after randomization day.

## SOCs with no PT &gt;=2% are excluded.

If the same subject in a given treatment had more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most severe occurrence is counted.

Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the subject experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity is summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Treatment (Trt) column gives study treatment at time of adverse event.

Includes data up to 28 days after last dose of study drug. Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.

MedDRA 22.0 coding dictionary applied.

The Open-Label Run-In phase is the study period before randomization day (Week 18). If a subject does not meet randomization criteria and is discontinued, the study period will be considered Open-Label Run-in phase.

N: Number of subjects in analysis set.

PD (subject-days): Sum of total follow-time for all subjects combined. Follow-up time is time from the first dose to the event or total exposure for subjects who did not have any event (to the earliest occurrence of date of: the last dose date +28 days or date of death).

n: Number of subjects with the event.

Placebo exposure may contribute a maximum of 28 days to the risk period.

Drug induced liver injury There were 3 events adjudicated as possible or probable drug induced liver injury during the open-label run-in phase; 2 were mild and 1 was moderate. None met Hy's Law criteria. One subject was on paracetamol with a concurrent viral illness, which was considered a possible cause. This subject was also taking MTX at the time of the event. The second subject was also on paracetamol, when elevated AST and ALT occurred. This was considered moderate with probable relation.

The third subject was not on paracetamol and had a finding consistent with mild hepatocellular effects that were deemed of probable relationship. All 3 events resolved. No drug induced liver injury events were adjudicated during the double-blind phase.

Opportunistic infections and special interest infections , there were 2 cases of herpes zoster adjudicated during the open-label run-in phase and none during the double-blind phase. Both events were in a single dermatome, did not meet the criteria for being considered an opportunistic infection, and resolved.

Four subjects had serious infections that occurred during the study. Three subjects during the openlabel run-in phase had serious infections: pneumonia, epidural empyema and sinusitis in a child with a history of craniosynostosis repair, and appendicitis. During the double-blind phase, there was 1 serious infectious event (appendicitis) in a subject being treated with placebo. One SAE/infection, pilonidal sinus repair, was coded to the SOC Surgical and medical procedures instead of Infections even though the subject was admitted to the hospital after surgery to treat a pilonidal cyst because of the infection, large incision site, and the need for wound vac placement. This event was inadvertently not captured in the programmed list of serious infection events. It was adjudicated as not meeting opportunistic infection criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no cases of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or arterial or venous thromboembolism .

There were 2 events in the open-label run-in phase and 1 event in the double-blind phase reviewed for GI perforation ; none were adjudicated as GI perforation.

NOTE: N = total number of subjects with at least one observation of the given laboratory test while on study treatment or during lag time.

Percentages are displayed for the laboratory tests having a category with greater or equal to1 evaluable subjects.

n= number of subjects with a laboratory abnormality meeting specified criteria while on study treatment or during lag time.

The Open-Label Run-in phase is the study period before randomization day (Week 18). If a subject does not meet randomization criteria and is discontinued, the study period will all be considered Open-Label Run-in phase.

Last observation is defined as the last observation while on study drug or during the lag of the treatment phase.

The Double-Blind phase is the study period on and after randomization day.

Baseline for Open-Label Run-in phase was Day 1.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetic Results

Tofacitinib plasma concentrations for individual patients are listed in Appendix to clinical report for study A3921104.

The  sparse  PK  sampling  design  precluded  non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  for  each  individual. Instead, the results this study will be pooled with other clinical studies to enable population PK analysis. The result of the population PK analysis will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tofacitinib for treatment of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

This submission is in fulfilment of the Article 46 requirement. Study A3921104 is a deferred study in the JIA PIP (Study 6) with a completion date by February 2020.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A consequential Type II variation to update the SmPC with the relevant results is planned for submission in June 2020.

Study design: Study A3921104 was a randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tofacitinib for treatment of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children and adolescent subjects. Superiority of tofacitinib versus placebo was analysed.

All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). At the end of the 18-week run-in phase, only subjects who achieved at least a JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response were randomized to the 26-week double-blind, placebocontrolled  phase.  Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  a  JIA  ACR  30  response  at  this  time  point  were discontinued  from  the  study.  Subjects  who  were  eligible  for  the  26-week  double-blind  phase  were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo.

Study  population: 185  subjects  completed  the  open-label  run-in  phase,  with  173  subjects  being randomized into the double-blind phase (88 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 85 subjects to placebo). A total of 99 subjects completed the double-blind phase (61 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 38 in the  placebo  group).  Of  those  subjects,  97  were  rolled  over  into  the  A3921145  study  and  2  were discontinued.  Since  flares  led  to  discontinuation  during  the  double-blind  phase,  insufficient  clinical response was the most common discontinuation reason for double-blind discontinuation in both arms, with a higher percentage in the placebo group.

Enrolled population reflects the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) JIA classification criteria. A minority of subjects were from EU countries 6 (2.7%). All age ranges were represented as follow: 12-18 y (61.8%), 6≤12 y (28.4%) and 2 -≤6 y(9.8%). Subjects had active JIA (mean number of joints with active arthritis (12.2 for OL) and number of joints with limitation of motion (mean 7.5 for OL).

Results: Overall efficacy results were supportive of tofacitinib superiority as compared to placebo for the treatment of JIA subjects. Detailed assessment will be made within the variation the MAH will submit.

Primary endpoint was the occurrence of disease flare from double-blind randomization through Week 44 (type I Error Controlled) of study being significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group (p-value=0.0031), with a difference of proportions (tofacitinib-placebo) of -23.69%, 95% CI (-39.41%, -7.97%).

Efficacy was supported also by key secondary endpoints: i) JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses (at Week 44, Type I Error Controlled), a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID achieved JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses compared to subjects treated with placebo (p=0.0166, p=0.0031, and p=0.0387, respectively); ii) Change From Double-Blind Baseline in CHAQ Disability Index at Week 44 (Type I Error Controlled) the improvement was statistically greater in subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID than those treated with placebo, with a LS mean difference in the scores of -0.12, p-value=0.0292.

Secondary endpoints results, although descriptive analysis was conducted, were generally supportive of better activity of tofacitinib as compared to placebo for different endpoints related to disease activity, however for endpoints more stringent the numerical difference was lower.

Safety: In the OL phase, treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 64 (28.4%) subjects during the open-label run-in phase. Most treatment-related TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the DB phase, treatment-related TEAEs were seen in 22 (25.0%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 33 (38.8%) subjects in the placebo group during the double-blind phase. Most treatmentrelated  TEAEs  reported  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  The  most  common  was  infections  and infestations occurring in 14.1% and 10.2% respectively in the OL and DB phase. Regarding severity in the OL phase only 1 case was classified as severe, in the DB phase no severe cases were reported in the tofacitinib arm and 1 case in the PLB arm.

Regarding AEs of special interest, considering the entire tofacitinib exposure period, there were 3 cases of serious infections, 2 cases of zoster, no opportunistic infections, malignancies, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or arterial or venous thromboembolism.

Overall the safety profile seems to not raise specific main safety concerns related to the paediatric age and  it  could  be  considered  generally  similar  to  that  of  the  already  approved  tofacitinib  indications. Detailed assessment of the data and potential SmPC changes will be done within the variation procedure the MAH will submit.

Pharmacokinetic: The sparse PK sampling design precluded non-compartmental analysis (NCA) for each  individual.  Instead,  the  results  this  study  will  be  pooled  with  other  clinical  studies  to  enable population PK analysis.

The result of the population PK analysis will be reported separately in the Type II variation for pJIA
