Extension of indication to include combination use with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Imbruvica based on data from the phase 3 study PCYC-1130-CA; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An updated RMP (version 12) is also submitted.

Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/984 on 26 April 2012. Imbruvica was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: \"Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\". The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan designation.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0398/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0398/2017 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ibrutinib is a potent small molecule BTK for oral use.

In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ibrutinib is presently approved for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL and as a single agent or combination therapy with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy.

The target indication, which is the subject of this Type II variation, is to extend the indications for ibrutinib in CLL, as follows:

- IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL.

## Background on the Target Indication and Current Treatments

Treatment guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicate the choice of treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL is based on stage of disease, whether a patient is considered 'fit' and presence or absence of del17p or mutated TP53 (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017).

The benefit of FCR is strongly correlated to the presence of high-risk features other than del 17p/TP53 mutation, with a reported 10-year PFS of ~55% and a plateau thereafter in subjects with mutated IGHV vs ~10% in subjects with unmutated IGHV ( MDACC group, 2016 ). The group of young fit patients with no TP53 aberration and mutated IGHV disease constitutes approximately one-third of the young fit patients and around 8-10% of all patients of all age groups requiring frontline therapy ( Jain, Hematology Am Soc Hematol Edu Program; 2018, p242 ). The Clb+CD20 antibody combination is not recommended in subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease

b  Used for first- and second-line treatment of CLL

Chemoimmunotherapies (chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents) are a mainstay of treatment for frontline CLL (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018). The most effective CIT regimen, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR), is however also associated with increased hematologic toxicities, and therefore its use is limited to younger, fitter patients without comorbidities (ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018; Hallek 2010; Keating 2005; Robak 2017). By contrast, of the recommended multi-agent CIT regimens, the alkylating-agent based regimens, bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) and chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (Clb+Ob), are recommended for broader groups of patients based on their improved safety profiles but are seemingly less efficacious than the FCR combination (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018).

When treated with CIT, patients with high-risk CLL characterized by del 17p, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV had shorter PFS and OS compared with those without these high-risk features (Thompson 2016; Byrd 2006). In CLL patients with high-risk genomic features (eg, del 17p or del 11q), mutated TP53, or unmutated IGHV, there are few frontline treatment options available (ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018), and the guidelines note it is important to fully explore the potential of ibrutinib-based therapy in these high-risk CLL patients. Phase 3 data from Study 1112 demonstrated a significant PFS and OS benefit in patients with previously treated CLL, including patients with del 17p CLL treated with ibrutinib (Byrd 2014). Data from Study 1112 ultimately led to the regulatory approval of ibrutinib in previously treated patients with CLL in the US, European Union, and globally (IMBRUVICA USPI, IMBRUVICA Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]) as well as the approval in the EU of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL in patients with del17 p/mutated TP53 who are not suited for CIT (IMBRUVICA ®  SmPC). Subsequently,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase 3 data from Study 1115 led to approvals in the US, EU, and globally in patients with previously untreated CLL (IMBRUVICA USPI, IMBRUVICA SmPC).

The recently updated 2018 iwCLL guidelines (Hallek 2018) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN 2018), emphasize the importance of obtaining prognostic information using molecular genetic testing with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify common high-risk genomic features such as del 11q and del 17p and sequencing to detect TP53 mutations and IGHV mutational status to inform treatment decisions in clinical practice. Progression-free survival and OS are similar in patients with CLL carrying del 17p and patients carrying a TP53 mutation in the absence of del 17p (Zenz 2010). The presence of adverse genomic features del 17p and del 11q, along with TP53 mutations and unmutated IGHV clones identified by DNA sequencing, typically confer unfavorable outcomes (eg, shorter PFS and OS) with conventional CIT regimens used in CLL including alkylating drugs or purine analogues (Thompson 2016; Fink 2013; Byrd 2006). However, when historically poor prognostic genomic factors were examined in ibrutinib-treated patients, these factors did not confer adverse prognosis for PFS (Kipps 2017). Assessment of CLL patients for del 17p, del 11q, mutated TP53, and IGHV mutational status has prognostic value and should be performed prior to treatment as well as guide therapeutic decisions in clinical practice (Hallek 2018; NCCN 2018). Providing patients who have these high-risk genomic features with effective therapy options remains an urgent, unmet need.

Ibrutinib has previously been used in combination with 2 anti-CD20 antibodies, ofatumumab and rituximab, in 2 Phase 1/2 CLL studies (Jaglowski 2014; Burger 2014; Burger 2017). Ibrutinib use in this setting was shown to be well tolerated and produced high rates of overall response (83% to 95%) with minimal treatment-related lymphocytosis, suggesting that an ibrutinib plus anti-CD20 antibody strategy was likely to be administered safely and potentially produce improved quality of responses in CLL.

Phase 3 data from the CLL11 trial has established the efficacy and safety of the anti-CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, in combination with chlorambucil in treatment-naive CLL (Goede 2014; Goede 2015). The addition of obinutuzumab to chlorambucil demonstrated significant improvement in efficacy over both single-agent chlorambucil and chlorambucil combined with rituximab. The addition of obinutuzumab to ibrutinib was expected to result in a further significant improvement in disease control, including in patients with high-risk CLL, due to the targeting of distinct mechanisms of action important in attenuating aberrant B-cell activity in frontline CLL. Treatment with ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab may provide an important treatment benefit for all patients with CLL and previously untreated patients with CLL with del 17p/ mutated TP53, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV - a patient population with poor prognosis for which fewer treatment options are available. A need exists for novel therapies in this hard-to-treat population, the importance of which was further underscored by the updated iwCLL guidelines (Hallek 2018). Obinutuzmab was therefore considered to be an appropriate agent with which to combine ibrutinib in Study 1130.

## Bioanalytical methods

The bioanalytical method (BTM-1792-R0) used for the measurement of ibrutinib and its metabolite PCI-452227 in study 1130 was previously assessed in application EMEA/H/C/3791/X/37. No changes were made to the method reported in previous submissions for ibrutinib. Samples were analysed by a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the determination of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 in heparinized human plasma. The method was validated for ibrutinib and PCI-45227 over the concentration range of 0.500 to 100 ng/mL. The plasma concentration of ibrutinib and the major metabolite, PCI-45227, were determined. An ISR evaluation for method BTM-1792-R0, using samples selected from study 1130, was conducted and met the acceptance criteria. Interference from co-medicine obinutuzumab on ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was evaluated. Results showed the mean concentrations for the test samples were within ± 15.0% of the Low QC nominal values and that there was no interference from the co-medicine on the ibrutinib and PCI-45227 samples.

## Sampling

Sparse PK samples were collected in all subjects randomized to receive ibrutinib. On Cycle 1, Day 15, samples were collected pre-dose, at 1 hour (window: 45-75 minutes), 2 hours (window: 1.5-2.5 hours) and 4 hours (window: 3.5-4.5 hours). On Cycle 2, Day 1 a pre-dose sample was collected.

## Pharmacokinetic analysis

A previously developed model ( Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Ibrutinib, EDMS-ERI-112451527: 1.0, 1 October 2015 , EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0020) was used in the analysis of the data from study PCYC-1130-CA. The previously developed model to describe ibrutinib was a 2-compartment PK model with sequential zero to first order absorption and first order elimination. It included an effect of meal on relative bioavailability and duration of zero order input, as well as an effect of the co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors and age on F1. The between subject variability and the residual variability was high (56.0 - 155% and 48.8 - 81.3% respectively). Between-subject variability was included on relative bioavailability (F1, instead of on oral clearance (CL/F)), apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F) and lag-time (ALAG1). Calculation of posthoc the PK parameters CL/F, V2/F, V3/F and Q/F need to account for the separate estimate of F1.

Pharmacokinetic parameters including the mean oral clearance (CL/F), distribution volume (Vss/F), and metrics of systemic exposure (e.g., the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC0-24h], plasma concentration at 24 hours after dosing [C24h] of ibrutinib) were estimated using a Bayesian feedback analysis based on a previously developed population PK model (The NONMEM maximum a posteriori approach using the First Order Conditional Estimation method (FOCE) and the feature MAXEVAL equal to 0 applied to the data of Study PCYC-1130-CA). Analyses of ibrutinib plasma concentration-time data were conducted using non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) software (v. 7.1).

The individual empirical Bayesian estimates (EBE) of PK parameters were used to obtain the individual model-derived estimates of the ibrutinib exposure. Exposure metrics, AUCtau and Ctrough were calculated by means of predictions i.e. predicting individual PK profiles at steady state over the dosing interval (24 hours) using individual EBE of PK parameters with the residual variability fixed to zero.

The model was fitted to the data using the log transform both sides approach and the first-order conditional estimation method.

## Pharmacokinetic analysis

The NONMEM maximum a posteriori approach using the First Order Conditional Estimation method (FOCE) and the feature MAXEVAL equal to 0 applied to the data of Study PCYC-1130-CA was successful. The model was able to describe the data well, as can be appreciated from the GOF and residual plots shown in Figure 1.

The distributions of the EBE of ETAs for the individual parameters had median near zero, consistent with the expectations. This indicated an absence of bias in the PK parameters obtained from these analyses. The shrinkage (η sh) was higher for ALAG1 (58%), Q (60%) as well as for V2 (44%) and V3 (63%). The Ibrutinib population pharmacokinetics are described with between-subject variability of bioavailability (F1) rather than on oral clearance (CL/F). This suggests that CL/F was well estimated (shrinkage on F1 of 18%), while some parameters tended more to regress toward the mean (e.g., ALAG1, Q, V2, V3), consistent with the sparse sampling approach used in this study.

When ibrutinib is administered in combination with obinutuzumab, the PK profile of ibrutinib is in alignment with historical data with ibrutinib for ibrutinib as monotherapy, and there was no evidence of effect of obinutuzumab on ibrutinib exposure. The mean CL/F and Vss/F were 1114 L/h and 9501 L, respectively. The goodness-of-fit plots, the graphical exploration of the empirical Bayesian estimates, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the visual predictive check plots indicated the absence of bias in the individual predictions. Figure 3 represents the ibrutinib concentration-time data overlaying model-based simulations derived from a previously developed PK model for ibrutinib. There was a substantial overlap of observed and predicted values based on the previous nonlinear mixed-effects model, thereby indicating that the PK behaviour observed in this study was consistent with previous assessments. In addition, the previously developed PK model for ibrutinib monotherapy allowed for description of the data obtained in subjects with CLL/SLL when treated with Ibr+Ob. Mean steady-state AUC0-24h and C24h or trough concentration (standard deviation [SD]) were 517 (268) ngxh/mL and 5.48 (3.74) ng/mL, respectively.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The MAH has conducted a clinical trial (study 1130) where subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms and received wither ibrutinib 420 mg/day plus intravenous obinutuzumab (Arm A) or chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg body weight plus intravenous obinutuzumab (Arm B), up to a total of 6 cycles for each treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Obinutuzumab concentrations were not determined and therefore no assessment can be made of the effect of ibrutinib on obinutuzumab. Mechanistically, an interaction between ibrutinib and obinutuzumab is not expected.

A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used to derive the individual exposure metrics (EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0020). The PPK model used in this analysis (based on 8697 observations from 1202 subjects) was generally similar to the model presented in the NDA with the exception that effects of body weight on V/F and of antacids on duration of zero order input (D1) were no longer included as they were considered not clinically significant. The conclusion was that the population pharmacokinetic model performed sufficiently well for its purpose.

The approach for deriving individual exposure is considered acceptable.

Sparse sampling was employed and a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used to derive the individual ibrutinib exposure. The applicant has presented goodness-of-fit plots, ETA-distributions and the shrinkage as well as a visual predictive check-plot. The shrinkage is high for all parameters but F1 (44-63%), indicating that the sparse sampling resulted in less informative data. The shrinkage on F1 is acceptable. The maximum concentration is somewhat under-predicted; however the model is considered to predict the data adequately.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical trial performed, and the method of analysing the data is considered acceptable. The pharmacokinetics profile is not considered to differ between this population and the previous populations.

Analysis of the primary and key efficacy endpoints (ie, PFS and ORR) was based on assessment by an IRC. Assessment of response and progression was conducted in accordance with the 2008 IWCLL criteria with recent clarifications (Hallek et al, 2013; Cheson et al, 2014; Hallek et al, 2012; Hallek et al, 2008).

The main disease evaluations included the following assessments:

- Physical examination with focus on the presence/absence of size increase/decrease in lymph nodes, liver, and spleen).
- Hematologic parameters by complete blood count performed at a central laboratory.
- Radiographic evaluation (CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis).
- Flow cytometric evaluation of MRD, which is defined as &lt; 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes; key time points in this evaluation are as follows:
- o A peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy with MRD at Cycle 9 and as appropriate if there was evidence of CR in the other response parameters.
- o Responders with MRD-negative status in the bone marrow were followed with peripheral blood MRD assessments every 4 cycles until Cycle 33 and then every 6 cycles starting at Cycle 39.
- o Responders with MRD-positive status in the bone marrow or peripheral blood were followed with peripheral blood MRD assessments every 4 cycles until Cycle 33 and then every 6 cycles starting Cycle 39. Upon MRD negativity in peripheral blood, this result was subsequently confirmed with a bone marrow MRD assessment.

If study treatment was held before a scheduled response assessment, the response assessment could be delayed up to 4 weeks to allow re-initiation of study treatment for 2 weeks (or as long as possible) prior to performing the scheduled response assessment. For the purposes of the study result analyses, efficacy assessments were performed by an IRC (whose members were blinded to each subject's study treatment assignment) and were independent of investigators and personnel who were involved in the conduct of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and was powered for this endpoint. The sample size for the study was calculated based on the following considerations:

- o Randomization ratio of 1:1.
- o Median PFS of 27 months for Arm B (chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab).
- o Target HR of 0.55, which corresponds to median PFS of 49.1 months for Arm A (ibrutinib combined with obinutuzumab).
- o Enrollment rate of 18 subjects per month.
- o A minimum of 94 PFS events provides at least an 80% power to detect the target HR of 0.55 based on a log-rank test and a 2-sided overall significance level of 0.05.

On this basis, 94 PFS events provide 80% power to achieve a statistical significance level of 5% (2-sided) under exponential distribution. With an estimated accrual rate of 18 subjects per month, approximately 212 eligible subjects were to be enrolled to observe 94 PFS events in approximately 36 months from the first subject randomized.

## Randomisation

Approximately 212 subjects were planned for randomization. Two randomization schemes were generated: 1 for each geographic region (North America vs. ROW). Under each scheme, randomization was stratified according to the following factors:

- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 vs. 2.
- Cytogenetics were to be stratified into 1 of 3 categories:
- o Del 17p.
- o Del 11q without del 17p.
- o Others (neither del 17p nor del 11q).

The randomization code was controlled through a centralized procedure. The primary efficacy evaluation was performed by an IRC that was blinded to study treatment information.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study; no blinding was performed.

## Statistical methods

The analysis of PFS will be performed in the ITT population to compare PFS (as assessed by the IRC) for the two treatment arms using a log-rank test. Distribution of PFS including median and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be summarized for each treatment arm using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The estimate of the hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% CI will be computed using a Cox proportional hazards model.

The following two randomization stratification factors will be used for the stratified analysis/test: ECOG performance status (0, 1 versus 2) and Cytogenetics (del 17p, del 11q without del 17p, others). To reflect the randomization process and maintain the integrity of randomization, all stratified tests will be based on randomization stratification factors as recorded in the IWRS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tests of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 based on a serial gatekeeping testing procedure in the following sequential hierarchical manner: PFS by IRC, PFS by IRC in the high-risk subpopulation, rate of sustained Hgb improvement, rate of MRD-negative response, ORR by IRC, OS, rate of IRRs, rate of sustained platelet improvement, and rate of clinically meaningful improvement of EQ-5D-5L utility score.

| High-risk population    | Randomized subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutation, or del 11q or unmutated IGHV at baseline per central laboratory results. |

The recently released IWCLL guidelines (Hallek et al, 2018) have placed new emphasis on the importance of testing for IGHV mutational status and are now recommending this testing in clinical practice. Given the guidelines from Hallek et al, 2018 on the importance of IGHV, an analysis for PFS was conducted in the high-risk population, which additionally includes subjects with unmutated IGHV (ie, del 17p/TP53 mutation/del 11q/unmutated IGHV). The IGHV mutational status subgroups were already selected as independent subgroups for analysis in addition to the high-risk subpopulation.

## Recruitment

Study Period: 06 October 2014 (first informed consent signed) to 26 March 2018 (date of database lock).

The study was conducted at a total of 9 sites in the United States (US) and 80 sites in rest-of-world (ROW).

## Conduct of the study

There were 3 amendments to the original protocol, which was dated 12 May 2014. Key changes (as selected by the assessor) in the amendments included

1. 18 Aug 2014 Included interim analysis to be conducted at approximately 66 PFS events.

Clarified that progressive disease could be assessed based on ≥ 50% increase from nadir rather than baseline count if the ALC is ≥ 30,000/μ L and lymphocyte doubling time is rapid.

2. 10 May 2016 Removed the 36-month timepoint from interim analysis.
3. 17 Feb 2017 Removed the planned interim analysis and updated plans for primary analysis to ensure maturity of PFS outcome data per FDA feedback.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Important changes in the planned analyses

- The randomization strata were based on available FISH results at randomization from either the central or local laboratory. Post-randomization, the central laboratory continued FISH tests and reported results based on samples drawn at baseline for all randomized subjects prior to database lock. According to the final central FISH results, there were 10% more subjects in the Clb+Ob arm with either del 17p or del 11q. In order to use the most complete information, the unstratified analysis was used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint (PFS by IRC) and all secondary endpoints. In addition, the original planned stratified analysis for primary endpoint (PFS by IRC) was maintained as a sensitivity analysis.
- Based on updated IWCLL guidelines (Hallek et al, 2018), in which there is new emphasis on the importance of testing for IGHV mutational status, an additional analysis for PFS was conducted inclusive of this high-risk population.

No cases of Richter's transformation were reported in the Ibr+Ob arm. Two cases of Richter's transformation in the Clb+Ob arm were reported.

## Updated analyses (cut off 28.02.2019)

For the ITT population, at an event rate of 23% in the experimental arm and 63% in the control arm, the risk of disease progression or death per investigator assessment was reduced by 74.9% for Ibr+Ob vs. Clb+Ob (HR = 0.251, 95% CI: 0.160, 0.395). The median PFS was not estimable for the Ibr+Ob arm and was 21.9 months for the Clb+Ob arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per investigator assessment at 36 months were 76.3% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 32.6% for the Clb+Ob arm.

For the high-risk population, at an event rate of 26% in the experimental arm and 83% in the control arm,the risk of disease progression or death per investigator assessment was reduced by 83.8% for Ibr+Ob vs. Clb+Ob (HR = 0.162, 95% CI: 0.096, 0.275). The median PFS was not reached for the Ibr+Ob arm and was 18.0 months for the Clb+Ob arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

per investigator assessment at 36 months were 72.4% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 12.0% for the Clb+Ob arm.

Given the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, mostly related to adverse events and unacceptable toxicity, a sensitivity analysis was requested, imputing an event at the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of censoring, if a PFS event was not determined at a later time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer time on treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event increases the hazard of progression. The HR between the Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR submitted to 0.327 (95% CI: 0.219, 0.486) for the unstratified analysis, and from 0.229 (95% CI: 0.144, 0.366) in the CSR submitted  to 0.316 (95% CI: 0.211, 0.473) for the stratified analysis. Nevertheless, the difference between the 2 treatment arms remains statistically significant.

## Secondary endpoints

Note: Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested with a closed testing procedure at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05. The first endpoint in the testing order (PFS in del 17p/TP53 mutation/del 11q high-risk subpopulation) met statistical significance. The next endpoint in the testing order (ie, rate of sustained hemoglobin improvement) did not meet statistical significance. As a result, all p-values for subsequent endpoints (ie, rate of MRDnegative response, ORR by IRC, OS, rate of sustained platelet improvement, rate of IRRs, and rate of clinically meaningful improvement in EQ-5D-5L utility score) are presented nominally.

Subjects were evaluated for MRD assessment per central laboratory in both the bone marrow and peripheral blood every 4 cycles after Cycle 9 until Cycle 33, then every 6 cycles starting at Cycle 39.

Treatment with Ibr+Ob resulted in a MRD negativity rate in the bone marrow of 20.4% vs. 17.2% in the Clb+Ob arm (nominal pvalue = 0.5465).

The MRD negativity rate in the peripheral blood or bone marrow was 34.5% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 25.0% for the Clb+Ob arm (nominal pvalue = 0.1152).

## Updated analyses (28.02.2019 cut-off)

Updated analyses for overall survival [OS; ITT population]) are provided based on a 28 February 2019 data extraction date. This is not a formal database lock, but rather a data snapshot, and the results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

should be interpreted accordingly. At an event rate of 18% in both study arms, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). The Kaplan-Meier point estimate for the OS rate at 36 months was 82.7% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 82.3% for the Clb+Ob arm.

## Rate of Infusion-related Reactions

The rate of serious or ≥ Grade 3 IRRs identified by MedDRA PT was 2.7% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 8.6% for the Clb+Ob arm (nominal pvalue= 0.0835).

The rate of IRRs of any grade identified by MedDRA PT was 24.8% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 57.8% for the Clb+Ob arm (nominal p-value&lt; 0.0001).

## Exploratory/other analyses

## Time to Next Treatment

The percentages of subjects who started their next treatment were 3.5% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 44.0% for the Clb+Ob arm.

There was a 93.7% reduction in the risk of the requirement for next treatment observed for the Ibr+Ob arm relative to the Clb+Ob arm (HR = 0.063, 95% CI: 0.023, 0.175; p &lt; 0.0001).

The median time to next treatment was not reached for either treatment arm. At the 30-month landmark time point, an estimated 96.2% of subjects in the Ibr+Ob arm and 51.3% for the Clb+Ob arm had not received subsequent treatment.

## Medical Resource Utilization

Medical resource utilization was evaluated during the first 9 months of study treatment.

In the Ibr+Ob arm, 44 subjects were hospitalized, and the median number of hospitalizations was 1.0 (with a median of 6.5 days of hospitalization). Seventeen subjects had emergency room visits, and the median number of emergency room visits was 1.0. During the first 9 months, 14 subjects (12.4%) received blood supportive products, while 24 subjects (21.2%) received growth factors.

In the Clb+Ob arm, 35 subjects were hospitalized, and the median number of hospitalizations was 1.0 (with a median of 7.0 days of hospitalization). Fifteen subjects had emergency room visits, and the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

median number of emergency room visits was 1.0. During the first 9 months, 24 subjects (20.7%) received blood supportive products, while 47 subjects (40.5%) received growth factors.

## Lymphocytosis

Lymphocytosis was defined as an elevation in ALC of ≥ 50% compared to baseline and to ≥ 5,000/μL at a post-baseline assessment. For subjects with lymphocytosis, resolution of lymphocytosis was defined as a decrease of ALC value to the baseline level or lower, or an ALC value that was below 5,000/μL, whichever occurred first.

Treatment-emergent lymphocytosis occurred in 8 subjects (7.2%) in the Ibr+Ob arm and 1 subject (0.9%) in the Clb+Ob arm. For subjects who developed lymphocytosis, the median time to lymphocytosis was 1.1 weeks (range: 1.0 to 2.1 weeks) for the Ibr+Ob arm and 2.1 weeks for the 1 subject in the Clb+Ob arm. The median time to resolution was 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 1.3 to 7.0 weeks) in the Ibr+Ob arm and 6.3 weeks for the 1 subject in the Clb+Ob arm. These events resolved in all subjects in both treatment arms.

## Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analyses have been performed using both unstratified and stratified methods.

[1] Studies 1115 and CLL3001 excluded subjects with del17p. However, in Study 1115, 1 subject was enrolled with del17p per local lab (TP53 mutation status unknown) and was randomized to the control arm. In Study CLL3001, 2 subjects were enrolled withdel17pintheIbr+BRarm.TP53mutationstatuswas not evaluatedinStudyCLL3001.

## Comparison with study 1115

The Applicant has also provided a comparison of efficacy data between study 1115 (ibrutinib monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy, n=269, data cutoff of 28 May 2015) and study 1130, both recruiting previously untreated patients with CLL/SLL. The median subject age was 71.0 years in Study 1130 and 73.0 years in Study 1115, with the majority of subjects being white (96.1% and 91.1%, respectively) and male (range: 63.8% and 62.8%, respectively). Greater than 90% of subjects across both studies had CLL and an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Baseline Rai Stage of III or IV was reported for 52.0% of subjects in Study 1130 and 45.4% of subjects in Study 1115.

Study 1115 excluded subjects with a chromosome 17p deletion; whereas 14.0% of subjects in Study 1130 had a del17p at baseline. In Study 1115, data for IGHV mutational status and TP53 mutational testing were not included in the original analysis and clinical study report. Testing results for IGHV mutational status and TP53 mutations were subsequently updated. In Study 1115, 53.2% of subjects had high-risk genomic features (mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV). In Study 1130, 64.6% of subjects had high-risk genomic features (ie, del17p/mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV)'.

## Long-term efficacy: Studies 1112 and 1115/1116

## Study 1112

Study 1112 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, comparator-controlled study in subjects with previously treated CLL/SLL. The study compared the efficacy and safety of orally administered ibrutinib 420 mg/day with that of ofatumumab administered IV at an initial dose of 300 mg followed by 11 doses of 2,000 mg over a 24-week period. Randomization of subjects into both treatment arms was 1:1, and subjects received ibrutinib until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity was observed, whichever occurred first. Baseline disease characteristics indicate that high-risk genomic features were consistent across the treatment groups (ibrutinib vs ofatumumab). Genomic analyses of high-risk features indicate that 32.5% of subjects had del17p, 24.3% had del11q, and 46.5% had unmutated IGHV; subjects with these high-risk genomic features comprised 82.4% of the study population.

The updated efficacy results are based on a median time on study of 56 months in Study 1112; 133  of the 196 subjects (67.9%) originally randomized to the ofatumumab treatment arm crossed over to ibrutinib treatment, with 63 (47.4%) of those 133 subjects still on ibrutinib treatment.

## Subjects (n=127) with del 17p:

The median investigator-assessed PFS was 40.6 months in the ibrutinib arm vs. 6.2 months in the ofatumumab arm (HR=0.124, 95% CI: 0.074, 0.208);

The investigator-assessed ORR was 88.9% for the ibrutinib arm vs. 18.8% for the ofatumumab arm.

## Study 1115/1116

Study 1115 compared the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib with Clb, both administered as single oral agents, in subjects with previously untreated CLL/SLL. Chlorambucil was administered on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles. Subjects in Study 1115 were transferred to extension Study 1116 after IRC confirmation of disease progression or at study closure, whichever occurred first. Study 1116 was prospectively designed in conjunction with Study 1115 to ensure retention of subjects and allow for collection of long-term safety and efficacy data in all subjects randomized in Study 1115 for at least 5 years following the first subject enrolled in this parent study. Study 1116 was also designed to provide continued treatment for subjects in the ibrutinib arm who had not progressed, and to allow second-line therapy after progressive disease to study subjects. Baseline disease characteristics indicate that high-risk genomic features were consistent across the treatment groups (ibrutinib vs Clb). Genomic analyses indicated that 5.9% had a del17p/TP53 mutation, 20.1% of subjects had a del11q mutation, and 43.9% had unmutated IGHV; subjects with these high-risk genomic features comprised 53.2% of the study population.

In Study 1116, disease progression and response were assessed by the investigator; there was no IRC assessment. After disease progression, second-line therapy, when clinically indicated, could include ibrutinib for subjects randomized to the Clb arm. All subjects were followed for progression and survival.

The updated efficacy results provided in this report are based on a median time on study of 48 months in Studies 1115/1116. One hundred thirty-six subjects received ibrutinib and 133 subjects received Clb. At the time of the long-term efficacy update, 73 (54.9%) of the 133 subjects originally randomized to the Clb treatment arm crossed over to ibrutinib treatment, with 44 (60.3%) of those 73 crossover subjects still on ibrutinib treatment.

CI=confidenceinterval;HR=hazardratio:NE=not evaluable

Subjects are not censored for initiation of subsequent antineoplastic treatment prior to progressive disease or death.

Time on study is based on the follow-up time of overall survival usingreverse Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival.

Based onKaplan-Meier estimates.

Hazard ratio is estimated using stratified Cox regression model with treatment as the only covariate. P value is from stratified log-rank test.

The HR for the subjects with the high-risk features (mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV) was 0.068; 95% CI: 0.037, 0.127, consistent with the intent-to-treat population at a median follow-up of 48 months.

ORR: The investigator-assessed ORR (PR or better) was 91.2% in the ibrutinib arm vs. 36.8% in the Clb arm. Compared to the primary analysis, the ORR increased with further ibrutinib treatment as subjects with stable disease or PR with lymphocytosis in Study 1115 achieved PR or better with further follow-up. Notably, improvement in investigator-assessed CR rates continued to increase with ongoing ibrutinib treatment.

Twenty-six subjects were confirmed as complete responders by the Sponsor based on IWCLL response criteria (Hallek 2008). Sponsor-confirmed CRs were observed in 22 subjects (16.2%) in the ibrutinib arm and 4 subjects (3.0%) in the Clb arm.

OS: The median OS was not reached in either arm.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This application is based on one pivotal study, 1130: 'A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib in Combination with Obinutuzumab versus Chlorambucil in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma'.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The study enrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or &lt;65 years of age with coexisting medical conditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min, or presence of del17p/TP53 mutation. Notably, the study only enrolled patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation, with previously untreated measurable nodal CLL/SLL requiring treatment. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1000 mg of obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of 5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). Standard dose and regimen were used for all study drugs. The control arm corresponds to the regimen used in the pivotal study supporting the approval for 'Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy'. In that study, similar to study 1130, subjects had to present a comorbidity score (CIRS) of greater than 6 and/or reduced renal function as measured by CrCl &lt;70 mL/min, but age was not considered for inclusion. Subjects on the control arm were eligible to receive ibrutinib monotherapy as next-line treatment.

The amendments, changes in planned analyses and protocol violations are not considered likely to impact on  the interpretation of the study results. Based on external information in terms of updated IWCLL guidelines during the study, emphasizing the importance of IGHV status, a high-risk population including this marker was defined. Final central FISH results, prior to database lock, revealed an imbalance for del 17p/del 11q between the study arms, with 10% higher prevalence in the control arm (the MAH considers that this numerical imbalance between treatment arms may have been due to multifactorial reasons (eg, hierarchical stratification input and multiple genomic factors)). This was addressed by using the unstratified analysis for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints; the high-risk population, including IGHV status, was balanced between study arms. The originally planned stratified analysis for the primary endpoint was kept as a sensitivity analysis. The chosen analyses are generally considered acceptable. The rationale for using a non-stratified log-rank test for the primary outcome is understood with reference to new guidance on IGHV status during study conduct - without this marker the high-risk population could be unbalanced.

The control regimen in high-risk disease, which corresponds to the regimen used in the pivotal study supporting the approval for 'Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy'is deemed appropriate. In that study, similar to study 1130, subjects had to present a comorbidity score (CIRS) of greater than 6 and/or reduced renal function as measured by CrCl &lt;70 mL/min, but age was not considered for inclusion. In study 1130 also fit subjects with high-risk disease, including del 17p, were enrolled, which would today be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered obsolete. However, as the study was planned before the first approval of B cell receptor inhibitors, and considering the known inferior results obtained with FCR in this group, the control regimen must be deemed acceptable also for subjects with high-risk disease.

The prospected median PFS for the control arm corresponds to the observed outcome in the obinutuzumab+chlorambucil arm in the BO21004/CLL11 registration study. No stratification for IGHV status was performed. Outcome per IGHV status was a predefined subgroup analysis. The results of the unstratified tests are presented as the primary results. The stratified analysis results are presented as a sensitivity analysis. The results are very similar. It is preferred that the statistical analysis model reflects the randomisation procedure however in this study were an imbalance occurred it is accepted to use the unstratified analysis as primary. Statistical methods and the method for controlling type I error rate are otherwise considered acceptable.

The design of the pivotal study, ibr+obi vs chl+obi, does not allow isolation of the contribution of each of the drug components to the effect. Specifically, it is not known to what extent obinutuzumab adds to the efficacy of ibrutinib. Indeed, in a recently published study, the combination of ibrutinib with another antiCD20 antibody, rituximab, was in terms of PFS not superior to ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects ≥65 years with previously untreated CLL ( Woyach et al, NEJM, 2018: Dec 1 ). However, as ibrutinib could be viewed as a substitution of chlorambucil in the approved combination with obinutuzumab, the strategy is considered acceptable from a regulatory perspective. The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib + obinutuzumab vs ibrutinib monotherapy.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Study PCYC-1130-CA randomized 229 patients. The median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (48%) or 1-2 (52%). At baseline, 52% had advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 32% of patients had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 44% with baseline anemia, 22% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 28% had a CrCL &lt;60 mL/min, and the median Cumulative Illness Rating Score for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was 4 (range, 0 to 12). At baseline, 65% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high risk factors (del17p/TP53 mutation [18%], del11q [15%], or unmutated IGHV [54%]).

Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 77% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression in the IMBRUVICA arm.

Given the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, a sensitivity analysis was requested, imputing an event at the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of censoring, if a PFS event was not determined at a later time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer time on treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event increases the hazard of progression. The HR between the Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR submitted to 0.327 (95% CI: 0.219, 0.486) for the unstratified analysis, and from 0.229 (95% CI: 0.144, 0.366) in the CSR submitted  to 0.316 (95% CI: 0.211, 0.473) for the stratified analysis. Nevertheless, the difference between the 2 treatment arms remains statistically significant.

The treatment effect of ibrutinib was consistent across the high-risk CLL/SLL population (del 17p/TP53 mutation, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV), with a PFS HR of 0.15 [95% CI (0.09, 0.27)]. The 2-year PFS rate estimates for the high-risk CLL/SLL population were 78.8% [95% CI (67.3, 86.7)] and 15.5% [95% CI (8.1, 25.2)] in the IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arms, respectively.

With a median follow-up time on study of 31 months, the median PFS was not reached in the IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab arm and was 19 months in the chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The external validity of the study is not challenged in relation to the intended study population with a mean age of 71 years and 20% of subjects younger than 65 years. An overall median follow-up of 31 months, an event rate of 64% in the control arm, and consistent sensitivity analyses all support a robust estimate of the primary outcome measure (unstratified PFS according to IRC), and pre-planned subgroup analyses show internal consistency with favourable efficacy for the experimental arm in subjects with high-risk features as well as in the complementary group.

Note that OS data, as expected in first-line treatment of CLL, was immature at the data cut-off of March 2018 with an event rate of 16% in the control arm.

Long-term efficacy is supported by reported data from the 1112 and 1115/1116 studies. With a median follow-up time on study of 56 months in Study PCYC-1112-CA, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or progression by investigator assessment was observed for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median investigator-assessed PFS according to IWCLL criteria was 44.1 months [95% CI (38.54, 56.87)] in the IMBRUVICA arm and 8.1 months [95% CI (7.79, 8.25)] in the ofatumumab arm, respectively; HR=0.14 [95% CI (0.11, 0.19)]. The investigator-assessed ORR in the IMBRUVICA arm was 87.2% versus 22.4% in the ofatumumab arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, 133 (67.9%) of the 196 subjects originally randomized to the ofatumumab treatment arm had crossed over to ibrutinib treatment. The Kaplan-Meier landmark estimate for OS at 60-months was 62.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm.

The outcomes of the subgroup analyses are generally consistent but HR point estimates associated with high-risk features are generally lower than for the complementary groups.

ORR, based on IRC assessment, was 88% in the experimental arm and 73% in the control arm. The corresponding figures for CR were 20% and 8%, respectively. It is noted that time to normalisation of ALC was faster in the control arm, 1.4 weeks vs 8.3 weeks in the experimental arm. With only 17 (15%) events in the experimental arm and 19 (16%) in the control arm data are immature. The early deaths noted in the experimental arm are discussed in the safety section. Overall, no trend for a worse outcome in the experimental arm is noted.

With almost a year longer follow-up, with 3 additional events in the experimental arm and 2 in the control arm, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). OS data is still immature. A further update is expected with the final CSR. MRD negativity rates in the bone marrow were similar between study arms, around 20%.

Infusion-related reactions (i.e. obinutuzumab-related) were numerically less frequently noted in the experimental arm and were observed in 25% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 58% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Grade 3 or higher or serious infusion-related reactions were observed in 3% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 9% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Achievement of sustained platelet improvement in subjects with thrombocytopenia at baseline was roughly similar between study arms. New treatment was started for 44% and 3.5% of subjects in the control and experimental arm, respectively; HR 0.063. The median time to next treatment was not reached for either treatment arm.

The MAH applies for an indication in all patients with previously untreated CLL while the studied population is restricted to patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation. A similar extrapolation was extensively discussed in the II-16 variation, where the pivotal 1115 study investigating ibrutinib monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy in subjects ≥65 years with previously untreated CLL ultimately lead to the approval of ibrutinib monotherapy in all previously untreated patients with CLL.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The efficacy results are robust and support clinically relevant benefit of Imbruvica in the sought indication.

The MAH accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide post-approval data on PFS2 or corresponding proxy from Study PCYC-1130 (expected in 3Q 2020).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The 7 studies forming the basis of the authorized indications in the ibrutinib EU SmPC are: Studies PCYC-1102-CA, PCYC-1112-CA, PCYC-1115-CA, and PCI-32765CLL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, and CLL3001) for CLL; Study PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as Study 1118E) for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM); and Studies PCYC-1104-CA and PCI-32765MCL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1104 and MCL3001) for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Data for the 981 ibrutinib-treated subjects from these 7 pivotal studies are referred to as the Current Label Pool.

Safety data from Study 1130, both separately and together with safety data from Study 1127, were integrated with those for Current Label Pool, ie, the registrational studies representing the currently approved indications in the ibrutinib SmPC, for determination of the ADR profile for ibrutinib as a single agent or in combination therapy. The integrated population of Study 1130, Study 1127, and the Current Label Pool is referred to as the 'Overall Label Pool' and represents data from 1,200 ibrutinib-treated subjects.  Relative to the currently approved ADR table for ibrutinib in the IMBRUVICA SmPC, no new ADRs were identified based on the addition of data from Studies 1130 or 1127.

Current Label Pool includes ibrutinib-treated subjects from Studies 1112, 1115, CLL3001, 1118E, 1104, and MCL3001, and 51 previously treated subjects with CLL/SLL treated with ibrutinib 420 mg/day in Study 1102. The intended doses were 560 mg/day in Studies 1104 and MCL3001, and 420 mg/day in Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, CLL3001, and 1118E.

Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in safety population as denominator.

Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 20.1.

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Over Time

Study 1130: For the following common TEAEs (≥10% per period), a suggestion of an increase in prevalence was observed with continued ibrutinib treatment (ie, difference of at least 2-fold between Days 1-90 and Days 271-365 [intervals of similar duration]), with consistently higher or stable rates for each subsequent time period compared with Days 1-90): upper respiratory tract infection (1.0% for Days 1-90; 2.4% for Days 271-365), nasopharyngitis (1.0% for Days 1-90; 3.5% for Days 271-365), hypertension (2.9% for Days 1-90; 8.2% for Days 271-365), and atrial fibrillation (0% for Days 1-90; 7.1% for Days 271-365).

Current label pool: There were no apparent trends of an increase in prevalence over time for any specific common TEAEs in the Current Label Pool, with the exception of hypertension which was reported at prevalence rates of 3.4% for Days 1-90 and 7.9% for Days 271-365.

Current Label Pool includes ibrutinib-treated subjects from Studies 1112, 1115, CLL3001, 1118E, 1104, and MCL3001, and 51 previously treated subjects with CLL/SLL treated with ibrutinib 420 mg/day in Study 1102. The intended doses were 560 mg/day in Studies 1104 and MCL3001, and 420 mg/day in Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, CLL3001, and 1118E.

Note: Percentages calculated with the number of subjects in safety population as denominator.

Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 20.1.

## Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Clinical Interest

## Hemorrhage

The proportions of subjects with a hemorrhage TEAE of any grade/severity or a major hemorrhagic TEAE in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130 (44.2% and 4.4%, respectively) were consistent with those observed in the Current Label Pool (41.4% and 4.5%, respectively).

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome

In Study 1130, TLS was reported in 1 subject (0.9%) in the ibrutinib+Ob arm (Grade 2) and in 7 subjects (6.1%) in the Clb+Ob arm (2.6% Grade 3 or 4).

The most common non-skin malignancy in the ib+Ob treatment arm was cancer involving the colon, reported in 3 subjects.

## Atrial fibrillation

In Study 1130, atrial fibrillation TEAEs were reported for 14 subjects (12.4%) in the ibrutinib+Ob arm. The atrial fibrillation TEAE in the ibrutinib+Ob arm was Grade 3 or 4 in severity for 6 subjects (5.3%), serious in 5 subjects (4.4%; including 4 subjects with a Grade 3 or 4 event), and resulted in ibrutinib dose reduction in 1 subject (0.9%). For no subject in the ibrutinib+Ob arm did the atrial fibrillation TEAE result in ibrutinib discontinuation or death.

The proportion of subjects with atrial fibrillation events in the ibrutinib+Ob arm was higher than that for the Current Label Pool (any grade: 6.4%; Grade 3 or higher: 3.3%); ibrutinib exposure was also considerably longer in Study 1130 than for the Current Label Pool

No subject in the Clb+Ob arm of Study 1130 had an atrial fibrillation TEAE.

## Hypertension

Hypertension TEAEs were reported for 16.8% of subjects in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130, with 3.5% of subjects having a Grade 3 or 4 hypertension TEAE. None of these events were serious or resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation. One subject (0.9%) had an ibrutinib dose reduction due to a hypertensive TEAE.

In the Clb+Ob arm of Study 1130, hypertension TEAEs were reported for 4.3% of subjects (3.5% with Grade 3 or 4 events).

While the reported incidence of hypertension TEAEs of any grade was higher for the ibrutinib+Ob arm compared with the Current Label Pool (9.9%) (possibly due to the longer treatment duration in the ibrutinib+Ob arm), the pattern of hypertension TEAEs in the 2 safety populations was similar with respect to the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (3.8%) and very few events that were serious (0.6%) or resulted in ibrutinib dose reduction or discontinuation (0.1% each).

## Long-term safety Data - PAM 3038-1

PRAC evaluated this study recently as MEA025 (CHMP conclusion 15/11/2018); please refer to that report.

The MAH's conclusions are as follows: 'The results from the Year 4 interim analysis of PAM 3038-1 show no new safety concerns in patients on long-term ibrutinib therapy administered at 420 mg or 560 mg daily to subjects with CLL/SLL or MCL with a median treatment duration of 45.4 and 11.1 months, respectively (33.7 months overall across both indications). The overall known safety profile of ibrutinib-treated patients remained consistent, other than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety signals identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, the safety of long-term exposure to ibrutinib in a subset of subjects with CLL/SLL (n=330) from Studies 1112 and 1115/1116 was in alignment with that observed for the larger LTS population (n=1,177)'.

In the assessment report, it is concluded that 'Overall this third interim report is not suggestive of any new safety concerns in patients exposed to ibrutinib for long term and no specific regulatory action is currently required'.

## Methodology for ADR Analysis

The determination of updated information to Section 4.8 of the SmPC was based on the following steps:

Step I. Data from Study 1130, either alone or with data from Study 1127, were pooled with data from the other 4 randomized controlled trials (1112, 1115, CLL3001, MCL3001). For the pooled analysis involving data from Study 1130 (ibrutinib+Ob arm) and Study 1127 (ibrutinib+rituximab arm of double-blind study), integrated TEAE data from the 1,883 subjects (944 ibrutinib, 939 comparator) comprising this Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) population were examined as follows:

- o Individual TEAE preferred terms that met the following criteria were identified (note, the same grouped terms as used in the current ADR section of the SmPC were used):
-  TEAE reported in ≥10% of subjects in the pooled RCT ibrutinib group and reported at a ≥5% higher incidence compared to the pooled RCT comparator group.
-  Serious TEAEs reported in ≥2% of subjects in pooled RCT ibrutinib group and reported at a ≥ 2% higher incidence compared to the pooled RCT comparator group.

Step II . Medical review of each potential ADRs identified in Step I was conducted. In addition, a review all ADRs from the current SmPC and any events from the completed individual studies was conducted to identify additional ADRs that are biologically plausible based on the current biological and clinical knowledge of ibrutinib therapy (eg, mechanism of action, pharmacological profile or well-established ADR for ibrutinib from other clinical trials or postmarketing spontaneous reports, consistent trending across multiple studies).

Step III . A final list of ADRs identified in Steps I and II above was compiled. This list was then applied to the safety population that integrates data from the pivotal studies representing the currently approved and proposed extended indications in CLL/SLL (1130, 1102, 1112, 1115, CLL3001); WM (1118E, 1127 [not included for updated ADR determination based on inclusion of data from 1130 only]); and MCL (1104, MCL3001). This Overall Label Pool represents data from a total of 1,200 subjects receiving ibrutinib as monotherapy or in combination therapy across these 9 studies.

## Results

Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved SmPC; please refer to separate SmPC.

Of the 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib for CLL, WM, or MCL comprising the Overall Label Pool, 5.1% discontinued treatment primarily due to ADRs. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse drug reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 6.6% of the 1,200 subjects.

Of the 1,200 patients treated with ibrutinib in the Overall Label Pool, 64% were 65 years of age or older. Grade 3 or higher pneumonia occurred more frequently among elderly patients treated with ibrutinib (12% of patients age ≥65 versus 7% of patients &lt;65 years of age).

The only TEAE preferred term that led to ibrutinib discontinuation in &gt;1 subject in the ibr+Ob treatment arm was thrombocytopenia (2 subjects; 1.8%). For 13 of the total of 19 subjects , the TEAE(s) leading to ibrutinib discontinuation were serious, including the 5 subjects who had a fatal TEAE and 8 subjects with non-fatal serious TEAEs (bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, osteoarthritis, pneumonia and cerebrovascular accident, respiratory tract infection, hemoptysis, non-small cell lung cancer, and thrombocytopenia).

In the Clb+Ob arm, 11 subjects (9.6%) had a TEAE that resulted in discontinuation of Clb, with infusion-related reactions being the only TEAE that led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject in this arm (n=2, 1.7%). In the ibrutinib+Ob arm, there were no subjects who discontinued obinutuzumab due to an IRR (based on PT). In the Clb+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to obinutuzumab discontinuation occurred in 7 subjects (6.1%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130 was consistent with that for the Current Label Pool (11.4%). Those TEAEs that led to ibrutinib discontinuation in 5 or more subjects in the Current Label Pool were pneumonia (n=12, 1.2%), atrial fibrillation (n=7, 0.7%), subdural hematoma (n=7, 0.7%), thrombocytopenia (n=6, 0.6%), sepsis (n=5, 0.5%), and neutropenia (n=5, 0.5%).

## Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction or Interruption

In Study 1130, TEAEs of any grade leading to an ibrutinib dose reduction were reported for 15.0% of subjects in the ibrutinib+Ob arm. Similarly, TEAEs of any grade led to a reduction in the dose of Clb for 12.2% of subjects. Neutropenia was the only individual TEAE that led to a reduction in the dose of ibrutinib (5.3%) or Clb (9.6%) in 2% or more of subjects.

In the Ibr+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to obinutuzumab interruption occurred in 7 subjects (6.2%); 1 subject (0.9%) experienced a Grade 3 or higher IRR leading to obinutuzumab interruption. In the Clb+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to obinutuzumab interruption occurred in 35 subjects (30.4%); 4 subjects (3.5%) experienced a Grade 3 or higher IRR leading to obinutuzumab interruption.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The substantially longer duration of treatment in the Ibr+Obi arm vs the Clb+Obi arm of study 1130, and also vs the Current label pool, should be noted when comparing AE rates between the groups. Here, the analysis of AEs and correlated rates in study 1130 during the first 9 months of study is considered of major interest. As could be expected, the differences between the study arms are smaller as compared to the overall analysis.

Fatal AEs were reported for 6 subjects in the experimental arm vs 3 subjects in the control arm. Importantly, within the first 9 months of treatment, the proportion of subjects with fatal TEAEs was 5.3% (n=6) for the experimental arm and 2.6% (n=3) in the control arm. The verbatim for these cases, however, do not suggest any specific pattern of AEs leading to death. Having considered also the AEs leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no potentially specific safety signal not previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been identified.

Notwithstanding the different times on therapy, compared to the Current label pool, grade ≥3 events were slightly more prevalent in the experimental arm of study 1130. At the SOC level, blood/lymphatic system disorders, injury/poisoning/procedural complications, and cardiac disorders were numerically more frequent in the experimental arm of study 1130. Grade 3-4 events were overall reported at similar rates between study arms in 1130. At the SOC level, infections/infestations and cardiac disorders were more frequently reported in the experimental arm.

With the exception of higher rates of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash maculo-papular, arthralgia, 1130, the respective frequencies reasonably correspond to the Current label pool. At the SOC level, GI disorders, infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal disorders, musculoskeletal/connective disorders, metabolism/nutrition disorders, and cardiac disorders were clearly more commonly reported in the experimental vs arm in study 1130. But, again, note the major difference in treatment duration. The prevalence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation seem to increase over time during treatment with ibrutinib.

and infusion-related reaction, which all were more commonly reported in the experimental arm of study the control

Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved SmPC. Having considered also the AEs leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

potentially specific safety signal not previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been identified.

Discontinuation of treatment due to AE was more common in the experimental arm of study 1130 as compared to the control arm and the Current label pool; here, as for the outcomes, time on treatment must be considered. Discontinuation due to investigator/sponsor decision, subject refuses further treatment or 'other' was more commonly reported in the experimental arm, in 10 subjects vs 1 in the control arm. Median time on study was similar between study arms. The TEAEs leading to most treatment discontinuations of ibrutinib were, in descending order, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, subdural hematoma, thrombocytopenia, sepsis and neutropenia.

The long-term safety data over 4 years from 1177 patients (CLL/SLL n=807 and MCL n=370) treated with IMBRUVICA were analyzed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 45 months with 70% and 40% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years. The median duration of treatment for MCL was 11 months with 31% and 14% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years. The overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained consistent, other than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. The prevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 6% (year 1-2), 8% (year 2-3), and 8% (year 3-4). The incidence for the 4-year period was 10%.

Considering the first 9 months of study participation, no major differences in terms of AE entity as described in the table above are noted, with the exception of AEs leading to obinutuzumab discontinuation or infusion interruption that were numerically more commonly reported in the control arm and are reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Given the unclear role/consequences of the QT shortening properties of ibrutinib ventricular arrhythmias are of potential interest to follow. Any grade and grade ≥3 events of cardiac arrhythmias excluding atrial fibrillation were more commonly reported in the experimental arm vs the control arm of study 1130, including three cases of tachycardia, two cases of syncope and one case each of ventricular extrasystoles, cardiac arrest and sudden death were noted. The difference in treatment duration, referring to the control arm of study 1130 as well as the Current label pool, complicates the interpretation of this dataset. Further vigilance is indicated.

TEAEs of any other malignancy and non-skin cancer were more common in the experimental arm of study 1130 as compared to the Current label pool, 13.3% vs 8.4% and 7.1% vs 2.5%, respectively. No clear pattern in terms of histology is obvious although 3 subjects in the experimental arm of study 1130 were reported with colon cancer. Most likely the very different exposure/observation times contribute to this finding but further vigilance is indicated.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

When adding safety data from the 1130 and 1127 (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, parallel procedure) studies to the Current label pool, no new ADR was identified.

Long-term safety is supported by the outcome of the recently assessed MEA025 (CHMP conclusion 15/11/2018) where it was concluded that overall this third interim report is not suggestive of any new safety concerns in patients exposed to ibrutinib for long term. No regulatory action was required.

Further, the MAH should keep monitoring reports of ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin primary malignancies within the PSURs.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

CLL is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs; diagnosis requires th e presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood. It is the most common form of adult leukemia in the Western world. Assessment of newly diagnosed patients for deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (del11q), mutated TP53, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) mutational status has prognostic and predictive value;

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

In particular, patients with the del17p abnormality have an increased risk of relapse and death; the median life expectancy is 2 to 3 years from first-line treatment. It should be noted that the Clb+CD20 antibody combination is not recommended in subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

Pivotal study: PCYC-1130-CA was 'A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib in Combination with Obinutuzumab versus Chlorambucil in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma'. Randomisation, stratified by ECOG 0-1 vs 2, and del 17p vs del 11q without del 17p vs others, was 1:1, n=229. The study Period was: 06 October 2014 (first informed consent signed) to 26 March 2018 (date of database lock). The study was conducted at a total of 9 sites in the US and 80 sites in rest-of-world (ROW). Patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation, with previously untreated measurable nodal CLL/SLL requiring treatment were enrolled. A six months treatment period for the control arm was compared with treatment until PD or toxicity for the experimental arm. Subjects on the control arm were eligible to receive ibrutinib monotherapy as next-line treatment.

The event-driven primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IRC using non-EMA censoring rules, no interim analysis was performed. Due to imbalance of high-risk stratification factors between study arms, and new external guidance highlighting the prognostic impact of IGHV mutation status during study conduct, the originally planned stratified analysis of the primary outcome was, prior to database lock, changed to an unstratified analysis. With IGHV mutation status included, high-risk features were balanced between study arms.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

With a median follow-up of 31.3 months and an event rate of 64% in the control arm and 21% in the experimental arm, an unstratified analysis of IRC assessment of PFS showed a HR of 0.231 (0.145, 0.367), p&lt;0.0001. Use of the stratified Cox regression model showed a consistent outcome. The sensitivity analysis using an unstratified analysis of investigator assessment showed a HR of 0.260. Given the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, a sensitivity analysis was requested, imputing an event at the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of censoring, if a PFS event was not determined at a later time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer time on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event increases the hazard of progression. The HR between the Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR submitted to. Nevertheless, the difference between the 2 treatment arms remains statistically significant.

ORR, based on IRC assessment, was 88% in the experimental arm and 73% in the control arm. The corresponding figures for CR were 20% and 8%, respectively. Time to normalisation of absolute lymphocyte count was, however, faster in the control arm, 1.4 weeks vs 8.3 weeks in the experimental arm.

With only 17 (15%) events in the experimental arm and 19 (16%) in the control arm at the time of the primary submission, OS data is immature. With almost a year longer follow-up, with 3 additional events in the experimental arm and 2 in the control arm, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). OS data is still immature. A further update is expected with the final CSR. The early deaths noted in the experimental arm are discussed below. Overall, no trend for a worse outcome in the experimental arm is noted.

Infusion-related reactions (i.e. obinutuzumab-related) were numerically less frequently noted in the experimental arm.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

As a six months treatment period for the control arm is compared with treatment until PD or toxicity for the experimental arm, and progress on vs off therapy has different prognostic implications, data on PFS2 would be informative and will be provided along with the final analysis CSR for the 1130 study, in 3Q2020 as recommended by the CHMP.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

In relation to the known safety profile of ibrutinib no new ADRs or safety signals were observed.

The prevalence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation seem to increase over time during treatment with ibrutinib.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Having considered also the AEs leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no potentially specific safety signal not previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been identified.

Ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin primary malignancies will be monitored in the PSURs.

Notes:

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The HR for the primary endpoint PFS of 0.231 - which following sensitivity analyses was revised to 0.327 - is statistically significant and considered clinically highly relevant, not least in patients with high-risk disease. Also ORR and CR rates were in favour of the experimental arm, with long-term follow-up of other ibrutinib studies showing deepening responses over time. Thus, the PFS outcome can be considered robustly estimated. With approximately one additional year of follow-up, data remains essentially stable. The outcomes of the subgroup analyses are consistent.

The rate and severity of obintuzumab infusion-related reactions were lower in the experimental arm as it seems Imbruvica has a protective effect over IRS triggered by the monoclonal antibody. OS results are too immature to evaluate but no negative trend for the experimental arm is noted in the KM graph.

No new ADRs or safety signals were observed in relation to the known safety profile of ibrutinib.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The improved outcome in terms of PFS consistent among subgroups far outweighs the manageable safety profile of ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

The indication encompasses all patients with previously untreated CLL while the studied population is restricted to patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation. A simil ar

extrapolation was extensively discussed in the II-16 variation, where the pivotal 1115 study investigating ibrutinib monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy in subjects ≥65 years with previously untreated CLL ultimately lead to the approval of ibrutinib monotherapy in all previously untreated patients with CLL. Consistently, given the safety profile of the ibr+obi combination, there is no reason to restrict the use of this combination to a more narrow population than already approved for ibrutinib monotherapy.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Imbruvica in combination with obinutuzumab in CLL is positive.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should submit the following safety data the next PSUR: Ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin primary malignancies.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include combination use with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Imbruvica based on data from the phase 3 study PCYC-1130-CA; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An updated RMP (version 12) is agreed.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to obinutuzumab within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of indication to include combination use with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Imbruvica based on data from the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

phase 3 study PCYC-1130-CA; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An updated RMP (version 12) is agreed.
