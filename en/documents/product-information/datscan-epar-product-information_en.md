Each 2.5 ml single dose vial contains 185 MBq ioflupane ( 123 I) (specific activity range 2.5 to 4.5 x 10 14 Bq/mmol) at reference time. Each 5 ml single dose vial contains 370 MBq ioflupane ( 123 I) ( specific activity range 2.5 to 4.5 x 10 14 Bq/mmol) at reference time.

Excipient(s) with known effect This medicinal product contains 39.5 g/l ethanol. For the full list of excipients see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection. Clear colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.

DaTSCAN is indicated for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum:

- In adult patients with clinically uncertain Parkinsonia n Syndromes, for example those with early symptoms, in order to help differentiate Essential Tremor from Parkinsonian Syndromes related to idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. DaTSCAN is unable to discriminate between Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
- In adult patients, t o help differentiate probable dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease.

DaTSCAN is unable to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Prior to administration a ppropriate resuscitation equipment should be available.

DaTSCAN should only be used in adult patients referred by physicians experienced in the management of movement disorders and/or dementia. DaTSCAN should only be used by qualified personnel with the appropriate government authorisation for the use and manipulation of radionuclides within a designated clinical setting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated across the range 111 to 185 MBq. Do not exceed 185 MBq and do not use when the activity is below 110 MBq.

Patients must undergo appropriate thyroid blocking treatment prior to injection to minimise thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine, for example by oral administration of appr oximately 120 mg potassium iodide 1 to 4 hours prior to injection of DaTSCAN.

## Special populations

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant r enal or hepatic impairment.  No data are available (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of DaTSCAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. No data are available.

## Method of Administration

For intravenous use.

DaTSCAN should be used without dilution. To minimise the potential for pain at the injection site during administration, a slow intravenous injection (not less than 15 to 20 seconds) via an arm vein is recommended.

## Image acquisition

SPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours postinjection. Images should be acquired using a gamma camera fitted with a high -resolution collimator and calibrated using the 159 keV photopeak and a ± 10% energy window. Angular sampling should preferably be not less than 120 views over 360 degrees. For high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be consistent and set as small as possible (typically 11 -15cm). Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest that optimal images are obtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 3.54.5 mm for those systems currently in use. A minimum of 500k counts should be collected for optimal images.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in sectio n 6.1.
- -Pregnancy (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be discontinued immediately and, if necessary, intrave nous treatment initiated .  Resuscitative medicinal products and equipment (e.g. endotracheal tube and ventilator) have to be readily available.

This radiopharmaceutical may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clini c al settings. Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and the appropriate licences of the local competent official organisations.

For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely benefit.  The activity administered must be such that the resulting dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended diagnostic result.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The patient should be well hydrated before and after the examination a nd urged to void as often as possible during the first 48 hours after the procedure in order to minimise radiation exposure.

Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the absence of data, DaTSCA N is not recomme nded in cases of moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment.

This medicinal product contains 39.5 g/l (5% volume ) ethanol (alcohol), up to 197 mg per dose, equivalent to 5 ml beer or 2 ml wine. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholi sm. To be taken into account in high -risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy.

## Interpretation of DaTSCAN Images

DaTSCAN images are interpreted visually, based upon the appearance of the striata. Optimum presentation of the reconstructe d im ages for vis ual interpretation is transaxial slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (ACPC) line. Determination of whether an image is normal or abnormal is made by assessing the extent (as indicated by shape) and intensity (in relation to the background) of the striatal signal.

Normal images are characterised by two symmetrical crescent -shaped are as of equal intensity. Abnormal images are either asymmetric or symmetric with unequal or re duced intensity and/or loss of crescent.

As an adjunct, visual interpretation may be assisted by semi -quantitative assessment using CE -marked so ftware, where DaTSCAN uptake in the striatum is compared with uptake in a reference region and ratios are compared against an age adjusted healthy subj ects' database. The evaluation of ratios, such as the left/right striatum DaTSCAN uptake (symmetry) or caudate/putamen uptake, may further help with the image assessment.

The following precautions should be taken when using semi -quantitative methods:

- Semi-quantification should only be used an adjunct to visual assessment
- Only CE marked software should be used
- Users should be trained in the use of CE marked software by the manufacturer and follow EANM p ractice guidelines for image acquisition, reconstr ucti on and asses sment
- Readers should interpret the scan visually and then perform the semi-quantitative analysis according to manufacturer's instructions including quality check s for the quantitation process
- o ROI /VOI techniques should be used to compare u ptake in the striatum with uptake in a reference region
- o Comparison against an age adjusted healthy subjects database is recommended to account for age -expected decrease in striatal binding
- o The reconstruction and filter settings (including attenuation corre ctio n) used can affect the semiquantitative values.  The reconstruction and filter settings recommended by the manufacturer of the CE marked software should be followed and should match those used for semi-quantification of the healthy subjects database .
- o The intensity of the striatal signal as measured by SBR (striatal binding ratio) and asymmetry and caudate to putamen ratio provide objective numerical values corresponding to the visual assessment para meter s and can be helpful in difficult to read cases
- o If the semi-quantitative values are inconsistent with the visual interpretation , the scan should be evaluated for appropriate placement of the ROIs /VOIs, correct image orientation and appropriate parame ters for im age acquisition and attenuation correction shou ld be verified. Some s oftware packages can support these processes to reduce operatordependent variability
- o Final assessment should always consider both visual appearance and semi -quantitative results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed in humans.

Ioflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Medicines that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may therefor e interfere with DaTSCAN diagnosis. These includ e am fetamine, buprop ion, cocaine, codeine, dexam f etamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, and phentermine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as sertraline , may increas e or decrease ioflupa ne binding to the dopamine transporter.

Medicines shown during clinical trials not to interfere with DaTSCAN imaging include amantadine, trihex yphenidyl, budipine, levodopa, metoprolol, primidone, propranolol and selegiline. Dopamine a gonists and an tagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to interfere with DaTSCAN imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in animal studies not to interfere with DaTSCAN imaging include p er golide.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of c hildbearing potential

Wh ere it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of chil dbearing potential, information should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has mis sed a peri o d sho uld be assumed pregnant until p roven otherwise. Where uncertainty exists, it is important that radiation exposure should be the minimum consi stent with achieving satisfactory imaging. Alternative techniques which do not involve ionising r ad iation shoul d be considered.

## Pregnancy

Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with this product. Radionuclide procedures carried out o n pre gnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. Administration of 185 MBq of ioflupane ( 123 I) results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 3.0 mGy. DaTSCAN is contrain dicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).

## Breastfeeding

It is not known whether ioflupane ( 123 I) is excreted in human milk.  Before administering a radioactive medicinal pr o d uct to a breast-fe eding mother, consideration should be giv en as to whether the inv estigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breast -fe eding and as to whether the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceutical has been made, beari n g i n mind the secretion of radioactivity in breast milk. If administration is considered necessary, breast -feeding should be interrupted for 3 days and substituted by formula feeding. During this time, breast milk should be expressed at regular intervals an d the expresse d feeds should be discarded.

## Fertility

No fe rtility studies have been performed. No data are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

DaTSCAN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

The f ollowing undesirable effects are recognised for DaTSCAN:

## Tabulat ed summary of adverse reactions

The frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as follows: Very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10,00 0 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data) .  Wit hin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Immune system disorders

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Uncommon: I

njection site pain (intense pain or burning sensation following administration into small

veins)

Not kno

wn: Feeling hot

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with can cer induction an d a potential for development of hereditary defects. As the effectiv e dose is 4.63 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 185 MBq is administered these adverse event s are expected to occu r with a low probability.

## Reporting of suspe ct ed adverse r eactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of t he medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the med i cinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any su spec ted advers e reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V .

## 4.9 Overdose

In cases of overdose of radioactivity, frequent micturition and defaecation should be encour a ged in order to minimise radiation dose to the patient. Care should be taken to av oid contamination from the radioactivity eliminated by the patient using such methods.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic g r oup: Diagnostic radiopharmaceutical central nervous system,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ATC co de: V09AB03.

Due to the low quantities of ioflupane injected, pharmacological effects are not expected following intravenous administration of DaTSCAN at the recommended dosage.

## Mechanism of action

Ioflupane is a cocaine analogue. Studies in animals hav e shown that ioflu pane binds with high affinity to the presynaptic dopamine transporter and so radiolabelled ioflupane ( 123 I) can be used as a surrogate marker to exam ine the integrity of t he dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Ioflupane also binds to the serotonin transporter on 5-HT neurons but with lower (approximately 10fold) binding affinity.

There is no experience in types of tremor other than essential tremor.

## Clinical efficacy

Cli nical studies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies

In a pivotal clinical trial including evaluation of 288 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodie s (DLB) (144 subjects), Alzheimer's disease (124 subjects), vascular dementia (9 subjects) or other (11 subjects), the results of an independent, blinded visual assessment of the DaTSCAN im ages were compared to the clinical diagnosis as determined by physicians experienced in the management and diagnosis of dementias.  Clinical categorisation into the respe c tive dementia group was based on a standardised and comprehensive clini cal and ne uropsychiatric evaluation.  The values for the sensitivity of DaTSCAN in determining probable DLB from non -DLB ranged from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 88.6% to 91.4%. The positive predictive value ranged from 78.9% to 84.4% and the n e g at ive predic tive value from 86.1% to 88.7%. Analyses in which both possible and probable DLB patients were compared with nonDLB dementia patients demonstrated values for the sensitivity of DaTSCAN ranging from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 81.3% t o 83 .9% when t he p ossible DLB patients were included as non-DLB patients. The sensiti vity ranged from 60.6% to 63.4% and specificity from 88.6% to 91.4% when the possible DLB patients were included as DLB patients.

Clinical s tudies demonstrating adjunctiv e use of semi-quan titative information for image interpretation

The reliability of u sing semiquantitative information as an adjunct to visual inspection was analysed in four clinical stu dies where sensitivity, specificity or overall accuracy between the two methods of ima ge interpretation were compared. In the four studies (total n=578), CEmarked DaTSCAN semiquantitation software was used. The differences (i.e., improvements when adding semi-quantitative information to visual inspection) in sensitivity ra nged between 0.1 % and 5.5%, in specificity between 0.0% and 2.0%, and in overall accuracy between 0.0% and 12.0%.

The biggest of these four studies retrospectively assessed a total of 3 04 DaTSCAN exams from previously conducted Phase 3 or 4 studies, whi ch i ncluded su bjec ts with a clinical diagnosis of PS, nonPS (mainly ET), probable DLB, and non -DLB (mainly AD). Five nuclear medicine physicians who had limited prior experience with DaTS C AN interpretation assessed the images in 2 readings (alone and combin ed with semi-qua ntitative data provided by DaTQUANT 4.0 software ) at least 1 month apart. These results were compa red with the subject's 1 -to 3-year followup diagnosis to determine diag nostic accuracy. The improvements in sensitivity and specificity [w ith 95% confid ence intervals] were 0.1% [ -6.2%,6.4%] and 2.0% [ -3.0%,7.0%]. Also, the results of the combined reading were associated with an increase in reader confidence.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Distribution

Ioflupane ( 123 I) is cleared rapidly f rom the blood afte r intravenous injection; only 5% of the administered activity remai ns in whole blood at 5 minutes post -injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Organ uptake

Uptake in the brain is rapid, reaching ab o ut 7% of injected activity at 10 minutes pos tinjection and decrea si ng to 3% aft er 5 hours. About 30% of the whole brain activity is attributed to stri atal uptake.

## Elimination

At 48 hours postinjection, approximately 60% of the injected radioactivity i s excreted in the urine, with faecal excret ion calculated at approx imat ely 14%.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Nonclinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeated do se toxicity and genotoxicity.

Studies on reproductive toxicity and t o assess the carci nogenic potential of ioflupane have not been performed.

## 11 DOSIMETRY

Iodin e-123 has a physical halflife of 13.2 hours. It decays emitting gamma radiation with a predominant ener gy of 159 keV and X -rays of 27 keV.

The estimated absorbed radiati on d oses to an ave rage adult patient (70 kg) from intravenous injection of ioflupane ( 123 I) are listed in the Table below. The values are calculated assuming urinary bladder emptying at 4 .8hour intervals and appropriate thyroid blocking (Iodine -123 is a known Auger ele ctron emitter). Frequent bladder emptying should be encouraged after dosing to minimise radiation exposure.

## 1. What DaTSCAN is and what it is used for

DaTSCAN contains the active substance ioflupane ( 123 I) which is used to help identify (diagnose ) con ditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called 'radiopharmaceuticals', which contain a small amount of radioactivity.

- When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a short time.
- Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using special cameras.
- A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is ins ide the organ and the body. This can give t he do ctor valuable information about how that organ is working .

When DaTSCAN is injected into an adult, it is carried around the body in the blood . It collects in a small area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in:

- Parkinsonism (includ in g Parkinson's disease) and
- dementia with Lewy bodies.

A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may feel that the scan would help in finding out more a bout your condition and deciding on possibl e treatment.

When DaTSCAN is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in some types of X -ray investigation . Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to these small amounts of radiation.

This medicine is used for diagnostic use only. It is used only to identify illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before DaTSCAN is used

## DaTSCAN must not be used

- if you are aller gic to ioflupane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine ( listed in s ection 6).
- if you are pregnant

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using DaTSCAN if you have a moderate or severe problem with your kidneys or liver.

## Before administration of DaTSCAN you should

- d rink plenty of water so that you are well hydrated before and after the examination and urinate as often as possible during the first 48 hours after the procedure .

## Children and adolescents

DaTSCAN is not recommended for children aged 0 to 18 years

## Other medicines and DaTSCAN

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines . Some medic ines or substances can affect the way that DaTSCAN works.

These inclu de:

- bupropion (used to treat depression or to stop smoking )
- sertraline , paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, f luvoxamine (used to treat depressi on)
- meth ylphenidate, dexamfetamine (used to tr eat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) a nd narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness))
- phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity)
- amfetamine
- cocaine (sometimes us ed as an anaesthetic for nose surgery )
- moda finil ( used to treat narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness) and other sleep disorders )
- cod eine ( used to relieve mild to moderate pain and suppress a dry cough )

S ome medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may a sk you to stop taking them for a short time before you receive DaTSCAN.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use DaTSCAN if you are pregnant or think you may possibly be pregnant. This is because th e child may receive some of the radioactivity. Tell your nuclear medic ine doctor if you think you might be pregnant. Alternative techniques which do not involve radioacti vity should be considered.

If you are breastfeeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of DaTSCAN, or ask you to stop breast-fe eding. It is not known whether ioflupane ( 123 I) is passed into bre ast milk.

- You sho uld n ot breast-fe ed your child for 3 days after DaTSCAN is given.
- Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any breast milk you have expr essed.
- You will need to continue to do this for 3 d a ys, until the ra dioac tivity is no longer in yo ur body.

## Driving and using machines

DaTSCAN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

DaTSCAN contains alcohol (ethanol) 5 % by volume. Each dose contains up to 197 mg alcohol. This is about the same as 5 ml beer, or 2 ml wine. This is harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and needs to be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy. Tell your do ctor if any of these apply to you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How DaTSCAN is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity . DaTSCAN wil l always be used in a hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are train ed and qualif ied to use it safely . They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine . Your nuclear medicine doctor will decide the dose that is best for you .

Before you receive DaTSCAN, your nuclear me dicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liq uid that contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building -up in your thyroid gland. It is important that you take the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you.

DaTSCAN is given to you as an injection , usually into a vein in your arm. The recom mended radioactivity given by injection is between 111 to 185 MBq (m ega b equerel or MBq is a unit used to measure radi oactivity). A single injection is enough. Th e camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of DaTSCAN.

## If you are given more DaTSCAN than you should

Since DaTSCAN is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an overdose . Your nuclear medic ine doctor w ill s uggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get rid of the medicin e. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass -your doctor will tell you what to do . This is normal practice with medicines like DaTSCAN . Any ioflupane ( 123 I) which remains in your body will naturally los e its radioactivit y.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure .
