## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Trazec.  This  scientific discussion has been updated until 1 February 2004. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 1. Introduction Trazec (nateglininde) is indicated for combination therapy with metformin of type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone. The daily dose is  60180 mg daily. Nateglinide  is  an  aminoacid  derivative  of  phenylalanine.  Nateglinide  is  not  structurally  related  to sulphonylureas. However, the mechanism of action is similar: nateglinide is an insulin secretagogue, decreasing blood glucose levels. 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Composition Trazec film-coated tablets are available in 60 mg, 120 mg and 180 mg strengths containing nateglinide INN  as  the  active  substance.  In  addition  to  the  active  substance,  the  film-coated  tablets  contain standard  excipients  that  are  commonly  used  in  solid  oral  dosage  forms,  chiefly  lactose  and microcrystalline cellulose. The remaining core ingredients are croscarmellose sodium, povidone and magnesium stearate. The primary packaging consists of a thermoformed blister using rigid plastic films, PVC/PE/PVDC backed  with  a  heat-sealable  lacquered  aluminium  foil:  thermolacquer/aluminium/external  protective coating. Active substance Nateglinide  is  N-(trans-4-Isopropylcyclohexanecarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine,  a  chiral  molecule  which has no structural resemblance to other antidiabetic drugs. It  is  manufactured by a third party and information was supplied in the form of an open and closed DMF.  The  process  validation  and  investigation  of  potential  critical  parameters  was  satisfactory  to assure a consistent good quality and purity of the active substance. Proof  of  structure  and  chirality  was  demonstrated  in  the  usual  way  with  physicochemical  and spectroscopic data. Two polymorphic forms are known, therefore, the most stable form was chosen for development of the finished product. The crystal form is confirmed using powder X-ray diffractiometry and infrared absorption spectrum.  The X-ray diffraction method can detect the least stable form at the 5% level, which has no impact on bioavailability. The specification includes tests for identity (IR, and  powder X-ray diffraction), assay by HPLC (98102 %), optical rotation, heavy metals, related substances by HPLC methods, loss on drying etc. Since nateglinide  has  a  low  solubility,  particle  size  is  also  controlled  by  laser  light  diffraction  and  the specification limits have been validated with reference to human biostudies. In general, impurities are observed only at low levels and the limits proposed in the specification are justified with reference to animal toxicology studies.

Batch analytical data were provided on 50 batches of active substance in total, the majority of which were pilot scale batches used in safety and bioequivalence studies and clinical trials. Good uniformity and compliance with the specification was demonstrated.

Nateglinide has good stability characteristics that were demonstrated in a number of studies carried out on three pilot-scale batches stored under ICH conditions, including light stress. Real time studies at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

25 ° C/60%RH were carried out over 48 months with accelerated studies carried out over 6 months. In summary the results support a 48-month retest period when stored at or below 30 ° C in polyethylene bags/fibre drums.

Other ingredients

All tablet core excipients comply with monographs in the Ph. Eur.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A  declaration  from  the  applicant  confirmed  that  magnesium  stearate  and  lactose  monohydrate  are manufactured in compliance with EU requirements concerning TSE. The film-coat (coating premix) components meet the requirement of the Ph. Eur. except ferric oxide which complies with the French monograph. Premixes (red, pink and yellow for the three strengths) are tested according to the Novartis in-house monograph, which is acceptable. Product development and finished product Due to the low solubility of the active substance, product development has included investigations into particle  size  and  polymorphism.  However,  since  the  most  stable  polymorph  H  is  manufactured  and assured by X-ray powder diffraction during testing of the active substance, polymorphism should not be a problem. The impact of the particle size distribution of the nateglinide substance on drug product dissolution was  investigated.  Results  from  three  ranges  of  particle  size  showed  that  the  rate  of  dissolution  is independent of particle size  and  therefore  support  the  particle size  specification  as  proposed  by  the manufacturer. Excipients are standard ingredients in tablet formulation and used at typical range of concentration. The  choice  was  based  on  compatibility  studies  results,  where  the  drug  substance  showed  excellent compatibility  with  all  excipients  including  binary  or  ternary  mixtures  (storage  at  50°C  in  dry  and humid conditions for 2 months). Bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  the  final  formulation  proposed  for  marketing  to demonstrate equivalence to the pivotal clinical formulation. Concerning bioequivalence between different strengths, a high degree of inter-subject variability was noted, which led to additional studies being performed with increased numbers of subjects using the 60 mg and 180 mg products. Results indicated satisfactory bioequivalence in terms of AUC and Cmax. The  manufacturing  process  is  uncomplicated  but  has  been  validated  and  is  controlled  by  means  of relevant in-process tests. Evidence of satisfactory GMP status has been presented for the intended site of manufacture for marketing. The specification is comprehensive and includes tests for identity, assay  dissolution, uniformity of content ( Ph.Eur.) and impurities. Stability of the Product Stability studies were carried out on 7 pilot-scale batches of product at several sites of manufacture, including the site proposed for marketing, carried out under ICH conditions. Twelve-month data were available at the time of submission of the dossier. As may be expected from the stability profile of the active substance, very little degradation was observed during these studies, and no significant physical changes.  A  matrix  program  allowed  for  full  testing  of  all  batch/package/strengths  at  12,  24  and 36 months.  Since  nateglinide  tablets  have  been  shown  to  be  stable  with  minimal  batch-to-batch variability, it is considered that data pooling from the matrix design gives satisfactory information for use in determining the shelf-life, in line with current CPMP/QWP guidance on this issue.

Results of these studies support the shelf-life as proposed in the SPC, i.e. 2 years when stored at or below 30°C in the original packing.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Overall,  the  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  information  presented  in  this  application  dossier  was detailed and well presented, and provided extensive validation in all relevant critical areas for both the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

active substance and the finished product. Only very minor quality issues are not completely resolved at the time of the opinion, but these have no impact on the benefit/risk ratio and would not present a barrier to authorisation of the product.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic studies in animals are of good quality and compliance with GLP is satisfactory. · In vitro studies Receptor binding studies Several in-vitro competitive  binding/displacement  studies  demonstrated  that  the  binding  affinity  of nateglinide was lower than that of glibenclamide and repaglinide for the sulphonylurea (SU) receptor. The  SU  receptor  consists  of  a    ligand-binding  moiety  (SUR1)  and  KIR  6.2.  (an  ATP-sensitive  K+ channel). The interaction of a ligand with the SU receptor produces the depolarisation of the beta cell followed by a calcium influx into the beta cell through voltage-sensitive channels, with subsequent insulin release. · In vivo studies Electrophysiology and ion flux measurements Results of patch-clamp studies of single rat pancreatic beta-cells showed that the effect of nateglinide is  rapid  and  reversed  upon  removal of the compound. Nateglinide was less potent than repaglinide, glimepiride  or  glibenclamide  whereas  the  potency  of  nateglinide  was  increased  (3-fold)  with increasing glucose levels. The effects of nateglinide compared to repaglinide, glimepiride and glibenclamide on the membrane potential  of  rat  pancreatic  beta-cells  were  also  studied  in  the  presence  of  metabolic  inhibitors.  The IC50  value  for  closure  of  K + channels  of  nateglinide  was  over  400-fold  lower  in  the  presence  of metabolic inhibitors; Ion flux experiments showed that stimulation of the L-type Ca ++ channel and inhibition of the delayed rectifier  K v K + channels  were  only  observed  at  high  doses  with  reduced  magnitude  of  effects,  thus direct effects are not thought to contribute to the overall response of nateglinide. Insulin secretion/kinetics of insulin secretion The effects of nateglinide on insulin release were confirmed from studies on isolated Langerhans islets and  beta-cells  lines  and  compared  with  other  insulinotropic  agents  (repaglinide,  glibenclamide  and tolbutamide). Similar glucose sensitizing effects were also demonstrated in studies using rat pancreatic beta-cells; nateglinide left-shifted the glucose dose-response curve for insulin release and acted as a sensitizer of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. No effect of nateglinide on glucagon secretion was observed at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Kinetics of insulin release ( in-vitro and in-vivo studies) The kinetics of nateglinide on hormone secretion were studied using pancreas preparations, islets and in in  vivo studies  (Cynomolgus  monkey).  Nateglinide  stimulated  insulin  release  with  a  preferential effect on the early phase of insulin release while repaglinide and glipizide have a slower and longer insulinotropic effect.

In rat models of type 2 diabetes or in rats fed with a high fat diet (pre-meal dosing), gliclazide and nateglinide  had  similar  initial  efficacy  followed  by  increase  over  time  with  nateglinide  whereas  it decreased with gliclazide. The pancreatic content of insulin was higher at the end of the study with nateglinide; nateglinide stimulated insulin release only during meals.

## Selectivity of beta-cells versus cardiac and vascular KATP + channels

Nateglinide  had  higher  selectivity  on  K + ATP  channels  of  the  pancreatic  beta-cell  compared  to  other hypoglycaemic agents (glibenclamide, repaglinide).

## · General and safety pharmacology programme

General  pharmacodynamic  studies  with  nateglinide  showed  only  non  specific  effects  on  blood pressure and gastrointestinal tract at high doses.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Summary of salient findings Pharmacodynamic activity of nateglinide has been demonstrated in respect of the proposed indication. Nateglinide appears to have a short-lived action on the early phase of insulin secretion. Pharmacokinetics Nateglinide  is  rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  administration  in  all  species.  The  extent  of  absorption  is independent of the dose or the frequency of dosing. Comparisons  of  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human  data  showed  that  exposure  in  rodents  was considerably  lower  than  that  in  humans,  whilst  in  dogs  exposure  was  greater.  Bioavailability  in animals increased in a dose-dependent manner suggestive of saturable first-pass metabolism. Multiple dosing resulted in increased exposure to radioactivity in rats and dogs. Nateglinide  was  extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins  in  all  species.  The  potential  for  drug-drug interaction in relation to protein binding with nateglinide seems low as in vitro studies showed that the binding  of  nateglinide  to  plasma  proteins  was  not  affected  by  furosemide,  propranolol,  captopril, nicardipine,  pravastatin,  glibenclamide,  warfarin,  phenytoin,  tolbutamide,  or  metformin;  nateglinide did  not  affect  protein  binding  of  these  compounds.  High  concentrations  of  salicylic  acid    and acetylsalicylic acid  increased the free fraction of nateglinide. These concentrations may correspond to the anti-inflammatory doses used sometimes in rheumatology, however the increase in concentration of the free drug would result in an increase in clearance, with only small resulting effect on plasma glucose. After administration of radiolabelled nateglinide, radioactivity was distributed throughout the body.  Organs  showing  tissue  levels  higher  than  that  in  blood  were  the  liver,  kidney,  pancreas  and mesenteric lymph nodes in the rat; and kidney, liver, heart and lung in the dog. Nateglinide  and  its  metabolites  pass  through  the  placenta.  Concentrations  in  the  uterus,  ovaries, placenta, and mammary glands were 15-34% of plasma levels. The concentrations of radioactivity in fetal tissues and amniotic fluid were lower than that in the placenta. The exposure of  the fetus was low, but sufficient for fetuses to be actually exposed in reproduction studies. Nateglinide is excreted in the milk of female rats; the milk to plasma ratio of AUC0-48h was 1.4. All metabolites found in humans are also present in animal species used in the toxicology programme. The  only  pharmacologically  active  metabolite  is  M7  that  is  as  potent  as  the  parent  compound. However,  in  view  of  the  low  levels  in  humans,  M7  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  the  overall pharmacological activity in vivo . In  rats,  biliary  and  renal  excretion  accounts  for  equal  amounts  of  the  dose  whilst  in  dogs  and  mice biliary excretion predominates. The renal route is the principal route of excretion in humans. The  major  metabolic  pathway  in  humans  is  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  the  isopropyl  side  chain, which  is  catalysed  primarily  by  cytochrome  (CYP)  P450  isoform  2C9,  with  lesser  involvement  of CYP3A4. CYP2C9 is predicted to be 2- to 8-fold more active than CYP3A4 in nateglinide metabolism in vivo. Toxicology

All toxicology studies were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP  regulations  and  appropriate guidelines.

- Single dose toxicity

Acute  toxicity  was  assessed  using  oral  route  in  rats  and  dogs,  and  i.v.  injection  in  mice  and  dogs. Toxicity of nateglinide was low, but female rodents were more sensitive than males. In mice, the LD50

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was 200-400 mg/kg (iv); convulsions were observed at 400 mg/kg. In rats, the LD50 was &gt; 2000 mg/kg with salivation,  mumbling and decreased locomotor activity observed at high doses. In dogs (oral), vomiting was observed in the high-dose groups.

- Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated dose toxicity studies with a duration of up to 52 weeks were performed in mice, rats and dogs.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Occasional increases in liver enzymes  were  reported in rats and dogs at high doses with histopathological  changes  in  the  liver  in  the  dog.  These  abnormalities  were  reversible  and  were attributed to extensive biliary excretion of nateglinide metabolites in the dog. The other target organ was the  gastrointestinal  tract  (with  mostly  gastric  erosions  and  ulcers)  in  rats  and  dogs.  The  safety ratio (AUC) for gastric ulcers was about 8. · Reproduction studies Studies were performed in rats and rabbits. There was no sign of teratogenesis in rats. Gall bladder agenesis and small gall bladders were observed in rabbit fetuses. A significant difference was observed between the group treated with the highest dose of nateglinide and the non treated group (p&lt;0.05). Gallbladder agenesis was not considered as a spontaneous finding exacerbated by maternal toxicity in New Zealand White rabbits. The plasma / milk ratio was 1.4. Nateglinide is contra-indicated during pregnancy and breast-feeding, and this has been mentioned in the SPC). · Genotoxicity Nateglinide was not genotoxic in the standard test battery. · Carcinogenic potential The carcinogenic potential of nateglinide was assessed using dietary administration to mice and rats in 2-year studies. In the first carcinogenicity study in rats, an increased incidence of benign pancreatic islet cell tumours was observed in females at the highest dose level. This was not confirmed in the second carcinogenicity study using 5-fold higher doses. Nateglinide had no carcinogenic potential in mice. However, peripheral neuropathy was observed after 78 weeks in females mostly (up to 60 % of the females treated at intermediate and high doses levels). Additional studies were performed to investigate the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy in mice, and the potential of nateglinide to stimulate beta cell division in the pancreas of rats. The  neuropathy  lesions  were  characterised  by  axonal  degeneration  and  Schwann  cell  proliferation; these  lesions  have  been  reported  in  untreated  aged  mice  of  this  strain  (B6C3F1).  The  safety  ratio (AUC)  for  neuropathy  was  about  6.  There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  neuropathy  in nateglinide-treated mice in 5 additional studies (up to 78 weeks of treatment), nor in rats and dogs. Neuropathy was attributed to increase incidence of spontaneous lesions in aged mice treated at doses higher than the MTD. Statistical analysis of pancreatic islet tumour  incidence  revealed a trend however,  statistical significance was not attained in a pairwise comparison against controls. A study investigating potential excessive stimulation of the pancreas by nateglinide was performed at doses greater than those used in the carcinogenicity study; there was no increase in tumour incidence.

## · Special toxicity studies

In  rabbits,  it  was  shown  that  nateglinide  was  not  an  ocular  irritant.  In  addition,  nateglinide  did  not produce haemolysis and is devoid of antigenic potential.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was no evidence of potentially additive or synergistic toxic effects of nateglinide in combination with other hypoglycaemic agents (glibenclamide, glipizide and voglibose).

The toxicity of major metabolites was not found to differ from that of nateglinide.

## · Impurities

The applicant has set appropriate limits for impurities.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment has been performed and no effects from the therapeutic use of nateglinide are expected. Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects The ability  of  nateglinide  to  stimulate  insulin  release  rapidly  with  a  preferential  effect  on  the  early phase  was  demonstrated  in  rodents  and  a  primate  model  of  early  type  2  diabetes  (Cynomolgus monkey). It was shown that nateglinide acts via the sulphonylurea receptor but may differ from other agents mainly by the early onset and short effect duration. General pharmacodynamic studies showed that nateglinide produces non-specific responses on blood pressure and the gastrointestinal tract at very high doses. Nateglinide  has  low  acute  toxicity  potential.  In  chronic  toxicity  studies,  the  target  organs  were  the gastro-intestinal tract with gastric erosions and ulcerations, and the liver with occasional increases in enzymes in rats and dogs. A sufficient safety margin based on exposure was present in both cases. In reproduction  studies, there was  no  relevant  effect of nateglinide on  fertility,  embryofetal development, parturition, lactation, and perinatal development in rats. In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a higher incidence of foetuses with no gallblader was observed. Nateglinide  is  not  genotoxic.  The  mouse  carcinogenicity  study  showed  an  increased  incidence  of peripheral  neuropathy  in  females  treated  at  doses  exceeding  the  maximum  tolerated  dose.  This  was considered  as  spontaneous  lesions  occurring  in  this  strain  at  toxic  doses  rather  than  a  direct  toxic effect. An increased incidence of benign pancreatic islet cell tumours was observed in male rats at high doses. The safety ratio for human use is considered acceptable thus the findings are not considered clinically relevant for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. 4. Clinical aspects Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease characterised by increased peripheral insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion. It has been suggested though not yet confirmed that agents e.g., glucose, amino acids, gastrointestinal peptides, and sulphonylureas share a final common mechanism. This is characterised  by  a  reduction  of  negative  cell  potential  leading  to  changes  in  calcium  flux  and triggering exocytosis. This was the basis for developing nateglinide, an amino acid derivative. Other  pharmacological  agents  for  type  2  diabetes  act  by  improving  glucose  sensitivity  (e.g., metformin), reducing glucose uptake (acarbose), improving insulin secretion (sulphonylureas, repaglinide), or insulin substitution (exogenous insulin). Nateglinide has been studied in 41 clinical pharmacology studies in over 800 subjects and patients, and in 12 double-blind controlled clinical trials in over 3000 patients.

## Clinical pharmacology

Clinical pharmacology studies have been carried out in healthy volunteers, renal and hepatic patients and in type 2 diabetic patients.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Dynamic studies Nateglinide increased plasma insulin concentrations and decreased mealtime plasma glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. In type 2 diabetic patients, nateglinide in oral doses of 30 to 240 mg administered 10 min before meals induced a rapid insulin response (35 min); the maximum decrease was seen for the 120-mg dose. When  compared  to  glibenclamide  and  repaglinide,  the  insulinotropic  effect  of  nateglinide  was characterised by a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Nateglinide at 120 mg dose significantly decreased the 2-h incremental glucose compared to placebo and glibenclamide. In the event of a missed meal, glucose nadirs were significantly lower in the glibenclamide than in the nateglinide  treatment group. Moreover, hyperinsulinaemia was more prolonged (4 h to 8 h post-dose) after treatment with glibenclamide compared to nateglinide and placebo treatments  (1 to 4 h). The  combination  with  metformin  produced  significant  reductions  in prandial  plasma  glucose excursions than either drug alone; the enhanced effects are likely due to a combination of increased insulin levels and improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. Pharmacodynamic effects were similar in diabetic patients to those of healthy volunteers. Primary and secondary pharmacodynamics have been well investigated. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide were investigated in healthy volunteers, type 2 diabetic patients and patients with impaired renal and liver function. Nateglinide was administered as tablets of 60 mg to  180  mg  strength,  or  as  a  solution  for  intravenous  injection  in  some  studies.  One  study  was performed with 14 C-labelled nateglinide. Plasma concentrations of nateglinide were mainly determined using HPLC method with UV detection. The analytical method has been adequately validated and showed satisfactory accuracy and precision. The limit of quantification was 50 ng/ml (or lower); the interassay variability was &lt; 10%. · Absorption No differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between healthy volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Nateglinide exhibited a constant absorption rate over the dose range of 30 to 120 mg. Nateglinide mean AUC and Cmax increased linearly with dose and no accumulation after repeated dosing was observed. Table 1. AUC and Cmax of various doses of nateglinide (given three times daily) After  administration  of  an  oral  dose  of  120  mg  and  an  i.v.  dose  of  60  mg  in  10 mn  the  absolute availability was about 75 % indicating a modest first-pass effect. Influence of food

The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide were studied in healthy volunteers with respect to effect of food, meal composition, meal timing, gastric emptying, and in type 2 diabetics, effect of food, and missed meals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These results indicated that nateglinide should be administered before meals because of lower Cmax and Tmax when given immediately after food. This is reflected in the SPC. Meal composition did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of nateglinide.

## · Distribution

The Vd of nateglinide was about 10.5 l. Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to serum albumin. The protein binding of the metabolites was not studied.

## Children

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Elimination Nateglinide is extensively eliminated by metabolism by the mixed-function oxidase system (CYP 2C9 and 3A4). The main metabolites (M1, M2, and M3) result from hydroxylation of the isopropyl sidechain, either on the methyl carbon (M1), or one of the methyl groups (M2, M3). The main metabolites are about 5-6 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, except for minor metabolite M7. Total clearance was 7.36 l/h and elimination half-life was 1.3 hour. The pharmacokinetics of the metabolites have not been studied. The relative systemic exposure of metabolites to parent drug was 9% for M1 and 3-4% for  other.  Urinary  excretion  is  the  primary  elimination  route  of  nateglinide,  as  unchanged  drug  for about  16%.  Significant  tubular  secretion  is  likely  assuming  the  absence  of  any  passive  tubular reabsorption. Only 10% of radiolabelled nateglinide dose was recovered in the faeces. · Interaction studies Medicinal  products  that  are  commonly  used  in  type  2  diabetic  patients  have  been  evaluated  and relevant doses were used in all interaction studies. Drug-drug interactions via metabolic induction or inhibition  of  the  cytochrome  P-450  enzymes  (in  particular  CYP2C9)  may  be  expected  with nateglinide.  As  the  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  nateglinide  have  not  been  completely characterised, there is a risk for increased exposure to nateglinide during concomitant medication with inhibitors of cytochrome P450, especially CYP2C9 inhibitors. This could result in a more prolonged effect and possibly increased risk of hypoglycaemia. This has been mentioned in the SPC. No interactions were demonstrated when nateglinide was concomitantly administered with diclofenac (CYP2C9), warfarin (CYP 2C9 and 3A4), digoxin, troglitazone (CYP 3A4 inducer), metformin and glibenclamide. No study was performed with oral contraceptives. · Special populations Renal impairment A  study was performed in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment  (CrCL:  1550 ml/min/1.73m²)  receiving  120  mg.  In  moderate/severe  renal  impairment  patients,  the  mean pharmacokinetic parameters of nateglinide were comparable to those of healthy subjects; in type 1 or 2 diabetic subjects on haemodialysis (when compared to healthy controls) the mean Cmax decreased by 49 % , which is considered clinically relevant and could result in a loss of efficacy. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, dose adjustment may be necessary as recommended in the SPC. Hepatic impairment The  pharmacokinetics  of  120  mg  nateglinide  were  studied  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh classification 5-11) compared to healthy volunteers; nateglinide plasma AUC increased by 30% and Cmax by 37%. Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication to the use of nateglinide. Elderly No pharmacokinetic study was performed in elderly.

The pharmacokinetics of nateglinide have not been studied in children. This is acceptable as type 2 diabetes in children is rare.

## Other populations

No specific studies were performed as regards gender, or race. A kinetic population analysis did not indicate the need for dose adjustment according to the BMI, race or gender.

- Bioequivalence studies:

Six studies were carried out under fasting conditions and the results showed that the tablets used in clinical trials were bioequivalent to those intended for marketing.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Clinical efficacy The  clinical  trials  were  performed  according  to  GCP  standards  and  agreed  international  ethical principles. Dose-response studies and main clinical studies Dose response studies The  results  of  phase  I  studies  led  to  the  selection  of  a  30-180  mg  dose  range.  Study  P116  was  a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. It showed that the 60-mg and 120-mg doses were more effective than the 30 mg, and both were similarly effective when administered three times daily, before meals. Two trials were performed to establish the effective doses of nateglinide. Study B202 was a 12-week randomised, double blind,  placebo-controlled,  fixed-dose,  parallel-group  comparison  of  the  efficacy and  safety  of  four  fixed  doses  of  nateglinide  in  289  patients  (HbA1c  and  FPG  were  the  primary efficacy  parameters).  Study  B302  was  carried  out  in  697  patients  (HbA1c  was  the  primary  efficacy parameter). In  studies  B  202  and  B302,  both  HbA1c  and  FPG  decreased  in  the  nateglinide  60  to  180  mg  dose groups  compared  to  baseline  values.  A  linear  dose  response  relationship  was  observed  with nateglinide. Statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (%) were obtained for the 120 and 180 mg doses only of about 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. Changes in FPG (mmol/l) were observed with a maximum decrease of 1.0 for the 120 mg dose. The 180-mg dose was associated with further reductions in HbA1c and FPG in study B302, but not in study B202. The proposed doses of 60-180 mg are justified as the maximal effect on HbA1c and plasma glucose was observed with these doses. However, the initial dose in combination with metformin should be 60 mg as the effect is additive and hypoglycaemia has been observed when patients were randomised to  a  120-mg  dose.  The  rationale  for  three  times  daily  administration  is  based  on  pharmacodynamic results showing that nateglinide increases insulin release after meals. The 180-mg dose did not provide significant improvement in glycaemic control compared to 120 mg, however there might be a benefit for some patients after titration in clinical practice.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Active comparators were accepted reference agents such as metformin and troglitazone. However, the comparison with troglitazone is of little support because troglitazone is not marketed in Europe and has been withdrawn from the market in the US due to hepatic toxicity. There was no comparison with sulphonylureas such as gliclazide and glipizide, nor with repaglinide; the combination of nateglinide and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors was not studied. 1. Primary endpoints For all Phase III trials except B355 the primary efficacy endpoint was HbA1c. In some trials, FPG was considered as a co-primary endpoint. Baseline was the average of the last 2 measurements from the run-in period. Responders were defined as patients having a reduction of HbA1c &gt; 10% from baseline. In B355 the primary endpoint was post-prandial glucose excursion. Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  FPG,  fasting  insulin,  post-prandial  glucose  (except  B355), post-prandial  insulin,  C-peptide,  lipids  (i.e.,  total  cholesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides). Fructosamine, an estimate of mean glycaemia over the past 2-3 weeks was measured in B202, B302 and B355. 2. Statistical analysis The  primary  analysis  of  efficacy  considered  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  including  all randomised patients who had at least one valid observation for an efficacy variable. The significance level  was  5%.  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  used  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF) approach for those patients who did not complete the final week efficacy assessment. An ANCOVA model  including  effects  for  treatment,  centre,  baseline  HbA1c,  treatment  by  centre  interaction,  and treatment by baseline HbA1c interaction was fitted. Secondary efficacy variables considered the ITT population using a similar model as specified for the primary analysis model, and LOCF approach. In studies 201, 251 and 252, sample size calculations were based on a clinically relevant difference of 1 unit in HbA1c (a standard deviation of 1.5 absolute units), 5 % type 1 error, and 80 % power. In other studies, the standard deviation was 1.3 with other similar criteria. 3. Study populations/accountability of patients Diabetic patients included had a mean baseline HbA1c ranging from 7.98% - 8.48%. Patients included were of above 65 years of age (30.3 %), 5.6 % were over 75 years; the mean weight was 84.7 kg and the mean BMI, 29.1 kg/m². Patients were treated by diet (65 %) and oral hypoglycaemic agents (19.5 % with glibenclamide and 16 % with metformin), without satisfactory glycaemic control.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Four placebo-controlled trials B202, B302, B351 and B356 have been carried out. All patients in these studies  inadequately  controlled  by  diet  and  exercise.  However,  29-46%  of  patients  were  on  oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) 2 months prior to randomisation . In two of these trials, the efficacy of nateglinide 120 mg in combination with metformin (B351) or troglitazone (B356) was also studied. In study B 351, the mean HbA1c concentration at baseline ranged from 8.27% to 8.43 %, and in study B356 from 8.1% to 8.4%. Table 3. Changes in HbA1c (%) values (B202, B302, B351, B356) *Statistically significantly change from baseline (p&lt;0.05); ** Statistically significantly different from placebo Table 4. Changes in FPG (µmol/l) values (B202, B302, B351 and B356)

* Statistically significantly change from baseline (p&lt;0.05); ** Statistically significantly different from placebo

Results showed a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) and dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c and FPG at endpoint in the nateglinide groups compared to placebo; the reduction in HbA1c ranged from -0.3 to 1%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No significant effect related to BMI on the magnitude of the change in HbA1c was observed.

## · Analysis of responders

In study B302 responders were defined as the patients having a reduction of HbA1c ≥ 10% compared to baseline, and the number of patients having HbA1c ≤ 8% at week 24 with baseline &gt; 8.5%. Results showed that 38% of patients on nateglinide had a reduction ≥ 10  % compared to 16 % on placebo; 46 % of patients on nateglinide had HbA1c ≤ 8% compared to 23 % on placebo.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Active comparator trials Three trials were performed versus metformin (B351), glibenclamide (B355), and troglitazone (B356), respectively. Table 5. Study B351, change in HbA1c (%, ITT population) * statistically significant change from baseline (p&lt;0.05) Metformin monotherapy) produced greater reductions in HbA1c and in FPG than nateglinide although a submaximal dose of metformin 500 mg tid (metformin can be titrated up to 2000-2500 mg/day) was used. Study B355 used forced titration and comparison with glibenclamide using Sustacal challenge. Post prandial glucose excursion (PPGE) was calculated as the area under the pre-prandial and post-Sustacal plasma glucose-time curve between 0 and 4 hours (AUC 0-4 h). Nateglinide  (120  mg)  was  significantly  more  effective  than  glibenclamide  (5/10  mg  once  daily)  or placebo in decreasing PPGE, but less effective than glibenclamide of FPG; however, HbA1c was not measured in this study. No study was performed with other sulphonylureas (e.g., glipizide, gliclazide) and no conclusion can be drawn on the efficacy of nateglinide compared to a sulphonylurea. The reduction in HbA1c was less with nateglinide 120 mg tid than with troglitazone after 16 weeks of treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (-0.55 and -0.75, respectively). No clinical trial was performed versus repaglinide but a comparative pharmacodynamic study  showed that the insulinotropic effect of nateglinide had a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of action than that of repaglinide (0.5 and 2 mg). Switch from other oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents Nateglinide monotherapy was studied after switching from glibenclamide in patients not adequately controlled by glibenclamide (10 mg /day, study B304), and from glibenclamide in patients previously treated with a metformin-glibenclamide combination (study B252).

It was concluded that patients inadequately controlled by glibenclamide 10 mg cannot be switched to nateglinide as glibenclamide was significantly more effective than nateglinide.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  a  phase  II  study  of  patients  previously  treated  with  a  metformin/glibenclamide  combination,  the switch  from  glibenclamide  to  placebo  or  nateglinide  60  mg,  or  nateglinide  120  mg  led  to  a deterioration of glycaemic control in all treatment groups.

Overall, nateglinide was less effective than glibenclamide administered alone or in combination with metformin.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Efficacy in combination The  efficacy  of  nateglinide  was  studied  in  combination  with  metformin  (B351,  B354),  with sulphonylureas (B251), and with troglitazone (B356). Table 6. Combination with metformin : adjusted mean changes in HbA1c. The rationale of using the combination of nateglinide+metformin in patients previously treated with diet only was not justified. However, an add-on affect was observed on HbA1c, FPG and PPGE. Study  B354 was  performed  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  prior  metformin  monotherapy (1000 mg bid) and diet. Table 7. HbA1c adjusted (least square means) changes (ITT population) * statistically significant at the 0.05 level after Dunnet's adjustment for multiple comparisons This study was correctly designed to assess the efficacy of nateglinide in combination with sufficient doses  of  metformin  in  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  metformin  alone.  The  addition  of nateglinide improved glycaemic control. Combination with glibenclamide (B251) Table 8. HbA1c (%) values (ITT population)

In  patients  previously  treated  with  glibenclamide,  the  addition  of  nateglinide  did  not  significantly reduce HbA1c levels.

No specific trials were performed in children or adolescents, or pregnant women. The absence of data in  children  or  adolescents  less  than  18  years  old  is  acceptable  as  type  2  diabetes  is  rare  in  this population.

Medicinal product no longer authorised * statistically significant change from baseline (p&lt;0.05) Combination with troglitazone had a synergistic effect on HbA1c. · Long-term efficacy Three one-year extension trials were performed (B351E, B202E, B251E). A total of 719 patients were enrolled  in  these  studies,  with  301  patients  exposed  to  nateglinide  monotherapy,  and  234  to nateglinide combination. Table 10. Change in HbA1c  in completers for nateglinide alone or in combination (B351E,B202E and B251E). In  combination  with  metformin,  the  additive  effect  was  maintained  over  time.  In  combination  with glibenclamide,  nateglinide  60  or  120  mg  plus  glibenclamide  (10  mg)  did  not  produce  clinical improvement in glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled on glibenclamide alone. Clinical studies in special populations No clinical trial was performed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. No specific clinical trial was performed in elderly. However, a total of 975 patients ≥ 65 years were included  in  the  trials,  436  exposed    to  nateglinide  monotherapy  and  193  to  the  combination  with metformin. Pooling of trials B302 and B351 showed that age did not affect efficacy of nateglinide.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

From dose-ranging trials, 60 mg appeared to be the minimal effective dose and 180 mg the maximal effective dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The methodology used in the clinical trials was appropriate. The ITT population include patients who all randomised patients with at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation; this may have introduce a bias but fortunately the number of patients excluded before providing efficacy data was low and hence the  bias  is  considered  unimportant.  Adjustment  for  multiple  comparisons  was  used  but  as  most comparisons made were significant, multiple comparison was not a problem and interpretation of raw p values is safe.

Medicinal product no longer authorised As monotherapy, nateglinide efficacy (60 to 180 mg tid) was significantly greater than placebo with evidence of dose response. The 120-mg dose of nateglinide was found to be superior to the 60 mg, but in one out of 2 studies, the 180-mg dose did not lead to greater reductions in HbA1c compared to 120 mg. Nateglinide monotherapy decreased HbA1c (%) by 0.45-1.02 after 16 or 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. Nateglinide (120 mg tid) was clearly less effective than metformin 500 mg tid in patients treated by diet only. Nateglinide appears to be more effective than glibenclamide although the comparison was only made on PPGE only and not on HbA1c. No adequate study was performed comparing nateglinide with other SUs. Nateglinide was not compared to repaglinide or an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. The glycaemic control of patients stabilised on SUs worsened when switched on nateglinide. Overall, the efficacy of nateglinide as monotherapy was less than that of both reference products used as  first  line  therapy  in  type  2  diabetes.  Monotherapy  results  suggested  loss  of  effect  over  time (especially on FPG, in study B302, 354 and extension B351) after initial improvement. In  combination  in  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  metformin  monotherapy,  the  addition  of nateglinide (60 mg or 120 mg tid) produced a significant decrease in HbA1c compared to metformin monotherapy. In patients previously treated with SUs, nateglinide (120 mg tid) combined with glibenclamide did not improve HbA1c. The absence of additive effect may be expected as these two compounds share the same  mechanism  of  action.  In  patients  previously  treated  with  a  metformin  and  glibenclamide combination, the switch from glibenclamide to nateglinide 60 mg, or 120 mg led to a deterioration of glycaemic control in all treatment groups. The  combination  of  nateglinide  (120  mg  tid)  with  troglitazone  resulted  in  a  synergistic  effect  on HbA1c. However, troglitazone is not marketed in Europe and has been withdrawn from the US market because of hepatic toxicity. The combination of metformin and nateglinide has not been compared to the widely used combination of metformin and SU in patients not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. This was not requested by the CPMP in their scientific advice of April 1996. Clinical safety Patient exposure The safety analysis was performed on a total of 3156 patients, including all patients randomised in clinical data available with safety assessment post baseline, as of 30 June 1999. This does not include the placebo-controlled study B356 and ongoing clinical trials. Table 11. Distribution of patients in the studies

- -asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia  with  the  same  values  for  blood  glucose  in  the  absence  of symptoms.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A total of 2122 patients were exposed to nateglinide, 1441 (67.9%) to nateglinide monotherapy, 640 (30.2%) to the combination with metformin and 114 (5.4 %) with glibenclamide. Most of the patients were exposed to the treatment up to 6 months; 789 were exposed for at least 6 months, 190 received nateglinide for 1 year, 113 patients (7.8%) nateglinide monotherapy; 55 nateglinide + metformin; 22 nateglinide + glibenclamide. 420 patients were exposed to 60 mg, 740 to 120 mg, 230 to 180 mg. Among the 3352 patients exposed in the overall programme, 71 % were &lt; 65 years of age, 29 % (974) were ≥ 65 years, and 179 (5%) were ≥ 75 years of age. Adverse events and serious adverse event/deaths The most common adverse events (AEs) in the nateglinide and nateglinide+metformin group ( ≥ 3 % of patients) are summarised in table 17. Table 12. Adverse events in clinical trials (completed studies) Source: Adverse event CRF database The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups.  The  commonest  AEs  wee hypoglycaemia, URI, headache, sinusitis, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, back pain, and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea  was  less  frequent  in  the  nateglinide+metformin  than  in  the  metformin  group  (8.4%  and 12.3%, respectively). Following the preclinical findings in mice, a re-analysis of clinical data did not show any cause for concern as regards neuropathy. Hypoglycaemic reactions Hypoglycaemia (HG) was defined as follows: -any event suggestive of hypoglycaemia regardless of blood or plasma glucose level; -symptomatic events suggestive of hypoglycaemia and confirmed by a blood glucose &lt; 2.8 mmol/l (or plasma glucose equivalent ≤ 3.3 mmol/l);

- -a  grade  3  or  4  symptomatic  event  [each  event  was  rated  according  to  severity  on  a  clinical grading scale of 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (requiring assistance), to 4 (requiring hospitalisation)}.

## Monotherapy

In  completed  clinical  trials  of  the  initial  submission,  symptoms  of  hypoglycaemia  were  reported  in 10.4% of patients on nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% on nateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% on metformin monotherapy, 19.8% on glibenclamide monotherapy, and 4.1% on placebo.

The high incidence of hypoglycaemia in the glibenclamide group may have been related to the choice of this SU comparator. HG was considered as mild in nearly all patients. The only event classified as grade 3 was observed with a 30-mg dose. There was no grade-4 event. The incidence of confirmed HG was lower with nateglinide (2.4%) than with glibenclamide (7.2%). More episodes of hypoglycaemia were observed in patients randomised to 180 mg (17%) than to 120 mg (12.8%) or 60 mg (10.5%), but there was no increase in severity.

The majority of deaths were cardiovascular in nature: myocardial infarction (1 on nateglinide 30 mg, 3 on  glibenclamide  10  mg  and  1  post  study  (nateglinide  120  mg);  cardiac  arrest  (1  on  nateglinide 120 mg +metformin); tachycardia (1 on nateglinide 120 mg); sudden death (1 on nateglinide 60 mg +metformin); arteriosclerotic disease (1 patient on metformin 500 mg). The other causes of death were pancreas neoplasm malignant on metformin (1), hepatic failure on placebo (1), and car accident on nateglinide (1, it should be noted that the patient was not driving). None of the deaths was considered as related to treatment by the investigator and there is no indication of excess mortality for nateglinidetreated patients compared to other treated groups.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Combination therapy The incidence of HG, but not the timing of the event, was dose-dependent. Most occurred with 120 mg in patients with low HbA1c values at baseline. The risk of hypoglycaemia in patients whose baseline HbA1c is close to therapeutic target is mentioned in the SPC. When  blood  glucose  was  determined  following  the  occurrence  of  symptoms  of  hypoglycaemia, slightly fewer nateglinide-treated patients had very low blood doses values ( ≤ 3,3  mmol/l) compared to the sulphonylurea-treated patients. Cardiovascular safety Diabetic  patients  are  at  increased  risk  for  cardiovascular  events  and  this  was  monitored  in  the  12 controlled clinical trials. In addition, vital signs and ECGs were monitored. The incidence of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and coronary artery disease was comparable in all treated groups. In view of the data provided, there is no evidence for cardiovascular concern with nateglinide. Effect on body weight Weight gain during long-term therapy was not significant in nateglinide monotherapy treated patients (B202-E) or in combination with metformin (B351-E) or glibenclamide (B251-E). In study B351-E, the  mean  weight  gain  after  52  weeks  was  +1.2  kg,  +0.34  kg  and  -1.0  kg  in  the  nateglinide, nateglinide+metformin, and metformin groups, respectively. Deaths and serious adverse events Table 13.

## Serious adverse events

The most frequently reported SAEs were cardiovascular events such as angina pectoris and myocardial infarction,  neurological  and  musculoskeletal  disorders.  There  was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of SAE in the nateglinide-treated patients compared to the other groups.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The incidence of discontinuations for an AE in the nateglinide group was comparable to that of the placebo  group  (5.4%  and  6.1%  respectively).  In  all  completed  studies,  the  main  reasons  for nateglinide-treated patients to withdraw were fatigue (0.8%), and symptoms relating to hyperglycaemia (thirst (0.7%), polyuria (0.5%) and nocturia (0.3%)). Discontinuation for hypoglycaemia occurred in 0.3%. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation in the nateglinide plus  metformin  group  were  gastrointestinal  (nausea,  diarrhoea)  and  most  likely  attributable  to metformin. No  patient  had  abnormal  laboratory  test  as  primary  reason  for  discontinuation.  However,  in  study B202, one patient treated with nateglinide 180 mg withdrew because of an increase in gamma-GT, AST and ALT and this was considered as possibly related to study drug by the investigator; a patient treated in combination with metformin had a change in gamma-GT, AST and ALT from day 187 to 371. Laboratory findings Adequate laboratory follow up has been performed in clinical trials. Blood A small number of patients in the nateglinide and nateglinide plus metformin treatment groups had decreases  from  baseline  in  haematocrit,  however  these  anomalies  were  due  to  other  causes  (e.g., haemorrhaging ulcer). Liver function tests The proportion of patients meeting criteria for change in liver function tests (ALT, AST, Gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatases, and total bilirubin) was similar in the nateglinide, nateglinide + metformin and the  placebo  groups.  Twelve  patients  (8  on  nateglinide  monotherapy  and  4  on  combination)  had increases in liver function tests characterised by rises in ALT and/or AST (&gt;3 ULN) by day 30-93; enzyme values returned to normal in spite of continuing therapy with nateglinide in most cases. Lipids Table 14 summarises the evolution of lipid profile in all clinical trials. Table 14. Mean lipid changes from baseline according to treatment group.

There  were  no  differences  in  lipids  between  treatment  groups,  however , overall  increases  in triglycerides  and  lipids  were  observed  in  about  10  %  of  all  patients whatever  the  active  treatment. Further  analysis  according  to  the  baseline  level  of  fasting  lipids  showed  inconsistent  effects  of nateglinide.

## Safety in special populations

With  nateglinide (overall monotherapy  and  metformin  combination  groups)  the  incidence  of hypoglycaemia  was  higher  in  patients ≥ 75  years  (13.8%)    than  in  patients &lt; 65 years  (10.6%).  In patients ≥ 65 years treated with the nateglinide+metformin combination, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was higher (17.1%) than in patients &lt; 65 years (13.4%)

Nateglinide  has  low  acute  toxicity  potential.  In  chronic  toxicity  studies,  the  target  organs  were  the gastro-intestinal tract with gastric erosions and ulcerations, and the liver with occasional increases in enzymes  in  rats  and  dogs.  A  sufficient  safety  ratio  based  on  exposure  (AUC)  was  present  in  both cases.  Reproduction  studies  showed  no  relevant  effect  of  nateglinide  on  fertility,  embryofetal development, parturition, lactation, and perinatal development in rats. In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a higher incidence of foetuses with no gallblader was observed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Discussion on clinical safety There  is  a  sufficient  safety  database  for  nateglinide.  Withdrawals  for  AEs  were  primarily  due  to fatigue,  hypoglycaemia  and  symptoms  relating  to  hyperglycaemia,  especially  when  nateglinide  was combined to metformin. There was no excess mortality for nateglinide-treated patients compared to placebo or other oral antihyperglycaemic agents. The most common reported AEs in monotherapy were upper respiratory tract infection, hypoglycaemia, fatigue and headache. Adequate monitoring of cardiac function was performed in nateglinide clinical trials. There was no cardiovascular  safety  concern  raised  with  nateglinide.  No  concerns  were  identified  as  regards  liver function  tests  in  patients  receiving  nateglinide  and  no  specific  monitoring  of  liver  function  is recommended in the SPC. Inconsistent effects on lipids were observed. In  combination  studies  with  metformin,  more adverse events in the nateglinide 120-mg group were reported,  especially  hypoglycaemia  in  patient  whose  baseline  HbA1c was  near  therapeutic  target.  In these patients, the risk of hypoglycaemia has been mentioned in the SPC. In  combination  with  metformin,  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  was  found  in patients ≥ 65  years  compared  to  younger  patients.  Due  to  additive  effects  of  nateglinide  and metformin,  there  is  a  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  in  patients  receiving  this  combination,  especially  in elderly. For all patients, the recommended starting dose is 60 mg, this is included in the SPC. 5. Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation Quality The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Batch to batch consistency has been documented and the relevant test will be performed according to the agreed specifications. Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology The preclinical studies of nateglinide were of good quality. The ability  of  nateglinide  to  stimulate  insulin  release  rapidly  with  a  preferential  effect  on  the  early phase was demonstrated. It was shown that nateglinide acts via the sulphonylurea receptor but may differ from other agents. No concern was identified in safety pharmacodynamic studies. The  pharmacokinetics  of  nateglinide  were  well  investigated  in  relevant  species.  The  Applicant  has committed to study the role of CYP2C9 in the metabolism of nateglinide and the potential of CYP2C9 inhibitors to affect nateglinide pharmacokinetics in vivo.

Nateglinide is contra-indicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nateglinide was not genotoxic in the usual battery of tests. The mouse carcinogenicity study showed an increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy in females treated at doses exceeding the MTD. This was attributed to spontaneous lesions occurring in this strain at toxic doses rather than a direct toxic effect. An increased incidence of benign pancreatic islet cell tumours was observed in male rats at high doses,  possibly  due  to  hyperstimulation  of  insulin  release  by  nateglinide.  The  findings  were  not considered as a concern for therapeutic use in type 2 diabetes as the safety ratio for human use was considered acceptable.

The most commonly reported adverse events in monotherapy were upper respiratory tract infection, hypoglycaemia,  fatigue  and  headache.  There  was  no  cardiovascular  safety  concern  raised  with nateglinide. No  concerns  were  identified  as  regards  liver  function  tests  in  patients  receiving nateglinide  and  no  specific  monitoring  of  liver  function  is  recommended  in  the  SPC.  Inconsistent effects on lipids were observed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Efficacy In clinical trials, the dose of 60 mg three times daily (before main meals) appeared to be the minimal effective dose and 180 mg the maximal effective dose. As monotherapy, nateglinide efficacy on HbA1c (60 to 180 mg three times daily, tid) was significantly greater than placebo with evidence of dose response. Nateglinide monotherapy decreased HbA1c by 0.45-1.02% after 16-24 weeks of treatment. However,  the  efficacy  of  nateglinide  (120  mg  tid)  was  less  than  that  of  a  suboptimal  dose  of metformin (500 mg tid) in patients treated by diet only. Nateglinide was more efficacious than glibenclamide on PPGE, but less efficacious than glibenclamide on the basis of trial using FPG; HbA1c was not measured in this trial. No adequate study was performed comparing nateglinide with other SUs. The glycaemic control of patients stabilised on SUs and switched to nateglinide worsened on nateglinide. In addition, nateglinide was not compared to repaglinide or an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Overall, the efficacy of nateglinide as monotherapy was less than that of reference oral antidiabetics and results suggested a loss of effect over time. In patients not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, the addition of nateglinide (60 mg or 120  mg  tid)  to  metformin  produced  a  significant  decrease  in  HbA1c  compared  to  metformin monotherapy. In patients previously treated with SUs, nateglinide (120 mg tid) combined with glibenclamide did not improve HbA1c. In patients previously treated with a metformin and glibenclamide combination, the switch from glibenclamide to nateglinide 60 mg, or 120 mg led to a deterioration of glycaemic control in  all  treatment  groups.  Nateglinide  was  also  studied  in  combination  with  troglitazone,  however, troglitazone is not marketed in Europe and has been withdrawn from the US market due to hepatic toxicity. The combination of metformin and nateglinide has not been compared to the widely used combination of metformin and SU in patients not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. This was not requested by the CPMP in their scientific advice of April 1996. Some CPMP members considered that this information should be provided before the Marketing Authorisation, however the majority of the CPMP  considered  that  this  could  be  documented  after  granting  the  marketing  authorisation.  The Applicant has committed to document further the efficacy and safety of the combination of nateglinide plus metformin against a combination of metformin plus sulphonylurea. Safety A sufficient number of patients have been exposed to nateglinide in the safety database. Overall the safety profile was considered acceptable. Withdrawals for adverse events from clinical trials were due primarily  to  hypoglycaemia  and  related-symptoms,  especially  when  nateglinide  was  combined  to metformin. There is no excess mortality for nateglinide-treated patients compared to placebo or other oral antihyperglycaemic agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  combination  studies  with  metformin,  more adverse events in the nateglinide 120-mg group were reported,  especially  hypoglycaemia  in  elderly,  and  in  patients  whose  baseline  HbA1c was  near therapeutic target.

## Benefit/risk assessment

In combination therapy with metformin, nateglinide has demonstrated its efficacy and safety for the treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  patients  inadequately  controlled  despite  a  maximally  tolerated  dose  of metformin alone.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision that the benefit to risk profile of Trazec as combination therapy with metformin for type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone was favourable, and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
