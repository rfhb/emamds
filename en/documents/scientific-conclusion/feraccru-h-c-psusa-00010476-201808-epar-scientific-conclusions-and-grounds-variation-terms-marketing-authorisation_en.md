## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ferric maltol, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Faeces discolouration was observed in patients treated with ferric maltol in clinical trials. Black discolouration of the stool is a well-known ADR of oral iron formulations. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ferric maltol should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ferric maltol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ferric maltol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
