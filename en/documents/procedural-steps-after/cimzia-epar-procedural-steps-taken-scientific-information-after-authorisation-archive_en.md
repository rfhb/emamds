| II/0099 | Submission of the final report from study (RA0020 - RABBIT) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a nationwide prospective observational cohort study in Germany on the long-term safety and effectiveness of bDMARDs in rhumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, this submission includes a safety analysis across the 4 completed RA registries (ARTIS, NDB, BSRBR and RABBIT) as requested by EMA/PRAC in the final assessment report of Procedures EMEA/H/C/001037/II/0072, EMEA/H/C/001037/II/0081, and EMA/H/C/001037/II/0087. Based on this, revisions to the RMP summary of safety concerns and consequently the pharmacovigilance plan are proposed in line with GVP Module V Rev.2. An updated RMP version 19.1 is included. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission | 10/06/2021 | n/a        |      | The results of the RABBIT study showed a higher risk for serious hospitalised infections and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) for Cimzia compared to csDMARDs and a significantly reduced risk for all-cause mortality. The elevated infection risk and risk for NMSC was not confirmed by the sensitivity analysis. However, it was not possible to distinguish if this effect was caused by the reduced number of events or by elimination of residual confounding factors. Due to low numbers of patients with NMSC, these results are not conclusive and would need to be evaluated in larger studies. The risk of infection and NMSC are is already covered in the SmPC of Cimzia and other TNF-inhibitors. Overall, the results are in line with the known safety profile of Cimzia and suggest that the use of Cimzia for the treatment of RA patients in daily rheumatologic care is a safe and generally well tolerated option. |

| II/0087 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC in order to introduce a change in posology for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and to update the safety and efficacy information based on the results of the study AS0005 (C-OPTIMISE) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a multicentre, open-label (part A) followed by a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (part B) to evaluate maintenance of remission in subjects with active axSpA receiving either certolizumab pegol 200mg q2w or 200mg q4w as compared to placebo. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 17.0 has also been updated to reflect the completion of study AS0005 and update to list of safety concerns. In addition, the interim study reports AS0006 and AS0007 have been submitted to include additional pooled safety data in the SmPC. Study AS0006 is a phase 3, multicenter, randomised, placebo- controlled, double-blind study to evaluate efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol in subjects with active axSpA without x-ray evidence of ankylosing | 25/06/2020 | 27/07/2020 | SmPC and PL | Cimzia was studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) (including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non- radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week open- label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo- controlled phase (N=313) for patients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dose reduction and treatment withdrawal in patients in sustained remission. The percentage of patients who achieved sustained remission at Week 48 was 43.9% for the overall axSpA population, and was similar in the nr axSpA (45.3%) and AS (42.8%) subpopulations. Among the patients who were randomised in the second part of the study (N=313), a statistically significant (p <0.001, Non-responder Imputation (NRI)) greater proportion of patients did not experience a flare when continuing treatment with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (83.7%) or Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (79.0%) compared with treatment withdrawal (20.2%).

Study AS0007 is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the effects of certolizumab pegol on the reduction of anterior uveitis flares in aSpA subjects with a history of anterior uveitis (C-view). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |     | groups, was statistically significant (p<0.001 for each comparison) and clinically meaningful. In the placebo group, flares started approximately 8 weeks after Cimzia was withdrawn, with the majority of flares occurring within 24 weeks of treatment withdrawal. Patients who were in sustained remission at Week 48 had no or very low inflammation, and no meaningful increase in inflammation was observed at Week 96 irrespective of their treatment group. In the second part of the study, 70% (73/104) placebo- treated patients, 14% (15/105) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks and 6.7% (7/104) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks experienced a flare and were subsequently treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks. Based on the results from C-OPTIMISE, a dose reduction (200 mg every 4 weeks) in patients in sustained remission after one year of treatment with Cimzia may be considered. Withdrawal of Cimzia treatment is associated with a high risk of flare. Results from C-OPTIMISE also indicated that a reduction of the dose to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks did not change immunogenicity outcomes. No new safety signal   |

| II/0084/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the safety and efficacy information following the final results from studies PS0002 (CIMPASI-2), PS0003 (CIMPACT) and PS0005 (CIMPASI-1) listed as category 3 studies in the RMP; these are results from the open label treatment periods assessing the safety and efficacy of long term use of certolizumab pegol in psoriasis. The RMP version 16.0 has also been updated. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1.

Among patients who were Physician Global Assessment (PGA) clear or almost clear at Week 16 and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks (N=103 of 175) or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=95 of 186), the maintenance of response at Week 48 was 85.9% and 84.3% respectively. After an additional 96 weeks of open-label treatment (Week 144) the maintenance of response was evaluated. Twenty-one percent of all randomised subjects were lost to follow-up before Week 144. Approximately 27% of completer study subjects who entered the open-label treatment between weeks 48 to 144 on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks had their dose increased to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks for maintenance of response. In an analysis in which all patients with treatment failures were considered non-responders, the maintenance of response of the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks treatment group, for the respective endpoint, after an additional 96 weeks of open-label therapy, was 84.5% for PASI 75 for study subjects who were responders at Week 16 and 78.4% for PGA clear or almost clear.

In addition, the following information about quality of life, immunogenicity and safety are added in the SmPC: Improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index score were sustained or slightly decreased through Week 144. First occurrences of antibody positivity in the open-label treatment period were observed in 2.8% (19/668) of patients. The long-term safety profile of Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with Cimzia.                                           |

| II/0086 | Submission of the final report from study (UP0038) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a non-interventional post-authorisation safety study with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of Cimzia risk minimisation educational materials for healthcare professionals and patients. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 13/02/2020 | n/a | The overall objective of the post-authorisation safety study (UP0038) was to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational material risk minimisation measures being implemented in the EU in healthcare professionals (HCP) respondents who were prescribing and/or administering Cimzia and in patient respondents who were prescribed Cimzia. The focus of this review was the patient reminder card as the prescriber guide was removed from the educational material in January 2019. Of the 169 HCPs who completed the survey (147 rheumatologists, 22 rheumatology nurses), 113 (67%) indicated they received the patient reminder card. Of these, 107/113 (96%) read the patient card and 94/113 (83%) provided it to their patients. Among patients eligible for participation, 69/95 (73%) received the patient reminder |

Although the potential for selection bias must be acknowledged (i.e. only those receiving the patient card answering the survey), this is considered to be an acceptable proportion. Of the respondents, the majority read the patient card (63/69 patients, 91%) and understood its content (61/63 patients, 97%). All respondents considered the patient reminder card to be helpful in some way (somewhat, very or extremely). The survey also included a section capturing the patient recall of important safety information. This indicated that the patients were well aware of the most important safety concerns with Cimzia, such as infections (61/63 patients, 97% were aware of the need to contact their doctor in case of persistent fever or infection). To conclude, the number of healthcare professionals receiving the patient reminder card is considered rather low. However, the matter is not be further pursued given the recent revision of the educational material with the removal of the prescriber guide. An acceptable proportion of responding patients received, read and understood the   |

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 05/09/2019   | n/a   | Interim report of the German biologics register RABBIT (Rheumatoide Arthritis: Beobachtung der Biologika- Therapie) The interim results showed a 1.5-fold higher risk for serious hospitalized infection for Cimzia compared to csDMARD treated patients. Moreover, a 2.4-fold risk increase for lung cancer was revealed for Cimzia treatment compared receiving csDMARDs. Due to low numbers of patients with lung cancer, these results need to be confirmed in larger studies. Overall, the use of Cimzia for the treatment of patients with RA in daily rheumatologic care appears as a safe and well tolerated option. Final report British Society Rheumatology (BSRBR) Registry The BSRBR final data show, that compared to non-biologic controls, Cimizia treatment was associated with lower rates of cardiac events and death. This must be interpreted cautiously and could suggest insufficient control of confounding. In addition, as moderate to severe heart failure is a contraindication for all anti-TNF-treatments, this finding is not surprising. When compared to other anti-TNF- α treatments, Cimizia treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious infections. For malignancies there was |

The risk of malignancy will continue to be closely monitored via pharmacovigilance activities as indicated in the RMP. The comparison to other anti-TNF-α should be interpreted with caution. All these outcomes would from a mechanistic perspective be expected to be class effects if there is a causal relation. Overall, no impact on the established safety profile of Cimzia is identified from these comparisons.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the availability of additional safety information from the phase 3 clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of certolizumab in subjects with active axSpA without X-ray evidence of ankylosing spondylitis and objective signs of inflammation (AS0006). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 27/06/2019 | 26/06/2020 | SmPC | The efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a 52 weeks multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled study (AS0006) in 317 patients ≥18 years of age with adult-onset axial spondyloarthritis and back pain for at least 12 months. Patients had to fulfil ASAS criteria for nr- axSpA (not including family history and good response to NSAIDs), and have had objective signs of inflammation indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above the upper limit of normal and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicative of inflammatory disease [positive CRP (> ULN) and/or positive MRI], but without definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on sacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the BASDAI ≥4, and spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 10 NRS. Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs.

Utilisation and dose adjustment of standard of care medication (SC) (e.g., NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were permitted at any time. The primary efficacy variable was the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response at Week 52. ASDAS-MI response was defined as an ASDAS reduction (improvement) ≥ 2.0 relative to baseline or as reaching the lowest possible score. ASAS 40 was a secondary endpoint. At baseline, 37 %and 41% of patients had high disease activity (ASDAS ≥2.1, ≤3.5) and 62% and 58% of patient had very high disease activity (ASDAS >3.5) in the CIMZIA group and placebo group respectively. At Week 52, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients treated with Cimzia achieved ASDAS-MI response compared to patients treated with placebo. Cimzia-treated patients also had improvements compared to placebo in multiple components of axial spondyloarthritis disease activity, including CRP. At both Week 12 and 52, ASAS 40 responses were significantly greater than placebo. At Week 52, the percentage of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) was 36.4 %for the Cimzia group compared to 11.8 %for the placebo group. At Week 52, patients treated with Cimzia showed a clinical meaningful improvement in the MASES compared to placebo (LS mean change from baseline -2.4; -0.2   |

Study RA0022/BSRBR is a longitudinal observational study of patients with RA treated with biologic agents, and prospective surveillance study for adverse events. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission   | 16/05/2019   | n/a   | Based on the real-world data from these 4 registries (ARTIS, NDB, RABBIT, and BSRBR), no new safety concerns for certolizumab pegol (CZP) have been identified. Final data from the ARTIS and NDB registries included in this annual status report inform the investigation of safety concerns with CZP related to infections, congestive heart failure, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, demyelinating-like disorders, lupus, hepatobiliary events, and cardiac and cerebrovascular ischemia. Collectively, these final data from ARTIS and NDB, interim data provided from BSRBR and RABBIT, are consistent with the established safety profile and risk characterisation of CZP, and support the benefit-risk profile and pharmacovigilance activities outlined in the EU risk management plan (RMP).   |

C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the obligations and conditions of a marketing authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of change(s) which require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH where significant assessment is required | 17/01/2019   | 17/04/2019   | SmPC, Annex II and PL | In the risk management plan (RMP), the summary of safety concerns is updated to remove 'Aplastic anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and leukopenia', 'Sarcoidosis' and 'New onset or worsening of psoriasis (including palmoplantar pustular psoriasis) and related conditions' from the list of important identified risks; to remove 'Cardiac ischemia and cerebrovascular ischemia' and 'Serious bleeding events' from the list of important potential risks; and to remove 'Children and adolescents' from the list of missing information. Based on the experience with the use of certolizumab and the knowledge about the safety profile, the distribution of the prescriber guide to rheumatologists will cease. In addition, based on the experience with the use of other TNF-inhibitors in psoriasis and an adequate level of understanding of the potential risks and management, the distribution of the prescriber guide to dermatologists will also cease.

Both CZP dose regimens studied (400 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W after three initial loading doses of 400 mg) were superior to placebo. In study CIMPACT, the anti TNF alfa antibody etanercept (Enbrel®) was included as active comparator. Superiority vs. etanercept could be concluded for PASI75 at Week 12 for the higher 400 mg CZP dose (66.7% vs. 53.3%, p=0.0152) and non-inferiority for the 200 mg dose (61.3% vs. 53.3%; 8% difference, 95% CI: -2.9; 18.9). For PGA response at Week 12 in CIMPACT (secondary end-point), there was no difference in response for this variable for the 200 mg CZP dose vs. ETN (40% vs. 39%) while the 400 mg CZP dose showed a larger response (50%) than ETN. The safety profile of Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks were generally similar. In conclusion, the submitted clinical studies support an update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.   |

| II/0055   | Final clinical study report for study PsA001 is submitted to provide data on long-term use of Cimzia in psoriatic arthritis subjects up to 216 weeks of treatment. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are revised in order to update the efficacy and safety information (Week 216) for study PsA001. The package leaflet remains unchanged. A revised RMP (version 11) is also submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 15/12/2016   | 28/04/2017   | SmPC        | For the current data from the overall study (combined double-blind, dose-blind and open-label treatment periods, it is similarly considered that the efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in reducing signs and symptoms of active PsA, in those subjects who remained in the study, was maintained (up to Week 216). Findings were similar for physical function and health- related outcomes. Inhibition of progression of structural damage in subjects who remained in the study was sustained with long-term (up to 216 weeks) CZP treatment. Taken together, it is considered that the efficacy of CZP treatment in active PsA in subjects who remained in the study is sustained with long-term (up to 216 weeks) CZP treatment. Overall, it is considered that the incidence and type of AEs observed in the study is consistent with existing knowledge of CZP and anti-TNFα therapy in general and the open-label data from patients with PsA treated with CZP for up to 216 weeks is consistent with the previous study data. The 'Long-term use in psoriatic arthritis' identified as a safety concern has been removed from the Risk Management Plan.   |

Antibodies detectable on at least one occasion were present in 13% of patients (8.4% of the overall patients had transient formation of antibodies and an additional 4.7% had persistent formation of antibodies). The overall percentage of patients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was estimated to be 9.1%. Similar to the placebo-controlled studies, antibody positivity was associated with reduced efficacy in some patients. |

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 24/10/2013 | 25/11/2013 | SmPC and PL | The option of switching to a CZP 400mg Q4W maintenance dose regimen once clinical response is confirmed was assessed in Study C87077. The results demonstrated that efficacy was maintained after switching from a dose regimen of CZP 200mg Q2W to CZP 400mg Q4W. The results showed that for the maintenance of the clinical response, both regimen CZP 200mg Q2W and CZP 400mg Q4W with MTX demonstrated significance compared to placebo with MTX for ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 (CZP 400mg Q4W + MTX only) response. The responses compared to placebo were similar for the 2 CZP maintenance dose regimens. The long-term use of the CZP 400mg Q4W dose regimen was followed in Study C87015. This supportive extension study was primarily a safety study. Its open label design without control group did not allow for any robust conclusions on long term efficacy. |

As additional supportive information, 1-year interim results from the open-label studies C87071 (with MTX) and RA0007 (without MTX) indicated comparable maintenance of clinical response and continued inhibition of structural damage progression (mTSS) by the CZP 200mg Q2W and the CZP 400mg Q4W dose regimens in Japanese subjects following 52 weeks of open-label treatment. In conclusion, based on these study results, CZP 400mg Q4W is considered effective as an alternative dosing option to the currently recommended CZP 200mg Q2W treatment regimen in sustaining the clinical benefit of CZP in subjects with moderate to severe RA once clinical response is achieved.

| II/0031 | Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add the risk of hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Information in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC is also updated based on the integrated summary of rheumatoid arthritis safety data. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/04/2013 | 18/10/2013 | SmPC and PL | A post-marketing case of HSTCL concomitant with certolizumab pegol (CZP) use was reviewed. Although the time to onset of the event was short and a previous extended immunosuppressive treatment (including other anti-TNF agents) was a confounding factor, the contribution of CZP cannot be totally excluded. Therefore, in line with the wording for other anti-TNF agents, a warning concerning HSTCL is added to section 4.4 to inform healthcare professionals that a risk for the development of HSTCL in patients treated with Cimzia cannot be excluded. A cumulative safety review for the RA population studies showed that the incidence and the pattern of AEs presented are consistent with previous experience with CZP and with those expected for RA subjects treated with an anti-TNFα agent. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 are therefore updated concerning the number of patients exposed in RA clinical trials, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse drug reaction and the incidence rates for infections, malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorder, injections site reactions and antibodies to CZP. |

| II/0028   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) as a new adverse event with unknown frequency. This update is based on a review of post-marketing and clinical trials cases, a literature search and disproportionality analysis. The package leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.3. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   | 21/03/2013   | 18/10/2013   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | The MAH presented a cumulative review of cases of MCC associated with certolizumab pegol (CZP), supported by a literature review and disproportionality analyses. Two cases of MCC were retrieved from the cumulative review. Both reports were post marketing cases. No MCC cases were observed clinical trials. Both described cases lacked evidence of causal attribution to CZP. One of the cases had a short time to onset and was confounded by prior medications; the other case could not be completely disregarded. No cases of MCC associated with CZP were identified in the literature however the data presented strongly supports the suspicion of a class effect of TNF- blockers on development of MCC. The presented disproportionality analysis also supports the suspicion of a class effect. Overall, although it is not clear whether the appearance of MCC in patients receiving CZP might be due to a number of factors such as other TNF inhibitor therapy, the underlying autoimmune diseases, the patient's age, the exposure to other non-biologic immunosuppressant therapy, the possible contribution of CZP use to the risk cannot be excluded. Therefore MCC is added to section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' of the SmPC, with a frequency category of 'not known'. The severity and seriousness of the event of MCC also justify its addition to section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' to warn the prescribing physicians that cases of MCC have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including CZP and to recommend periodic skin examination, particularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer.   |

Results identified 112 cases of hypersensitivity of which 37 cases concerned patients treated with Cimzia for rheumatoid arthritis, 56 for Crohn's disease and 19 for other or unspecified indications. Approximately one third of hypersensitivity reactions occurred acutely after the first administration of Cimzia. This trend was even more pronounced for the global anaphylactic reactions for which 16 of the 25 hypersensitivity reactions were observed after the first administration. Although hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock) is already listed in section 4.8 and hypersensitivity is discussed in section 4.4 of the SmPC, the fact that these events may occur after the first injection of Cimzia is considered clinically important information and is therefore added in section 4.4 of the SmPC.   |

Additionally, clinical and non-clinical studies that characterised the placental transfer of certolizumab pegol were submitted. Results from an in vitro study using a human placental transfer model showed only low levels of transfer to the foetal compartment. Furthermore, clinical data from an investigator-initiated study evaluating plasma levels in infants of mothers treated with certolizumab pegol in late pregnancy was submitted. The study results were considered insufficiently robust to support the claim of a lack of placental transfer. Due to the limited clinical data and the fact that infants from mothers who received certolizumab pegol during pregnancy might be at increased risk for infection, CHMP recommended not to expose these infants to live vaccines up to 5 month after the mother having received the last certolizumab pegol administration   |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 24/06/2010 | 26/08/2010 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | From the data presented by the MAH on leukaemias and paediatric malignancies, it is agreed that there are a number of uncertainties regarding whether there is a causal association between anti-TNF agents and leukaemias or paediatric malignancies or not. Nevertheless, given the mechanism of action of these agents, the possible risks for the development of such malignancies with use of agents of this class cannot be excluded. By addressing these risks in the product information, and with the ongoing follow up activities, the benefit/risk balance for Cimzia remains positive. |
