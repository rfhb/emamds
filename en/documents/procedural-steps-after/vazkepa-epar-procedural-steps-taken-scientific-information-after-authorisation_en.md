1 Notifications  are issued for  type I variations  and Article  61(3) notifications  (unless part of a group including a type II variation  or extension  application  or a worksharing  application).  Opinions are  issued for all  other procedures.

2 A Commission  decision  (CD) is issued for procedures  that affect  the terms of the marketing  authorisation  (e.g.  summary of  product characteristics,  annex  II, labelling,  package  leaflet).  The CD is issued within two  months of  the opinion  for variations  falling  under the scope of  Article  23.1a(a)  of Regulation  (EU) No.  712/2012, or within  one year  for other procedures.
