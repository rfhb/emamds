1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0053   | Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy and safety data on paediatric patients following the outcome of Article 46 procedure EMEA/H/C/002829/P46/009 and based on results from study J1S-MC-JV02 (JV02). This is a randomized, open-label, phase 1/2 study evaluating ramucirumab in paediatric patients and young adults with relapsed, recurrent, or refractory synovial sarcoma. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial updates to the SmPC and the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 21/03/2024   |            | SmPC, Labelling and PL   | SmPC new text No new safety concerns were reported in the limited number of paediatric patients treated with ramucirumab in combination therapy in study J1S-MC-JV02. The efficacy and safety of ramucirumab in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel compared to gemcitabine and docetaxel alone was evaluated in J1S-MC-JV02 (JV02), a randomised, multicentre, global, Phase 2 study in 23 paediatric patients and young adults aged 36 months to 29 years with relapsed, recurrent, or progressive synovial sarcoma (SS). Randomization (2:1) was stratified by staging at relapse (metastatic disease versus locally advanced). The study was terminated without formal evaluation of the primary PFS endpoint since at the interim futility analysis, JV02 did not meet the pre-specified 60% confidence in treatment superiority (PFS HR of less than 1 for SS). There was one partial response and no complete response in the experimental arm. No responses, complete   |

This increased incidence was not observed in patients receiving ramucirumab compared to placebo from single agent clinical trials. In the post-marketing setting, cardiac failure was observed for ramucirumab, mostly in combination with paclitaxel. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac failure during treatment, and suspension of treatment should be considered if clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac failure develop.
