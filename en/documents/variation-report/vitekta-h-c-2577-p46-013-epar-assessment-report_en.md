## 1. Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

The applicant has submitted an abbreviated clinical study report (CSR) of the final data from Study GS-US-183-0130 in accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. An interim Week  192  CSR  for  Study  GS-US-183-0130  was  submitted  with  the  initial  Vitekta  Marketing Authorization Application. About the product Vitekta® tablets contain elvitegravir (EVG; 85 or 150 mg). Vitekta was approved for commercial marketing  in  the  United  States  on  24  September  2014  and  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  13 November 2013. In  the  EU,  Vitekta  is  indicated  to  be  coadministered  with  a  ritonavir  (RTV)  boosted  protease inhibitor and with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  type  1  (HIV-1)  infection  in  adults  who  are  infected  with  HIV  1  without  known  mutations associated  with  resistance  to  EVG.  Vitekta  is  also  part  of  an  approved  single  tablet  regimen (Stribild®: EVG/cobicistat [COBI]/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. Study  GS  US  183  0130  was  conducted  to  provide  continued  access  to  EVG+RTV  for  adult  and paediatric  subjects  who  completed  a  prior  EVG+RTV  study  without  experiencing  any  treatment limiting toxicity. In addition, long-term safety of EVG+RTV in combination with other antiretroviral agents in subjects who have completed a prior EVG+RTV treatment study were also observed. This submission presents an abbreviated clinical study report (CSR) of the final data from Study GS-US-183-0130 in accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. An interim Week  192  CSR  for  Study  GS-US-183-0130  was  submitted  with  the  initial  Vitekta  Marketing Authorization Application Approved indication(s) and posology Indication Vitekta is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults: Vitekta  co-administered  with  a  ritonavir-boosted  protease  inhibitor  and  with  other  antiretroviral agents,  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus-1  (HIV-1)  infection  in adults  who  are  infected  with  HIV-1  without  known  mutations  associated  with  resistance  to elvitegravir (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Posology Adults Medicinal product no longer authorised

The recommended dose of Vitekta is one 85 mg tablet or one 150 mg tablet taken orally once daily with food.

1. Scientific discussion 1.1. Clinical aspects Study GS-US-183-0130 was a Phase 2, rollover, open label, multicenter, multiple dose, single arm extension study. The primary objective was to observe the long-term safety of EVG+RTV in combination with other antiretroviral  agents  in  subjects  who  have  completed  a  prior  EVG+RTV  treatment  study.  Eligible subjects were HIV-1 infected adult and paediatric subjects who had completed a prior EVG+RTV treatment study without experiencing any treatment-limiting toxicity. Subjects were enrolled in this extension study regardless of their baseline HIV 1 RNA level (ie, subjects with baseline HIV 1 RNA levels  of  either  &lt;  50  or  &gt;  50  copies/mL  were  enrolled).  Nonvirologically  suppressed  subjects entering  this  study  had,  for  the  most  part,  failed  prior  antiretroviral  regimens  and  had  limited treatment  options  available.  Genotyping  was  not  performed  at  baseline,  so  subjects  who  met eligibility requirements were enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. In this study, subjects who were receiving an RTV boosted protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their antiretroviral  regimen  took  the  RTV  dose  and  followed  the  dosing  schedule  indicated  in  the prescribing information for the PI. No additional RTV was required. Subjects whose antiretroviral regimen did not include RTV took RTV 100 mg once daily with their EVG dose. Subjects who were taking  lopinavir/r  (LPV/r)  or  atazanavir/r  (ATV/r)  as  part  of  their  antiretroviral  regimen  received EVG 85 mg tablet once daily due to an established drug drug interaction with these agents; all other subjects received 1 or 2 EVG 150 mg tablets once daily. While participating in this study, subjects were monitored for safety using periodic assessments of adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and clinical laboratory tests. Study visits occurred once  every  8  weeks  for  the  first  48  weeks  of  the  study,  then  once  every  12  weeks.  Following implementation of protocol amendment 3, subjects who were not treated with EVG in their prior EVG+RTV study were to have an additional study visit at 4 weeks for safety monitoring. The study was conducted and reported in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  in  accordance  with  International  Conference  on  Harmonization  Good Clinical  Practice  guidelines,  applicable  governmental  regulatory  requirements,  and  in  compliance with the protocol. A total of 192 subjects were enrolled in the study and received EVG. Of the 192 enrolled subjects, 186 were adults and 6 were paediatric subjects. Subject attrition was high, as only 73 subjects (38.0%) completed the study and 119 subjects (62.0%) prematurely discontinued from the study. The  most  common  reasons  subjects  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study  were  withdrew consent (29 subjects; 15.1%), lack of efficacy (28 subjects; 14.6%), and investigator's discretion (22 subjects; 11.5%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The majority of subjects were male (90.1%) and white (72.4%), with a mean age of 46 years in adults (ranging from 18 to 65 years) and 16 years in paediatric subjects (ranging from 15 to 17 years). Categorically, baseline HIV 1 RNA level was &lt; 50 copies/mL in 85 subjects (44.5%), 50 to &lt;  400  copies/mL  in  40  subjects  (20.9%),  and  &gt;  400  copies/mL  in  66  subjects  (34.6%).  At

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

baseline, the mean CD4 cell count was 282 cells/mm3; categorically, 119 subjects (62.6%) had a baseline CD4 cell count &gt; 200 cells/mm3.

The efficacy endpoints for this study included the following:

- The percentages of subjects with HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL
- The percentages of subjects with HIV 1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL

· The change from baseline in HIV 1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) · The change from baseline in CD4 cell count (cells/mm3) The Efficacy Analysis Set included all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of EVG and who had at least one post-baseline measurement of either HIV 1 RNA or CD4 cell count. This was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL or &lt; 400 copies/mL were summarized using Missing = Excluded (M = E) analysis. For M = E analysis, subjects with missing data were excluded from both the numerator and denominator (ie, only non-missing data were included when calculating percentages). Change  from  baseline  in  HIV-1  RNA  (log10  copies/mL)  and  CD4  cell  count  (cells/mm3)  were summarized  descriptively  (sample  size,  mean,  standard  deviation,  95%  CI,  median,  Q1,  Q3, minimum, and maximum) for each study visit. Resistance testing was performed if subjects had HIV 1 RNA &gt; 400 copies/mL at the time of study discontinuation  or  upon  virologic  rebound  and  the  investigator  requested  to  reconfigure  the subject's antiretroviral regimen without including EVG/r. Efficacy Results Data were summarized for adult subjects by baseline HIV 1 RNA levels (ie, the baseline HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL group and the baseline HIV 1 RNA &gt;50 copies/mL group). For the 83 subjects in the baseline HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (M = E analysis) subject group, the number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 48, 96, 144, and 192 were 72 of 80 (90.0%), 63 of 73 (86.3%), 59 of 68 (86.8%), and 56 of 63 (88.9%), respectively, and at Weeks 240, 288, 336, 384, and 408 (end of study) were 50 of 59 (84.7%), 51 of 55 (92.7%), 45 of 51 (88.2%), 42 of 46 (91.3%), and 9 of 9 (100%), respectively. The number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels &lt; 400 copies/mL were  slightly higher, with similar trends. For the 102 subjects in the baseline HIV 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (M = E analysis) subject group, the number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 48, 96, 144, and 192 were 26 of 73 (35.6%), 29 of 64 (45.3%), 30 of 52 (57.7%), and 31 of 45 (68.9%), respectively, and at Weeks 240, 288, 336, 384, and 408 (end of study) were 25 of 36 (69.4%), 26 of 31 (83.9%), 26 of 31 (83.9%), 24 of 27 (88.9%), and 5 of 6 (83.3%), respectively. The number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels &lt; 400 copies/mL were slightly higher, with similar trends. For the baseline HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL group, as expected from these virologically suppressed subjects, no clinically relevant changes in mean HIV 1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) levels were observed. Mean increases in CD4 cell counts were observed at each assessment point (mean change from baseline range: 31 to 264 cells/mm3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

For the baseline HIV 1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL group, mean decreases from baseline in HIV 1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) levels were observed over 408 weeks (mean change from baseline range: -0.18 to-1.59 log10 copies/mL). Mean increases in CD4 cell counts were observed at each assessment

point (mean change from baseline range: 9 to 216 cells/mm3 through 396 weeks (mean change was 511 cells/mm3 at 408 weeks).

Caution  is  warranted  in  interpreting  these  efficacy  results  due  to  small  sample  size  and  high attrition rate.

A total of 62 adult subjects qualified for resistance analysis, of whom 48 entered the study with pre existing  integrase  resistance  mutations  (developed  during  their  original  EVG  treatment  period  in Study GS US 183 0105) and 14 had no evidence of integrase resistance at study entry. Among the 48  subjects  with  pre  existing  integrase  resistance  mutations,  39  developed  additional  integrase resistance mutations during Study GS US 183 0130, 3 had no additional mutations, and 6 had no data  available  due  to  assay  failures.  Among  the  14  subjects  with  no  pre  existing  integrase resistance mutations, 7 developed integrase resistance mutations during Study GS US 183 0130. Among the 85 subjects (all adult subjects) who entered the study fully suppressed with HIV 1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, 9 qualified for resistance analysis. Among these 9 subjects, 4 developed integrase resistance mutations during Study GS US 183 0130. Overall in Study GS US 183 0130, the majority of resistance development was characterized as an evolution of RT, protease, and integrase resistance that had existed prior to study entry in subjects who  were  not  fully  suppressed  on  their  regimen.  With  regard  to  integrase  resistance,  mutation patterns evolved and resulted in a general increase in the level of phenotypic resistance to EVG. Of the  9  subjects  who  entered  the  study  with  fully  suppressed  HIV  1  RNA,  4  developed  integrase resistance. Paediatric Subjects For the 6 paediatric subjects, the number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels &lt; 50 copies/mL at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 (no pediatric subjects remained in the study after this visit) were 2 of 6 (33.3%), 1 of 5 (20.0%), 1 of 3 (33.3%), 0 of 2 (0%), and 0 of 1 (0%), respectively.  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  plasma  HIV  1  RNA  levels  &lt;  400 copies/mL were slightly higher, with similar trends. Mean HIV 1 RNA (log10 copies/mL) levels were maintained over 240 weeks (mean change from baseline range: -0.53 to 1.49 log10 copies/mL). Mean decreases in CD4 cell counts were observed at almost every assessment point (mean change from baseline range: -286 to 11 cells/mm3). Caution  is  warranted  in  interpreting  these  efficacy  results  due  to  small  sample  size  and  high attrition rate. All 6 paediatric subjects qualified for resistance analysis, of whom 4 had no evidence of integrase resistance at study entry and 2 had no baseline data. No  pediatric subjects developed integrase resistance mutations during Study GS US 183 0130. Safety Results The Safety Analysis Set included all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of EVG. All data  collected  up  to  30  days  after  subjects  permanently  discontinued  their  study  drug  were included in the safety summaries. This was the primary analysis set for safety analyses.

Most subjects (174 of 186; 93.5%) experienced an AE while receiving EVG (85, 150, or 300 mg) in this  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (by  preferred  term)  were  upper  respiratory  tract infection (32.3%), sinusitis (26.3%), and diarrhea (25.3%). Most AEs were mild to moderate, not serious, not related to study drug, and few led to study drug discontinuation. Only 6 subjects had a Grade 3 AE that was also considered by the investigator to be related to study drug (necrotizing retinitis,  acute  pancreatitis,  hepatitis  B,  peripheral  neuropathy  [2  subjects],  and  acute  kidney injury); no Grade 4 study drug related AEs were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 83 adult subjects (44.6%) had SAEs. Only 3 subjects had an SAE that was considered by the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug:  necrotizing  retinitis,  acute  pancreatitis,  and  acute kidney  injury.  Thirteen  subjects  died  during  this  study.  None  of  the  AEs  leading  to  death  were considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  Most  SAEs  and  deaths  were  due  to either complications of the subjects' underlying advanced  HIV  1  infection or pre-existing comorbidities.

One adult  subject  became  pregnant  during  the  study.  The  subject  had  a  spontaneous  abortion, which was reported as an SAE and was considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug, concomitant antiretroviral medications, or study procedures. Few subjects (14 subjects) discontinued study drug due to an AE. All AEs that led to study drug discontinuation  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  not  related  to  study  drug,  with  the exception of nausea in 1 subject. A total of 65 subjects (35.1%) had a maximum Grade 3 laboratory abnormality, and 25 subjects (13.5%) had a maximum Grade 4 abnormality. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were most frequently  reported  for  creatine  kinase  (18  subjects),  GGT  (18  subjects),  serum  amylase  (15 subjects), urine glucose (15 subjects), and fasting triglycerides (12 subjects). Most of the Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were not clinically relevant (eg, creatine kinase elevation or amylase elevation without reported relevant AEs) or were due to underlying comorbidities (eg, glycosuria in subjects with diabetes, GGT elevation in subjects with chronic hepatitis C). There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in mean values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, or body weight. Paediatric Subjects All 6 pediatric subjects (100%) had an AE while receiving EVG (85 or 150 mg) in this study. The most frequently  reported AEs  (by  preferred  term)  were  cough  (4  subjects),  and  ear  pain,  nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, and pyrexia (3 subjects each). Most AEs were mild to moderate, not serious, and not related to study drug. No Grade 3 or 4 study drug related AEs or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported. A total of 3 pediatric subjects had SAEs, none of which was considered by the investigator to be related  to  study  drug.  Most  SAEs  were  due  to  either  complications  of  the  subjects'  underlying advanced HIV 1 infection or pre-existing comorbidities. One paediatric subject (enrolled at age 16) became pregnant during the study at the age of 18. The subject  had  an  elective  abortion,  which  was  only  discovered  after  she  completed  a  social  work questionnaire;  this  is  the  only  documentation  of  the  subject's  pregnancy  and  abortion.  A corresponding AE of unintended pregnancy was reported. The subject did not discontinue the study due to these events. No Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported for &gt; 1 paediatric subject. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in mean values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, or body weight. BENEFITS AND RISKS CONCLUSIONS Medicinal product no longer authorised

In this overview, data are presented from Study GS-US-183-0130, which showed that long term exposure  to  EVG  was  generally  well  tolerated  when  administered  in  combination  with  other antiretroviral agents to HIV 1 infected, antiretroviral treatment experienced subjects. No new safety concerns for EVG in the subject populations studied were identified.

Caution is warranted in interpreting these results due to small sample size and high attrition rate.

No updates to the Vitekta prescribing information are warranted in relation to the data presented in this submission. These data also do not change the positive benefit risk balance of Vitekta when used in accordance with the current SmPC.

## 1.2 Discussion on clinical aspects

<!-- image -->

The applicant has submitted the result of the long-term follow up of adult and paediatric patients with HIV taking Vitekta. There are no major safety or efficacy issues arising out of it, however the number of 6 paediatric subjects is too small to make any meaningful conclusions. On the basis of this study, there is no change in the benefit-risk profile of Vitekta for the existing indications. No changes are proposed to the Prescribing information. 2. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation Overall conclusion The benefit/risk balance remains unchanged and positive in the approved indications at present. The data provided in this submission do not raise any safety or efficacy concerns for elvitegravir in the paediatric population, although the number of subjects is too small. Based on these results the applicant proposes no amendments to the SmPC. No further action is considered necessary. Medicinal product no longer authorised
