## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Retrospective cohort study - pharmacokinetics and exposure outcome in neonates administered lacosamide, report ep0155

## Description

## Methods

EP0155 was a retrospective cohort study that used electronic healthcare record (EHR) data from the Pediatric Network (PEDSnet) data network. The primary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and effectiveness outcomes in neonates exposed to any dose of LCM in clinical practice. The secondary objectives were to estimate the incidence of the selected medical events of interest (6 system organ classes and 2 Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries).

EP0155 used EHR data from the PEDSnet multi-institutional database and University of Michigan C.S. Mott's Children's Hospital. Data from both databases are stored in the Patient -Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet®) database common data model (Version 5.1), where all elements are in a structured format.

Electronic healthcare record data from 01 Jan 2009 to 29 Feb 2020 were extracted from the PCORnet database. Patients were selected for inclusion in EP0155 based on LCM exposure only (ie, they did not have to have a diagnosis of epilepsy). Lacosamide could have been used as monotherapy or adjunctive to a prior antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy during an intensive care or in-hospital stay. Patients were followed for a maximum of 30 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study participants

Inclusion criteria:

- Neonates &lt;30 calendar days of age (or gestational age equivalent) on index date
- At least 35 weeks gestational age
- Treated with LCM (iv or oral, any dose) on index date

Exclusion criteria:

- Patients outside the neonatal age range at index date, as they did not fit the criteria of a neonate at treatment onset.
- Patients born very preterm (&lt;35 weeks) as these babies did not have the same seizure etiology which would respond to AED.

## Treatments

## Objective(s)

## Primary objectives:

1. To obtain measurements of pharmacokinetics of lacosamide (plasma concentration) by obtaining drug dosing with time stamps and blood tests with time stamps at any time during the first observable episode of exposure to lacosamide and thereafter up to 30 days.
2. To assess effectiveness outcomes in a noncomparative design, evaluating endpoints within 30 days of drug start.

## Secondary objectives

1. To estimate the incidence of the selected medical events for 6 System Organ Classes (SOC) namely: i) Cardiac disorders; ii) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; iii) Nervous system disorders; iv) Metabolism and nutrition disorders; v) Administration site conditions and injury; vi) Blood and lymphatic system disorders.
2. Plus 2 Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries (SMQs) namely: i) Drug rash - reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome; ii) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Sample size

The study analyzed data from a convenience sample of patients from both databases. No formal sample size computation was done. A feasibility assessment identified at least 40 patients ever exposed to iv LCM who were &lt; 30 days of age. The study selection criteria were not very restrictive, so it was assumed that the sample size would not be significantly reduced. This sample size was sufficient to evaluate the primary objective of the study which was purely descriptive in nature.

In most cases, electroencephalography (EEG) data were only available for up to 3 days, as this was what was deemed clinically necessary for these patients. Therefore, it was considered more appropriate to define outcomes as EEG outcomes rather than effectiveness outcomes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Electroencephalography data were available for 34 patients on Day 1, for 26 patients on Day 2, and for 21 patients on Day 3, respectively.

On Day 1, in the 31 patients with electrographic seizures, the effectiveness assessment showed that &lt;11 patients  had any improvement, &lt;11 patients  had no change, and 13 patients (42.0%) had unknown responses. A total of &lt;11 patients  had an improvement in seizure burden of &gt;50%.

On Day 2, in the 17 patients with electrographic seizures, &lt;11 patients  showed improvement, &lt;11 patients  showed no change, and &lt;11 patients  had unknown responses.

On Day 3, in the 12 patients with electrographic seizures, &lt;11 patients  showed no change in seizure burden, and the response was unknown in the remaining &lt;11 patients.

## PK results

Pharmacokinetic data were not available in patient charts for most patients (ie, only &lt;11 patients had any PK data). Given the small number of values, a meaningful analysis of PK data was not possible.

Among the AESI for LCM, cardiac arrest was observed in &lt;11 patient, with a crude incidence rate per 1000 person-days of 1.39 (95% CI: 0.04 to 7.74). For other adverse event categories, crude incidence rates per 1000 person-days ranged from 2.81 (95% CI: 0.34 to 10.16) each for blood or lymphatic system disorders and nervous system disorders to 12.46 (95% CI: 5.38 to 24.55) for morbidity diagnoses. No adverse events were attributed to LCM by the treating physician.

No adverse events were attributed to LCM by the treating physicians.

Overall, no new safety concerns were observed, and the results of the study do not impact the current benefit-risk balance of LCM.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In this retrospective study, effectiveness and safety of LCM was evaluated in the acute treatment of neonatal seizures.

Forty-seven neonates (&lt;30 days of age) met the study eligibility criteria. Almost all of the neonates received their first dose of LCM in the ICU (n=46; 97.9%), and three-fifths of patients (n=29; 61.7%) received more than four administrations of LCM. The median (IQR) number of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

days on LCM was 10.0 (1.0 - 28.0) days. Phenobarbital (n=37; 78.7%), fosphenytoin (n=29; 61.7%) and LEV (n=27; 57.4%) were the most commonly used AEDs before index date.

Approximately 94% and 40% of the study patients had history of seizure and status epilepticus, respectively, before index date. About 21% of patients had status epilepticus on the index date. Reported underlying conditions were suspected epilepsy or seizure (n=16; 34%), intracranial hemorrhage (27.7%), sepsis (&lt;11%), and meningitis (&lt;11%).

In most cases, EEG data were available for up to 3 days, as this was what was deemed clinically necessary for these patients. EEG data were available on day 1, day 2 and day 3 for 34, 26 and 21 patients, respectively. In patients who were on LCM and did not receive any new AED,electrographic seizures were present on days 1, 2 and 3 in 31, &lt;11 and &lt;11patients, respectively. On days 1 and 2, any improvement in seizures was observed in &lt;11 neonates and &lt;11 neonate, respectively.

The population included in this study was critically ill. During the median duration of follow up, ie, 12.0 (7.0 - 28.0) days, &lt;11 patients died. Cardiac arrest was observed in one patient.

Various AEs occurred, the majority only in one patient. Hypotension and adrenal cortical hypofunction were reported in &lt;11 patients each, congestive heart failure, hypertension, acute injury of the kidney and diabetes insipidus in &lt;11 patients each. None of these events or deaths were attributed by the treating physician to LCM. No evidence of new safety concerns was found.

The current study has limitations, ie, retrospective design, small sample size and the lack of a control arm. Comparative studies are required to enable any conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of LCM in neonatal seizures.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In accordance with Article 46, the MAH has provided the final study report of 'Retrospective cohort study pharmacokinetics and exposure outcome in neonates administered lacosamide'. In this retrospective study the primary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and effectiveness outcomes in neonates exposed to any dose of LCM in clinical practice and the secondary objectives were to estimate the incidence of the selected medical events of interest.

Of the 47 patients in EP0155, the mean age at the index date was 13.9 days and the mean birthweight was 3.0 kg, respectively. The most common aetiology of first seizure was suspected epilepsy (34.0%), followed by intracranial haemorrhage (27.7%), and sepsis and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (&lt;11%each). On the index date, &lt;11%of patients had status epilepticus.

PK data was not available in the patient charts for most patients, only for &lt;11 patients. No PK data is presented which is accepted, however in a future submission it is encouraged that the PK observations are reported.

The median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of follow up for the effectiveness evaluation was 1.0 (1.0 to 6.0) days and the median (IQR) duration of follow up for the adverse event evaluation was 12.0 (7.0 to 28.0) days. Approximately 70% of patients had LCM used as a second or third line of therapy. The most commonly used (non-benzodiazepine) AEDs before the index date were phenobarbital (PB) (78.7%), fosphenytoin (61.7%), and levetiracetam (LEV) (57.4%). In most cases, electroencephalography (EEG) data were only available for up to 3 days, as this was what was deemed clinically necessary for these patients. The effectiveness based on EEG outcome was not possible to determine due to a small sample size and a high percentage of missing data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the safety follow-up period of a median 12 days, &lt;11 patients died, however none of the deaths were deemed related to lacosamide treatment but probably related to the severe background diseases (see above) for which lacosamide was given.

The MAH considers that no change of the label is deemed necessary and that the results of the study do not impact the current benefit-risk balance of LCM. This is concurred.

The Rapporteur concludes that the MAH has fulfilled its obligation to submit data from this paediatric study in accordance with Art 46. However, the small sample size, effectiveness evaluation based only on EEG data and a short safety follow up do not allow any evaluation of effectiveness or safety and accordingly, the results do not have any impact on the B/R balance of lacosamide. No further actions are required.
