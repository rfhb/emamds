<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

| Age group                | Dose                      | Schedule                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 6 months to < 9 years    | One or two a 0.5 mL doses | If 2 doses, administer at least 4 weeks apart |
| 9 years of age and older | One 0.5 mL dose           | Not applicable                                |

a Children less than 9 years of age who have not been previously vaccinated against influenza, should receive a second dose.

## Children below 6 months of age

The safety and efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in children from birth to less than 6 months of age has not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only.

The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Young children with insufficient deltoid mass should be vaccinated in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with all injectable vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## General

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to prevent influenza.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## Potassium

This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed with Flucelvax Tetra. There are no data available on coadministration of Flucelvax Tetra with other vaccines. Based on clinical experience with cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), Flucelvax Tetra can be given at the same time as other vaccines.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Inactivated influenza vaccines, such as Flucelvax Tetra, can be given in any stage of pregnancy. Larger safety datasets are available on vaccine use during the second or third trimester, compared with the first trimester; however, data from worldwide use of influenza vaccines do not indicate any adverse foetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine.

A prospective Pregnancy Exposure Registry was conducted in the United States (US) and data were collected from 665 women vaccinated with Flucelvax Tetra during 3 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20), of whom 28% were exposed during their first trimester. Based on pregnancy outcomes and predefined infant safety outcomes, there was no evidence of adverse foetal, newborn or pregnancy outcomes attributable to the vaccine during any stage of pregnancy.

There have been no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with Flucelvax Tetra. Reproductive and developmental toxicology data from cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) do not predict an increased risk of developmental abnormalities.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Flucelvax Tetra is excreted in human milk. No effects on breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Flucelvax Tetra may be given during lactation.

## Fertility

No human fertility data are available. Animal data, with cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), have not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Flucelvax Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of Flucelvax Tetra in adults 18 years and older was evaluated in a randomised, controlled study (V130\\_01), in which 1 334 subjects received Flucelvax Tetra. Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical study.

The most commonly reported (≥10%) reactions in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra were pain at the injection site (34%), headache (14%), fatigue (14%), myalgia (14%), erythema (13%) and induration (10%).

The incidence of some adverse reactions were considerably lower among subjects ≥ 65 years of age when compared to subjects 18 to &lt; 65 years of age (see table below).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Paediatric population (6 months to less than 18 years of age)

The safety of Flucelvax Tetra in children 6 months to less than 18 years of age has been evaluated in three clinical studies, V130\\_03, V130\\_12 and V130\\_14. In the randomised, controlled study V130\\_03,  1 159 paediatric subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (584 subjects 9 to &lt;18 years; 575 subjects 4 to &lt;9 years). Children 9 to less than 18 years of age received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 4 to less than 9 years of age received one or two doses (separated by 4 weeks) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject's prior influenza vaccination history. In this age group, 235 paediatric subjects received one dose and 340 subjects received two doses. Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical study.

In the multinational, randomised, observer-blind study V130\\_12, the safety population included a total of 2 255 children 2 to less than 18 years of age who received Flucelvax Tetra (580 subjects 2 to &lt; 6 years; 564 subjects 6 to &lt; 9 years; 1 111 subjects 9 to &lt; 18 years). Children 9 to less than 18 years of age received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 2 to less than 9 years of age received one or two doses (separated by 28 days) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject's prior influenza vaccination history.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the multinational, randomised, observer blind study V130\\_14, the safety population included a total of 5 697 subjects 6 months to less than 4 years of age of whom N=2 856 received Flucelvax Tetra. Children received one or two doses (separated by 28 days) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject's prior influenza vaccination history.

The most common local and systemic adverse reactions reported across any paediatric study is described below by sub-group.

T he most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 to less than 18 years of age were pain at the injection site (61%), injection site erythema (25%), injection site induration (19%), fatigue (18%), headache (22%) myalgia (16%),  injection site ecchymosis (11%) and loss of appetite (10%).

The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 months to less than 6 years of age were tenderness at the injection site (54%), injection site erythema (23%), sleepiness (21%), irritability (21%), injection site induration (15%), change in eating habits (16%), diarrhoea (13%), injection site ecchymosis (11%) and fever (11%).

Compared to adults 18 years of age and older, paediatric subjects generally reported higher rates of local and systemic adverse reactions.

In children who received a second dose of Flucelvax Tetra, the incidence of adverse reactions following the second dose of vaccine was similar or slightly lower to that observed with the first dose.

The highest frequency of adverse reactions in children 6 months to less and 18 years of age in these clinical studies are described in Table 2 below.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are no data for overdose with Flucelvax Tetra. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Flucelvax Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two B types) contained in the vaccine. Flucelvax Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses.

Flucelvax Tetra is manufactured using Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells.

Specific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human studies, antibody titres of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.

Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype.

Annual revaccination with current influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to year.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Adults 18 years of age and older

Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in adults 18 years of age and older in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130\\_01). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1334) or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c (N = 677) or TIV2c (N = 669)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed, 21 days after vaccination.

The immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions, defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of &lt;1:10 with a post vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre -vaccination HI titre of ≥ 10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in serum HI antibody titre.

Flucelvax Tetra was non-inferior to TIVc. Non-inferiority was established for all 4 influenza strains included in Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs and the differences in the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following vaccination. The antibody response to influenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to the antibody response after vaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate lineage. There was no evidence that the addition of the second influenza B strain resulted in immune interference to other strains included in the vaccine.

Age subgroup analyses in subjects 18 to less than 65 years of age and 65 years of age and above confirmed that HI antibody responses (GMT and differences in vaccine group seroconversion rates) met non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria 3 weeks following vaccination for all 4 influenza strains in both age groups.

The non-inferiority data observed are summarised in Table 3.

## Clinical efficacy of cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) against culture-confirmed influenza in adults

The efficacy experience with TIVc is relevant to Flucelvax Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

A multinational, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study (V58P13) was performed to assess clinical efficacy and safety of TIVc during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to less than 50 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive TIVc (N = 3828), Agrippal (N = 3676) or placebo (N = 3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio.

TIVc efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness caused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases were identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral temperature ≥ 100.0°F / 38°C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab samples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral strains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were calculated (Table 4).

## Paediatric population

Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Children and Adolescents 4 to less than 18 Years of Age Immunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in children 4 to less than 18 years of age as part of a randomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130\\_03). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1 159) or one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c (N = 593), or TIV2c (N = 580)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed 21 days after vaccination.

The immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs of HI antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions (seroconversion rate), defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of &lt;1:10 with a post-vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre -vaccination HI titr e ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in serum HI antibody titre.

Flucelvax Tetra was noninferior to TIVc in children 4 to less than 18 years of age. Non-inferiority was established for all 4 influenza strains included in the Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs and the differences in the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following vaccination. The antibody response to influenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to the antibody response after vaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate lineage. There was no evidence that the addition of the second B strain resulted in immune interference to other strains included in the vaccine.

The immunogenicity data in subjects 4 to less than 18 years of age are summarised in Table 5.

Clinical efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in the paediatric population 6 months to less than 18 years of age Absolute efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in the paediatric population was evaluated in two clinical studies. Efficacy  in children 2 to less than 18 years of age was evaluated in Study V130\\_12. This was a multinational, randomised, non-influenza vaccine comparator-controlled efficacy study conducted in 8 countries over 3 influenza seasons, in which 4 514 subjects were enrolled to received 0.5 ml of Flucelvax Tetra or a non-influenza comparator in a 1:1 ratio. Based on influenza vaccination history, participants received one or two doses (28 days apart) of the study vaccine.

Flucelvax Tetra efficacy was assessed by the prevention of confirmed influenza illness caused by any influenza Type A or B strain.  Influenza cases were identified by active surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and confirmed by viral culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  An ILI episode was defined as a fever body temperature ≥ 37.8°C) along with at least one of the following: cough,  sore  throat,  nasal  congestion,  or  rhinorrhoea.  Vaccine  efficacy  against  laboratory  confirmed influenza was calculated (Table 6).

1 Number of subjects in the Full-Analysis Set (FAS)- Efficacy, which included all subjects randomised, received a study vaccination and provided efficacy data.

Efficacy in children 6 months to less than 4 years was evaluated in Study V130\\_14. This was a multinational, randomised, observer-blind, non-influenza vaccine comparator-controlled efficacy study conducted in 15 countries over 5 influenza seasons, in which 5 697 subjects received either 0.5 ml of Flucelvax Tetra or a non-influenza comparator in a 1:1 ratio. Based on influenza vaccination history, participants received one or two doses (28 days apart) of the study vaccine.

Flucelvax Tetra efficacy was assessed by the prevention of confirmed influenza illness caused by any influenza Type A or B strain. Influenza cases were identified by active surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. An ILI episode was defined as a fever body temperature ≥ 37.8°C with at least one of the following on the same day: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, earache or ear discharge. Vaccine efficacy against laboratory confirmed influenza was calculated (Table 7).

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra
3. How Flucelvax Tetra is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Flucelvax Tetra
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for

Flucelvax Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax Tetra is prepared in cell cultures, and, therefore, is egg-free.

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

Flucelvax Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 6 months of age.

The vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World Health Organisation for the 2024/2025 Season.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra

## You should not receive Flucelvax Tetra:

If you are allergic to:

- the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, or polysorbate 80, which are trace residues from the manufacturing process.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Flucelvax Tetra.

## BEFORE receiving the vaccine

- Your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration. This reaction may occur with Flucelvax Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected.
- You should tell your doctor if you have an acute illness associated with fever. Your doctor may decide to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see section 'Other medicines and Flucelvax Tetra').
- You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

As with all vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## Children aged less than 6 months

This vaccine is currently not recommended in children aged less than 6 months as safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.

## Other medicines and Flucelvax Tetra

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other vaccine.

Flucelvax Tetra may be given at the same time as other vaccines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Influenza vaccines may be given in any trimester of pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Use of Flucelvax Tetra during breast-feeding has not been studied. No effects on breast fed babies are expected. Flucelvax Tetra may be given during breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Flucelvax Tetra has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machines.

## Flucelvax Tetra contains sodium and potassium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.
