## Treatments

## Vaccines Administered:

Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 groups and were vaccinated with 7vPnC or 13vPnC according to the vaccination schedules detailed for each group under ' Study Design ' . On each vaccination day, a single dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC or 7vPnC was administered intramuscularly into the anterolateral muscle of the left thigh.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Immunogenicity Evaluations:

Blood samples for analyses included in this study report were collected at 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in all subjects for each blood sample and expressed as micrograms per milliliter ( μ g/mL). A randomly selected subset was to be analyzed for serum opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) elicited by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) at the time indicated above. Subjects were randomly assigned by an independent statistician.

## Safety Evaluations:

The safety of 13vPnC in this study was determined based on incidence rates of local reactions (redness, swelling and tenderness at the site of study vaccine injection), systemic events (decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, fever, and use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms), and AEs. Subjects were observed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination for any significant acute reactions. Observations after vaccination were to be performed according to local immunization practice.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

Seven (7) analysis populations were planned for the study overall; 6 immunogenicity analysis populations and the safety population. Data for infant series 2 immunogenicity populations were included in the infant CSR (see P046 57 AR).

Data for the following 4 remaining immunogenicity populations are included in this report:

## Pre-toddler Dose Evaluable Infant Pneumococcal Immunogenicity Population

This population is referred throughout the CSR as the ' evaluable pre-toddler dose immunogenicity population ' , and included subjects who met all of the following criteria:

1. Eligible for the study;
2. 41 to 78 days of age, inclusive, on the day of randomization (this was also the day of first vaccination for Group 3);
3. Received the vaccine to which they were randomly assigned at all infant doses (when vaccinated);
4. Received all 3 study vaccinations for Group 1, 2, 3, and both study vaccinations for Group 4, during the infant series;

6. Had no major protocol violations as determined by the clinical lead or clinicians for the immunogenicity evaluable population;
7. Were 364 to 469 days of age, inclusive, at the pre-toddler dose blood draw;
8. Had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result before the toddler dose that would contribute to the planned analysis; and,
9. Note: the above condition was considered met if the subject had a valid and determinate pretoddler dose assay result for any pneumococcal serotype (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F).
10. Had the blood draw before the toddler dose within the required time frame (within 1 day before or on the day of the toddler dose).

## Evaluable Toddler Dose Pneumococcal Immunogenicity Population

This population is referred throughout the CSR as the ' evaluable toddler dose immunogenicity population ' , and included subjects who met all of the following criteria:

1. Eligible for the study;
2. 41 to 78 days of age, inclusive, on the day of randomization (this was also the day of first vaccinations for Group 3);
3. 364 to 469 days of age, inclusive, on the day of toddler dose;
4. Received the vaccine to which they were randomly assigned at all infant doses and toddler dose (when vaccinated);
5. Received all 4 study vaccinations (3 infant doses and 1 toddler dose) for Groups 1, 2 and 3, and all 3 study vaccinations (2 infant doses and 1 toddler dose) for Group 4;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6. Had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result after the toddler dose that would contribute to the planned analysis;
7. Note: the above condition was considered met if the subject had a valid and determinate pretoddler dose assay result for any pneumococcal serotype (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F).
8. Had blood draw after the toddler dose within the required time frame (27 to 56 days after the toddler dose);
9. Received no prohibited vaccines before blood draw after the toddler dose; and,
10. Had no major protocol violations as determined by the clinical lead or clinicians for the immunogenicity evaluable population.

## Pre-toddler Dose All-Available Infant Pneumococcal Immunogenicity Population

This population is referred to throughout this CSR as the ' all-available pre-toddler dose immunogenicity population ' , and included subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result from the pre-toddler dose blood draw for each group.

## All-Available Toddler Dose Pneumococcal Immunogenicity Population

This population is referred to throughout this CSR as the ' all-available toddler dose immunogenicity population ' , and included subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result from the blood draw after the toddler dose for each group.

## Safety Population:

The safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine.

## Immunogenicity Analysis:

Statistical procedures similar to those used for the primary endpoints above were performed for the secondary immunogenicity endpoints, 95% CIs (instead of 97.5% CIs) were calculated for the differences in proportions for responders, both for IgG concentrations and OPA titers.

The immunogenicity analyses were described in general terms first, and by analysis type second. Missing values were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses; no imputation or estimation of missing values was attempted.

## Primary Endpoints:

-  The proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series.
-  The serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series.

## Secondary Endpoints:

-  The proportion of subjects in a subset achieving a serotype-specific OPA titer ≥lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series.
-  The serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titer (GMT) for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Proportions of Subjects Achieving Defined Levels

Within each vaccine group and for each pneumococcal serotype, the proportion of subjects achieving an antibody concentration or titer at a prespecified level, i.e. ≥0.35 μg/mL for IgG antibody concentration and LLOQ for OPA titer were computed at proposed analysis endpoints. In addition, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the proportion were calculated.

For primary immunogenicity endpoints responses for 13vPnC in Group 2 and in 13vPnC Group 3, to assess the difference for each serotype separately in the observed proportion responses for 13vPnC in Group 2 and in Group 3 compared with the 7vPnC in Group 1, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 97.5% CIs on the difference in proportions were to be calculated. The noninferiority criterion for primary endpoint with regard to the proportion of subjects achieving IgG antibody concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL only applies to the 7 common serotypes. For both the primary (percentage of subjects achieving serotypespecific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL) and the secondary endpoint (percentage of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ), analysis for the additional 6 serotypes in 13vPnC (which are not in 7vPnC), based on the actual response rates, were to be performed for comparisons of vaccine groups. In addition, for the primary responder endpoint (percentage of subjects achieving serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL), the analyses for the additional 6 serotypes in 13vPnC were also performed based on the lowest response rate among the 7 common serotypes (from the 7vPnC vaccine group). This analysis was performed to bridge antibody response for serotypes not in 7vPnC to 7vPnC efficacy.

## Geometric Means

Geometric Mean (Analysis of a Single Population Mean):

For the toddler dose analysis, two-sided 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution.

Ratio of the Geometric Means (Analysis of Two Population Means):

For the toddler dose analysis, two-sided 95% CIs for the ratio of two geometric means (13vPnC Groups -7vPnC Group 1 reference) were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the difference of the two logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. The mean difference of the logarithmically transformed results was equivalent to the ratio of the two geometric means on the logarithmic scale: log (x/y) =(log x) -(log y).

## Safety Analyses:

The safety of 7vPnC and 13vPnC in this study was determined based on observation of local reactions (including redness, swelling, and tenderness) at the pneumococcal injection site, systemic events (including fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and decreased sleep), use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms, and other AEs reported.

Adverse events were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and were summarized by vaccine group.

Differences in incidence rates of local reactions and systemic events after administration of each dose of study vaccine in the 13vPnC groups relative to the incidence rates in the 7vPnC group were reported.

CHMP's comment: It is noted that for the two primary objectives 97.5% CI were calculated, while 95% CI were used for all secondary analyses. This is acceptable but should be kept in mind when interpreting results.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 1674 subjects randomized in the study, 1556 (93.0%) subjects were vaccinated with the toddler dose. The majority of subjects (&gt;87.2%) in each vaccine group completed the toddler dose and 6-month follow up. A total of 51 (3.0%) subjects who received the toddler dose were withdrawn before the post-toddler dose blood draw. The disposition of subjects was similar across vaccine groups.

In total, 830 (53.3%) male subjects and 726 (46.7%) female subjects were included in the safety population at the time of the toddler dose. The mean ages of subjects in each group were similar at the toddler dose.

## Efficacy results

## Pre-toddler dose:

Before the toddler dose, the proportion of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥ 0.35 µg/mL remained high ( ≥ 82.5%) in Groups 1, 2 and 3 for the common serotypes (Table 2), although slightly lower than that observed after the infant series (Data not shown in this AR).

For the additional serotypes, the proportions of responders in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 (&gt;93.7% all serotypes, except serotype 3 [73.6% in Group 2 and 60.4 in Group 3]) were somewhat lower than after the infant series, but remained higher than in 7vPnC Group 1 before the toddler dose.  In the 7vPnC group the proportions of responders for each additional serotype was higher before the toddler dose than after the infant series, and were particularly high for serotypes 19A (90.2%), 5 (77.9%), and 6A (74.0%).

IgG GMCs for the common and additional serotypes before the toddler dose were consistent with these results (Table 4), and in the 13vPnC groups were lower than after the infant series (Data not shown in this AR). As with the proportion of responders, IgG GMCs for serotype 3 were lower than for other additional serotypes.

Post-toddler dose:

Common serotypes: One month after the toddler dose, the proportions of responders were generally similar or higher ( ≥ 98.3%) than after the infant series for each common serotype in Groups 1, 2, and 3 (Table 3, Infant data not shown in this AR).

One month after the toddler dose, IgG GMCs were higher than after the infant series for each common serotype in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 and 7vPnC Group 1 (Table 5, Infant data not shown in this AR). Based on statistical comparisons between the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, IgG GMCs for the common serotypes in Group 2 were noninferior to those in Group 1 (ie, lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for the ratio &gt;0.5); for serotype 19F the GMC was statistically significantly greater in 13vPnC Group 2 (ie, lower bound of 95% CI for the ratio &gt;1, Table 6).  In addition, the non-inferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes in 13vPnC Group 3 relative to 7vPnC Group 1, and IgG GMCs were statistically significantly greater in Group 3 for serotypes 18C and 19 F (Table 7).

Additional serotypes: For each additional serotype, including serotype 3, the proportions of responders in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series (Table 3, Infant data not shown in this AR). In 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 the proportions of responders were ≥98.8% for each additional serotype. In 7vPnC Group 1, the proportion responders was ≥84.9% for serotypes 5, 6A, and 19A, and ranged from 16.5% to 18.8% for serotypes 1, 3, and 7F.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IgG GMCs for each additional serotype in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were numerically higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series, except for serotype 3 in Groups 2 and 3 (Table 4, Infant data not shown in this AR).

When compared with GMCs in 7vPnC Group 1, the IgG GMCs for each additional serotype in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 were statistically significantly higher (lower bound of the 95% CI for the GMC ratios was &gt;1, Table 5 and Table 6).

## OPA GMTs for the toddler dose after a 3-dose infant series

Pre-toddler :

Before the toddler dose, OPA GMTs for the common serotypes were lower than GMTs after the infant series in Groups 1, 2 and 3, and were generally lower in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 than in 7vPnC Group 1. For the additional serotypes, GMTs in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 were lower, and in 7vPnC Group 1 were similar or lower, before the toddler dose than after the infant series (Table 7, Infant data not shown in this AR).

Post-toddler dose:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Common serotypes : One month after the toddler dose, OPA GMTs were higher than after the infant series for each common serotype in Groups 1, 2, and 3, with the exception of serotype 14 in Groups 1 and 2 (Table 8 Infant data not shown in this AR).

Based on statistical comparisons between the 13vPnC and 7vPnC groups, OPA GMTs for all common serotypes in Group 2 or Group 3 were noninferior to those in Group 1 (ie, lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &gt;0.5); the GMT for serotype 19F was statistically significantly greater in 13vPnC Group 2 and Group 3 each relative to 7vPnC Group 1 (ie, lower bound of 95% CI for the ratio &gt;1, Table 9 and Table 10).

Additional serotypes : OPA GMTs for each additional serotype in Groups 2 and 3 were numerically higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series, except for serotype 3 in Group 2 (Table 8 Infant data not shown in this AR).

When compared with GMTs in 7vPnC Group 1, the OPA GMTs for each additional serotype in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 were statistically significantly higher (lower bound of the 95% CI for the GMT ratios was &gt;1, Table 9 and Table 10).

CHMP's comment: The OPA GMTs in the Prevenar 13 groups were differed more compared to the IgG results. However, the responses to the toddler dose were consistent, and in agreement with previously reported results. The data do not cause further concern.

## IgG results for the toddler dose administered after a 2-dose infant series

## Pre-toddler dose :

Common serotypes : Before the toddler dose, the proportion of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 µg/mL ranged from 72.6% to 99.6% in 13vPnC Group 4 for the common serotypes (for most serotypes somewhat lower than after the infant series, Table 1 Infant data not shown in this AR). IgG GMCs for the common serotypes were consistent with these results (Table 3, Infant data not shown in this AR).

Additional serotypes: Before the toddler dose, the proportion of responders in 13vPnC Group 4 (&gt;93.7% all additional serotypes, except serotype 3 [63.6%]) were somewhat lower than after the infant series, but remained higher than in 7vPnC Group 1 before the toddler dose (Table 1 Infant data not shown in this AR).

IgG GMCs before the toddler dose were lower than after the infant series in Group 4; however, GMCs at the pretoddler time point remained higher in 13vPnC Group 4 than in 7vPnC Group 1 (Table 3 Infant data not shown in this AR). As noted for the other 13vPnC groups, IgG GMCs for serotype 3 in Group 4 were lower than for other additional serotypes.

## Post-toddler dose:

Common serotypes : The proportion of responders in Group 4 was higher (≥97.7%) 1 month after the toddler dose than after the infant series for each common serotype (Table 2 Infant data not shown in this AR). IgG GMCs were also higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series and were generally similar to GMCs for the other study groups (Table 4 Infant data not shown in this AR).

Based on statistical comparisons between the 13vPnC Group 4 and 7vPnC Group 1, IgG GMCs for all common serotypes in Group 4 were noninferior to those in Group 1 (ie, lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &gt;0.5 [although noninferiority was not prespecified for this analysis]); for serotype 19F the GMC was statistically significantly greater in 13vPnC Group 4 (ie, lower bound of 95% CI for the ratio &gt;1, Table 11).

Additional serotypes : The proportions of responders to the additional serotypes in Group 4 (≥98.6%) were similar or higher than observed after the infant series and were generally similar to those of 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 (Table 2 Infant data not shown in this AR).  IgG GMCs for each additional serotype in Groups 4 were numerically higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series, except for serotype 3 (Table 4 Infant data not shown in this AR).

When compared with GMCs in 7vPnC Group 1, the IgG GMCs for each additional serotype in 13vPnC Group 4 was statistically significantly higher (lower bound of the 95% CI for the GMC ratios was &gt;1, Table 11).

## OPA GMTs for the toddler dose administered after a 2-dose infant series

Pre-toddler :

Before the toddler dose, OPA GMTs for the common serotypes were lower in 13vPnC Group 4 than in 7vPnC Group 1, except for serotype 19F. For the additional serotypes, GMTs in 13vPnC Group 4 were higher than in 7vPnC Group 1 (Table 7). OPA GMTs in Group 4 were generally similar or lower than titers in the other 13vPnC groups. OPA GMTs for all serotypes were lower before the toddler dose than after the infant series (Table 7, Infant data not shown in this AR).

Post-toddler dose:

Common serotypes : One month after the toddler dose, OPA GMTs were numerically higher than after the infant series for each common serotype in Group 4, with the exception of serotype 14 (Table 8,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Infant data not shown in this AR). OPA GMTs in Group 4 were generally similar to those in the other groups for most common serotypes.

Although noninferiority was not predefined for the toddler dose, OPA GMTs in Group 4 met the noninferiority criterion when compared to those in Group 1 (ie, lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &gt;0.5) for all common serotypes, except serotypes 6B and 23F; the GMT for serotype 19F was statistically significantly greater in 13vPnC Group 4 relative to 7vPnC Group 1 (ie, lower bound of 95% CI for the ratio &gt;1, Table 12).

Additional serotypes : OPA GMTs for each additional serotype in Group 4, including serotype 3, were numerically higher after the toddler dose than after the infant series (Table 8 Infant data not shown in this AR).

The OPA GMTs for the additional serotypes in 13vPnC Group 4 were statistically significantly higher (lower bound of the 95% CI for the GMC ratios was &gt;1, Table 12) than those in 7vPnC Group 1.

CHMP's comment: The results for the toddler dose given after 2-dose primary schedule (group 4) were in agreement with the other results (tables 2-5), and do not raise further concern.

## Safety results

## Local Reactions:

Toddler dose:

Local reactions were reported infrequently within 7 days after the toddler dose, and the percentages of subjects with local reactions were generally similar across the 4 groups (5.8% to 7.9%, Table 33).

Redness and swelling were mostly mild or moderate in severity in all vaccine groups; the only severe cases were reported in Group 4 (1 event of severe redness [0.4%] and 1 event of severe swelling [0.4%]). Significant local tenderness, defined as interfering with limb movement, was reported in 2 subjects (0.4%) in Group 2 and in 3 subjects (0.7%) in Group 3; no significant tenderness was reported in Group 1 or Group 4.

Differences between groups in percentage of subjects with local reactions were small and not statistically significant for any comparison (Group 2 versus Group 1; Group 3 versus Group 1; Group 2 versus Group 3; and Group 4 versus Group 1.

## Systemic Events:

## Toddler dose:

Systemic events were reported in &lt;10% of subjects in any group within 7 days following the toddler dose, with comparable percentages across the 4 groups (Table 35). Fewer than 7.0% of subjects in each of the 4 groups experienced any fever after the toddler dose.  Moderate fever (temperature &gt;39ºC but ≤40ºC) was reported in &lt;1.0% of subjects in any group. Severe fever (temperature &gt;40ºC) was reported in only 1 subject (13vPnC Group 2) after the toddler dose. Within 7 days after the toddler dose  5.4% of subjects in any group used medication to prevent or treat fever. The statistically significant higher percentages of subjects with any fever or moderate fever observed in Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4 each relative to Group 1 were not likely to be clinically significant. No statistically significant difference was noted for fever of any severity for Group 2 relative to Group 3.

Among the other systemic events (decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and decreased sleep) irritability was reported most frequently in each of the 4 groups (3.1% to 4.4%) within 7 days after the toddler dose (Table 35). No statistically significant differences between groups were observed for systemic events other than fever.

## Adverse Events:

Toddler dose: The percentages of subjects with AEs reported during the toddler dose (from day of toddler dose until the 1-month post-toddler blood draw) across the 4 groups ranged from 4.9% to 7.8%. The most frequently reported AEs were categorized (system organ class [SOC]) as Infections and infestations (  6.3% across groups). The most frequently reported individual AE was nasopharyngitis, which was reported in 2.7 to 5.6% across all groups (Table 41). A total of 7 related AEs were reported in 7 subjects (&lt;1% of subjects in any group).These included: injection site erythema in 1 subject in 7vPnC Group 1; vomiting in 1 subject in 13vPnC Group 2; and pyrexia in 2 subjects each in 13vPnC Groups 2 and 3 and in 1 subject in Group 4.

Most AEs were mild in severity. No severe or life-threatening AEs occurred in any vaccine group after the toddler dose (Table 44). One event of bronchitis was assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and was judged to be an SAE that was not related to a study vaccine; no other SAEs were reported after the toddler dose. No deaths and no withdrawal from the study due to an AE were reported after the toddler dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6-month follow up : Only SAEs or newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions were collected during the 6-month follow up period after the toddler dose. Only 2 SAEs (0.2% each) were reported (enteritis and bronchopneumonia) and each occurred in the 7vPnC group. These events were considered by the investigator to be mild in severity and were assessed as not related to the study vaccine. No nonserious AEs (newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions) were reported during the 6-month follow-up period in 13vPnC recipients. No deaths or AE withdrawals from the study were reported during the 6month follow-up.

The safety data provided in Study B1851015 for the infant series, after the infant series, after the toddler dose, and during the 6-month follow-up period presented no notable safety concerns, and were consistent with safety results in other infant studies of 13vPnC.
