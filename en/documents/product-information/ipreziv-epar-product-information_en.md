ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ipreziv 20 mg tablets

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each tablet contains 20 mg of azilsartan medoxomil (as potassium). For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Tablet. White to nearly white round tablets, 6.0 mm in diameter, debossed 'ASL' on one side and '20' on the other. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Ipreziv is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled at the lower dose. Near-maximal antihypertensive effect is evident at 2 weeks, with maximal effects attained by 4 weeks. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Ipreziv alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved when Ipreziv is coadministered with other antihypertensive medicinal products, including diuretics (such as chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide) and calcium channel blockers (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Older people (65 years and over)

No initial dose adjustment with Ipreziv is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2), although consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose in the very elderly (≥ 75 years), who may be at risk of hypotension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

As there is limited experience of use of Ipreziv in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment close monitoring is recommended and consideration should be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 5.2).

Intravascular volume depletion For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or salt depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics), Ipreziv should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 4.4). Heart failure Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see section 4.4). Black population No dose adjustment is required in the black population, although smaller reductions in blood pressure are observed compared with a non-black population (see section 5.1). This generally has been true for other angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Consequently, uptitration of Ipreziv and concomitant therapy may be needed more frequently for blood pressure control in black patients. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Ipreziv in children and adolescents 0 to &lt; 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration Ipreziv is for oral use and may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. - Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). - The concomitant use of Ipreziv with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal impairment or renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system, such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria or, rarely, acute renal failure. The possibility of similar effects cannot be excluded with Ipreziv.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment, congestive heart failure or renal artery stenosis, as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Excessive blood pressure decreases in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.

## Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Kidney transplantation There is currently no experience on the use of Ipreziv in patients who have recently undergone kidney transplantation. Hepatic impairment Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Hypotension in volume- and /or salt-depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Ipreziv. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to administration of Ipreziv, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision, and consideration can be given to a starting dose of 20 mg. Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Ipreziv is not recommended in these patients. Hyperkalaemia Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, concomitant use of Ipreziv with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium in hypertensive patients (see section 4.5). In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients and/or in patients with other co-morbidities, the risk of hyperkalaemia, which may be fatal, is increased. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral valve stenosis, or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Lithium

As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists the combination of lithium and Ipreziv is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Concomitant use not recommended

Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A similar effect may occur with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Due to the lack of experience with concomitant use of azilsartan medoxomil and lithium, this combination is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid &gt; 3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II receptor antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium. Therefore, adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment are recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products (e.g. heparin) may increase potassium levels. Monitoring of serum potassium should be undertaken as appropriate (see section 4.4). Additional information Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). No clinically significant interactions have been reported in studies of azilsartan medoxomil or azilsartan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlortalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, and warfarin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolysed to the active moiety azilsartan by esterases in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during drug absorption (see section 5.2). In vitro studies indicated that interactions based on esterase inhibition are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

There are no data from the use of Ipreziv in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there are no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Breastfeeding Because no information is available regarding the use of Ipreziv during breastfeeding, Ipreziv is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breastfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Fertility No data are available on the effect of Ipreziv on human fertility. Nonclinical studies demonstrated that azilsartan did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Based on its pharmacodynamic properties it is expected that azilsartan medoxomil would have negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when taking any antihypertensive it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or tiredness may occur. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Ipreziv at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in patients treated for up to 56 weeks. In these clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with treatment with Ipreziv were mostly mild or moderate, with an overall incidence similar to placebo. The most common adverse reaction was dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions with Ipreziv was not affected by gender, age, or race.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions based on pooled data (40 and 80 mg doses) are listed below according to system organ class and preferred terms. These are ranked by frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000, &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), including isolated reports. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency for the Ipreziv 20 mg dose as with the 40 and 80 mg doses in one placebo controlled study.

Nervous system disorders Vascular disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders General disorders and administration site conditions Investigations Description of selected adverse reactions When Ipreziv was coadministered with chlortalidone, the frequencies of blood creatinine increased and hypotension were increased from uncommon to common. When Ipreziv was coadministered with amlodipine, the frequency of peripheral oedema was increased from uncommon to common, but was lower than amlodipine alone. Investigations Serum creatinine The incidence of elevations in serum creatinine following treatment with Ipreziv was similar to placebo in the randomised placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. Coadministration of Ipreziv with diuretics, such as chlortalidone, resulted in a greater incidence of creatinine elevations, an observation consistent with that of other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The elevations in serum creatinine during coadminstiration of Ipreziv with diuretics were associated with larger blood pressure reductions compared with a single medicinal product. Many of these elevations were transient or nonprogressive while subjects continued to receive treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment, the majority of the elevations that had not resolved during treatment were reversible, with the creatinine levels of most subjects returning to Baseline or nearBaseline values.

## Uric acid

Small mean increases of serum uric acid were observed with Ipreziv (10.8 µmol/l) compared with placebo (4.3 µmol/l).

## Hemoglobin and hematocrit

Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 3 g/l and 1 volume percent, respectively) were observed in placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. This effect is also seen with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Ipreziv was compared with placebo and active comparators in two 6-week randomized, double blind studies. Blood pressure reductions compared with placebo based on 24 hour mean blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and clinic blood pressure measurements at trough are shown in the table below for both studies. Additionally, Ipreziv 80 mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in SBP than the highest approved doses of olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan.

Based on pharmacological considerations, the main manifestation of an overdose is likely to be symptomatic hypotension and dizziness. During controlled clinical studies in healthy subjects, once daily doses up to 320 mg of Ipreziv were administered for 7 days and were well tolerated. Management If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted and vital signs monitored. Azilsartan is not removed by dialysis. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain ATC Code: C09CA09 Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effect Azilsartan medoxomil is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active moiety, azilsartan, which selectively antagonises the effects of angiotensin II by blocking its binding to the AT1 receptor in multiple tissues (see section 5.2). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Blockade of the AT1 receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the antihypertensive effect of azilsartan. Essential hypertension In seven double blind controlled studies, a total of 5941 patients (3672 given Ipreziv, 801 given placebo, and 1468 given active comparator) were evaluated. Overall, 51% of patients were male and 26% were 65 years or older (5% ≥ 75 years); 67% were white and 19% were black. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Coadministration of Ipreziv 40 and 80 mg with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or a thiazidetype diuretic (chlortalidone) resulted in additional blood pressure reductions compared with the other antihypertensive alone. Dose dependent adverse events including dizziness, hypotension and serum creatinine elevations were more frequent with diuretic coadministration compared with Ipreziv alone, while hypokalemia was less frequent compared with diuretic alone.

Doses were force-titrated at Week 2 from 20 to 40 mg and 40 to 80 mg for Ipreziv, and 20 to 40 mg and 160 to 320 mg, respectively, for olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan In these two studies, clinically important and most common adverse events included dizziness, headache and dyslipidemia. For Ipreziv, olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan, respectively dizziness was observed at an incidence of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8%; headache at 4.8%, 5.5% and 7.6% and dyslipidemia at 3.5%, 2.4% and 1.1%. In active-comparator studies with either valsartan or ramipril, the blood-pressure-lowering effect with Ipreziv was sustained during long-term treatment. Ipreziv had a lower incidence of cough (1.2%) compared with ramipril (8.2%). The antihypertensive effect of Ipreziv occurred within the first 2 weeks of dosing with the full effect achieved by 4 weeks. The blood pressure lowering effect of Ipreziv was also maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios for SBP and DBP were approximately 80% or higher. Rebound hypertension was not observed following abrupt cessation of Ipreziv therapy after 6 months of treatment. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity to blood pressure lowering effects in some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out (see section 4.2). As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors the antihypertensive effect was lower in black patients (usually a lowrenin population).

Beneficial effects of Ipreziv on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are currently unknown.

## Effect on cardiac repolarisation

A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted to assess the potential of Ipreziv to prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation at a dose of 320 mg of Ipreziv.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ipreziv in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Additional information

The estimated absolute oral bioavailability of azilsartan medoxomil based on plasma levels of azilsartan is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not affect the bioavailability of azilsartan (see section 4.2).

Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Following oral administration, azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active moiety azilsartan in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during absorption. Based on in vitro studies, carboxymethylenebutenolidase is involved in the hydrolysis in the intestine and liver. In addition, plasma esterases are involved in the hydrolysis of azilsartan medoxomil to azilsartan. Absorption Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16 litres. Azilsartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Azilsartan is metabolised to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O -dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% that of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Ipreziv. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.

## Elimination

Following an oral dose of 14 C-labelled azilsartan medoxomil, approximately 55% of radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 42% in urine, with 15% of the dose excreted in urine as azilsartan. The elimination half-life of azilsartan is approximately 11 hours and renal clearance is approximately 2.3 ml/min. Steady-state levels of azilsartan are achieved within 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with repeated once-daily dosing.

Linearity/non-linearity Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. Characteristics in specific groups of patients Paediatric population The pharmacokinetics of azilsartan have not been studied in children under 18 years of age. Older people Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between young (age range 18-45 years) and elderly (age range 65-85 years) patients. Renal impairment In patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment azilsartan total exposure (AUC) was +30%, +25% and +95% increased. No increase (+5%) was observed in end-stage renal disease patients who were dialysed. However, there is no clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 4.2). Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation. Hepatic impairment Administration of Ipreziv for up to 5 days in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (ChildPugh B) hepatic impairment resulted in slight increase in azilsartan exposure (AUC increased by 1.3 to 1.6 fold, see section 4.2). Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Gender Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between males and females. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Race

Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between black and white populations. No dose adjustment is necessary based on race.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In preclinical safety studies, azilsartan medoxomil and M-II, the major human metabolite, were examined for repeated-dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.

In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters, changes in the kidney and renal haemodynamics, as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals. These effects, which

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were prevented by oral saline supplementation, do not have clinical significance in treatment of hypertension.

In rats and dogs, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.

Azilsartan and M-II crossed the placenta and were found in the fetuses of pregnant rats and were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. In the reproduction toxicity studies, there were no effects on male or female fertility. There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, a slight delay in physical development (delayed incisor eruption, pinna detachment, eye opening), and higher mortality.

Azilsartan and M-II showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. 6.

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ipreziv 40 mg tablets

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each tablet contains 40 mg of azilsartan medoxomil (as potassium). For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Tablet. White to nearly white round tablets, 7.6 mm in diameter, debossed 'ASL' on one side and '40' on the other. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Ipreziv is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled at the lower dose. Near-maximal antihypertensive effect is evident at 2 weeks, with maximal effects attained by 4 weeks. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Ipreziv alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved when Ipreziv is coadministered with other antihypertensive medicinal products, including diuretics (such as chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide) and calcium channel blockers (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Older people (65 years and over)

No initial dose adjustment with Ipreziv is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2), although consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose in the very elderly (≥ 75 years), who may be at risk of hypotension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

As there is limited experience of use of Ipreziv in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment close monitoring is recommended and consideration should be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 5.2).

Intravascular volume depletion For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or salt depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics), Ipreziv should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 4.4). Heart failure Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see section 4.4). Black population No dose adjustment is required in the black population, although smaller reductions in blood pressure are observed compared with a non-black population (see section 5.1). This generally has been true for other angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Consequently, uptitration of Ipreziv and concomitant therapy may be needed more frequently for blood pressure control in black patients. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Ipreziv in children and adolescents 0 to &lt; 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration Ipreziv is for oral use and may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. - Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). - The concomitant use of Ipreziv with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal impairment or renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system, such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria or, rarely, acute renal failure. The possibility of similar effects cannot be excluded with Ipreziv.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment, congestive heart failure or renal artery stenosis, as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Excessive blood pressure decreases in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.

## Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Kidney transplantation There is currently no experience on the use of Ipreziv in patients who have recently undergone kidney transplantation. Hepatic impairment Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Hypotension in volume- and /or salt-depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Ipreziv. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to administration of Ipreziv, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision, and consideration can be given to a starting dose of 20 mg. Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Ipreziv is not recommended in these patients. Hyperkalaemia Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, concomitant use of Ipreziv with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium in hypertensive patients (see section 4.5). In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients and/or in patients with other co-morbidities, the risk of hyperkalaemia, which may be fatal, is increased. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral valve stenosis, or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Lithium

As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists the combination of lithium and Ipreziv is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Concomitant use not recommended

Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A similar effect may occur with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Due to the lack of experience with concomitant use of azilsartan medoxomil and lithium, this combination is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid &gt; 3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II receptor antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium. Therefore, adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment are recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products (e.g. heparin) may increase potassium levels. Monitoring of serum potassium should be undertaken as appropriate (see section 4.4). Additional information Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). No clinically significant interactions have been reported in studies of azilsartan medoxomil or azilsartan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlortalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, and warfarin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolysed to the active moiety azilsartan by esterases in the gastro intestinal tract and/or during drug absorption (see section 5.2). In vitro studies indicated that interactions based on esterase inhibition are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

There are no data from the use of Ipreziv in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there are no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Breastfeeding Because no information is available regarding the use of Ipreziv during breastfeeding, Ipreziv is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breastfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Fertility No data are available on the effect of Ipreziv on human fertility. Nonclinical studies demonstrated that azilsartan did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Based on its pharmacodynamic properties it is expected that azilsartan medoxomil would have negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when taking any antihypertensive it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or tiredness may occur. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Ipreziv at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in patients treated for up to 56 weeks. In these clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with treatment with Ipreziv were mostly mild or moderate, with an overall incidence similar to placebo. The most common adverse reaction was dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions with Ipreziv was not affected by gender, age, or race.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions based on pooled data (40 and 80 mg doses) are listed below according to system organ class and preferred terms. These are ranked by frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000, &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), including isolated reports. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency for the Ipreziv 20 mg dose as with the 40 and 80 mg doses in one placebo controlled study.

Nervous system disorders Vascular disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders General disorders and administration site conditions Investigations Description of selected adverse reactions When Ipreziv was coadministered with chlortalidone, the frequencies of blood creatinine increased and hypotension were increased from uncommon to common. When Ipreziv was coadministered with amlodipine, the frequency of peripheral oedema was increased from uncommon to common, but was lower than amlodipine alone. Investigations Serum creatinine The incidence of elevations in serum creatinine following treatment with Ipreziv was similar to placebo in the randomised placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. Coadministration of Ipreziv with diuretics, such as chlortalidone, resulted in a greater incidence of creatinine elevations, an observation consistent with that of other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The elevations in serum creatinine during coadminstiration of Ipreziv with diuretics were associated with larger blood pressure reductions compared with a single medicinal product. Many of these elevations were transient or nonprogressive while subjects continued to receive treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment, the majority of the elevations that had not resolved during treatment were reversible, with the creatinine levels of most subjects returning to Baseline or nearBaseline values.

## Uric acid

Small mean increases of serum uric acid were observed with Ipreziv (10.8 µmol/l) compared with placebo (4.3 µmol/l).

## Hemoglobin and hematocrit

Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 3 g/l and 1 volume percent, respectively) were observed in placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. This effect is also seen with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Ipreziv was compared with placebo and active comparators in two 6-week randomized, double blind studies. Blood pressure reductions compared with placebo based on 24 hour mean blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and clinic blood pressure measurements at trough are shown in the table below for both studies. Additionally, Ipreziv 80 mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in SBP than the highest approved doses of olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan.

Based on pharmacological considerations, the main manifestation of an overdose is likely to be symptomatic hypotension and dizziness. During controlled clinical studies in healthy subjects, once daily doses up to 320 mg of Ipreziv were administered for 7 days and were well tolerated. Management If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted and vital signs monitored. Azilsartan is not removed by dialysis. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain ATC Code: C09CA09 Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effect Azilsartan medoxomil is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active moiety, azilsartan, which selectively antagonises the effects of angiotensin II by blocking its binding to the AT1 receptor in multiple tissues (see section 5.2). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Blockade of the AT1 receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the antihypertensive effect of azilsartan. Essential hypertension In seven double blind controlled studies, a total of 5941 patients (3672 given Ipreziv, 801 given placebo, and 1468 given active comparator) were evaluated. Overall, 51% of patients were male and 26% were 65 years or older (5% ≥ 75 years); 67% were white and 19% were black. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Coadministration of Ipreziv 40 and 80 mg with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or a thiazidetype diuretic (chlortalidone) resulted in additional blood pressure reductions compared with the other antihypertensive alone. Dose dependent adverse events including dizziness, hypotension and serum creatinine elevations were more frequent with diuretic coadministration compared with Ipreziv alone, while hypokalemia was less frequent compared with diuretic alone.

Doses were force-titrated at Week 2 from 20 to 40 mg and 40 to 80 mg for Ipreziv, and 20 to 40 mg and 160 to 320 mg, respectively, for olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan In these two studies, clinically important and most common adverse events included dizziness, headache and dyslipidemia. For Ipreziv, olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan, respectively dizziness was observed at an incidence of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8%; headache at 4.8%, 5.5% and 7.6% and dyslipidemia at 3.5%, 2.4% and 1.1%. In active-comparator studies with either valsartan or ramipril, the blood-pressure-lowering effect with Ipreziv was sustained during long-term treatment. Ipreziv had a lower incidence of cough (1.2%) compared with ramipril (8.2%). The antihypertensive effect of Ipreziv occurred within the first 2 weeks of dosing with the full effect achieved by 4 weeks. The blood pressure lowering effect of Ipreziv was also maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios for SBP and DBP were approximately 80% or higher. Rebound hypertension was not observed following abrupt cessation of Ipreziv therapy after 6 months of treatment. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity to blood pressure lowering effects in some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out (see section 4.2). As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors the antihypertensive effect was lower in black patients (usually a lowrenin population).

Beneficial effects of Ipreziv on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are currently unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect on cardiac repolarisation

A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted to assess the potential of Ipreziv to prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation at a dose of 320 mg of Ipreziv.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ipreziv in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Additional information

The estimated absolute oral bioavailability of azilsartan medoxomil based on plasma levels of azilsartan is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not affect the bioavailability of azilsartan (see section 4.2).

Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Following oral administration, azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active moiety azilsartan in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during absorption. Based on in vitro studies, carboxymethylenebutenolidase is involved in the hydrolysis in the intestine and liver. In addition, plasma esterases are involved in the hydrolysis of azilsartan medoxomil to azilsartan. Absorption Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16 litres. Azilsartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Azilsartan is metabolised to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O -dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% that of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Ipreziv. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.

## Elimination

Following an oral dose of 14 C-labelled azilsartan medoxomil, approximately 55% of radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 42% in urine, with 15% of the dose excreted in urine as azilsartan. The elimination half-life of azilsartan is approximately 11 hours and renal clearance is approximately 2.3 ml/min. Steady-state levels of azilsartan are achieved within 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with repeated once-daily dosing.

Linearity/non-linearity Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. Characteristics in specific groups of patients Paediatric population The pharmacokinetics of azilsartan have not been studied in children under 18 years of age. Older people Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between young (age range 18-45 years) and elderly (age range 65-85 years) patients. Renal impairment In patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment azilsartan total exposure (AUC) was +30%, +25% and +95% increased. No increase (+5%) was observed in end-stage renal disease patients who were dialysed. However, there is no clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 4.2). Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation. Hepatic impairment Administration of Ipreziv for up to 5 days in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (ChildPugh B) hepatic impairment resulted in slight increase in azilsartan exposure (AUC increased by 1.3 to 1.6 fold, see section 4.2). Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Gender Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between males and females. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Race

Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between black and white populations. No dose adjustment is necessary based on race.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In preclinical safety studies, azilsartan medoxomil and M-II, the major human metabolite, were examined for repeated-dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.

In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters, changes in the kidney and renal haemodynamics, as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals. These effects, which

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were prevented by oral saline supplementation, do not have clinical significance in treatment of hypertension.

In rats and dogs, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.

Azilsartan and M-II crossed the placenta and were found in the fetuses of pregnant rats and were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. In the reproduction toxicity studies, there were no effects on male or female fertility. There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, a slight delay in physical development (delayed incisor eruption, pinna detachment, eye opening), and higher mortality.

Azilsartan and M-II showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. 6.

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Ipreziv 80 mg tablets

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each tablet contains 80 mg of azilsartan medoxomil (as potassium). For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Tablet. White to nearly white round tablets, 9.6 mm in diameter, debossed 'ASL' on one side and '80' on the other. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Ipreziv is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled at the lower dose. Near-maximal antihypertensive effect is evident at 2 weeks, with maximal effects attained by 4 weeks. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Ipreziv alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved when Ipreziv is coadministered with other antihypertensive medicinal products, including diuretics (such as chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide) and calcium channel blockers (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special populations

## Older people (65 years and over)

No initial dose adjustment with Ipreziv is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2), although consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose in the very elderly (≥ 75 years), who may be at risk of hypotension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

As there is limited experience of use of Ipreziv in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment close monitoring is recommended and consideration should be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 5.2).

Intravascular volume depletion For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or salt depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics), Ipreziv should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 4.4). Heart failure Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see section 4.4). Black population No dose adjustment is required in the black population, although smaller reductions in blood pressure are observed compared with a non-black population (see section 5.1). This generally has been true for other angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Consequently, uptitration of Ipreziv and concomitant therapy may be needed more frequently for blood pressure control in black patients. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Ipreziv in children and adolescents 0 to &lt; 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration Ipreziv is for oral use and may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 4.3 Contraindications - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. - Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). - The concomitant use of Ipreziv with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal impairment or renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system, such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria or, rarely, acute renal failure. The possibility of similar effects cannot be excluded with Ipreziv.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment, congestive heart failure or renal artery stenosis, as there is no experience of use of Ipreziv in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Excessive blood pressure decreases in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.

## Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Kidney transplantation There is currently no experience on the use of Ipreziv in patients who have recently undergone kidney transplantation. Hepatic impairment Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Hypotension in volume- and /or salt-depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Ipreziv. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to administration of Ipreziv, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision, and consideration can be given to a starting dose of 20 mg. Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Ipreziv is not recommended in these patients. Hyperkalaemia Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, concomitant use of Ipreziv with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium in hypertensive patients (see section 4.5). In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients and/or in patients with other co-morbidities, the risk of hyperkalaemia, which may be fatal, is increased. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as appropriate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral valve stenosis, or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

## Pregnancy

Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).

## Lithium

As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists the combination of lithium and Ipreziv is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Concomitant use not recommended

Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A similar effect may occur with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Due to the lack of experience with concomitant use of azilsartan medoxomil and lithium, this combination is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid &gt; 3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II receptor antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium. Therefore, adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment are recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products (e.g. heparin) may increase potassium levels. Monitoring of serum potassium should be undertaken as appropriate (see section 4.4). Additional information Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). No clinically significant interactions have been reported in studies of azilsartan medoxomil or azilsartan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlortalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, and warfarin. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolysed to the active moiety azilsartan by esterases in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during drug absorption (see section 5.2). In vitro studies indicated that interactions based on esterase inhibition are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).

The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

There are no data from the use of Ipreziv in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there are no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Breastfeeding Because no information is available regarding the use of Ipreziv during breastfeeding, Ipreziv is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breastfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Fertility No data are available on the effect of Ipreziv on human fertility. Nonclinical studies demonstrated that azilsartan did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Based on its pharmacodynamic properties it is expected that azilsartan medoxomil would have negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when taking any antihypertensive it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or tiredness may occur. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Ipreziv at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in patients treated for up to 56 weeks. In these clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with treatment with Ipreziv were mostly mild or moderate, with an overall incidence similar to placebo. The most common adverse reaction was dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions with Ipreziv was not affected by gender, age, or race.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions based on pooled data (40 and 80 mg doses) are listed below according to system organ class and preferred terms. These are ranked by frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000, &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), including isolated reports. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency for the Ipreziv 20 mg dose as with the 40 and 80 mg doses in one placebo controlled study.

Nervous system disorders Vascular disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders General disorders and administration site conditions Investigations Description of selected adverse reactions When Ipreziv was coadministered with chlortalidone, the frequencies of blood creatinine increased and hypotension were increased from uncommon to common. When Ipreziv was coadministered with amlodipine, the frequency of peripheral oedema was increased from uncommon to common, but was lower than amlodipine alone. Investigations Serum creatinine The incidence of elevations in serum creatinine following treatment with Ipreziv was similar to placebo in the randomised placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. Coadministration of Ipreziv with diuretics, such as chlortalidone, resulted in a greater incidence of creatinine elevations, an observation consistent with that of other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The elevations in serum creatinine during coadminstiration of Ipreziv with diuretics were associated with larger blood pressure reductions compared with a single medicinal product. Many of these elevations were transient or nonprogressive while subjects continued to receive treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment, the majority of the elevations that had not resolved during treatment were reversible, with the creatinine levels of most subjects returning to Baseline or nearBaseline values.

## Uric acid

Small mean increases of serum uric acid were observed with Ipreziv (10.8 µmol/l) compared with placebo (4.3 µmol/l).

## Hemoglobin and hematocrit

Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 3 g/l and 1 volume percent, respectively) were observed in placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. This effect is also seen with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

Ipreziv was compared with placebo and active comparators in two 6-week randomized, double blind studies. Blood pressure reductions compared with placebo based on 24 hour mean blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and clinic blood pressure measurements at trough are shown in the table below for both studies. Additionally, Ipreziv 80 mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in SBP than the highest approved doses of olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan.

Based on pharmacological considerations, the main manifestation of an overdose is likely to be symptomatic hypotension and dizziness. During controlled clinical studies in healthy subjects, once daily doses up to 320 mg of Ipreziv were administered for 7 days and were well tolerated. Management If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted and vital signs monitored. Azilsartan is not removed by dialysis. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II antagonists, plain ATC Code: C09CA09 Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effect Azilsartan medoxomil is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active moiety, azilsartan, which selectively antagonises the effects of angiotensin II by blocking its binding to the AT1 receptor in multiple tissues (see section 5.2). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Blockade of the AT1 receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the antihypertensive effect of azilsartan. Essential hypertension In seven double blind controlled studies, a total of 5941 patients (3672 given Ipreziv, 801 given placebo, and 1468 given active comparator) were evaluated. Overall, 51% of patients were male and 26% were 65 years or older (5% ≥ 75 years); 67% were white and 19% were black. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Coadministration of Ipreziv 40 and 80 mg with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or a thiazidetype diuretic (chlortalidone) resulted in additional blood pressure reductions compared with the other antihypertensive alone. Dose dependent adverse events including dizziness, hypotension and serum creatinine elevations were more frequent with diuretic coadministration compared with Ipreziv alone, while hypokalemia was less frequent compared with diuretic alone.

Doses were force-titrated at Week 2 from 20 to 40 mg and 40 to 80 mg for Ipreziv, and 20 to 40 mg and 160 to 320 mg, respectively, for olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan In these two studies, clinically important and most common adverse events included dizziness, headache and dyslipidemia. For Ipreziv, olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan, respectively dizziness was observed at an incidence of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8%; headache at 4.8%, 5.5% and 7.6% and dyslipidemia at 3.5%, 2.4% and 1.1%. In active-comparator studies with either valsartan or ramipril, the blood-pressure-lowering effect with Ipreziv was sustained during long-term treatment. Ipreziv had a lower incidence of cough (1.2%) compared with ramipril (8.2%). The antihypertensive effect of Ipreziv occurred within the first 2 weeks of dosing with the full effect achieved by 4 weeks. The blood pressure lowering effect of Ipreziv was also maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios for SBP and DBP were approximately 80% or higher. Rebound hypertension was not observed following abrupt cessation of Ipreziv therapy after 6 months of treatment. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity to blood pressure lowering effects in some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out (see section 4.2). As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors the antihypertensive effect was lower in black patients (usually a lowrenin population).

Beneficial effects of Ipreziv on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are currently unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect on cardiac repolarisation

A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted to assess the potential of Ipreziv to prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation at a dose of 320 mg of Ipreziv.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Ipreziv in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Additional information

The estimated absolute oral bioavailability of azilsartan medoxomil based on plasma levels of azilsartan is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not affect the bioavailability of azilsartan (see section 4.2).

Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Following oral administration, azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active moiety azilsartan in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during absorption. Based on in vitro studies, carboxymethylenebutenolidase is involved in the hydrolysis in the intestine and liver. In addition, plasma esterases are involved in the hydrolysis of azilsartan medoxomil to azilsartan. Absorption Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16 litres. Azilsartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt; 99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

Azilsartan is metabolised to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O -dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% that of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Ipreziv. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.

## Elimination

Following an oral dose of 14 C-labelled azilsartan medoxomil, approximately 55% of radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 42% in urine, with 15% of the dose excreted in urine as azilsartan. The elimination half-life of azilsartan is approximately 11 hours and renal clearance is approximately 2.3 ml/min. Steady-state levels of azilsartan are achieved within 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with repeated once-daily dosing.

Linearity/non-linearity Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. Characteristics in specific groups of patients Paediatric population The pharmacokinetics of azilsartan have not been studied in children under 18 years of age. Older people Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between young (age range 18-45 years) and elderly (age range 65-85 years) patients. Renal impairment In patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment azilsartan total exposure (AUC) was +30%, +25% and +95% increased. No increase (+5%) was observed in end-stage renal disease patients who were dialysed. However, there is no clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 4.2). Hemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation. Hepatic impairment Administration of Ipreziv for up to 5 days in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (ChildPugh B) hepatic impairment resulted in slight increase in azilsartan exposure (AUC increased by 1.3 to 1.6 fold, see section 4.2). Ipreziv has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Gender Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between males and females. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Race

Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between black and white populations. No dose adjustment is necessary based on race.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In preclinical safety studies, azilsartan medoxomil and M-II, the major human metabolite, were examined for repeated-dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity.

In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters, changes in the kidney and renal haemodynamics, as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals. These effects, which

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were prevented by oral saline supplementation, do not have clinical significance in treatment of hypertension.

In rats and dogs, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.

Azilsartan and M-II crossed the placenta and were found in the fetuses of pregnant rats and were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. In the reproduction toxicity studies, there were no effects on male or female fertility. There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, a slight delay in physical development (delayed incisor eruption, pinna detachment, eye opening), and higher mortality.

Azilsartan and M-II showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. 6.

IPREZIV 80 MG TABLETS

azilsartan medoxomil

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet : 1. What Ipreziv is and what it is used for 2. What do you need to know before you take Ipreziv 3. How to take Ipreziv 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Ipreziv 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. WHAT IPREZIV IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Ipreziv contains an active substance called azilsartan medoxomil and belongs to a class of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). Angiotensin II is a substance which occurs naturally in the body and which causes the blood vessels to tighten, therefore increasing your blood pressure. Ipreziv blocks this effect so that the blood vessels relax, which helps lower your blood pressure. This medicine is used for treating high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adult patients (over 18 years of age). 2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU TAKE IPREZIV Do NOT take Ipreziv if you -are allergic (hypersensitive) to azilsartan medoxomil or any of the other ingredients of Ipreziv (see section 6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Ipreziv in early pregnancy - see pregnancy section).
- -have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren .

## Warnings and precautions

Before you take, or whilst you are taking Ipreziv, tell your doctor if you:

- -have kidney problems
- -are on dialysis or had a recent kidney transplant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -have severe liver disease
- -have heart problems (including heart failure, recent heart attack)
- -have ever had a stroke
- -have low blood pressure or feel dizzy or lightheaded
- -are vomiting, have recently had severe vomiting, or have diarrhoea
- -have elevated levels of potassium in your blood
- -have a disease of the adrenal gland called primary hyperaldosteronism
- -have been told that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called 'aortic or mitral valve stenosis') or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 'obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy').
- -are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:

o an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems. o aliskiren Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading 'Do not take Ipreziv'. You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Ipreziv is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonist medicines, azilsartan medoxomil may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. Children and adolescents There is no experience with the use of Ipreziv in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Therefore, Ipreziv should not be given to children or adolescents. Other medicines and Ipreziv Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. Ipreziv can affect the way some other medicines work and some medicines can have an effect on Ipreziv. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: -Lithium (a medicine for mental health problems) -Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or celecoxib (medicines to relieve pain and inflammation) -Aspirin (acetylsalicyclic acid) if taking more than 3 g per day (medicine to relieve pain and inflammation) -Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood; these include potassium supplements, potassium-sparing medicines (certain 'water tablets') or salt substitutes containing potassium Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Heparin (a medicine for thinning the blood)
- -Diuretics (water tablets)
- -Aliskiren or other medicines to lower your blood pressure (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril or valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan).

Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings 'Do not take Ipreziv' and 'Warnings and precautions').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

## Pregnancy

You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Ipreziv before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Ipreziv.

Ipreziv is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Ipreziv is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.

Driving and using machines Ipreziv is unlikely to have an effect on driving or using machines. However some people may feel tired or dizzy when taking Ipreziv and if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. 3. HOW TO TAKE IPREZIV Always take Ipreziv exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. It is important to keep taking Ipreziv every day. Ipreziv is for oral use. Take the tablet with plenty of water. You can take Ipreziv with or without food. -The usual starting dose is 40 mg once a day. Your doctor may increase this dose to a maximum of 80 mg once a day depending on blood pressure response. -For patients such as the very elderly (75 years and above) your doctor may recommend a lower starting dose of 20 mg once a day. -If you suffer from mild or moderate liver disease your doctor may recommend a lower starting dose of 20 mg once a day. -For patients who recently have lost body fluids e.g. through vomiting or diarrhoea, or by taking water tablets, your doctor may recommend a lower starting dose of 20 mg once a day. -If you suffer from other coexisting illnesses such as severe kidney disease or heart failure your doctor will decide on the most appropriate starting dose. A reduction in your blood pressure will be measureable within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment and the full effect of your dose will be observed by 4 weeks. If you take more Ipreziv than you should If you take too many tablets, or if someone else takes your medicine, contact your doctor immediately. You may feel faint or dizzy if you have taken more than you should. If you forget to take Ipreziv Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just take the next dose at the usual time.

## If you stop taking Ipreziv

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

## STOP taking Ipreziv and seek medical help immediately if you have any of the following allergic reactions, which occur rarely (less than 1 in 1000 people):

- -Difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat (angioedema)
- -Itching of the skin with raised lumps.

## Other possible side effects include:

Common side effects affecting less than 1 in 10 people: -Dizziness -Diarrhoea -Increased blood creatine phosphokinase (an indicator of muscle damage). Uncommon side effects affecting less than 1 in 100 people: -Low blood pressure, which may make you feel faint or dizzy -Feeling tired -Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet (peripheral oedema) -Skin rash and itching -Nausea -Muscle spasms -Increased serum creatinine in the blood (an indicator of kidney function) -Increased uric acid in the blood (an indicator of kidney function). Rare side effects affecting less than 1 in 1000 people: -Changes in blood test results including decreased levels of a protein in the red blood cells (haemoglobin). When Ipreziv is taken with chlortalidone (a water tablet), higher levels of certain chemicals in the blood (such as creatinine), which are indicators of kidney function, have been seen commonly (in less than 1 in 10 users), and low blood pressure is also common. Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet is more common (in less than 1 in 10 users) when Ipreziv is taken with amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker for treating hypertension) than when Ipreziv is taken alone (less than 1 in 100 users). The frequency of this event is highest when amlodipine is taken alone. Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
