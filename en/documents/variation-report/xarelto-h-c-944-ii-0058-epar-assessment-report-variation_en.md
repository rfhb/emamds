## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bayer AG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 3 November 2017 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, IIIA and IIIB   |

Extension of Indication to include the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and for the prevention of acute limb ischaemia and mortality in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) for Xarelto 2.5 mg co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance.

In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated for all other dose strengths (10/15/20 mg) of Xarelto with relevant exposure information based on the provided clinical data.

The updated RMP version 11.1 has also been submitted.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0194/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0194/2017 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 17 November 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/422/7/2011/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that acts by inhibiting thrombin formation and thus formation of thrombi. In the EU, rivaroxaban is approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of venous thrombosis and, in addition to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine, for prevention of atherothrombotic events after an ACS.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder proposed an extension of indication with this application to include the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and the prevention of acute limb

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ischaemia and mortality in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid co-administered with ASA.

Stable CAD is usually characterized by episodes of reversible myocardial ischaemia or hypoxia, induced by exercise, emotion or occurring spontaneously, with symptoms of angina pectoris. The pathophysiological mechanisms that cause stable CAD are traditionally described as atherosclerotic narrowings of ≥50% of the left main coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major coronary arteries; however, in more recent years, other pathophysiological features such as microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm have also been distinguished. CAD can also present clinically as left ventricular dysfunction caused by ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The clinical presentation and severity of CAD varies considerably between individuals. Other medical conditions that are not caused by CAD could present clinically with symptoms of angina pectoris, including valvular disease (e.g. aortic stenosis), tachyarrhythmia and severe anaemia.

Stable CAD with symptoms of angina pectoris is essentially a diagnosis based on history and the characteristics of chest pain. In most patients, however, apart from physical examination, some objective tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis, assess underlying disease and assist in risk stratification. Such testing includes biochemistry, resting ECG, echocardiography and stress testing. However, for patients in which revascularization is unlikely to be an option, investigations may be reduced to a clinically indicated minimum and appropriate therapy should be commenced although objective testing has not been performed (ESC Guidelines 2013).

The natural history of the disease varies greatly between individuals. In patients with stable angina pectoris only, the prognosis is usually favourable with a low risk of mortality (approx. 1% annually) and a low risk of MI (approx. 1-3% annually). However, the prognosis is poorer in patients with heart failure, a greater number of diseased vessels, more proximal locations of coronary stenosis, greater severity of lesions, more extensive ischaemia, more impaired functional capacity, older age, significant depression and more severe angina (ESC Guidelines 2013). Thus, risk stratification based on clinical evaluation, ventricular function, stress testing and coronary anatomy is important when deciding on the optimal therapy for a patient. Within a population with stable CAD, an individual's prognosis can vary considerably, depending on baseline clinical, functional and anatomical characteristics. This is exemplified in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry which included very high-risk patients, many with peripheral arterial disease or previous MI and almost 50% with diabetes. Consequently, annual mortality rate was as high as 3.8% in this population, whereas patients with non-obstructive plaques within the coronary arteries have an annual mortality rate of only 0.63% (ESC Guidelines for CAD 2013).

Existing pharmacological treatments of CAD aim at relief from symptoms and to prevent CV events by reducing plaque progression, stabilize plaques, reduce inflammation and prevent thrombosis. For event prevention in stable CAD patients, lipid-lowering agents, anti-hypertensive agents and antithrombotic agents are used. For most patients, SAPT (single antiplatelet therapy) is recommended as antithrombotic treatment; DAPT (dual antiplatelet therapy) is used primarily after an ACS in the acute phase or in stable CAD after a PCI procedure. It has been convincingly demonstrated that increasing the intensity of antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention of CV events is effective, but at the cost of an increase in bleeding. In stable CAD patients, combined antiplatelet therapy by addition of vorapaxar (a PAR-1-antagonist) in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy has been proven to significantly reduce a composite of CV death, MI or stroke, particularly in post-MI patients, but at the cost of an increased risk of moderate and severe bleeding. In the ESC Guidelines, it was concluded that combined antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial only in selected patients at high risk of ischaemic events, not to be recommended systematically in SCAD patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PAD (peripheral arterial disease) encompasses all arterial diseases other than coronary arteries and the aorta, and should be distinguished from peripheral artery disease, which is often used for lower extremity artery disease (LEAD). In the COMPASS trial, PAD was represented by patients with LEAD and carotid stenosis only. PAD secondary to atherosclerosis and CAD often share the same risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle and family history. Patients affected by PAD are also at risk for other atherosclerotic events. 10-year rates of coronary events, CV mortality and total mortality has been showed to be doubled in LEAD patients (Fowkes et al, 2008). ABI is considered to be a strong marker for CV events (ESC Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Diseases, 2017). As with CAD, pharmacological treatments of PAD aim at reducing symptoms, and prevent CV events by using lipid-lowering, antihypertensive and antithrombotic drugs. In the ESC Guidelines from 2017, the antithrombotic regimens are similar to CAD. SAPT forms the basis, with low-dose aspirin for carotid artery stenosis, and clopidogrel in symptomatic LEAD or LEAD that has undergone revascularization. Anticoagulation therapy is recommended only in patients with a concomitant indication that requires anticoagulation, and could be combined with SAPT after a recent revascularization procedure.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An updated ERA with a study on Algal (Desmodesmus subspicatus) growth inhibition (OECD 201) was submitted. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 0.52 and 1.02 mg/L respectively.

The PECsurfacewater was revised by adding the PEC for the existing indications with the PEC of the new indication. The revised PECsurfacewater has been re-calculated to 0.12 μg/L.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Considering the available data, no risks were identified for rivaroxaban with regard to the various environmental compartments and no specific labelling regarding the environmental risk is required.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

During the run-in period, Day -28 to Day -1, eligible subjects (excluding those who were randomized between Day 4-7 after CABG surgery) who had signed informed consent and stopped non-study anticoagulants and aspirin received rivaroxaban placebo bid and aspirin 100 mg od.

Subjects who had completed the run-in period with at least 80% adherence to treatment were first divided in those who had a continuous need for PPI and those who did not. The latter group was randomized to pantoprazole 40 mg od or matching placebo. Thereafter, the participants were randomized into three arms of different antithrombotic treatments:

Arm A: rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od

Arm B: rivaroxaban 5 mg bid/aspirin placebo od

Arm C: rivaroxaban placebo bid/aspirin 100 mg od

## Objectives

Primary objectives for rivaroxaban randomization were

- To determine whether rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared with aspirin 100 mg od reduces the risk of a composite of MI, stroke, or CV death in subjects with CAD or PAD
- To determine whether rivaroxaban 5 mg bid compared with aspirin 100 mg od reduces the risk of a composite of MI, stroke, or CV death in subjects with CAD or PAD

Secondary objectives for rivaroxaban randomization were

- To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone reduces the risk of the composite of major thrombotic events: CHD death, MI, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia (ALI), compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD
- To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone reduces the risk of the composite of major thrombotic events: CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD
- To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone reduces the risk of mortality compared with aspirin 100 mg od in subjects with CAD or PAD

## Objective for pantoprazole randomization was

- To determine whether pantoprazole 40 mg od compared with placebo reduces the risk of upper GI bleeding, ulceration, or GI obstruction or perforation in subjects with CAD or PAD receiving antithrombotic study medications

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy outcome was the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the composite of the following efficacy outcome events:

- Myocardial infarction or
- Stroke or
- Cardiovascular death

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary efficacy outcomes were the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the following secondary efficacy outcomes - in the order as specified below:

1. The composite of outcomes -CHD death, MI, ischemic stroke or ALI
2. The composite of outcomes -CV death, MI, ischemic stroke or ALI
3. All-cause mortality

CHD death includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is only derived via adjudication. ALI is defined as limb-threatening ischemia that is confirmed by limb hemodynamics or imaging and leads to an acute vascular intervention (i.e. pharmacologic [heparin, thrombolysis], peripheral arterial surgery/reconstruction, peripheral angioplasty/stent, or amputation) within 30 days of onset of symptoms. In the absence of confirmation by limb hemodynamics or imaging, absent pedal pulses is acceptable as hemodynamic criterion for ALI.

Tertiary efficacy outcomes included:

- The time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the following tertiary efficacy outcomes:
- o Individual components of the primary and secondary outcomes, i.e., MI, stroke, ischemic stroke, CV death, CHD death, ALI, and non-CV death

Primary safety variable was the time (in days) from randomization to the first occurrence of the following primary safety outcome:

Modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding, defined as:

- I. fatal bleeding, or
- II. symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or bleeding into the surgical site requiring reoperation, or
- III. bleeding leading to hospitalization*

*Major bleeding also includes presentation to an acute care facility with discharge on the same day.

A net clinical benefit time-to-event variable was defined as the composite of the primary efficacy outcome and the primary safety outcome, excluding bleedings leading to hospitalization and bleedings into surgical site associated with re-operation (thus representing fatal or symptomatic critical organ bleeding only).

The outcome for the pantoprazole randomization is the composite of the following outcomes:

- Overt bleeding of gastroduodenal origin confirmed by endoscopy or radiography
- Overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin
- Bleeding of presumed occult gastrointestinal origin with documented decrease in Hb of 2 g/dL from baseline
- Symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcer
- Gastrointestinal pain with underlying multiple gastroduodenal erosions, obstruction or perforation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

Initially, approximately 19,500 eligible subjects were to be admitted to the run-in period and an additional 2000 were to be enrolled post CABG and without run-in. Approximately 10% of run-in subjects were expected to either be non-compliant with treatment or to decline further interest in participating; thus, the study was to randomise approximately 19,500 subjects, at least 6,500 subjects per antithrombotic study group.

The study was event-driven and was to continue until a minimum of 2,200 subjects had experienced an event for the primary efficacy outcome. The aim was to have at least 90% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction for each of the two rivaroxaban treatment groups versus the aspirin control group.

The following assumptions were made for the antithrombotic treatment part of the study; a 2-sided type I error level of 2.7% for each of the two comparisons to control the overall type I error level of 5%, an annual event rate in the aspirin control group between 4.0% and 4.5%, a recruitment period of about 2.5 years, a total expected study duration of 4.5 to 5 years and, an early study drug discontinuation rate of about 6% and 4% in the 1st and 2nd 6-month periods, and 3% in the 6-month periods thereafter.

Within study protocol amendment 6 (03 July 2014) the number of subjects was increased to 21,400 randomised ((approximately 7,134 subjects per treatment group)) based on emerging data which suggested that a realistic event rate was 3.5-4.0% rather than 4.0-4.5%.

During the first 2 years after randomisation of the first patient, it was found that the actual randomisation was slower than expected and that the observed cumulated overall annual incidence was at the lower end of the projected range of 3.0 to 4.0%. This led to the decision to continue enrollment to maintain the study duration in the originally planned range of 4.5 to 5 years. Simulations were performed to justify the implied sample size increase, based on the following revised assumptions, which are partially taken from the blinded data observed within the first 2 years of the trial;

- Overall length of recruitment period about 3 to 3.5 years, where randomisation times are
- o taken as observed for the first ~18,000 subjects
- o assumed to be approximately uniform over about 10 months with some seasonal variation for the remaining ~9,400 subjects
- 2-sided overall type I error level of 5% using a truncated Hochberg test ( γ = 0.9) for the testing of the two primary hypotheses
- Constant overall incidence rate of about 2.9% per year (95% CI: 2.56 -3.22%), resulting in a constant incidence rate of about 3.3% (95% CI: 2.95 -3.71%) per year for the aspirin control group assuming a 20% relative risk reduction for both hypotheses
- Early discontinuation of study drug: about 6% and 4.5% in the 1st and 2nd 6-month periods, and 3% in the 6-month periods thereafter
- Censoring due to non-CV death at an event rate of almost 1% per year

Based on these simulation results, the sample size was increased from 21,400 randomised subjects to 27,400 (approximately 9,134 subjects per treatment group) by protocol amendment 8 (19 Aug 2015).

## Randomisation

Subjects being randomized after run-in and those who were randomized between Day 4-7 after CABG surgery and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Who did not have a continuous need to take a PPI, were initially randomized 1:1 to receive pantoprazole 40 mg od or matching placebo od, using a block size of 6, stratified by centre. Within each of these blocks of 6, subjects were then randomized 1:1:1 to anticoagulant therapy (see below) stratified by the randomization to pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo, resulting in blocks of 3.
- Who did have a continuous need to take a PPI, were randomized 1:1:1 to anticoagulant therapy using a block size of 6 stratified by centre as shown below.

## Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study. All doses were provided in tablet form for oral administration.

## Statistical methods

## Analysis sets

Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The intention-to-treat analysis set included all randomised subjects. The safety analysis set included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.

## Methods

The primary efficacy variable was the time (in days) from randomisation to the first occurrence of the composite of the following events: MI, stroke or CV death. Primary statistical analyses were based on events which were unrefuted during the adjudication process (that evaluated whether events reported by investigators met the pre-specified trial definition).

Each of the rivaroxaban-based treatment groups were compared to the control group using two separate stratified log-rank tests taking into account proton pump inhibitor use (three strata levels: not randomised to a proton pump inhibitor; pantoprazole 40 mg od; pantoprazole placebo). Study center was not used as a stratification factor in the analysis.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative risk functions and Nelson-Aalen estimates of the cumulative hazard functions were provided to evaluate the timing of event occurrence in the three treatment arms and the consistency of the respective treatment effects for all time points. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on two separate stratified Cox proportional hazards models.

Analyses of the secondary efficacy outcomes and the primary safety time-to-event variable essentially used the same statistical methods as described for the primary efficacy variable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analyses were performed to include all primary efficacy outcome events up until the minimum (earliest) of the final rivaroxaban/aspirin follow-up visit date and the subject's last contact date during the rivaroxaban/aspirin portion of the study.

In addition, the number of primary efficacy outcome events occurring after the final rivaroxaban/aspirin follow-up visit until the rivaroxaban/aspirin washout telephone visit, included in the clean database for the rivaroxaban/aspirin comparisons, was summarized by rivaroxaban/aspirin study treatment group.

The plausibility of the proportional hazards assumption was assessed by visually examining both the plot of the log of the negative log of Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function versus the log of time for evidence of non-parallelism and the smoothed plot of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals to directly visualize the log hazard ratio, and by including a time*treatment interaction term in the Cox model (time log transformed). The significance of the interaction was tested at the 5% type I error level. If the interaction was significant and there was strong evidence of non-proportionality from the plots, time-dependent hazard ratios were to be estimated with the model that includes the interaction term.

## Multiplicity

Each of the rivaroxaban-based treatment group was first to be compared with the aspirin control group on the primary efficacy outcome, followed by the same comparisons on the three ordered secondary efficacy outcomes ( Figure 2 ). The null hypotheses of no effect corresponding to different efficacy outcomes were grouped into 4 separate families. Standard logical restrictions were imposed, i.e., the null hypotheses were split into two branches corresponding to the tests for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od (hypotheses H1A, H2A, H3A, H4A) and to the tests for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid (hypotheses H1B, H2B, H3B, H4B). A null hypothesis within each branch could be tested if and only if the immediately preceding null hypothesis was rejected.

Figure 2. Hypothesis testing problem

<!-- image -->

Multiple hypotheses testing was to be performed according to a mixture gatekeeping procedure based on the Hochberg test with a truncation fraction of γ = 0.9, which controls the familywise error rate at the pre-assigned level of significance α = 5% in the strong sense. The Hochberg-based gatekeeping procedure (based on an extension of the general mixture methodology developed in Dmitrienko and Tamhane (2011, 2013) and recently proposed in Brechenmacher et al., 2011) was to account for two sources of multiplicity at the final analysis; two arms of rivaroxaban/aspirin study treatment being compared to the active control aspirin and comparisons being performed for a primary and three

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

secondary outcomes. A truncation fraction γ close to 1 was chosen to ensure a high probability of success for the primary hypotheses, considering that potentially only a small fraction of α is carried forward to the next family of hypotheses. The gatekeeping procedure was to use the truncated Hochberg test in Family 1 to 3 because they were to serve as gatekeepers for the next family in the sequence. The regular Hochberg test was to be applied in Family 4 since this was the last family in the testing sequence.

A third source of multiplicity related to the planned interim analyses and was addressed for the testing of the primary outcome via the modified Haybittle-Peto rule. Given conservative monitoring boundaries, the type I error level adjustment for the final analysis was considered negligible and no adjustment was performed for the final primary efficacy analysis.

## Interim analyses

Two formal interim analyses were planned when 50% (about 1,100) and 75% (about 1,650) of the expected number of accumulated primary efficacy outcome events (2200 subjects with an unrefuted event) accrued.

If the interim analyses showed clear and consistent benefit in both rivaroxaban treatment groups, the DSMB could recommend early study termination. The modified Haybittle-Peto rule was to be used to guide the decision regarding early stopping of some or all of the study treatment groups: a reduction of 4 standard deviations in the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome at the first interim analysis (one-sided p-value &lt; 0.0001) or 3 standard deviations at the second interim analysis (one-sided p-value &lt;0.0014). If the monitoring boundary was crossed at either of the planned interim analyses, a second analysis was to be done after at least an additional 3-6 months to confirm the boundary remained crossed and that the trend in treatment effect was not temporary.

For a lack of efficacy, a futility approach was to be utilized. Based on the conditional probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for either primary comparison, the DSMB might have considered recommending early termination of the study. If the results were clear with one intervention, but not for the second intervention, the DSMB could have decided to continue evaluation of both or one rivaroxaban treatment arms. If the study was to continue with both interventions, then the type I error levels as pre-planned were to be used in the final analysis. If one intervention was stopped early for efficacy, the multiple testing procedure for the final analysis was to be performed as pre-planned with the assumption that the p-value for the primary efficacy outcome of the arm that was stopped early for overwhelming efficacy was smaller than 0.025. For secondary outcomes, the p-values were to be obtained from log-rank tests based on all available data for the stopped arm (data from confirmation analysis 6 months after respective interim look) and the complete data from the comparator arm. If one intervention was stopped early for futility, the final analysis was to be performed when at least 1,513 subjects in the two remaining arms has experienced an event with the final analysis to be performed according to the pre-planned multiple testing strategy.

On 06 FEB 2017, the independent DSMB recommended to stop the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early since the log-rank test statistic (z-value) for one of the primary comparisons had crossed the modified Haybittle-Peto boundary (i.e., z &gt;4) consistently over 3 months at the first interim analysis. Considering the two comparisons, one for each rivaroxaban treatment arm, being made according to the modified Haybittle-Peto rule, the type I error level allocated at the first interim analysis is α1 = 0.0001267.

## Recruitment

Study Start Date: 28 February 2013 (First Patient First Visit)

Study Completion Date: 20-July-2017 (Last Patient Last Visit, antithrombotic part)

## Conduct of the study

The protocol and DSMB charter specified that approximately 1100 first occurrences of primary outcome events (50% of the required total 2200 subjects with a primary outcome event) would trigger the first formal interim analysis of efficacy. On 01 November 2016, a total of 1096 first occurrences of primary outcome events had been reported and analyses for the primary efficacy outcome were performed by the unblinded DSMB statistician. On 08 December 2016, a closed DSMB conference call was held based on an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis of best available data from 01 December 2016, and On 30 January 2017, a closed face-to-face meeting of the DSMB was held based on an analysis of best available data from 17 January 2017, when 1224 first occurrences of primary outcome events had been reported.

On 06 February 2017, the independent COMPASS DSMB issued a letter recommending stopping the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early. The antithrombotic part of the study was completed 21 July 2017.

The DSMB also reviewed the efficacy and safety of the comparison of pantoprazole versus placebo but made no recommendation regarding early termination of this aspect of the overall study.

The study protocol was amended 10 times; the most significant amendments were Amendment 6 which formed integrated protocol version 2.0, dated 03 JUL 2014 and Amendment 8 which formed integrated protocol version 3.0, dated 19 AUG 2015. The major modifications specified in Amendment 6 were changes in the eligibility criteria for the study population with removal of the requirement for two additional risk factors or disease in at least two vascular beds for PAD subjects under the age of 65, and addition of patients with previous carotid revascularization and an increase of the sample size from 19500 to ~21400 randomized subjects. The main modification due to Amendment 8 was a change in the secondary outcomes to include 2 new composites of major thrombotic events, including new outcome components (ALI and CHD death). The multiple testing strategy was revised to ensure the control of the familywise type I error for both testing of primary and secondary efficacy variables for the final analyses based on 2200 events.

## Concomitant medication:

Only a few subjects (95 subjects, 0.3%) in the ITT analysis set had a documented anticoagulant use at screening. All subjects discontinued the use of all anticoagulants before the run-in period. For a total of 88.9% of the subjects in the ITT analysis set, antiplatelet use was documented at screening. The most commonly reported antiplatelet agent was aspirin (87% of the subjects), followed by clopidogrel (7.2% of subjects). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups. Prior use of antiplatelet agents was slightly lower in the subgroup of subjects with PAD only (79.5%) compared to subjects with CAD only (89.7%) and subjects with CAD and PAD (90.8%) All 88.9% subjects discontinued the use of all antiplatelets before the run-in period. At least one non-study antiplatelet therapy at any visit was taken by 19.3% of all subjects. The most frequently reported concomitant non-study antiplatelet therapies at any visit were aspirin (17.5%), and clopidogrel (5.4%). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups. Over time, use of non-study antiplatelet therapy increased, probably corresponding to the increasing number of subjects who permanently discontinued antithrombotic study treatment.

Relevant non-study drugs were taken by almost all subjects (99.6%) in all three treatment groups during the rivaroxaban/aspirin follow-up period. The most frequently reported pre-specified relevant concomitant medications were lipid lowering agents (taken by 93.9% of all subjects), ACE inhibitors or ARB (78.9%) and beta blockers (75.5%). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups. The use of relevant concomitant medication by CAD only mirrored the overall population. For the subgroup of PAD only there was a lower use of guideline recommended therapies across all treatment groups.

A total of 33.3% of the subjects in the ITT analysis set reported a continuous need for PPI treatment at screening. The most commonly reported PPI medications were pantoprazole (11.8%) and omeprazole (11.6%). There were no relevant differences between the treatment groups.

## Numbers analysed

In this trial the ITT analysis set corresponds to the full analysis set according to the ICH E9 guideline. None of the 27395 randomized subjects were excluded from the ITT analysis set.

From the ITT analysis set, 44 subjects were excluded who were not treated with study rivaroxaban/ placebo and/or study aspirin/placebo. Thus, 27351 subjects were valid for the safety analysis set (SAF). The reason for exclusion from SAF was no intake of antithrombotic study drug.

## Outcomes and estimation

The results of the primary efficacy endpoint are presented in Table 4 .

Table displays unrefuted outcomes = outcome events meeting the definition in the event adjudication plan. The primary efficacy outcome is composed of the first occurrence of MI, stroke, or CV death (includes fatal MI and stroke). For composite outcomes and each component, the first event after randomization is considered.

Subsequent events of the same type are not shown.

Stroke includes ischemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and uncertain or unknown stroke.

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence risk for the composite primary efficacy outcome are shown in Figure 5 .

Table displays unrefuted outcomes = outcome events meeting the definition in the event adjudication plan.

Secondary efficacy outcomes are composed of the first occurrence of (i) MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, or CHD death, (ii), MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, or CV death and (iii) death. For composite outcomes and each component, the first event after randomization is considered. Subsequent events of the same type are not shown.

n/100 p-yrs: incidence rate estimated as number of subjects with incident events divided by the cumulative at-risk time in the reference population, where a subject is no longer at risk once an incident event occurred.

HRs (95% CI) are based on the stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Log-rank p-values (two-sided) are based on the stratified log-rank test.

CHD death includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is only identified via adjudication but not reported as such by the investigator.

ALI = acute limb ischemia; bid = twice daily; CHD = coronary heart disease; CI = confidence interval; CV = cardiovascular; ITT = intention-to-treat; MI = myocardial infarction; od = once daily; riva = rivaroxaban.

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence risk for the composite secondary efficacy outcomes  of MI, ischemic stroke, CHD death, or ALI and of of MI, ischemic stroke, CV death, or AL is shown in Figures 5 and 6 respectively.

Stroke includes hemorrhagic stroke.

CHD death is a sub-category of CV death and includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is only identified via adjudication.

## Ancillary analyses

## Potential testing strategies specified after the DSMB recommendation to terminate the antithrombotic study treatment arms

Since an early stop at approximately 50% of the target number of primary efficacy outcome events was not anticipated, the study protocol and SAP did not describe any plans for the testing of secondary efficacy outcomes in the unlikely case of a premature termination for efficacy. For the secondary efficacy hypotheses, nominal p-values are reported; the test decisions according to several testing strategies defined after the DSMB recommendation to terminate the antithrombotic study treatment arms, but before the release of the first clinical database are presented in Table 10 .

## Analysis of the composite primary efficacy outcome for important subgroups: subjects with CAD and/or PAD

The CAD/PAD diagnoses used for all analyses of this trial took into account the diagnosis made by the investigator at screening. In addition to the investigator diagnosis supplemental information from baseline evaluation and medical history records was used for a diagnosis of CAD or PAD (according to protocol definition) and the main focus of all analyses is based on this diagnosis for the main subgroups CAD yes, PAD yes and CAD and PAD.

The distribution of subjects by CAD and PAD subgroups was comparable in the 3 treatment groups, both for investigator assessments and for the CAD and PAD diagnoses that took baseline evaluation and medical history records into account ( Table 11 ).

The diagnosis is based on the investigator assessment taking into account the individual medical history characteristics. Table displays unrefuted outcomes = outcome events meeting the definition in the event adjudication plan. The primary efficacy outcome is composed of the first occurrence of MI, stroke, or CV death (includes fatal MI and stroke). Stroke includes ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and uncertain or unknown stroke.

Tables displays unrefuted outcomes = outcome events meeting the definition in the event adjudication plan.

Secondary efficacy outcomes are composed of the first occurrence of (i) MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, and CHD death, (ii), MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, and CV death and (iii) death.

For composite outcomes and each component, the first event after randomization is considered. Subsequent events of the same type are not shown.

HR (95% CI): Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) are based on the stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Log-rank p-value: p-values (two-sided) are based on the stratified log rank test.

Log-rank test statistic: test statistic of the stratified log-rank test

MI = myocardial infarction, CV = cardiovascular, CHD = coronary heart disease, ALI = acute limb ischemia, p-yrs = patient years, bid = twice daily, od = once daily, CI = confidence interval.

CHD death includes death due to acute MI, sudden cardiac death, or death due to a CV procedure and is only identified via adjudication but not reported as such by the investigator.

## All-cause mortality

Forest plots with crude incidences and the results of the Cox proportional hazards model for the subgroup analysis of all-cause mortality up until the global rivaroxaban/aspirin outcomes cut-off date are shown in Figure 12 for the comparison of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od with aspirin 100 mg od.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

COMPASS is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator, event-driven study, in which 27 395 subjects with objectively confirmed CAD or PAD were randomised 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, or ASA 100 mg od.

Additionally, subjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were randomised 1:1 to pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo; this part of the study is ongoing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study population consists of patients with CAD, PAD or CAD and PAD. Most patients had either CAD only, or CAD and PAD. The majority of patients in the subgroup presented by the MAH as 'PAD yes' also had CAD.

Some information was lacking with regards to concomitant risk factors for CV disease, most importantly on glycaemic control in diabetic subjects. Despite excluding patients with dual antiplatelet therapy, the majority of patients had suffered a previous MI and a high proportion (about 30%) had a prior CABG surgery. However, the data were considered acceptable and to be representative of the intended target population and overall, subjects with high risk of incident cardiovascular disease were enrolled in the trial.

After a pre-planned interim analysis, the independent COMPASS DSMB recommended stopping the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms early. The DSMB also reviewed the efficacy and safety of the comparison of pantoprazole versus placebo but made no recommendation regarding early termination of this aspect of the overall study. Overall, the statistical methods used are appropriate as was planned analyses had the study been completed as planned. The key issue is multiplicity and interpretation of secondary ordered outcomes. When all antithrombotic treatment arms was stopped, the MAH concluded that the multiplicity strategy as planned was no longer valid since there was no pre-planned strategy on how to analyse key secondary endpoints. For the secondary efficacy endpoints therefore, nominal p-values have been reported. Hence, being strict, no formally valid claims can be made for secondary endpoints. Test decisions according to a number of post-hoc testing strategies (defined after the DSMB recommendation but before the release of the first clinical database) have, in addition, been presented.

The efficacy analysis population (ITT) included all randomised subjects and the majority of randomised subjects, 27332/27395 (99.8%), completed the follow-up period up until the global rivaroxaban/aspirin outcomes cut-off date. Reasons for non-completion were consent withdrawn and lost-to follow-up. At the cut-off date a total of 4587 (16.7%) of randomised subjects had discontinued both rivaroxaban/placebo and aspirin/placebo treatment permanently; 16.9%, 17.5%, and 15.9% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and aspirin 100 mg od, arm respectively. In this population, these rates of discontinuation are considered acceptable.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid in combination with aspirin 100 mg od significantly reduced the primary efficacy outcome, the time to first occurrence of stroke, MI, or CV death, compared with treatment with aspirin 100 mg od alone, in the ITT population. Since the study was terminated at the first interim report, not as many events for the primary efficacy outcome occurred as was originally planned. Treatment with rivaroxaban 5 mg bid did not show a statistically significant reduction in hazard ratio of the primary efficacy outcome compared to aspirin only.

The analysis of the primary composite endpoint (based on the global cut-off when the DSMB recommended that the antithrombotic treatment arms should be stopped) is also supported by the sensitivity analyses performed, the analysis of the composite primary efficacy outcome based on investigator-reported events and, the analysis of the primary endpoint based on data up until the final follow-up.

The reduction in occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome is considered clinically relevant in this heavily disease-burdened population. The effect is apparent early during treatment and remains consistent during the course of this study. The results with regards to both the primary and the secondary efficacy outcomes are consistent in the CAD only, CAD yes and CAD and PAD groups, but for the primary endpoint, the HR was less favourable and not statistically significant in the PAD only group However, the CHMP taking into account also the Additional expert consultation (see below), acknowledged that CAD are PAD are both characterised by atherosclerosis. Even though different arteries are affected, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pathophysiology of the disease is similar across all vascular beds. Patients with clinical evidence of atherosclerosis in any territory should be expected to respond in a similar fashion to anti-thrombotic therapy. The lack of statistical significance in patients with PAD only was attributed to the smaller sample size of this sub-group, compared to the other sub-group of patients included in the COMPASS study. The CHMP concluded that patients with PAD should also be included in the target population for the proposed combination of rivaroxaban and acetylsalicylic acid.

However, the CHMP noted that CAD and PAD encompass a broad spectrum of patients, from patients with very mild or no symptoms, to patients with severe multi-vessel disease at high risk of infarction. Patients with severe coronary artery disease are also at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy which is a common cause of heart failure in this population. Patients with mild CAD, patients with NYHA class III or IV symptoms or known ejection fraction &lt;30% for example were not included in this study. Therefore the indication was revised to adult patients with coronary CAD or symptomatic PAD at high risk of ischaemic events. This reflects the studied population of the COMPASS study. CAD patients had multi-vessel CAD and/or prior MI. For patients &lt; 65 years of age atherosclerosis involving at least two vascular beds or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were required. PAD patients had previous interventions such as bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease or intermittent claudication with ankle/arm blood pressure ratio &lt; 0.90 and/ or significant peripheral artery stenosis or previous carotid revascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%.

For the secondary efficacy outcome, the results are congruent with regards to the first two secondary endpoints (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CHD death and MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CV death). For the third secondary endpoint, all-cause mortality, the picture is not as clear. All-cause mortality is lower in the riva 2.5/aspirin cohort, but the n/100 p-years (95% CI) are overlapping in all treatment groups. The number of malignancy deaths is lower in the riva 2.5/aspirin cohort, which accounts for the lower number of non-CV deaths in this cohort.

The pre-planned gatekeeping strategy and the failure of the 5 mg rivaroxaban arm implied (post-hoc proposed strategy that takes the stopping of treatments at the interim into account) that the testing of ordered secondary endpoints were to be made using the same conservative stopping boundary that was used at the interim analysis. As a consequence, no formally valid conclusion can be made for any of the secondary endpoints. The difference between rivaroxaban 2.5 mg treatment regimen and the aspirin control group in the ordered secondary composite endpoint 2 (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CHD death) and 3 (MI, ischemic stroke, ALI, CV death) finds, as concluded above, support in that they share components with the primary composite endpoint or relies on components that are subsets of primary components.

However, irrespective of testing strategy (to handle multiplicity) including the one that was pre-planned (hence ignoring the interim analysis and the early stopping of the antithrombotic treatment arms), no valid claim can be made regarding all-cause mortality. There is no effect on all-cause mortality in women, in the age group &gt; 75 years and in patients that have not had a prior MI. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with CABG at baseline, PAD only, asymptomatic carotid stenosis &gt; 50% and age groups &lt;55 years. Therefore the CHMP concluded, that reduction of all-cause mortality should be removed from the proposed indication.

For ALI, there is a statistically significant reduction in the riva 2.5/aspirin group, but the numbers in all groups are very small (22 events in this group as compared to 40 in the aspirin only group). Apart from the analytical limitations of the secondary endpoints as described above, this small numerical decrease of events is not considered robust enough to allow for 'reduction of ALI' as a separate entity in the indication. Therefore the CHMP concluded, that reduction of all-cause mortality or ALI should be removed from the proposed indication which was revised to prevention of atherothrombotic events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP also noted that for patients &gt; 75 years the reduction in HR of the primary efficacy outcome was less pronounced and not statistically significant. This observation could partly be due to the smaller size of this group of patients (N=3821) compared to patients &lt;75 years (14457). However, the effect with respect to reduction of stroke was of a relevant magnitude also in these elderly patients. The CHMP also noted that available data suggest that the risk of bleeding increases with age. Therefore it is recommended that rivaroxaban should be used with caution CAD/PAD patient and the benefit-risk of the treatment should be individually assessed on a regular basis.

Finally, as long term treatment is expected in these patients beyond the duration of the anti-thrombotic phase of the COMPASS study the CHMP advised that duration of treatment should be determined for each individual patient based on regular evaluations and should consider the risk for thrombotic events versus the bleeding risks.

## Additional expert consultation

The Scientific Advisory Group on Cardiovascular Issues (SAG-CVS) was asked to provide their view on the following issues:

1. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is applying for an indication for Xarelto in combination with ASA for the prevention of major cardiovascular events in  patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk of ischaemic events and/or documented peripheral artery disease (PAD) based on the results of the COMPASS study

- a. Please discuss the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with PAD without coexisting diagnosed CAD and current standard of care with respect to prevention of CVE
- b. What is your opinion concerning the strength and relevance of the results in the COMPASS study with respect to reduction of MACE as well as the risk of bleedings in the group of patients with PAD only. Do you think the results support a potential change of the standard of care of patients with PAD?

The Group advised that there is a continuum between CAD and PAD (with many patients having both), as both conditions are linked with atherosclerosis which has developed in different territories. Therefore, there is no biological rationale to distinguish between the two. The Group also noted that there is a transition in the Standard of Care for patients with PAD, with treatment aiming at reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in such patients.

With regards to the results of the COMPASS study, the Group noted that the results in the pre-specified PAD only sub-group did not reach statistical significance for the reduction of CVE. This was however considered to be due to the smaller sample size of this group and chance fluctuation of treatment effect. The results in this sub-group of patients are consistent with those for the overall study population and the Group considered these as sufficient of demonstrating efficacy in the applied indication. The Group however noted that the evidence of an effect of rivaroxaban in acute limb ischaemia is much weaker  - it was a tertiary endpoint without central adjudication than for the other investigated endpoints and recommended that this should reflected in the presentation of the results of the COMPASS study in the label.

The Group acknowledged that such results support a potential change in standard care of patients with PAD. Low dose rivaroxaban will then be added to aspirin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Do the results of the COMPASS study and the known increased risk of bleeding associated with rivaroxaban, support use of rivaroxaban in CAD/PAD patients ≥ 75 years.

The Group advised that available data suggest that there is an increased risk of bleeding with increasing age. This is also known from previous experience with all factor Xa inhibitors. Despite this increased risk, the Group advised that this does not preclude use of rivaroxaban in in CAD/PAD patients ≥75 years. Instead it was considered that labelling with warnings about this risk would be appropriate to effectively manage this risk. Treatment with rivaroxaban in elderly patients should depend on careful assessment of the individual's personal circumstances and in particular the risk they may have for bleeding.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

In the approved indications, and congruent with the mode of action for rivaroxaban, bleeding is the most serious and most common adverse event of interest. For other components of the cardiovascular safety profile of rivaroxaban, treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in patients in previous phase III studies include tachycardia (uncommon), hypotension (common), renal impairment (common) and peripheral oedema (common).

In the COMPASS study, the primary safety outcome was major bleeding according to modified ISTH criteria. The clinical hierarchy of modified ISTH major bleeding events was as follows

- Fatal bleeding
- Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, respiratory, liver, pancreas, adrenal gland or kidney, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome (non-fatal)
- Bleeding into the surgical site requiring re-operation (non-fatal and non-critical organ)
- Bleeding leading to any hospitalization (*) (non-fatal, non-critical organ, not leading to re-operation)

(*) Major bleeding also includes hospitalization or presentation to an acute care facility with discharge on the same day, or associated with a &gt; 1 day hospitalization.

## Patient exposure

A total of 27351 subjects comprised the safety analysis set (rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid/aspirin: 9134 patients, exposed for a mean of 666 days; rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: 9110 patients, exposed for a mean of 662 days; aspirin only: 9107 patients exposed for a mean of 671 days).

## Adverse events

Due to additional reporting of specified outcomes as (S)AE, reporting of non-serious AEs that did not lead to study drug discontinuation and more frequent visits in Japan, the crude incidences of AEs in Japan subjects are different compared with those in non-Japan subjects. Unless otherwise indicated, all tables displayed are with data excluding Japan subjects.

The overall summary of AEs for non-Japan subjects by the subgroups CAD/PAD, sex, and age at baseline is shown in Table 17 . For the purpose of safety reporting, the subgroups for CAD/PAD display subjects in a unique category based on their presentation of 'CAD only', 'PAD only' or both 'CAD/PAD combined' to avoid reporting a subject twice.

system organ class; TESAE = treatment-emergent serious adverse event

Events of special interest were not reported separately but were included within and as part of the AE tables. For the ESIs 'hepatic failure', and 'pancytopenia', imbalances of potential clinical interest between treatment groups were noted.

Four cases of hepatic failure were reported, two each in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid cohorts respectively. One of the cases occurred four months after stop of study treatment; two of the cases were attributed to liver failure in conjunction with other organ failure (heart failure and multi-organ failure due to bleeding); and in one case, liver failure was considered as related to underlying malignant disease.

Six cases of pancytopenia were reported; four of those in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od cohort, one in the rivaroxaban 5 mg cohort and one in the aspirin 100 mg od cohort. Of the rivaroxaban cases, one was considered attributed to alcohol/malnourishment; one was attributed to MDS diagnosed more than one year after discontinuation of study medication; one was attributed to paraneoplastic syndrome and viral infection; one occurred in a patient diagnosed with myelofibrosis and one occurred in conjunction with malignancy and chemotherapy.

## Primary safety outcome: Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding events

The SAF analysis considered treatment-emergent ISTH major bleeding events which were in the database after closure on 22 JUL 2017.

The number of subjects with a primary safety outcome, crude incidences and incidence rates (n/100 patient-years) of treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding event and the 4 clinical hierarchical categories as well as the results from the statistical comparison for thetreatment-emergent data scope in the SAF set are presented in Table 22 .

## Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding events by hierarchy and bleeding site

## Treatment-emergent fatal bleeding events

Treatment-emergent bleeding events in the SAF analysis set were fatal in 12 subjects (0.1%) in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 13 subjects (0.1%) in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 8 subjects (&lt;0.1%) in the aspirin 100 mg od group. Fatal bleeding events were most frequently due to intracranial bleeding events, and of these mainly hemorrhagic stroke, with no notable differences between the 3 treatment groups (&lt;0.1% in each group). Fatal, non-intracranial bleeding events were few and of diverse origin: gastrointestinal (5 cases), retroperitoneal (4 cases), respiratory tract (3 cases), skin or injection site (2 cases), other (2 cases) and unknown site (1 case).

## Symptomatic critical organ bleeding events (non-fatal)

Symptomatic critical organ bleeding events (non-fatal) were reported by 0.6% of the subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.7% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 0.5% in the aspirin 100 mg od group. These bleeding events were most frequently due to intracranial (subarachnoid, intraventricular, intracerebral/intraparenchymal hemorrhage) and/or intraocular bleeding events with 0.2% each in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.3% and &lt;0.1%, respectively, in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 0.2% and &lt;0.1%, respectively, in the aspirin 100 mg od group. Symptomatic non-intracranial bleeding events were few and of diverse origin: intraocular (27 cases), respiratory tract (21 cases), retinal (17 cases), intraarticular (7 cases), other (7 cases), urinary tract (5 cases), intraabdominal (5 cases), unknown site (4 cases), intramuscular (3 cases), intraspinal (3 cases), retroperitoneal (3 cases), and pericardial (2 cases).

## Bleeding events into a surgical site requiring re-operation (non- fatal and non-critical organ)

Bleeding events into a surgical site requiring re-operation were reported by &lt;0.1% of the subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 0.2% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and &lt;0.1% in the aspirin 100 mg od group. These bleeding events were most frequently gastrointestinal, skin or injection site bleeding events with &lt;0.1% each in all 3 treatment groups. The number of subjects with bleeding events on further sites was small and the sites were of diverse origin: urinary tract (4 cases), genital (1 case), and other (1 case).

## Bleeding leading to any hospitalization (non-fatal, non-critical organ, not leading to re-operation)

Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major events leading to any hospitalization were reported by 2.1% of the subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 1.5% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

group, and 1.0% in the aspirin 100 mg od group with significant differences between the individual rivaroxaban treatment arms versus the aspirin 100 mg od group.

Treatment-emergent modified ISTH major bleeding events were mainly driven by hospitalization with an overnight stay with twice as many subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group (1.7%) compared with the aspirin 100 mg od group (0.8%). These bleeding events were most frequently gastrointestinal (1.2% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.7% rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, and 0.5% aspirin 100 mg od). The majority of the gastrointestinal bleeding events excluded the oral cavity and the esophagus. Of these mainly gastric and duodenal bleeding events were reported with a higher frequency (0.5%) in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od as compared with 0.3% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group and 0.2% in the aspirin 100 mg od group followed by bleeding events of unknown gastrointestinal site (0.3% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.1% each rivaroxaban 5 mg bid and aspirin 100 mg od). The number of subjects with other sites bleeding events was of diverse origin: urinary tract (overall 38 cases; 9 cases rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od), skin or injection site (overall 24 cases; 22 cases in both rivaroxaban groups), genital (16 cases), epistaxis (13 cases), unknown site (10 cases), respiratory tract (4 cases), for the remaining sites 3 cases or less per site were documented. The number of subjects with bleeding events leading to hospitalization without overnight stay was lower as compared with those with an overnight stay (0.4% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.3% rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, and 0.2% aspirin 100 mg od) with no significant differences between the treatment arms. Gastrointestinal and skin or injection site bleeding events were most frequently reported (&lt;0.1% and 0.1% rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od, 0.1% and &lt;0.1% rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, and &lt;0.1% each for aspirin 100 mg od, respectively). Further bleeding events were few and of diverse origin: epistaxis (15 cases), urinary tract (14 cases), intramuscular (1 case), respiratory tract (1 case), genital (1 case), unknown site (1 case), and other (1 case).

## Other bleedings (not meeting the criteria of ISTH major bleeding events)

All treatment-emergent bleeding events that were not adjudicated as major and not refuted during stroke adjudication were counted as minor.

The number and crude incidences of subjects with treatment-emergent minor bleeding events by site is displayed in Table 25 .

## Laboratory findings

There was no mandatory laboratory testing during the study in the global study protocol. Investigator-reported cardiac markers in events of myocardial infarction were largely similar across the antithrombotic treatment arms (data not shown).

For Swedish subjects, additional laboratory monitoring throughout the study was performed for haemoglobin and haematocrit, and also creatinine clearance in subjects with e GFR below 60 ml/min, at screening and at 6 months intervals thereafter. There were no relevant changes from baseline or any difference between rivaroxaban-treated subjects (N = 246 for rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin and N = 244 for rivaroxaban 5 mg) and aspirin-treated subjects, with regards to either haemoglobin/haematocrit or eGFR.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Separate Cox proportional hazards models have been fitted to assess if the effect of the randomised antithrombotic treatment on the primary safety outcome is different for subjects randomised to pantoprazole compared with those randomised to pantoprazole placebo (subjects not randomised to pantoprazole/placebo were not considered).

No interaction of the antithrombotic treatment and the pantoprazole/placebo treatment on the primary safety outcome was found (interaction p-value for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od p=0.7342 and for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid p=0.5685.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall, 3.1% of all non-Japan subjects had permanent premature discontinuation of study drug intake due to (TE)(S)AE. Percentages were 3.4% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od group, 3.4% in the rivaroxaban 5 mg bid group, and 2.7% in the aspirin 100 mg od group ( Table 27 ).

Permanent discontinuation of antithrombotic medication refers to the last report of premature permanent discontinuation of rivaroxaban and/or aspirin due to AE before global rivaroxaban/aspirin outcomes cutoff date (06 FEB 2017).

All events with onset at the date of or after randomization and up until 2 days following permanent discontinuation of antithrombotic study treatment. Events with missing start date and end date of or after randomization are also considered.

* Includes events of special interest.

Most frequently reported PTs were 'atrial fibrillation' (total: 0.2%; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od: 0.2%, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: 0.2%, and aspirin 100 mg od: 0.1%) and 'abdominal pain upper' (total: &lt;0.1%; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od: 0.2%, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid: &lt;0.1%, and aspirin 100 mg od: &lt;0.1%). All other PTs related to premature permanent discontinuations of any antithrombotic study drug due to TEAEs were ≤0.1%.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

No new safety concerns were identified in the COMPASS study for rivaroxaban. As expected, the main safety concern with rivaroxaban use is bleeding.

There were significantly more modified ISTH major bleedings in the rivaroxaban treated participants as compared to the aspirin only treatment arm, with the highest HR in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

100 mg od group (absolute risk difference 1.3%). The difference was statistically significant for bleedings that required hospitalization; more fatal and critical organ bleedings also occurred in the rivaroxaban treated arms, but the numbers were small.

The combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin 100 mg od also increased minor bleedings with roughly the same magnitude (HR 1.73) as major bleedings.

Overall, there were slightly more AEs and TEAEs in the rivaroxaban cohorts vs the aspirin only cohort, mainly due to more reported gastrointestinal events and blood/lymphatic system disorders. The described AEs and TEAEs are in line with the known safety profile of rivaroxaban and there are no imbalances that give rise to any particular concern; however, bleedings were not reported as AEs but as outcomes, see above. As expected, the numbers of both bleeding and other AEs increase with increasing age. Therefore a waring has been included in the product information, that, the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily should be used with caution in elderly patients with CAD and/or PAD; the potential benefit must be weighed against the risk.

There was number of a gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation which is not a known adverse event for rivaroxaban. The overall number of these events was nevertheless low and distributed across the three treatment arms with crude incidences of 0.36%, 0.27% and 0.23% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od arm, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid arm, and ASA 100 mg od arm, respectively. Analysis of the individual cases did not reveal any new safety concerns, and having considered the low incidence rates od events which are not uncommon especially in the intended target population for rivaroxaban the CHMP considered that no action is required at this stage.

As the COMPASS study excluded patients with any history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke (as well as any type o stroke within 1 month) treatment of CAD or PAD with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with ASA is contraindicated in these patients.

## Additional expert consultations

See discussion on clinical efficacy.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Bleeding remains the main safety concern associated with rivaroxaban. The CHMP concluded that the available clinical safety data were adequate to support use of rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin for the treatment of patients with CAD or PAD.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Pharmacovigilance pla

There are no proposed additional pharmacovigilance activities based on the applied extension of indication to CAD/PAD patients.

The additional pharmacovigilance activities are based on an integrated PASS programme for use of rivaroxaban in the long-term indications (DVT, PE, SPAF and ACS).

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Particularly, a new contraindication of rivaroxaban with a history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated for all other dose strengths (10/15/20 mg) of Xarelto with relevant exposure information based on the provided clinical data. Furthermore, the PI for all dose strengths is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Xarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets and Xarelto 15 mg/20 mg film-coated tablets. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Stable CAD (coronary artery disease) is predominantly an atherosclerotic disease with narrowings of coronary arteries that give rise to episodes of myocardial ischaemia causing angina pectoris. CAD can also be caused by microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm, and other conditions than CAD can cause similar symptoms such as valvular disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe anaemia. PAD (peripheral

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arterial disease) is also typically caused by atherosclerosis. CAD and PAD share similar risk factors; both increase with increasing age and could present in different severities entailing different risks of future major cardiovascular events (MACE). Risk of future MACE varies considerably between patients with stable disease as compared to those with unstable disease, and also based on evidence of more generalized atherosclerotic disease and previous atherothrombotic events.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Treatment of CAD or PAD aims at reducing symptoms and preventing future cardiovascular events. For prevention, antithrombotic therapy, lipid-lowering therapy and antihypertensive therapy are used. At present, single antiplatelet therapy is the most common antithrombotic therapy in both CAD and PAD, with modifications in e.g. acute illness such as myocardial infarction and revascularization procedures. There are approved combination therapies with two antiplatelets that significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events but at the cost of an increased risk of bleeding. Despite existing available therapies, the disease burden carried by the more severely affected individuals with CAD or PAD is quite high, with an increased risk of cardiovascular events including mortality.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

One multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator, event-driven phase III study, snr 15786 (COMPASS). 27,395 subjects with objectively confirmed CAD or PAD were randomized

1:1:1 to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/ASA 100 mg od, or rivaroxaban 5 mg bid, or ASA 100 mg od. Additionally, subjects without a continuous need for treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were randomized 1:1 to pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo.

Subjects included were required to be &gt;/=65 years, or &lt;65 years with at least 2 additional risk factors or documented atherosclerosis in at least 2 vascular beds. CAD subjects should have objectively verified multi-vessel disease or previous MI. PAD subjects included had verified lower extremity arterial disease or carotid artery disease. Patients excluded were, importantly, those with high risk of bleeding, history of lacunar or haemorrhagic stroke, any stroke within one month, and patients with heart failure with known LV-EF &lt;30% or NYHA III or IV symptoms.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. In the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm, there was a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction with HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.66; 0.86) when compared to the aspirin 100 od only cohort; primary efficacy outcome events were reduced by 1.3% and occurred in 4.1% of the subjects in the 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm as compared to 5.4% in the aspirin only arm. When divided into the separate components of the composite, the effect was most pronounced for stroke (absolute risk reduction 0.7%; HR 0.58 (0.44; 0.76). CV death was reduced by 0.5% [HR 0.78 (0.64; 0.96)] and MI was reduced by 0.3% [HR 0.86 (0.70; 1.05)].

The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and two composites (death in coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or acute limb ischaemia, and death in cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke or acute limb ischaemia). For all-cause mortality, absolute reduction was 0.7% [HR 0.82 (0.71;0.96)] in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od arm when compared to aspirin 100 od only. For the two composites, absolute risk reduction in the composite including coronary heart disease was 1.3% [HR 0.72 (0.63; 0.83)] and for the composite including cardiovascular disease 1.4% [HR 0.74 (0.65; 0.85)].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The participants in the COMPASS trial could have CAD, PAD or both CAD and PAD. 91% of the participants had CAD; 73% had CAD only and 18% had both CAD and PAD. 9% had PAD only. The primary efficacy outcome of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od was not statistically significantly reduced in the PAD only cohort, with an absolute risk reduction of  0.4% [HR 0.89 (0.55;1.44)] compared to aspirin 100 od only.

There are analytical shortcomings with regards to the secondary endpoints, as this testing was not predefined in the way that was later carried out due to the premature stopping at the first interim analysis. ALI was numerically reduced, but the numbers were small (18 patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin 100 mg od vs 40 in the ASA only cohort).

For amputations, this was a non-adjudicated tertiary outcome. Although there was a numerical reduction in favour of rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 od treatment, these data or not robust enough to allow for an inclusion in the product information.

The participants in the COMPASS trial with CAD had CAD with either previous MI or objectively verified multi-vessel disease. Thus, there are no efficacy data on patients with less severe CAD. Patients with heart failure of NYHA class III and IV were excluded from the study. For this reason, the indication was revised to include only patients at high risk of ischaemic events.

The numerical reduction in all-cause mortality is of interest in interpreting the reduction of CV death and is appropriate to include in the product information.

The effect for the primary endpoint seemed to be somewhat lower for patients aged 75 years and above (HR 0.89, CI 0.69-1.14). However, there was a relevant effect for reduction of the risk of stroke.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

In general, the safety profile of rivaroxaban in the current study in CAD/PAD subjects did not markedly differ from that in previous studies conducted with rivaroxaban.

Both major and minor bleedings were increased in participants treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared to aspirin only. In total, 11.4% of the safety population in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg cohort experienced any bleeding vs 6.7% in the aspirin only cohort. Major bleeding was defined by modified ISTH criteria including hospitalization; this endpoint is considered clinically relevant. 2.9% of the safety population experienced a major bleeding event in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od cohort, as compared to 1.6% in the aspirin only cohort; the HR of major bleeding was 1.84 (95% CI 1.50-2.26) in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared to aspirin only.

Bleeding that required hospitalization contributed predominantly to the relative increase in the primary safety outcome, but there were numerically more fatal and critical organ bleeding in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od cohort. Fatal and critical organ bleeding events were most frequently intracranial, whereas the bleeding events that required hospitalization were most frequently gastrointestinal. The absolute risk increase in subjects ≥ 75 years of age was 2.2% in the riva2.5bid/ASA group vs ASA only; for patients with PAD only, the absolute risk increase in modified major bleeding was 1.5%.

For minor bleeding, absolute risk increased by 3.7% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared to aspirin only [HR 1.73 (95% CI 1.55; 1.94)] in the rivaroxaban 2.5 bid/aspirin 100 mg od compared to aspirin only. Gastrointestinal bleeding, skin or injection site bleeding, epistaxis and urinary tract bleeding were the most common sites of minor bleeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Patients with high risk of bleeding were excluded from the COMPASS trial.

The numbers of gastrointestinal events were lower than expected. It is not clear if the randomization to PPI/placebo in previously non-PPI-treated patients could have affected the risk of minor bleeding.

There are no safety data on patients with previous haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, or patients with any stroke within one month from randomization. These patients were excluded from the pivotal trial for safety reasons, due to a higher incipient risk of intracranial bleeding. Use of rivaroxaban in such patients is therefore contraindicated.

More subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin cohort permanently discontinued with study drug as compared to aspirin only. The were numerously more patients who discontinued due to 'adverse event', 'bleeding' or 'SAE/ESI' in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid/aspirin cohort.

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Patients with CAD and PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events despite current standard of care. Adding rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid to ASA 100 mg od is shown to reduce the composite primary efficacy outcome (composed of a reduction in stroke, MI and CV death) in a proportion that is considered to be of

clinical value for the studied population, which are judged to be at high risk of ischaemic events. The absolute reduction of the primary efficacy endpoint was numerically equal to the absolute increase in the primary safety outcome (1.3% each).

For patients with PAD without concomitant CAD, even if the results did not reach statistical significance, as the pathophysiology is the same  between the two conditions, the overall result of the study should apply equally to this subgroup of patients.

In the COMPASS study, the effect on the primary efficacy outcome was not statistically significant among subjects ≥ 75 years of age; however, there was a clinically relevant reduction of the incidence of stroke. On the other hand, the risk of bleeding increased with increasing age. Therefore, the benefit risk balance in this population should be individually assessed on a regular basis.

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The benefit of more intense antithrombotic therapy  with the combination of Xarelto and ASA  as documented  is consider to counterbalance the risk of bleeding in the studied population.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Xarelto is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

Extension of Indication to include prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) at high risk of ischaemic events for Xarelto 2.5 mg co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance.

In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated for all other dose strengths (10/15/20 mg) of Xarelto with relevant exposure information based on the provided clinical data. Furthermore, the PI for all dose strengths is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

The RMP has been updated to version 11.4.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
