| Update of section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions of use) and 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) of the SPC to implement the class labelling on liver impairment adopted by the CPMP for all anti-retroviral medicinal products on 25 April 2003. Furthermore, the MAH has taken this opportunity to update section 4.4 of the SPC, by reordering the wording on lactose (for the 300 and 600 mg tablet formulations only), on cholesterol and on lipodystrophy. In addition, the MAH has proposed to update the PL in line with the proposed changes of the SPC and to include the wording on lipodystrophy as adopted by the CPMP on 24 March 2003.                                | II/30  | II  | 20.11.03   | 06.02.04   |
