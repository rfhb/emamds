## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Spondylolisthesis,  a  condition  characterised  by  the  slippage  of  one  vertebral  segment  on  the  one below,  is  often  a  result  of  a  degenerative  disc  disease  process.  If  pain,  neurological  deficits,  and instability do not respond to conservative management, decompression and lumbar spinal fusion are the most common surgical options for progressive degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis.

Autologous bone is the standard treatment for the spinal fusion. The limitations of obtaining autograft bone  are  obvious:  the  amount  is  limited  and  the  harvesting  of  autograft  bone  causes  secondary morbidity at the harvesting site. Allograft bone is widely used, but it has not solved all the problems in bone  grafting:  the  amount  of  allograft  is  also  limited  and  autogenous  graft  has  been  shown  to  be superior to allograft, as remodelling and bone healing takes place more slowly in allografts compared to  autografts.  Allografting  carries  a  risk  of  transmissible  diseases,  such  as  hepatitis  and  HIV. Xenografts are even more problematic.

Human BMP-7 is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors and is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded, dimeric protein with two major subunit species of amino acids. Eptotermin alfa is expressed and secreted in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture process.'

Various  synthetic  materials  have  been  developed  as  bone  substitutes  and  as  alternatives  to  bone materials. The synthetic materials are not osteoinductive, i.e. they do not induce the formation of new bone. The development of appropriate osteoconductive carriers has not progressed as rapidly as the isolation  and  synthesis  of  growth  factors.  This  has  significantly  slowed  down  the  development  of clinically successful biosynthetic composite implants. Opgenra is composed of two separate units (2 vials):  Eptotermin alfa (OP-1) and bovine collagen matrix as a single unit This  combination  is  also  known  as  Osigraft  which  was  granted  a  MA  in  the  EU  through  a centralised procedure on 17 May 2001 for the indication). The current EU therapeutic indication of  Osigraft  is 'treatment  of  non-union  of  the  tibia  of  at  least  9-month  duration,  secondary  to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. '  Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in a separate vial In  the  United  States  and  Canada  Osigraft  (OP-1  Implant)  and  Opgenra  (OP-1  Putty)  have  been classified as medical devices. The active substance of Opgenra is eptotermin alfa that is a recombinant human osteogenic protein (also known as bone morphogenetic protein 7, BMP-7, or OP-1 protein). Eptotermin alfa is a growth factor belonging to the BMP family. The  BMP  family  of  proteins  is  the  largest  subgroup  of  the  transforming  growth  factorβ (TGFβ ) superfamily. BMPs are growth and differentiation factors, causing pluripotent mesenchymal cells to terminally  differentiate  (mature)  into  a  number  of  specialised  cell  types  including  osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myoblasts, fibroblasts, and adipocytes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Eptotermin alfa and collagen matrix, on one hand, and CMC, on the other hand, are manufactured and primary  packaged  separately.  Once  released,  they  are  packaged  together  as  Opgenra.  The  CMC imparts the putty-like consistency for ease of moulding between the transverse processes of the spine. The active substance in the product is still eptotermin alfa, which acts as an osteoinductive agent at the treatment site. The contents of the 2 vials must be aseptically combined and mixed with 2.5 ml sterile saline just before use at the time of surgery to produce a product with a putty-like consistency. The product  is  implanted  into  each  side  of  the  spine  bridging  the  dorsal  surfaces  of  the  transverse processes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Opgenra is proposed for use as an alternative to autograft in patients requiring posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion. The initially proposed indication was 'Opgenra is indicated for posterolateral lumbar spinal  fusion  in  adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis  who  have  failed  at  least  six  months  of conservative non-surgical treatment.'

At  the  time  of  the  oral  explanation  the  applicant  proposed  a  more  limited  indication: 'Opgenra  is indicated  for  posterolateral  lumbar  spinal  fusion  in  adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis  where autograft has failed, is not feasible or is unlikely to be efficacious.'

The  approved  indication  is  Opgenra  is  indicated  for  posterolateral  lumbar  spinal  fusion  in  adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed or is contra-indicated.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Opgenra is composed of two separate vials: a vial with Eptotermin alfa (OP-1) and bovine collagen matrix and a vial with Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC).

Eptotermin alfa and collagen matrix, on one hand, and CMC, on the other hand, are manufactured and primary  packaged  separately.  Once  released,  they  are  packaged  together  as  Opgenra.  The  CMC imparts the putty-like consistency for ease of moulding between the transverse processes of the spine. The active substance in the product is still eptotermin alfa, which acts as an osteoinductive agent at the treatment site.

Currently  eptotermin  alfa  is  marketed  in  the  EU  under  the  invented  name  of  Osigraft,  which  is practically  the  same  recombinant  human  osteogenic  protein  1  (OP-1)  in  a  type  I  bovine  collagen matrix as with Opgenra but without the putty CMC. Osigraft was granted an MA in the EU through a centralised procedure on 17-May-2001.

## Active Substance

Eptotermin alfa Drug Substance is a recombinant human protein (eptotermin alfa) produced from a genetically altered recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.

The cDNA for the eptotermin alfa gene was cloned from human c-DNA libraries using a probe based on peptide  sequences  of  bovine  osteogenic  proteins.  The  host  cell  line  used  for  the  construction  of  the production cell line is a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line. Details on the preparation, testing and storage of the cell banks were provided.

-  Manufacture

Bulk  eptotermin  alfa  is  manufactured  using  a  standardized  mammalian  cell  culture  process.  All manufacturing steps of Eptotermin alfa have been validated.  The preparation of the MCB and WCB is well described. MCB, WCB and End of production cells underwent extensive microbial/viral testing.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

During  fermentation  of  eptotermin  alfa,  raw  materials  from  animal  origin  are  used.  Assurance  has been given that these raw materials do not present a risk of BSE/TSE. Appropriate in-process controls have been implemented.  Mycoplasma and in vitro adventitious virus testing is performed.

The purification process consists of ultrafiltration, viral filtration and column chromatography steps. Appropriate  in-process  controls  have  been  implemented.    Viral  clearance  has  been  validated  with reference to the appropriate CHMP guidelines.

The active substance may be stored up to 24 months at the approved storage temperature.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Specification

The active substance release specifications have been suitably justified and are supported by consistent data from multiple lots.

-  Stability

The data confirm that the active substance may be stored up to 24 months at the recommended storage temperature.

## Medicinal Product / Vial with eptotermin alfa and collagen

The drug product vial contains one gram of sterile powder containing 3.5 mg eptotermin alfa protein and bovine collagen (Type I, derived from bone) in a 2 ounce vial for reconstitution. This formulation is  identical to the one approved for Osigraft. The Drug Product is presented as a sterile powder for reconstitution in 2 ounceType1 borosilicate glass vial (USP/PhEur). The vial is sealed with a 43 mm grey butyl pre-siliconized lyophilization stopper and crimped with a gamma stable plastic/aluminium seal.

 Manufacture of the Product Bovine collagen, or collagen matrix, is an osteoconductive excipient of the Drug Product. The starting material for the production of collagen matrix is bone powder derived from the midshaft of femurs and tibias  that  are  sourced  from  animals  of  USA  origin.  The  collagen  is  manufactured  by  chemical extraction of crushed bone. The collagen is particulate and is sieved to ensure a specific particle size range.  The  production  process  has  been  validated  to  ensure  viral  clearance  using  appropriate  viral models. The collagen matrix has been characterised by protein chemistry, biological and immunological techniques. The manufacture of Drug Product consists of rehydration of the collagen matrix and reconstitution of eptotermin  alfa.    Glass  vials  are  filled  with  defined  amounts  of  both  components  and  the  vials  are vacuum-dried. The powder is mixed and separate vials are filled to yield units containing 1 g powder with 3.5 mg eptotermin alfa. The Drug Product is terminally sterilised by gamma irradiation. All steps of the manufacturing process have been validated.  Product Specification The experience of the Applicant in production of Osigraft is extensive. The release specifications of the  Osigraft  and  all  analytical  methods  have  been  used  for  more  than  6  years.  Appropriate  release specifications have been set for the finished product.  Stability of the Product Medicinal product no longer authorised

The data confirm that the drug product may be stored up to 24 months at the recommended storage temperature of 2 to 8°C.

## Medicinal Product / Opgenra

##  Manufacture of the Product

Opgenra  Drug  Product  is  composed  of  separately  primary  packed  Drug  product  vial  containing eptotermin alfa and collagen and Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) vial.

The CMC component consists of 230 mg of sterile CMC in a 10 ml vial. Both vials are maintained sterile within individual blister packs comprised of plastic trays and lids. At the time of surgery, the contents of each vial are transferred to a sterile  mixing bowl, reconstituted with normal saline, and mixed with a spatula to produce a product with a putty-like consistency.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  company  purchases  the  CMC  from  a  commercial  vendor  and  it  is  refilled  into  more  suitable containers and quality tested before final filling. Filled CMC vials are sterilised by gamma irradiation by Sterix Isomedix. The company has clarified the source and vendor for the CMC and the quality of this  excipient  has  been  demonstrated  to  comply  with  Ph.Eur.  requirements.  Also  the  release  test methods have been evaluated and are accepted for release of CMC.

##  Product Specification

Appropriate release specifications have been set for the finished product.

Compatibility of the Osigraft Drug Product with the new excipient has been studied and the company has provided adequate justification not to include further release tests for the Opgenra Drug Product.

-  Stability of the Product

The proposed shelf life for CMC is 24 months under ambient storage conditions.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

The pharmacological basis for the development of Opgenra is based on the experience gained with Osigraft.

-  Primary pharmacodynamics

The  relevance  of  animal  models  was  evaluated  by  comparing  OP-1  binding  to  the  BMP  receptor extracellular  domains  (ECD)  from  human,  rat  and  rabbit  in  a  Biacore  assay.  Comparative  binding affinities (Kd) between human, rat and rabbit BMPR ECDs were demonstrated. However, the receptor binding of OP-1 in large animal models, dog and sheep, was not addressed.

Athymic rats were used to compare the efficacy of Opgenra with Grafton Putty ® (DBM, demineralised bone matrix). A significantly higher fusion rate was observed for Opgenra than for Grafton Putty ® . However these results  have  been  obtained  using  a  Grafton  Putty ® dose  lower  than  that  used  in  the studies where the efficacy was shown

.

Dogs were used to evaluate and compare treatments of Opgenra alone, Opgenra in conjunction with autograft, and  autograft alone in terms  of their respective abilities to promote  a  successful posterolateral  spinal  arthrodesis.  Overall,  these  data  showed  that  spinal  fusion  rate  with  Opgenra  is comparative  to  autograft,  and  that  the  fusion  rate  can  be  accelerated  with  Opgenra  without compromising the structural integrity of the bone.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rabbit pseudarthrosis repair model was used to evaluate the ability of Opgenra to induce fusion under challenging conditions. Nicotine exposure is known to impair bone healing and is used here to induce pseudarthrosis. These data showed that in conditions where spinal fusion is compromised, Opgenra appeared to produce efficient healing where autograft did not.

Opgenra was shown to produce comparative healing results in another challenging condition where multi-level  spinal  fusion  was  attempted,  namely  the  sheep  model.  Opgenra  was  compared  with autograft, collagen+CMC  carrier and with no-graft treatment. Depending  on  the method  of assessment, a 56% fusion rate at best was noted. While no fusion was detected in the no-graft and carrier groups, Opgenra and autograft treatments produced significantly higher and comparable fusion rates  when  assessed  by  manual  palpation,  radiographic  analysis  and  biomechanical  testing.  No difference was seen between Opgenra and autograft treatments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy of Opgenra was compared with Osigraft and autograft (control) in the dog laminectomy and spinal fusion model. The fusion rate success appeared to vary depending on the method of assessment. Manual  palpation  revealed  91%  fusion  rate  for  Opgenra  and  80%  for  Osigraft,  while  25%  of  the animals in the control group fused. However, when more strict fusion criteria of CT evaluation were used the fusion rates were 63% for Opgenra, 40% for Osigraft and 25% for the control.

A study was performed in dogs to evaluate the effects of the osteogenic protein device on neurological tissue in a canine laminectomy and posterolateral spinal fusion model. The primary objective of this study was to discover potential neurotoxic effects of OP-1 formulations (Osigraft and Opgenra) on the spinal  cord  in  a  clinically  relevant  model  of  spine  fusion.  The  safety  assessment  included  clinical monitoring  for  neurological  deficit,  computed  tomography  imaging  (CT)  and  gross  observation  at necropsy of spinal canal stenosis and neuropathological evaluation of the spinal cord for neurotoxicity. The dura was opened and small amounts of Osigraft and Opgenra were placed in the subarachnoid space. Although pathological features of neurotoxicity were not detected, there were certain findings, such as spinal cord compression, oedema, and demyelination that were observed in majority of the animals of the OP-1 treatment groups but not in the control animals. Furthermore, all Osigraft and Opgenra treated animals showed clear signs of inflammation

The submitted safety pharmacology studies have been evaluated during the marketing authorisation process of Osigraft and were not re-evaluated. Those studies were performed in rat, and effects on the cardiovascular  function  were  observed.  The  observed  effects  included  transient  increase  in  blood pressure,  tachycardia,  bradycardia  and  elevated  temperature.  To  further  evaluate  the  cardiovascular effects  of  OP-1,  an  additional  safety  pharmacology  study  in  dog  was  submitted  in  response  to  the D120 List of Questions. The observations in rats were assumed to be due to intravascular precipitation and embolisation, and to minimise such effects OP-1 was administered as a slow bolus injection into the dogs. Intravenous slow bolus injection of OP-1 was not associated with changes in cardiovascular or respiratory function.

These studies provide evidence that Opgenra is effective in large animal posterolateral lumbar fusion models.  With  regard  to  size,  sheep  would  be  the  best  large  animal  model  to  support  clinical  use. However, there is a significant caveat in the sheep studies. No information on randomisation and/or normalisation of data according to the weight has been provided. As sheep can substantially vary in weight, either randomisation of animals into treatment groups according to the weight, or normalisation  of  data  according  to  weight  may  be  necessary.  Furthermore,  these  studies  have  been performed in animals that are skeletally mature but relatively young in their adulthood. Therefore, it can be assumed that the new bone formation and bone healing properties of these animals are optimal. The same properties within human patients may be compromised in special populations.  Secondary pharmacodynamics Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  not  been  performed.  The  absence  of  pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies are justified by the fact that Opgenra will remain at the site of administration, and by the experience from clinical use of Osigraft.  Safety pharmacology programme Medicinal product no longer authorised

##  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

The absence of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies has been justified by the fact that Opgenra will remain at the site of administration, and by the experience from clinical use of Osigraft.

## Pharmacokinetics

125 I-Opgenra pharmacokinectis and distribution have been studied in the rats and monkeys following single intravenous administration of the OP-1 protein in the fusion site.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A dose proportional exposure (AUC) and a rapid clearance were observed in monkeys dosed with a single i.v. bolus of eptotermin alfa.  Rapid biphasic elimination was observed at the high-dose level. Elimination half lives were dependent on dose. Clearance data indicated that renal clearance may have been predominant. The apparent volume of distribution  was low indicating that eptotermin alfa was not distributed into a deep compartment in tissues.

In rat ,  similar PK characteristics were observed for all measured parameters at the doses used. Rats were dosed with a single i.v. bolus of eptotermin alfa at 0.025, 0.25, 2.5, and 3.5 mg/kg. Exposure was dose proportional and clearance was rapid with a biphasic elimination profile observed for all dose levels.  Elimination  half  lives  were  dependent  on  dose.  Clearance  was  similar  to  the  glomerular filtration rate in the rat. Volume of distribution was low and comparable to total body water of the rat.

Another study in rat was conducted using radio-labelled 125 I-eptotermin alfa to determine the rate of clearance from the systemic circulation. 125 I-eptotermin alfa was administered intravenously. Elimination of radioactivity  from  the  blood  stream  exhibited  first  order  kinetics.  The  terminal  halflives  of  total  and  TCA-precipitable  protein-bound  radioactivity  were  independent  of  dose  over  the dose range in both male and female rats. The mean t 1/2 of total radioactivity was 8.0 and 5.9 hours in male and female rats, respectively, and for the protein-bound radioactivity the t 1/2 was estimated to be 15.1 and 9.6 hours, respectively.

Excretion  of  radioactivity  was  evaluated  in  the  rabbit  following  the  surgical  implantation  of 125 IOpgenra. Excretion occurred mainly via urine.

Disposition  kinetics  of  radiolabelled  eptotermin  alfa  was  determined  in  male rabbits following surgical  implantation  of 125 I-Opgenra  into  lumbar  spine.  The  radioactivity  concentrations  in  blood were low. Maximum blood levels were achieved at 24 hours. These data show that radioactivity is continuously released from the implant. However, it is not known whether it is native protein-bound (eptotermin alfa) or free 125 I or 125 I bound to degradation products. Tissue distribution of 125 I-eptotermin alfa was evaluated in rat following an i.v. administration. Peak concentrations  in  the  blood,  liver,  lungs,  spleen,  and  thyroid  were  much  higher  than  those  in  other tissues regardless of the gender. The  tissue  distribution  of 125 I-eptotermin  alfa  was  also  evaluated  in rabbit following  the  surgical implantation  of 125 I-Opgenra.  The  highest  tissue  radioactivity  concentration  and  AUC  values  were obtained from the surgical sites, urinary bladder wall, urinary bladder contents, and thyroid gland. The thyroid levels were suggested to be attributed to free 125 I. The high concentrations in urinary bladder wall  and  urinary  bladder  contents  are  somewhat  expected  since  Opgenra  is  predominantly  excreted into urine.    Besides the surgical site, thyroid gland and urinary bladder wall, radioactivity was noted up to 72h in several organs and tissues. Apart from the implant site, thyroid gland and urinary bladder wall, relatively high AUC 0-tlast values were determined for seminal vesicle, myocardium and prostate gland.  No  exposure  was  observed  in  the  adipose  tissue  (white  and  brown  fat),  brain,  eye,  pituitary gland,  skeletal  muscle  (dorsal),  and  spinal  cord  where  the  mean  radioactivity  concentrations  were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) for all time points. Toxicokinetic evaluation in a new toxicity study submitted in response to D120 questions confirmed that OP-1 is continuously released at low level from the implant site. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Placental transfer was evaluated in pregnant rats using 125 I-eptotermin alfa. Considering that no more that 2 to 3% of the dose is found in the bloodstream after implantation, the expected potential transfer of eptotermin alfa may be negligible.

## Toxicology

Opgenra  toxicology  studies  include  a  pivotal  single-dose  toxicology  study  with  subcutaneous implantation of Opgenra in rat, a genotoxicity study (Ames test) with Opgenra, a cytotoxicity study in L292  cells,  and  an  epicutaneous  sensitisation  study  in  guinea  pig.  All  toxicology  studies  were conducted  in  compliance  with  the  GLP  regulations,  except  where  stated.  Those  exceptions  are considered not to have had an impact on the outcome of the toxicology program.

##  Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity  studies  with  intravenous  injection  of  eptotermin  alfa  were  performed  in  mouse and in rats. No acute toxicity was observed  in these studies.

Single-dose  toxicity  studies  with  subcutaneous  implantation  of  Osigraft  (2studies)  with  doses  up  to 1.740mg/kg eptotermin alfa, were performed in rats. Evidence of systemic toxicity was not noted in the short-term (14 or 21 days) studies.

In  the  52-week  study  (a  subgroup  of  animals  from  the  104-weeks  carcinogenicity  study)  neoplastic changes  were  observed  after  a  single  subcutaneous  administration  of  Osigraft.  These  consisted  of pleiomorphic sarcomas at the site of implantation of Osigraft. The sarcomas showed a trend of increased incidence with dose of Osigraft

In  the  14-day  subcutaneous  implantation  study  with  Opgenra  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in haemoglobin, packed cell volume levels and red blood cell count was noted in the high-dose group female,  as  well  as  females  in  the  low  and  mid-dose  groups  had  statistically  significant  decrease  in haemoglobin  level.  These  findings  are  unrelated  to  the  treatment  because  all  individual  values  fell within the recorded background values.  Significant increase of adrenals and liver weights was noted in high-dose females.

In the 4-week monkey study, local unresolved (8 weeks recovery) responses were observed at all dose levels.  These  included  damage  of  blood  vessels  at  injection  site,  local  vasculopathy,  thrombi,  and fibrosis.  These  were  also  noted  in  control  group  but  to  a  less  extent.  A  small  focus  of  osseous differentiation at the injection site  was  seen  in  the  high-dose  animals.  In  monkeys,  clinical observations were done on a twice a day basis throughout the study and there no observations other than the injection sites described above.  A complete list of tissues and organs were microscopically examined for histopathological findings.  There were no findings other than those at the injection site.

Local  foci  of  ossification  were  found  in  short-term  and  long-term  studies  after  subcutaneous implantation with Osigraft and Opgenra at all dose levels. Inflammation was the most notable finding common to all studies. Signs of chronic inflammation were observed in majority of the animals at all dose levels, and were associated with fibroplasia and fibrosis. There may be several mechanisms for these inflammatory reactions. They may represent a stimulated regeneration or foreign body reactions. However, an immune reaction cannot be excluded.  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) Repeat-dose toxicity studies with intravenous injection of eptotermin alfa were performed in rats and in monkey. Body weight decrease was observed in both rats and monkeys. Changes in haematology were observed in the 4-week rat study; decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit, packed cell volume, as well as elevated levels of platelets, neutrophils and leukocytes in high-dose males and females. Also, a decrease in serum albumin, and increase in serum globulin, potassium and cholesterol was noted in high-dose males and females. Changes in the organ weights were also noted; reduced ovary weight in females and increased testis weight in males. Thymus weight was decreased in both females and males. Hyperplastic and ossified cartilage was noted locally at all doses. This was considered as a pharmacological effect of eptotermin alfa. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Toxicokinetics  could  not  be  adequately  assessed  since  most  of  the  serum  sample  eptotermin  alfa concentration results were at or below the level of detection of the ELISA used to detect eptotermin alfa concentrations in serum.

##  Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity of Osigraft and Opgenra was tested in in vitro studies. A gene mutation test in bacteria (Ames test) proved to be negative for both Osigraft and Opgenra, as was the chromosomal aberration test  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells  for  Osigraft  eluates.  Mutagenic  potential  is  not  anticipated  for Opgenra.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Carcinogenicity

The applicant conducted a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats using subcutaneous administration of Osigraft. There was a problem with the design of the study, however, in that the control group did not receive a positive control for solid-state carcinogenicity (see below). It is therefore not possible to extract with  any  certainty  the  effect  of  Osigraft  from  the  effect  of  implantation  per  se.  In  the  104-week carcinogenicity  study,  neoplastic  changes  were  observed  after  a  single  subcutaneous  administration  of Osigraft. These consisted of pleiomorphic sarcomas at the site of implantation of Osigraft. The sarcomas showed a trend of increased incidence with dose of Osigraft.

To clarify the clinical relevance of this finding, the applicant conducted a review of the available literature, an additional analysis of the data from the 104-week carcinogenicity study, and a review of the clinical use of Osigraft. Taking into account the short-lived bioavailability of OP-1, the reported effects of bone  morphogenetic  proteins  on  malignant  cell  lines in  vitro, the  lack  of  genotoxicity  and  histology observations from several other studies, the known sensitivity of the rat to the development of tumors at the site of subcutaneous implants, and the finding that sarcomas were observed at the site of the implant and ectopic  ossification,  it  is  concluded  that  it  is  unlikely  that  OP-1  initiates  or  promotes  tumorigenesis. Nevertheless,  Osigraft  must  not  be  applied  in  the  vicinity  of  any  tumours.  It  is  likely  that  the  bone formation  resulting  from  subcutaneous  Osigraft  was  treated  as  a  foreign  body  having  the  characteristics which are known to induce solid state carcinogenesis or 'Oppenheimer effect' in reactive animal species.

 Reproduction Toxicity Reproduction and developmental toxicity was evaluated in rats and rabbits with intravenous injection of eptotermin alfa and subcutaneous administration of eptotermin alfa + Freund's adjuvant. There was no  indication  of  maternal  toxicity.  There  was  no  indication  of  any  effects  on  the  embryo-foetal development  in  the  offspring  of  the  rabbits.  However,  although  not  statistically  significant,  more skeletal malformations were observed in the offspring of the high-dose group. Dose-dependency could not  be  determined  since  malformations  were  not  evaluated  in  the  low  or  the  medium-dose  groups. Prenatal and postnatal function was evaluated in rabbits that were repeatedly dosed with subcutaneous injections of eptotermin alfa and adjuvant during gestation. There was no evidence of any effects on parturition  or  on  the  postnatal  development  of  the  kits  raised  to  Day  28  of  lactation.  However,  a statistically  significant  increase  in  skeletal  malformations  (misaligned  sternabrae)  was  noted  in  the offspring compared to controls within the study, although these malformations were within the levels observed in historical controls. Placental transfer was evaluated in a rat PK study.  Rats were given 3.8 mg/kg of 125 I-eptotermin alfa i.v. (38 times the human dose). It was determined that less than 1% of the dose was transferred to the foetus. Most of the radioactivity was located in the thyroids and stomach, the expected locations for free  iodine.  Considering  that  no  more  than  2  to  3%  of  the  dose  is  found  in  the  bloodstream  after surgical implantation the expected potential placental transfer of eptotermin alfa is negligible.  Local tolerance Medicinal product no longer authorised

In vitro studies with rabbit blood and cultured cell lines were used to evaluate haemolytic potential and cytotoxicity of Osigraft. Opgenra was also tested for cytotoxicity in cultured cells. Overall, the results were mainly inconclusive; cytotoxicity could not be reliably excluded. Dermal irritation was evaluated in guinea pig, and minimal erythema was observed at dose level 0.35mg eptotermin alfa.

Dermal  and  epicutaneous  sensitisation  assays  with  Osigraft  or  Opgenra  revealed  no  evidence  of delayed hypersensitivity.

##  Other toxicity studies

Tumour promotion assays were performed with Osigraft. The effect of eptotermin alfa on malignant human  cell  lines  has  been  mainly  differentiating,  not  proliferative.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  tumour promotion potential of Opgenra would be different from what has been observed for Osigraft.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However,  the  theoretical  possibility  of  stimulation  of  tumour  growth  has  not  been  excluded.  This possibility  has  to  be  dealt  with  by  observing  occurrence  of  malignancies  in  the  post-marketing surveillance data.

Immunogenicity of Opgenra was not assessed in non-clinical models. Osigraft has proved to be highly immunogenic in animal studies, and the OP-1 antibodies seem to have neutralising capacity. It would have been of interest to compare immunogenicity of Osigraft and Opgenra. There is a possibility that the CMC component would increase immunogenicity of the product. Nevertheless, there are human data  on  the  immunogenicity  of  Opgenra.  These  data  demonstrate  that  a  relatively  weak  immune reaction against both OP-1 and collagen is induced after first administration. These data have led to a recommendation to avoid re-administration in order to avoid a secondary immune response.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  assessment  of  the  risk  to  the  environment  from  the  use  of  Opgenra  has  been  prepared  in accordance  with  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  issued  1  June  2006.  The  drug  substance,  eptotermin alfa, and the matrix, Type 1 bovine bone collagen, are both proteins and, as such, are exempt from the requirement  for  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment.  Apart  from  saline,  the  only  other  significant component  of  the  product  is  sodium  carboxymethylcellulose,  which  is  a  widely  used  approved excipient  in pharmaceutical  products  and  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  risk to the environment. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction The clinical dossier is very limited. Only one pivotal study and one pilot study have been submitted. This  reflects  the  fact  that  the  product  has  been  initially  developed  and  approved  in  the  USA  as  a medical device according to the Humanitarian Device Exemption for which demonstration of efficacy is not required. GCP The pivotal Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Pharmacokinetics  Absorption  Distribution Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Elimination
-  Dose proportionality and time dependencies

No pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in man. The distribution, metabolism and excretion of Opgenra in man are not known but are expected to be similar to OP-1 from Osigraft. Opgenra is administered locally and the pharmacokinetic studies in the non-clinical section of the dossier suggest that OP-1 is largely confined to the implantation site.

-  Special populations

Studies in subjects with organ impairment have not been conducted, and this was accepted by CHMP for  the  same  reason:  Opgenra  is  administered  locally  and  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  the  nonclinical section of the dossier suggest that OP-1 is largely confined to the implantation site.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Neither in  vivo nor in  vitro pharmacokinetic  or  pharmacodynamic  data  on  the  possible  interactions have  been  provided  by  the  applicant.  Obviously,  conventional  drug-drug  interactions  are  unlikely. However,  drug-device  interaction  cannot  be  ruled  out.  For  example,  it  is  known  that  the  product Calstrux (beta calcium triphosphate), an absorbable bone void filler, used in combination with other BMP-containing  products  has  resulted  in  localised  induration,  swelling,  inflammation,  wound drainage, infection and device migration. This possible interaction has been appropriately specified in the  SPC.  Moreover,  there  is  evidence  that  prostaglandin  E1,  for  example,  promotes  the  osteogenic activity of rhBMP (Ono et al. 1996).

## Pharmacodynamics

-  Mechanism of action

The pre-clinical studies performed suggest that Opgenra acts locally and generates new bone that is similar to normal bone.

 Primary and Secondary pharmacology No pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in man. Given the biological actions of OP-1 and the specific characteristics of the product (an implant), this has been considered acceptable. Clinical efficacy  Dose response studies No dose response studies have been performed in man. The amount of OP-l/g collagen matrix and CMC in the  product  used  in  the  pivotal  study  was  chosen  on  the  basis  of  dose-ranging  studies  in rabbits, dogs and primates. The absence of dose-ranging studies in man is acceptable provided that the product is proved to be safe and effective, with reference to the Note for Guidance on Dose Response Information to Support Drug Registration (CPMP/ICH/378/95). It is acknowledged that considering the proposed indication, it would not be possible to search for the lowest effective dose. Possible off label use can entail the use of doses different to (namely larger) than those of the current posology  and  can  also  entail  use  in  other  patient  groups,  namely  children.  Furthermore,  there  is  a possibility of  putative repeated off-label use.  Main studies The applicant has submitted two clinical studies: the pilot study S99-01S (a feasibility study) and the pivotal study S01-01US in support of the efficacy and safety of Opgenra. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The pilot study does not add to the overall assessment of efficacy but provides some safety data.

## Pivotal Study S01-01US

## METHODS

## Study Participants

This  randomised  open  label  multicentre  study  population  comprised  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of degenerative  lumbar  spondylolisthesis  of  grade  I  and  II  demonstrated  by  medical  history,  physical examination and radiographic imaging, deemed eligible for decompression and spinal fusion with the use  of  autograft.  Each  patient  was  required  to  have  undergone  6  months  of  pre-trial  non-operative treatment.  Patients  with  non-degenerative  spondylolisthesis  of  any  grade  at  the  affected  level  and patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis of grade III or IV were excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients  were  randomized  to  treatment  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  either  Opgenra  or  a  control  arm,  in  which autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest (autograft) was used. This was considered appropriate as autograft was considered the current standard-of-care for spinal fusion.

## Objectives

The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  demonstrate  that  Opgenra  treatment  is  non-  inferior  to  autograft treatment.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy was measured by calculating the 12-, 24-, and 36- month overall success rates.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  overall  success  rate  at  24  months  in  the  Opgenra  and  the autograft groups.

A patient was considered an 'overall success' if he or she met all 6 of the following criteria:

1. Radiographic demonstration of spinal fusion (radiographic success) defined as meeting all three of the following conditions: Presence of bridging bone (on AP or lateral radiographs) between transverse processes  of  2  vertebral  bodies,  and  angulation  of ≤ 5°,  and  translational  movement  of  &lt;2  mm  on flexion/extension radiographs of the affected level. 2. ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) improvement of at least 20% from the pre-treatment visit. 3.  No  revisions,  removals,  or  supplemental  fixations  (criteria  based  on  the  Guidance  Document  for Preparation of IDEs for Spinal Systems, January 13, 2000) 4. The absence of serious device-related AEs during the course of the study. 5.  No  unresolved  neurological  deficits  at  the  final  examination  that  were  not  present  prior  to  study treatment, unless the deficit was due to a concurrent medical condition. 6. No decreases in neurological status at the final examination from the preoperative evaluation, unless the decrease is due to a concurrent medical condition. The following additional information was also collected for each patient:  Visual Analogue Scale Results for Pain Assessment  Donor Site Pain (autograft patients only)  Medication Use  Hospitalisation Data  General Health Survey (SF-36) The criteria for treatment success are in line with the recommendations of the FDA guidance on spinal systems, although they are not very stringent (for example the amount of bridging is not defined). Sample size The  estimated  overall  success  rates  were  53%  for  the  Opgenra  group  as  compared  to  47%  for  the autograft group. The non inferiority margin was set to 10% . The predefined non inferiority criterion of 10% was post hoc amended to 14%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Randomisation

The randomisation scheme was stratified by investigational site.

Randomising within the numerous sites can be expected to lead to some treatment imbalance and loss of  power.  In  an  open-label  trial  stratified  by  investigational  site,  treatment  allocation  becomes predictable  towards  the  end  of  a  block,  which  can  influence  the  investigators`  decision  about  the subjects' entry into the trial. The withdrawal of 41 patients (21 Opgenra patients versus 20 autograph), on knowing the treatment allocation might have introduced a bias related to the intervention.

## Blinding (masking)

The lack of blinding is, as such, acceptable because of the need to harvest bone from the iliac crest in the  autograph  group.  To  minimize  bias,  the  radiographic  outcomes  were  evaluated  by  two  separate reviewers who were blinded to patient identification, clinical history and treatment.

For the mITT population, the SAP analysis used a logistic regression model to take into account the effects  on  success  rate  of  baseline  characteristics  that  were  statistically  significant  at  the  0.10 significance  level.  The  model  yielded  adjusted  success  rates.  The  characteristics  considered  in  this analysis were: Age: &lt;45 years old, 45-65 years old, &gt;65 years old; Clinical site; Gender: male, female; Level fused: L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1; Grade of spondylolisthesis: Grade 1 or Grade 2; Prior treatment: surgical  (laminectomy,  facetectomy,  foraminotomy, discectomy), not  surgical  (includes  no  previous treatment);  Concurrent  medical  condition:  metabolic  bone  disease  and/or  osteoporosis  (yes/no); Concurrent medical condition: diabetes (yes/no); Workers' compensation status: no or yes (includes current, pending, litigation, and other); BMI; ODI. The characteristics found to be statistically significant and included in the analysis were the following: Level fused; Diabetes; Workers' compensation status and ODI. RESULTS Participant flow and recruitment A total of 312 patients were planned. A total of 336 patients were actually enrolled and randomized and  295  were  treated:  208  received  OP-1  and  87  received  autograft.  The  remaining  41  patients withdrew prior to study treatment. Conduct of the study The numerous protocol violations, post hoc amendments of the study endpoints, (including the post hoc amendment of the primary endpoint) are of concern. These concerns include the following main points in the initial study report: Overall success 1. The radiographic demonstration of effectiveness was modified.  As a consequence the radiographs were re-read by the radiologists who performed the initial evaluations. 2. Addition of 'absence of serious treatment related AE' and 'absence of re-treatment' and inclusion of the 'neurological outcome' as a new post hoc efficacy endpoints 3. Post hoc amendments to the neurological success Medicinal product no longer authorised

4. Post hoc changes to fixed non inferiority margins (from 10% to 14%)
5. Post hoc changes to the definition of efficacy population (to so called modified intention to treat population, mITT
6. Post hoc imputations were changed from LOCF to multiple imputations.

## Baseline data

Baseline  data  were  comparable  between  the  two  treatment  groups.  The  mean  age  was  68/69  years, approximately two thirds being women.

## Outcomes and estimation

Table  12  presents  the  Overall  Success  rate  at  24  months  in  the  mITT  population  using  the  SAP analyses.  Opgenra  (OP-1  Putty)  treatment  was  not  demonstrated  to  be  non-  inferior  to  autograft ( P =0.331). The estimated success rates were 38.7% for Opgenra and 49.4% for autograft.

According to the footnote the 95% upper confidence bound is for the difference between the angular scale  values  (in  radians),  so  it  should  be  0.228.  Because  this  value  is  greater  than  the  stated  noninferiority margin 0.14, the non-inferiority of OP-1 treatment to autograft treatment was not shown. The  observed  p-value  (p=0.33)  indicates  that  OP-1  treatment  is  not  non-  inferior  to  autograft treatment. The individual components of the overall success score (pre-defined) were as follows: ODI (Oswestry Disability Index): the treatment groups were similar (80.4% for Opgenra, and 85.5% for  autograft).  Statistical  testing  of  non-  inferiority  did  not  show  that  Opgenra  was  non-  inferior  to autograft with respect to ODI ( P =0.178), Absence of retreatment: Opgenra was statistically non- inferior to autograft at 24 months (92.3% for OP-1 Putty and 88.6% for autograft, P= 0.001). Absence of serious treatment-related AEs: Opgenra was statistically non-inferior to autograft (88.7% for Opgenra and 91.4% for autograft, P= 0.038). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Neurological success: Opgenra was statistically non- inferior to autograft (100% for OP-1 Putty, and 93.9% for autograft, P &lt;0.001).

Radiographic success: Opgenra patients had statistically significantly lower rate of overall radiographic success than autograft patients (52.4% for OP-1 Putty and 74.6% for autograft, P =0.003).

## Post hoc analyses showed the following:

Presence of bone on plain film: presence of bone on plain film was statistically significantly lower in the Opgenra patients compared to autograft (61.7% for Opgenra and 83.1% for autograft, P &lt;0.001) Translational  movement  success:  Opgenra  was  non-  inferior  to  autograft  (93.6%  for  Opgenra  and 96.3% for autograft, P =0.004).

Angulation success: Opgenra was similar to autograft (76.6% for Opgenra and 79.3% for autograft). While statistical  testing  of  non-inferiority  did  not show  that  Opgenra  was  non-  inferior  to  autograft with respect to angulation success ( P =0.087), neither did statistical testing of superiority indicate that autograft was superior to Opgenra ( P =0.629).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Presence of bone on CT at 9 months: Opgenra was clinically similar to autograft (84.9% for OP-1 Putty and 98.6% for autograft). Statistical testing of non- inferiority did not show that Opgenra was non- inferior to autograft with respect to presence of bone by CT ( P =0.929).

Additional  patient  outcome  measures  of  SF-36  and  VAS  pain  scales  suggest  early  and  durable improvements for patients in both groups. In addition, the avoidance of a second surgical procedure resulted in decreased operative time, decreased blood loss, and absence of donor site pain, all of which are clinical benefits of Opgenra versus autograft.

In  a post  hoc analysis,  Opgenra  was  statistically  non-  inferior  to  autograft  with  regard  to  overall clinical success, a composite parameter consisting of ODI success, absence of retreatment, absence of serious treatment-related AEs, and neurological success (71.2% in the OP-1 Putty group, and 69.0% in the autograft group, P =0.029).

The pivotal study failed to show that Opgenra treatment is non-inferior to autograft treatment with respect  to  overall  success.  When  evaluating  the  results  of  secondary  endpoints  some  multiplicity adjustment should be done. Using p&lt;0.01 as cut off point, non-inferiority of Opgenra treatment was shown only for success rate based on the absence of re-treatment and for overall neurological success at 12 and 24 months.

The  rates  of  bridging  bone,  one  of  the  protocol  endpoints,  were  significantly  different,  31.3%  for Opgenra  and  53%  for  autograft.  Analysis  on  non  inferiority  is  not  provided.  This  endpoint  was subsequently amended to bone formation. The post hoc overall clinical success composite excludes any radiographic criterion.

## Objectives:

The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of OP-1 Putty alone or as an autograft adjunct as measured by:

-  Safety:  comparison  of  complications  and  neurological  status  within  the  OP-1  Putty  treatment groups and control group (autograft alone)
-  Efficacy:  comparison  of  overall  fusion  success  and  time  to  fusion,  and  pain/function  outcome within the OP-1 treatment groups (Op-1 alone and OP-1 in combination with autograft), and in the control group (autograft alone).

## Methodology:

This  was  a  controlled,  randomized,  open-label  (radiographs  were  reviewed  by  2  independent radiologists  who  were  blinded  to  treatment  group),  multicentre,  pilot  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the safety and efficacy of OP-1 Putty for lumbar spinal fusion, both alone and as an adjunct to autogenous bone  graft  (autograft)  in  patients  with  single  level  (L3-S1)  degenerative  lumbar  spondylolisthesis (Grade 1 or 2) with spinal stenosis. The initial protocol specified 2 treatment groups: an investigational

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm of OP-1 Putty and autograft, and a control arm of autograft alone. A protocol revision added a new investigational arm of treatment with OP-1 Putty alone, and eliminated enrolment in the OP-1 Putty and autograft arm. At all times patients were randomized in a 2:1 manner to the OP-1 Puttycontaining treatment arm versus the autograft treatment arm.

Patients  underwent  standard  surgical  procedures  for  lumbar  spinal  posterior  decompression  with concomitant posterolateral intertransverse process arthrodesis using OP-1 Putty alone, OP-1 Putty with autograft, or with autograft alone, as specified by randomization. Patients were evaluated postoperatively at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months, and annually thereafter until the last patient in the Pivotal study (S01-01US) achieved 2-year follow-up.

## Number of Patients (planned and analyzed):

The study planned 48 patients: 24 in the OP-1 Putty alone group, 12 in the OP-1 Putty and autograft group,  and  12  in  the  autograft  alone  group.  Fifty-seven  patients  were  enrolled.  Forty-eight  patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and were distributed across treatment groups as planned. Both  analysis  datasets  (the  intent-to-treat  [ITT]  dataset  and  the  safety  dataset)  used  all  48  treated patients. Of the 9 patients enrolled but not included in analyses, 8 patients were withdrawn prior to treatment,  and  1  patient  did  not  receive  the  protocol-specified  treatment,  so  was  not  included  in analyses.

The original version of the Pilot Study protocol, Revision 1.0, was filed with the IDE on 29 January 1999. The first version under which patients were studied was Revision 2.0. Revisions 3.0 and 4.0 to the protocol were minor and/or editorial in nature. Subsequent revisions to the protocol are described briefly.

Diagnosis  and  Main  Criteria  for  Inclusion :  Patients  with  single  level  (L3-S1)  degenerative  lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade 1 or 2) with spinal stenosis. Criteria for Evaluation : Efficacy: The clinical protocol did not categorically define outcome variables as primary or secondary endpoints. For the purposes of analysis and reporting, outcome variables have been identified as either a primary endpoint or ancillary clinical outcome. The primary efficacy variable was overall success,  a  composite  measure  consisting  of  radiographic demonstration  of  spinal  fusion  (presence  of  bridging  bone  and ≤ 5°  angular  motion  and ≤ 2  mm translational  motion),  improvement  of  at  least  20%  on  the  Oswestry  Disability  Index  (ODI),  and absence of retreatment. Ancillary clinical outcomes included SF-36 Health Outcomes Survey scores, leg/buttock  pain  and  donor  site  pain  as  measured  by  a  visual  analogue  scale,  disc  height  by radiographic assessment, and degree of angular motion and translational movement by radiographic assessment. Safety: Safety outcomes were adverse events and immunogenicity. Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Analysis of the overall success rate was calculated both with and without a 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) approach. Changes to the Protocol Several revisions were made to the protocol during the course of the pilot study. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Protocol Revision 5.0: eliminated the OP-1 Putty and autograft arm of the study, and added an OP-1 Putty alone arm. After this Revision, further enrolment to the OP-1 Putty and autograft arm was terminated with a total of 12 patients treated.
-  Protocol Revision 5.1: increased the number of patients in the OP-1 Putty arm from 12 to 24, and set maximum enrolment at 48 patients.
-  Protocol Revision 5.2: eliminated the 10-day follow-up visit because of low patient compliance and lack of potential safety and efficacy data resulting from this visit.
-  Protocol Revision 5.3: allowed for inclusion of a third independent radiologist in cases where the primary radiographic reviewers disagreed on the evaluation of radiographic success.
-  Protocol  Revision  5.4:  included  an  expansion  of  the  1-year  follow-up  visit  window  from  ±  1 month to ± 2 months per the FDA Guidance Document for the Preparation of IDEs for Spinal Systems (13 January 2000).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Protocol Revision 5.5: increased the follow-up to include an additional annual evaluation until the last patient in the Pivotal Spine Study achieved 2-year follow up.

## Changes to the Planned Analysis

The  protocol  objectives  included  assessment  of  time  to  fusion.  As  this  variable  was  not  defined prospectively, it will not be discussed further.

## RESULTS

Demographics  and  Baseline  Characteristics :  The  groups  were  similar  in  age  (mean  age  was  65 years, with the range among groups of 43 to 80 years), weight, height distribution. Females accounted for more than half of the patients in each treatment group, and comprised 54.2% of the Opgenra alone group, 58.3% of the autograft alone group, and 75% of the Opgenra and autograft combination group.

## Efficacy:

-  Overall Success: treatment groups appear to be comparable at 24 months
-  Greater Radiographic Success is noted in both Opgenra groups versus autograft, but small sample sizes preclude the ability to assess differences between treatment groups.
-  Angular motion: The proportion of patients who achieved success in angular motion is higher in the Opgenra alone treatment group versus other treatment groups at both 12 and 24 months.
-  ODI percent success for both Opgenra treatment groups suggests an advantage for Opgenra over autograft.
-  Patient  105  (Opgenra  and  autograft)  underwent  re-treatment  for  pseudarthrosis  (supplemental fixation)  at  7.6  months  post-operatively.  Two  additional  patients  (Patients  153  and  455  in  the Opgenra alone group) underwent re-treatment after 24 months.
-  Treatment  groups  were  similar  for  disc  height,  leg/buttock  pain,  donor  site  pain,  and  SF-36 scores.

The following table is a summary of results for the primary endpoint, Overall Success, and for the 3 components of Overall Success: Radiographic Success, ODI, and re-treatment at 24 months.

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  statistical  planning  or  analyses  of  the  pilot  study  are  not  adequate  enough  to  allow  any  firm conclusions on the efficacy. Considering concurrently the results of the pivotal study, it would appear, in hindsight, that the pilot study did have value as a feasibility study. In a setting where the autograft control  arm  has  an  overall  success  rate  of  only  33%,  the  clinical  relevance  of  which  cannot  be considered convincing, it would have been appropriate to question the feasibility of a pivotal study of this design.

The conclusion of the applicant, drawn from the results of this pilot study, that OP-1 Putty compares favourably with autograft in posterolateral spinal fusion is unfounded.

The  pivotal  study  S01-01US  was  a  randomised  controlled  open  label  study  comparing  Opgenra  to autograft  in  posterolateral  lumbar  spinal  fusion  in  adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis  who  have failed  at  least  six  months  of  conservative  non-surgical  treatment.  Although  this  study  (the  aim  of which was to demonstrate non-inferiority of Opgenra to autograft) was a large study considering the area of orthopaedics, it had major flaws including overoptimistic sample size calculations, its analysis included substantial post hoc changes and the study could not demonstrate non-inferiority as compared to the autograft.

3. the  applicant`s  response  to  the  question  on  the  compliance  of  the  pivotal  study  to  guidance (Guideline on 'Points to Consider on Application with 1. Meta-Analysis; 2. One Pivotal Study'. CPMP/EWP 23) is inadequate as it excludes major issues, such as the reason for not presenting the results on ITT analysis on the original analysis plan and the post hoc nature of the presented data

The applicant made available, the results of a follow up study of the pivotal study using new post hoc determined clinical endpoints. In spite of two rounds of questions and responses, the non-inferiority of Opgenra to autograft remained doubtful. The  pivotal  study  failed  to  show  that  OP-1  treatment  is  non-inferior  to  autograft  treatment  with respect to overall success. Using p&lt;0.01 as cut off point, non-inferiority of OP-1 treatment was shown only for success rate based on the absence of re-treatment and for overall neurological success at 12 and 24 months. In  reviewing  the  outcome,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  both  the  outcome  criteria  and  the  non inferiority margins were amended post hoc. Even so, this trial did not demonstrate non inferiority of OP-1Putty over autograft on the primary endpoint of overall success at 24 months (P=0.331). The only significant success outcomes were on variables that were not determined a priori. Bearing this in mind the results must be viewed with caution. The rates of bridging bone, one of the protocol endpoints, were significantly different, 31.3% for OP-1 Putty and  53%  for  autograft  (analysis  on  non  inferiority not  provided).  This  endpoint  was subsequently amended to bone formation. The post hoc overall clinical success composite excludes any radiographic criterion. Major concerns remained about the robustness of the single pivotal study: 1. the applicant has not provided in the written responses the requested ITT analyses based on the original analysis plan i.e. on the a priori determined endpoints of the pivotal study, as requested also by scientific advice and gave no reason for not presenting them. 2. the applicant has not provided adequate or sufficient evidence to justify the post hoc changes made to the original analysis plan; Medicinal product no longer authorised

4. the presentation and discussion of the handling and the impact of missing data is inadequate and insufficient and not according to scientific advice;

At the time of the oral explanation the applicant addressed the above concerns as follows:

The original protocol indicated that the analysis was to be completed on treated patients only (ITT in protocol). The applicant explained that the major change to the primary endpoint (presence of bone instead  of  originally  bridging  bone)  was  done  because  of  insensitivity  of  plain  films  at  assessing bridging bone Translational movement of ≤ 3mm instead of originally ≤ 2 mm was based on FDA  guidance.  The  original  neurologic  endpoint  was  not  specifically  defined  and  would  have resulted in failure in overall success in all patients (both groups).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Imputation was conducted in 4 ways. However, careful discussion of the impact of the large number of missing data was not presented.

Furthermore,  to  explain  the  apparent  discrepancy  between  presence  of  bone  and  clinical  and radiographic measures of stability (angulation and translation), the applicant presented the hypothesis that medial bone formation led to underestimation of presence of bone at 24 months since plain X-rays provide poor visualisation medially.

Also at the time of the oral explanation, the applicant proposed a more restricted target population:

-  patients with co-morbidities or characteristics that make autograft not feasible or unlikely to be efficacious, including: osteoporosis  or other conditions  affecting bone  quality; significant underlying  medical  conditions  in  which  minimising  operative  time  is  critical;  steroid  or  other medications  that impair bone formation; smokers
-  patients who have failed prior autograft attempts.

To support the new indication, a summary of a prospective cohort study of 30 patients was presented (Fehling Study)

The explanations and proposals provided by the applicant did not fully resolve the CHMP concerns. Furthermore, no data from the pivotal study (subgroup analysis) specifically support the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product in the newly proposed restricted target population; and extrapolation of efficacy to the newly proposed population based on the failed pivotal study is difficult. An issue already presented in the Day150 Joint rapporteurs` assessment report and discussed again during  the  oral  explanation,  concerned  the  fact  that  the  optimal  surgical  methodology  has  changed since  the  time  the  study  was  carried  out,  and  that  the  technique  used  in  the  pivotal  study  (noninstrumental) is not anymore considered to be state-of-the art. In conclusion, non-inferiority of Opgenra to bone autograft, in the proposed therapeutic indication, has not been demonstrated. The validity, robustness and the clinical relevance of the presented results of the single pivotal trial to support the safety and efficacy of Opgenra are questionable. Clinical safety  Patient exposure In the pivotal study all 208 patients in the Opgenra group were treated once with 2 units (7.0 mg) of Opgenra and followed for up to 36 months. All 87 patients in the autograft group were treated with autologous iliac crest bone graft and followed for up to 36 months. In the pilot study S99-01US 48 patients received treatment, 36 of which included Opgenra. Opgenra formulation has been on the market already for several years in the USA and the estimated patient exposure to Opgenra is reported to be over 16000 patients solely in the USA.

Table 8 - Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by MedDRA System Organ Class (Safety Population)

| no |          |

Post-operative anaemia was reported more frequently in the autograft group (13.8% of patients) versus the  Opgenra  group  (4.8%  of  patients, P =0.013).  This  is  presumed  to  be  related  to  the  additional surgical procedure (i.e., autograft harvest) and is corroborated by findings of increased operative time and estimated blood loss in this treatment group.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

A conservative statistical cut-off ( P =0.2) was imposed to identify potential differences in AEs between treatment groups. While the safety profiles of the 2 treatment groups were generally comparable, there were 4 System Organ Class (SOC) categories in which the OP-1 Putty group showed an overall higher incidence of AEs than did the autograft group based on this statistical cut-off. The categories were:

-  Cardiac Disorders: 13% in Opgenra patients, 5.7% in Autograft ( P =0.098)
-  Infections and Infestations: 23.6% in Opgenra patients, 14.9% in Autograft patients ( P = 0.117)
-  Respiratory, Thoracic And Mediastinal Disorders: 15.9% in Opgenra patients, 6.9% in autograft patients ( P =0.039)
-  Gastrointestinal Disorders: 21.6% in Opgenra patients, 13.8% in autograft patients ( P =0.145).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 2 SOCs that had AEs reported more frequently in the autograft group than in the Opgenra group:

-  Blood And Lymphatic System Disorders: 5.8% in Opgenra patients, 14.9% in autograft patients (P=0.019)
-  Injury,  Poisoning  and  Procedural  Complications  :  33.7%  in  Opgenra  patients,  47.1%  Autograft patients (P=0.035)

Cardiac AEs : The following AEs were reported only by patients randomised to the Opgenra treatment group:  acute  coronary  syndrome  (1.0%),  atrial  fibrillation  (2.4%),  cardiac  failure  (0.5%),  cardiac failure  congestive  (1.4%),  chest  discomfort  (0.5%),  coronary  artery  disease  (1.0%),  myocardial ischaemia  (0.5%),  and  tachycardia  (1.4%).  Of  note,  myocardial  infarction  was  reported  more frequently  in  Opgenra  patients  as  opposed  to  autograft  patients  (2.4%  and  1.1%  respectively). Supraventricular  tachycardia  was  reported  once  by  a  patient  who  received  autograft.  Most  of  the events in the Opgenra group, and all in the autograft group, were classified as 'mild' or 'moderate' in severity.  Patients  in  the  Opgenra  group  who  experienced  'severe'  events  reported  myocardial infarction (1.4%), coronary artery disease (1.0%), chest pain (0.5%), and cardiac failure (0.5%).

## Pilot study S99-01US .

The patient population studied in this trial was generally elderly, with a mean age of 68 years, and many  patients  had  pre-existing  cardiac  risk  factors  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes reported pre-operatively. In the Infections and  Infestations category, 23.6%  of Opgenra patients experienced AEs, representing  6.6%  of  the  events,  while  14.9%  of  the  autograft  group  patients  experienced  AEs, representing  4.6%  of  the  events  ( P =0.117),.  None  of  the  events  reported  were  determined  to  be 'suspected related' to the autograft. The following AEs were reported only by patients randomized to the  Opgenra  treatment  group  :  clostridium  colitis  (1.9%),  cystitis  (0.5%),  ear  infection  (1.0%), gastroenteritis viral (0.5%), herpes virus infection (0.5%), meningitis (0.5%), nasopharyngitis (0.5%), oral infection (0.5%), parotitis (0.5%), post-polio syndrome (0.5%), sepsis (0.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (0.5%), urosepsis (0.5%), and wound infection staphylococcal (0.5%). Bone infection, laryrinthitis, and stitch abscess were only reported by one patient each who received autograft (1.1%). Of  the  Infections  and  Infestations  AEs,  there  were  4  preferred  terms  that  appeared  to  show  a preponderance of events in the Opgenra treatment group over the autograft group: Clostridium colitis (1.9% vs. 0%), herpes zoster (2.9% vs. 1.1%), pneumonia (2.9% vs. 1.1%), and urinary tract infection (5.3% vs. 3.4%). Infections are commonly observed in the post-operative setting. There is no known basis  for  suspecting  that  Opgenra  contributed  to  these  events,  whether  from  mechanism  of  action, preclinical studies of pharmacology or toxicology, or post- market surveillance. In the SOC Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Although  the  2  treatment  groups  were  statistically  identified  as  potentially  different  based  on conservative criteria SOC P=0.2 level (15.9% in the Opgenra group and 6.9% in the autograft group) ( P =0.039), no concerning pattern of clinical events emerged in the Opgenra treatment group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Adverse  events  (AE)  occurred  in  100%  of  patients  across  all  treatment  groups:  149  in  the  36 patients in the Opgenra treatment groups (with or without autograft), and 51 in the 12 patients treat who received autograft.
-  Thirty-six serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 18 patients across all treatment groups, and none were attributed to the use of Opgenra.
-  Four patients across treatment groups reported 8 malignancies, none of which were attributed to the use of Opgenra.
-  One death, due to carcinomatosis, occurred in this study.
-  Pseudarthrosis was reported predominantly between 6 and 12 months postoperatively and in 13 (36%) patients who received an Opgenra-containing regimen (10 patients, 28% in the Opgenra alone  arm).  Only  2  of  these  13  patients  required  a  surgical  retreatment  due  to  pseudarthrosis. There were no reports of pseudarthrosis in the autograft alone treatment group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Post-operative wound infections occurred in 4 patients who received Opgenra alone, and did not occur in patients who received an autograft.
-  There was no evidence of neurological deterioration post-operatively in any treatment group.
-  Seven  patients  in  the  Opgenra  alone  group  had  neutralizing  antibodies  at  either  6  weeks  or  6 months post-procedure, however no pattern of immunologically mediated AEs has emerged. The Overall  Success  rates  of  Opgenra  patients  with  or  without  neutralizing  antibodies  appeared comparable, 42.3% vs. 44.8%.

Although the applicant concluded that safety in S99-01S was comparable for the two study groups, several  AEs,  including  pseudarthrosis  and  wound  infection  were  overrepresented  in  the  Opgenra treatment group.

-  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

As  seen  in  the  Table  below,  there  was  no  difference  between  the  numbers  of  deaths  between  the treatment groups (taken the 2:1 randomisation into account)

Table 9 - Deaths  Laboratory findings No clinically meaningful differences were found between treatment groups.  Immunological events Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immunogenicity evaluation was carried out as part of studies S99-01US and S01-01US using patient serum samples collected preoperatively (baseline), post-operatively, and at the 6 week, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month follow up visits. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to detect the presence  of  anti-OP-1  antibodies  in  all  samples.  ELISA  methods  were  validated  to  detect  human antihuman OP-1 antibodies with IgG, IgM, and IgE isotypes. The ELISA cut point for this study was statistically based and reflects a false positive rate of 5 %, as recommended in Mire-Sluis, et al., 2004. Positive samples in the screening ELISA were evaluated in a titer ELISA to quantitate the level of anti-OP-1  antibodies  in  the  sample.  The  results  of  this  assay  are  reported  as  a  log  titer,  which corresponds to the lowest dilution of the sample that yields a positive result. The measurable log titer range in this assay extends from 1.90 to 6.11.

Samples found to be positive in the titer ELISA were further analyzed to determine whether antibodies to OP-1 had the ability to neutralize its activity in vitro. Initially, ELISA positive samples were tested in  an  alkaline  phosphatase-based  neutralizing  antibody  assay).  In  this  assay,  anti-OP-1  neutralizing antibodies are detected based on their ability to reduce the OP-1-induced alkaline phosphatase activity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

measured  48  hours  post  treatment.  The  cut  point  for  this  Neutralising  Antibody  (Nab)  assay  was determined  statistically,  based  on  the  variability  of  the  response  of  preoperative  (N=245)  serum samples from this study. As described above for the ELISA, this Nab assay cut point was set to reflect a 5% false positive rate.

The assessment of the used methodology, and consequently the results, is limited without any method validation  data.  No  validation  data  for  the  described  ELISA  'screening  assay',  the  ELISA  'titer method', the Nab assay, the PCR method were provided. A method for the quantitative determination of OP-1 antibodies was presented, but no quantitative data based on these analyses were presented or discussed.

The following Table 10 is a short summary of the results of the immunological status of the patients:

Table 10 - Patients with Positive Screening Test and Anti-OP-1 Neutralizing Antibody at Any Visit (Safety Population)

No significant patterns emerge from these profiles except that the peak presence of antibody titers was observed between 6 weeks and 3 months and declined thereafter.

There was no evidence of an increase in the number of patients with the following AEs at any time point in the neutralising antibody-positive patients' versus the neutralising antibody-negative patients.

For  the  follow  up  study  the  applicant  presented  a  final  study  report,  the  validation  reports  of  the immunological methods and has included a summary and also raw data of the immunological analyses of the follow-up study of the single pivotal study of this MAA. The methodology used in the followup study differs from that used in the pivotal study.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The results of the immunological testing of this follow up study support the results and conclusions of the  pivotal  study:  Opgenra  is  immunogenic,  the  main  conclusion  being  that  repeated  use  cannot  be recommended due to risks associated with an enhanced (secondary) immune response, which has been adequately reflected in the SPC of Opgenra.

## Safety in special populations

No clinical studies in special populations have been performed.

-  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug-drug  interactions  are  unlikely  but  drug-device  interactions  have  been  reported  with  BMP-2containing bone implants

-  Discontinuation due to adverse events

The nature of the treatment means that patients could not be discontinued as such.

-  Post marketing experience

OP-1 Putty formulation has been on the market already for several years in the USA and elsewhere and the estimated patient exposure to OP-1 Putty is reported to be over 16 000 patients solely in the USA. A completed and thoroughly checked update of the US post-marketing data should be made available.  There  is  a  substantial  amount  of  post-marketing  data  available  provided  their  quality  is acceptable. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The  MAA  submitted  a  risk  management  plan,  which,  upon  request  of  CHMP  included  a  risk minimisation plan. However, the CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Opgenra is a product that is composed of two separate units:  Eptotermin alfa (OP-1) and bovine collagen matrix excipient as a  single unit  Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in a separate vial Medicinal product no longer authorised

Thus, Opgenra has the same drug substance and excipient (OP-1 and collagen) as Osigraft, a product that has been approved in the centralised procedure since more than five years.

Opgenra is proposed for use as an alternative to autograft in patients requiring posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion. The initially proposed indication was 'Opgenra is indicated for posterolateral lumbar spinal  fusion  in  adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis  who  have  failed  at  least  six  months  of conservative non-surgical treatment.'

At  the  time  of  the  oral  explanation  (May  2008)  the  applicant  proposed  a  more  limited  indication: 'Opgenra is indicated for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed, is not feasible or is unlikely to be efficacious.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Quality

From  the  quality  point  of  view,  the  major  objections  were  resolved,  as  well  as  most  of  the  other concerns. The issues which remained to be resolved were listed as follow up measures.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The non-clinical data submitted were adequate and no unresolved issues remain. Animal experiments have provided the proof of concept for the use of Opgenra in spinal fusion and showed that Opgenra can promote new bone formation.

## Efficacy

Opgenra  contains  both  an  osteoconductive  component  (collagen)  and  an  osteoinductive  component (BMP-7, OP-1). The CMC component of Opgenra increases the plasticity of the product and facilitates its moulding between the transverse processes of the spine.

The applicant presented one pivotal clinical trial, study S01-01US, to support the non-inferiority of Opgenra as compared to autograft. This randomised controlled open label study compared Opgenra to autograft  in  posterolateral  lumbar  spinal  fusion  in  adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis  who  have failed at least six months of conservative non-surgical treatment.

The non-inferiority of Opgenra to autograft has not been unequivocally demonstrated.  The pivotal study failed to show that OP-1 treatment is non-inferior to autograft treatment with respect to overall success. Both the outcome criteria and the non inferiority margins were amended post hoc. The only significant success outcomes were on variables that were not determined a priori.

To address the CHMP concerns the applicant held an oral explanation and at that time also proposed a more restricted target population. To support the new indication, a summary of a prospective cohort study of 30 patients was presented (Fehlings Study).

The explanations provided by the applicant did not fully resolve the CHMP concerns. Furthermore, no clinical study data (subgroup analysis) demonstrated the efficacy of the medicinal product in the newly proposed restricted target population; and extrapolation of efficacy to the newly proposed population based on the failed pivotal study is difficult.

Furthermore the optimal surgical methodology has changed since the time the study was carried out, and the technique used in the pivotal study (non-instrumental) is not anymore considered to be stateof-the art.

In conclusion, non-inferiority of Opgenra to bone autograft in the proposed therapeutic indication has not been demonstrated. The validity, robustness and the clinical relevance of the presented results of the single pivotal trial to support efficacy and safety of Opgenra are questionable.

## Safety

The  overall  safety  profile  of  Opgenra  appears  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  autograft.  However, unexplained inflammation at the application site has been reported. The product triggers an immune response  to  the  BMP-7  and  bovine  collagen.  This  immune  response  seems  to  have  little  clinical consequences after single application. Off-label use, for example, for spinal fusion at multiple levels in children and repeated use, may take place in clinical practice. This scenario is of concern as the safety and efficacy has not been demonstrated in these situations. Furthermore, only limited safety data was made  available.  For  example,  very  few  safety  data  from  the  post  marketing  exposure  (which  was stated at the oral explanation to be &gt;16 000 patients), was presented, although some of it was referred to in the proposed Risk Management Plan.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

Autologous  bone  is  the  standard  treatment  for  spinal  fusion,  but  has  its  limitations.  The  amount  is limited, harvesting of autograft bone causes secondary morbidity, is inconvenient and is not always possible. Thus, omission of autografting would be an advantage.

Synthetic  materials  have  been  developed  as  bone  substitutes  and  as  alternatives  to  bone  materials. However, the synthetic materials are osteoconductive but not osteoinductive. A synthetic bone implant has been approved for single-level anterior lumbar spinal fusion.

Animal studies showed that Opgenra can promote new bone formation.  However, efficacy of Opgenra (non-inferiority  versus  autograft)  has  not  been  demonstrated  in  the  clinical  pivotal  study,  and  this study had major flaws. Finally, efficacy was not demonstrated at all for the restricted indication.

## Risks

No safety data on the newly proposed target population is available Although no clear safety signal was detected in the originally presented limited safety database for the previous indication, there were concerns with regard to the use of the product: -Unexplained inflammation at the application site has been reported. -Off-label use (for example, for spinal fusion at multiple levels in children and repeated use) may take place in clinical practice. In addition, only limited post-marketing safety data is available. Risk-benefit CHMP considers that the benefits to be expected from the demonstration of clinical efficacy do not outweigh the risks discussed above and thus the benefit/risk balance is considered negative. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP at the time of their meeting  in  June  2008  considered  by  consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Opgenra, for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed, is not feasible or is unlikely to be efficacious, was unfavourable and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation. GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL EFFICACY Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Efficacy (non-inferiority of Opgenra to bone autograft) in the proposed restricted therapeutic indication 'Opgenra is indicated for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed, is not feasible or is unlikely to be efficacious.' has not been demonstrated. No efficacy data has been submitted to support the efficacy of the product  in  the  target  population;  and  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  to  the  newly  proposed indication cannot be done based on the pivotal study performed for the wider indication; the pivotal study had major flaws (including poorly documented post hoc changes to the analysis) and failed to show non-inferiority of Opgenra to bone autograft.

## SAFETY

- -No safety data on the newly proposed target population is available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Unexplained  inflammation  at  the  application  site  has  been  reported  in  the  database  for  the initially proposed indication.
- -Only limited post-marketing safety data is available.

In  view  of  the  above  the  CHMP  has  recommended  the  refusal  of  the  granting  of  the  Marketing Authorisation for Opgenra.

## 2.7 Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of June 2008

Following  the  CHMP  Opinion  concluding  that  the  benefit  risk  of  Opgenra  administered  for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed, is not feasible or is unlikely to be efficacious was not considered favourable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

Iliac  crest  autograft  is  a  very  effective  bone  graft  for  use  in  creating  a  fusion  in  most  patients. Nevertheless, it does have some associated complications and is not efficacious in all patients.  The inherent risks associated with iliac crest donor site surgery include ongoing post-operative pain at the graft  site  and  a  series  of  additional  rare  but  potentially  catastrophic  complications  that  are  welldocumented in the spinal surgical literature.  Complications are more likely in the elderly, the obese, and  those  with  underlying  medical  conditions.    In  addition,  the  surgical  harvest  of  the  autograft material adds approximately 20 minutes to the fusion surgery, also adding additional risk to patients with significant underlying medical conditions.

EFFICACY The Applicant acknowledges that the pivotal study failed to meet the strict, predefined study success endpoint for demonstrating non-inferiority of Opgenra to autograft for use in the general population undergoing  posterolateral  lumbar  spinal  fusion.    However,  the  applicant  argued  that  the  body  of evidence,  comprised  of  the  pivotal  clinical  study,  pilot  clinical  study,  series  of  pre-clinical  studies, published  clinical  data  on  target  population,  post-market  surveillance,  and  surgeon  experience, demonstrates  a  positive  risk/benefit  profile  for  use  of  Opgenra  as  an  alternative  to  autograft  in  the specific population described in the proposed restricted indication and that the assessment should take into account the unmet medical need. Applicant`s description of the restricted indication Lumbar spinal fusion is the surgical treatment of choice for many diseases of the lower spine in order to provide stability and prevent further displacement of the spine for conditions such as spondylolisthesis.    For  patients  with  persistent  pain  despite  medical  therapy,  surgery  should  be considered.    Surgical  treatment  involves  decompression  of  the  nerve  roots  by  removing  bone (laminectomy)  followed  by  spinal  fusion  to  stabilize  the  affected  vertebrae.      Spinal  fusion  is accomplished with the aid of a bone graft material (usually iliac crest autograft) placed either between the vertebral bodies (interbody fusion) and/or between the transverse processes (intertransverse fusion, also  called  posterolateral  fusion)  of  adjacent  vertebrae.    Posterolateral  fusion  is  typically  indicated where  the  objective  of  the  surgery  is  to  restore  alignment  or  provide  stability  to  prevent  further deterioration in the alignment of the spine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Primary attempts at spinal fusion of the lumbar spine are not always successful, and may fail due to infection, poor vascularisation (associated with smoking, diabetes or other factors causing small vessel disease), or poor autograft bone quantity or quality.  When spinal fusion attempts using autograft fail, the  efficacy  of  autograft  to  promote  bone  fusion  during  subsequent  fusion  attempts  is  markedly reduced.  When a repeated autograft is necessary, the limited supply of autograft becomes a factor in the  feasibility  of  repeat  procedures.    Other  factors  that  can  put  patients  at  risk  also  need  to  be considered.  Soft tissue risks such as nerve and vascular injury may increase because of the residual

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

soft tissue damage and scarring at the donor site (from previous surgeries) which complicates future dissections.   Pain at either the original or second donor site can be severe and chronic, such that it affects ambulation and may result in increased use of pain medication including narcotics.  Further, the general health of the patient may be compromised secondary to infection at the donor site from the first  autograft  attempt,  making  further  autograft  attempts  too  high  risk.    Finally,  the  risk  of  repeat autograft harvest procedures may increase complications with other concurrent medical illnesses.  In addition,  the  quality  of  autograft  bone  available  may  compromise  the  viability  of  the  autograft  for either primary cases or revisions.  Patients with skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis/osteomalacia, Paget's disease are often not candidates for autograft because removing autograft from the donor site could further weaken the graft area.  Also, underlying bone diseases are associated with poor-quality bone graft, which is compromised in its capacity to form new bone and often fails to promote spine fusion.    If  primary  fusion  fails  in  these  patients  then  a  revision  procedure  re-using  the  same compromised iliac crest autograft is also very unlikely to be successful.

## Data supporting efficacy for use of Opgenra in the target population

Preclinical  tests  support  the  utility  of  Opgenra  in  the  restricted  indication.  A  preclinical  study  in  a primate model of posterolateral fusion demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the Opgenra/collagen matrix  combination  in  promoting  spine  fusion  over  a  broad  dose  range.  Fusion  in  the  clinical equivalent dose group was better than the autograft group at 3 months. BMP-7 has also been tested in animal  models  that  are  compromised  in  their  capacity  for  bone  formation.    In  models  of  chronic infection,  diabetes  and  osteoporosis,  BMP-7  was  able  to  overcome  these  compromising  factors  and induce  the  formation  of  new  bone.    Further,  when  the  activities  of  BMP-7  and  autograft  were compared directly in a model of nicotine exposure, BMP-7 was shown to be superior to autograft in revising posterolateral spinal pseudoarthroses. The  pivotal  clinical  trial  demonstrated  the  clinically  relevant  efficacy  of  Opgenra  in  all  of  the prospectively defined as well as post-hoc analyses: The MAH acknowledges that Opgenra failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to autograft according to the  initially  defined  composite  overall  success  endpoint  at  24  months.    Failure  to  demonstrate  noninferiority  of  Opgenra compared with autograft was primarily attributable to one component of one parameter, the presence of bone as assessed by plain films.  Nevertheless, the Opgenra group achieved clinically  comparable  improvements  in  all  other  key  clinical  outcomes  at  24  months  post  surgery including  Oswestry  Disability  Index  (ODI),  absence  of  retreatment,  absence  of  treatment-related serious  adverse  effects  and  absence  of  decrease  in  neurological  status.    Comparable  success  in  the other radiographic parameters measuring stability of the fused level (angulation and translation) at 24 months was also observed.  In addition, Opgenra subjects had statistically shorter operative times and less blood loss during surgery on average than autograft subjects. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Opgenra also demonstrated non-inferiority to autograft according to the modified composite overall success endpoint at 24 months, with clinical assessments performed at 24 months and radiographic and retreatment components at 36+ months.  Opgenra was clinically comparable to autograft on all pre-specified  24  month  clinical,  functional  radiographic  and  post  hoc  subcomponents  of  overall success, which was further supported by the post hoc radiographic assessment for presence of bone at 36+ months.

Unlike  autograft,  Opgenra  eliminates  the  pain  and  morbidity  associated  with  surgical  harvesting  of autograft bone from the iliac crest.  The use of Opgenra also reduced the time of the operation by 20 minutes (p=0.006) and significantly reduced blood loss (p=0.004) compared to autograft use.

Extrapolation  of  efficacy  data  from  the  pivotal  study  to  the  restricted  indication  use.  Multiple subpopulations (spinal level fused, grade of spondylolisthesis, presence of metabolic bone disease or osteoporosis, presence of diabetes, existence of prior surgical treatment) evaluated had similar efficacy in both treatment groups as the total population in the trial.

The  pilot  trial  (including  its  extension  study)  results  were  consistent  across  multiple  clinical  and radiographic efficacy endpoints.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With  respect  to  pain  and  disability  scores;  avoidance  of  reoperation  and  serious  treatment-related complications;  maintenance  or  improvement  of  neurologic  function;  radiographic  evidence  of  new bone  formation  (using  CT  scan  data  to  assess  presence  of  bone);  functional  stability  (measured  by angulation and translation); and long-term durability of success in patients followed for a mean of 4.4 years, Opgenra achieved uniformly successful and clinically meaningful results.

Research  indicates  that  patients  who  undergo  decompression  with  arthrodesis  for  degenerative spondylolisthesis may exhibit satisfactory clinical improvements at early time points (through 2 years post-operatively) regardless of whether they have achieved fusion or not; while at longer-term followup intervals, patients who have not achieved fusion exhibit worse clinical outcomes than patients who achieved fusion.  The durability of the good clinical results seen in the Opgenra pivotal study group at a  mean  4.4  years  follow-up  therefore  further  demonstrate  Opgenra's  effectiveness  in  achieving posterolateral spinal fusion and providing the attendant long-term clinical benefits of fusion.

The applicant concludes that efficacy for the restricted indication has been supported by clinical trial data and post-market data from the US where the product is authorized for a similar indication.  The post-market data consists of surveillance/pharmacovigilance reporting as well as clinical experience documented  in  both  published  reports  and  expert  statements.    The  applicant  concludes  that  these support  the  clinical  utility  of  Opgenra  for  promoting  spinal  fusion  in  patients  where  autograft  has failed, is not feasible, or is unlikely to be efficacious.

SAFETY 1. No safety data on the newly proposed target population is available The  MAH  has  presented  safety  information  for  the  newly  proposed  target  population,  which  are derived from post-marketing data in approximately 16,000 patients treated in the US under a US HDE approval.  The HDE status in the US places on the user and manufacturer a responsibility to record any  adverse  events  associated  with  the  clinical  use  of  the  product.    In  addition,  HDE  approved products require annual IRB approval and oversight of the use of the product.  Every effort was made by the manufacturer to ensure the capture of all adverse events associated with the use of the product in compliance with the local requirements for safety monitoring of implantable medical devices. The nature of adverse events reported was generally similar to that seen during clinical development. Since the launch of Opgenra in the USA as a medical device in 2004, spontaneously reported adverse events and those identified through medical and scientific literature review have been entered into a Pharmacovigilance database.  There has been an average of 0.28 adverse events reported per 100 units of Opgenra sold in the US.  Most of the adverse events received were found to be undesirable effects of  surgery  and  were  considered  by  the  attending  surgeons  to  be  causally  unrelated  to  Opgenra.  A tabulated summary of these events was submitted in the RMP at Day 180 of the procedure. When requested by the CHMP, specified information was provided on: Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Myocardial infarction:

There  were  two  events  in  patients  with  significant  past  medical  histories  of  cardiovascular disease.

-  Infections

No clinically significant pattern of infections or infection related adverse events was detected.

-  Inflammation

There were 14 events related to inflammation; average time from implantation to onset of the AE was 8 days (range 2-15 days).  All events were determined to be possibly related to Opgenra or Opgenra  in  combination  with  varying  quantities  of  a  bone  void  filler,  Calstrux  (tricalcium phosphate, carboxymethylcellulose) or other substances (blood or locally harvested bone chips). Of the 14 adverse events identified, 7 were procedures whereby the surgeon combined Opgenra with  varying  amounts  of  Calstrux  and  inflammation  occurred  within  the  context  of  product migration.  Product migration has been reported when Opgenra products are used in combination with Calstrux or other bone void fillers.  A specific warning against such concomitant use has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been written in the proposed SmPC and will be added to the physician training module to ensure such use is understood by the user.

Only two events appeared to have an allergic component to them, and the timing of exposure-toonset  (11  days  and  7  days  post-op)  may  be  suggestive  of  a  possible  product-related  allergic response. It is important to note however, that one patient had a prior exposure to BMP-2 which is contraindicated in the labelling instructions and the length of time preceding exposure to BMP-7 is unknown. The second patient had a 6-level fusion done and the amount of Opgenra used is not known. The surgeon thought the event may have been an allergic reaction to the bovine collagen carrier.

2. Unexplained inflammation at the application site has been reported in the database for the initially proposed indication.

All  adverse  event  reports  related  to  signs  or  symptoms  of  inflammation  or  of  fluid  collection  have been reviewed.

There were only 19 adverse events out of a total of approximately 16,000 treated patients related to signs  or  symptoms  of  inflammation  from  all  sources  (pivotal  study  and  post-market  adverse  event reporting).

-  Five (5) adverse events reported through the pivotal study were of mild severity and none of the events appears to be product related.  Fourteen (14) adverse events were reported through post-market surveillance, and seven of those were  associated  with  mixing  Opgenra  with  the  bone  void  filler  Calstrux.    A  specific  warning against  such  concomitant  use  has  been  written  in  the  proposed  SmPC.    Some  of  the  adverse events were reported to have had wound infections with positive identification of the infecting organism, a common complication associated with surgery.  Two of the events may have had an allergic component (see response to Ground 2). Consideration  of  the  various  types  of  events  represented  by  these  19  reports  does  not  suggest  that Opgenra is associated with any concerning pattern of inflammation-related adverse events. There were 5 events of fluid collection from all sources (pivotal study and post-market adverse event reporting) out of approximately 16,000 treated patients.  Two events reported through the pivotal study were of mild severity requiring no treatment and were reported as not related to the product.  Three events reported through post-market surveillance were reported as severity unknown and causal relation to product unknown.  Two of these three events were associated with concomitant use of the bone void filler Calstrux.  A specific warning against such concomitant use was written in  the  proposed  SmPC.    The  third  event  was  reported  as  'seroma'  and  further  detail  on  the severity or treatment was not provided to Stryker Biotech. Consideration of these five events from all sources does not suggest that fluid collection is a safety concern for Opgenra when Opgenra is used according to the proposed SmPC.

Despite  the  fact  that  patients  in  the  pivotal  trial  in  the  Opgenra  group  had  a  higher  incidence  of neutralizing  anti-OP-1  antibody  formation  than  autograft  patients,  analyses  demonstrated  that  the patients who had neutralizing antibodies did not experience a higher incidence of adverse events than patients who did not, and that patients who had neutralizing antibodies experienced clinical outcomes comparable to the patients who did not.  In addition, neutralizing antibodies were present in only 2 patients (1.1%) by 12 months, and in no patients at 24 months or at 36+ months follow up period.

## Report from the Ad-hoc Expert meeting on Opgenra re-examination

Following the request from the applicant, as agreed by the CHMP, an Ad-hoc Expert meeting has been convened on 9 October 2008 to provide comments on the grounds for negative opinion and advice on the list of questions raised by the CHMP and adopted at the September 2008 CHMP meeting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The experts considered the CHMP grounds for refusal and agreed that, although they have no reasons to doubt the principal pharmacological action of Opgenra, compelling clinical data on efficacy have not been presented for the broader nor for the restricted indication. The primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal trial was not met.

The  experts  were  not  convinced  that  the  applicant`s  argument  of  'lack  of  sensitivity  of  the  initial radiologic endpoint' is an appropriate justification to explain the change in endpoint, or to explain the failure of demonstrating non-inferiority of Opgenra to autograft in the pivotal trial. It is acknowledged that  CT-scans  are  more  sensitive  than  X-ray,  but  CT  imaging  is  impaired  by  artefacts  in  case  of instrumented  surgery  (although  it  was  pointed  out  that  this  could  be  overcome  by  use  of  special material). The experts felt, that the timing of the CT scans in the pivotal trial was also a weakness of the study. However, in any case demonstration of bridging bone was thought to be the most important endpoint whether demonstrated by X-ray or CT-scan.  In this regard, non-inferiority of Opgenra versus autograft had not been demonstrated either by X-ray, or by CT scan at +9 months and +36 months for this critical endpoint.

The experts considered that showing bridging bone on CT was necessary for the establishment of noninferiority of Opgenra compared to autograft and that clinical endpoints only were not sufficient. They also  had  doubts  concerning the sensitivity of the clinical  parameters.  The  expert  group  felt  that  the clinical outcomes were more difficult to interpret since all patients had received surgical decompression and laminectomy, which would be expected to improve symptoms. The experts acknowledged the case series presented on situations where autograft has failed. However, it  was  noted  that  the  case  studies  presented  described  a  very  heterogeneous  population  (e.g.  the Fehling study included also cervical spine fusions), and the product had been used in combination with other strategies to promote fusion such as instrumentation and heterogeneous use of autografting. In view of this it was felt that the results could not easily be extrapolated to the requested indication and the numbers were considered to be very small. The experts agreed that  although  there  is  a  need  for  a  second-line  alternative  to  autograft,  the  data currently available do not establish efficacy in the proposed restricted indication. A prospective trial in the high risk population (autograft failure or not feasible) would be valuable; such a trial would not necessarily have to be very large, but it would be important to be well designed and control well for variability. The trial population and methodology would need to be well defined in the study protocol Subgroup  analysis  data  presented  for  the  pivotal  trial  were  not  compelling.  Results  presented suggested Opgenra to be less efficacious in osteoporotic versus non-osteoporotic patients (and idem for  diabetes).  However,  a  comparison  of  Opgenra  versus  autograft  in  these  subgroups  of  patients would, based on the small numbers of individuals, have too limited power to yield definitive results. It was  felt,  that  a  prospective  trial  would  be  needed  to  demonstrate  efficacy.  For  example,  autograft versus Opgenra, or standard care with Opgenra versus standard care alone in a high risk population. It was  not  possible  to  look in cohorts of patients  according  to  concomitant  treatment  (e.g. biphosphonates), as baseline concomitant medication was not recorded. This was felt to be desirable if a future study was being planned. Medicinal product no longer authorised

From  the  experts`  discussion  on  instrumented  versus  uninstrumented  surgery,  it  transpired  that  the current standard of care in Europe tends to be instrumented fusion (with orthopaedic rods, screws or disc replacement), and would involve 360° fusion or/and interbody fusion rather than - or in addition to  -  posterolateral  fusion.  In  most  of  the  surgeon  statements  provided  by  the  applicant,  the  surgical method used involved some way of instrumentation.

The  expert  group  did  not  feel  that  instrumentation  was  likely  to  impair  the  biological  effects  of Opgenra. However the results of the pivotal trial could not easily be extrapolated to the situation of instrumented  fusion,  where  it  would  be  expected  that  the  effects  of  both  autograft  and  Opgenra  in promoting  fusion  might  be  enhanced.  There  was  a  divergent  view  on  whether  uninstrumented  or instrumented  fusions  represented  a  universal  standard  of  care.  One  expert  expressed  the  view  that there exist methodological advantages of doing uninstrumented fusion, for example that this allows an RSA  (roentgen  stereophotogrammetric  analysis)  study,  which  would  be  impossible  in  case  of instrumented fusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The expert group did not conclude on the role of instrumentation in a future study as this was out with the remit of the meeting.

The  experts  acknowledged  that  there  is  no  major  safety  concern  on  the  target  population  from  the pivotal trial; the experts noted the availability of some post-marketing data, which was considered to be reassuring. In their opinion, inflammation is not a major issue. Antibodies to OP-1, malignancy and potential off-label use would need to be followed closely.

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination and updated benefit/risk assessment

The active substance of Opgenra is eptotermin alfa that is a recombinant human osteogenic protein (also known as bone morphogenetic protein 7, BMP-7, or OP-1 protein). Eptotermin alfa is a growth factor  belonging  to  the  BMP  family.  Currently  eptotermin  alfa  is  marketed  in  the  EU  under  the invented  name  of  Osigraft  for  the  treatment  of  nonunion  of  tibia.  Osigraft  is,  practically  the  same recombinant human osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1) in a type I bovine collagen matrix as with Opgenra but without the putty CMC.

The two trials performed by the Applicant have provided evidence that Opgenra alone has substantial efficacy as first line therapy in a general population at low risk for non-union. In the pilot trial 11 of 16 patients  in  the  Opgenra  group  showed  radiographic  success  as  compared  to  3  of  6  in  the  autograft group after 4 years (7). In the pivotal trial, Opgenra appeared not to be as effective as autograft, as indicated by the failure in the radiographic demonstration of new bone formation. These results are comparable to the results of Johnsson et al, where bridging bone was seen in 6 of 10 patients in the Opgenra group and 8 of 10 in the autograft group (3).

The  preclinical  data  support  the  concept  of  induction  of  new  bone  formation.  These  findings  have previously  been  assessed  and  accepted  by  the  CHMP  and  the  proposed  pharmacological  action  of Opgenra was also acknowledged by the ad hoc expert meeting that took place 9 Oct 2008. Thus, there is a substantial body of data supporting positive effects of Opgenra on new bone formation. In  the  pivotal  trial,  treatment  with  Opgenra  resulted  in  clinical  outcomes  that  were  non-inferior  to treatment  with  autograft.  Radiographic  success  in  terms  of  new  bone  formation  was,  however,  not consistently shown. Since it was the opinion of the ad hoc expert group that radiographic success was necessary  to  show  efficacy,  it  is  concluded  that  non-inferiority  for  Opgenra  was  not  shown  for  the wider indication. Autograft is currently the standard of care in first line posterolateral spinal fusion for patients with no risk factors for non-union.  However, when it fails, there is an important decrease in the success rate of subsequent  revision(s)  with  autograft  alone.  Therefore,  an  alternative  therapy  is  needed  in  these patients, a view that was shared by the ad-hoc expert meeting. Autograft is a weak source of BMP and with limited quantity and/or quality of the graft material, there is  often  an  inadequate  amount  of  BMP  present  to  ensure  proper  stem  cell  signalling  to  allow  bone formation. A significant increase in the BMP with the use of Opgenra can allow bone to form in this setting or in other hostile environment such as scarring from previous surgery.  Therefore, there is a strong  rationale  for  using  Opgenra  in  patients  who  have  failed  prior  autograft  surgery  or  where autograft  is  not  feasible.    However,  it  was  the  opinion  of  the  ad  hoc  expert  group  that  the  data currently available do not establish efficacy in the proposed restricted indication. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Such a slightly less effective treatment would be acceptable in the situations mentioned above where there is no alternative available but actual evidence is lacking since these patients were excluded from the trials. However, in the US, Opgenra is used in these patients; there is some published evidence of its  efficacy  although  current  practice  combines  it  with  autologous  local  bone  and  often  with instrumentation, which minimizes the motion between adjacent vertebrae (Fehling series (1)).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Having re-examined the data submitted and having considered the conclusions of the Ad-hoc expert group meeting, it is the CHMP' view that the data support a very restricted indication in patients who have failed prior autograft surgery or where autograft is contra-indicated.

In  contrast,  situations  where  autograft  is  unlikely  to  be  efficacious  cover  a  too  broad  range  of conditions;  moreover,  superiority  over  autograft  would  have  to  be  shown  in  this  setting.    No  such evidence is currently available in the absence of a detailed analysis of this subpopulation in the trials performed by the Applicant. Experience from the US again shows that Opgenra is usually combined with autologous bone and instrumentation.

## Efficacy

Although no such patient has been studied in the clinical trials, efficacy data for the target population can reasonably be derived from these trials and the US published experience to support a very limited indication as an alternative to autograft when it has already failed or when it is contra-indicated.

-  Results from various animal models of pseudarthrosis suggest that Opgenra may be superior to autograft in conditions with high risk of non fusion.

## Safety

 There is evidence of efficacy on both clinical and radiological endpoints in the clinical trials where Opgenra was compared to the gold standard. These trials enrolled a number of patients at high risk of pseudarthrosis. Furthermore, comparative long-term data (up to 4 years) from the small pilot trial suggest maintenance of the effects of Opgenra similar to autograft.  Limited data on patients with prior autograft failure (i.e. the proposed indication), who have been treated in the US, are available from the literature.  Current practice in the proposed indication, as reflected by the US data, usually combines the use of Opgenra with local bone autograft and/or supplemental instrumentation; these options are left at the discretion of the surgeon.  Additional advantages of the use of Opgenra rather than revision(s) with autograft are shorter operative  time,  less  blood  loss,  and  much  less  post-operative  pain  due  to  eliminating  the harvesting procedure from the iliac crest.  However, due to the limited amount of data available in the proposed indication, there is a need for a long-term post-marketing observational study (see Section 2.7).  The risks of Opgenra have been reasonably well characterised in the clinical trials.  Post-marketing experience in the US is large. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  In addition, the experience gained with Osigraft, the same product without CMC, is extensive and there is no suggestion that the safety profile of Osigraft in its restricted indication (in the EU) differs from its safety profile in other countries where its indication is much broader.
-  The proposed SPC adequately covers all known safety issues.
-  The  RMP  for  Opgenra  should  be  updated  with  regard  to  its  indication  and  to  the  postmarketing data from the US, which should be thoroughly checked by the Applicant. It should also include a long-term post-marketing observational study. A UK and European registry that is  focused on the application of BMP-7/OP-1 already exists with a database administered at the University of Leeds (bmpusergroup.co.uk).  The website provides the following preamble: 'Pre-clinical and clinical safety assessments have revealed little evidence of toxic effects and there  have  been  few  reports  of  adverse  events  related  to  their  use.  A  small  rate  of immunological reaction following administration, resulting in antibody formation, has been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risk Management Plan

The  MAA  submitted  a  risk  management  plan,  which,  upon  request  of  CHMP  included  a  risk minimisation plan.

Opgenra has the same drug substance as Osigraft that is used for another therapeutic indication, tibial non-union fractures. Opgenra differs from Osigraft by its methylcellulose component that makes the product easier to shape. The marketing authorisation of Osigraft has been renewed.

Patients with non-degenerative spondylolisthesis of any grade at the affected level and patients with degenerative  spondylolisthesis  of  Grade  3  or  4  have  not  been  investigated.  Furthermore  pregnant women and patients with risk factors of impaired healing, such as tobacco, nicotine or corticosteroids have not been studied.

There have been no observable trends or safety-related concerns identified regarding the approved use of Opgenra that would impact the current safety profile of the products. Information regarding postmarketing exposure is submitted annually to all relevant regulatory agencies, as required by law.

## Pharmacovigilance plan

The  Applicant  was  of  the  opinion  that  there  are  no  special  activities  required  beyond  routine pharmacovigilance, that no pattern of clinically relevant laboratory changes has been associated with Opgenra treatment, and that there does not appear to be any association of neutralising antibodies and the development of potentially immunologically-related AEs or SAEs of any kind.

In the pivotal study, there was an increase of cardiac disorders, infections and infestations, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders in the Opgenra group as compared to the autograft group. These have been adequately taken into account in the SPC and PL texts.

Because of the potential off label use in vulnerable groups or application sites and the potential risk with local inflammation, including inflammation and device/drug migration with bone void filler use (Calstrux),  routine pharmacovigilance is not sufficient.

The Applicant presented a new RMP which fulfils EU criteria and addresses issues raised during the review  process.  A  detailed  description  of  the  educational  program  would  need  to  be  agreed  with CHMP and the Member States before launch. It is suggested that the MAH presents (with regard to the EudraVigilance interface) a set of relevant MedDRA terms with special focus on inflammation and related  terms.  A  review  on  hair  loss  and  cessation  of  nail  growth  has  been  requested  as  a  postmarketing  follow-up  measure,  based  on  a  possible  signal  in  the  latest  Osigraft  PSUR  (possibly indicating a systemic adverse reaction).

The  MAH  shall  agree  the  details  of  an  education  programme  for  surgeons  with  the  National Competent Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that:

The proposed SPC adequately covers all known safety issues. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some safety concerns.  the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.3 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Prior to use of the product, surgeons should be provided with educational material containing:

- a copy of the SPC
- a detailed description of:
-  Risk of hypersensitivity and antibody formation
-  Potential embryo-foetotoxicity and need for contraception for 2 years
-  the recommended methods for reconstitution of the product prior to implantation
-  the  recommended  manner  of  placement  of  the  material  together  with  some  comments  on  the importance of local haemostasis
-  the preparation of the selected paraspinal site where the intended implantation will occur
-  the methods for soft tissue closure around the implant. These descriptive texts are included in the product information.
- -Information about:
-  Hypersensitivity and antibody formation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Embryo-foetotoxicity  and  the  need  for  women  with  childbearing  potential  to  use  effective contraception for 2 years following implant
-  the risks of ectopic bone formation
-  interaction with bone void fillers
-  that the product should only be used once
- -details of the post marketing surveillance studies including information on how to enroll patients

In  addition,  prior  to  use,  surgeons  intending  to  use  Opgenra  should  receive  a  Training  DVD containing images recorded during the course of an operation on a live patient and including the following information:

-  Placement in sterile field
-  Product description
-  Wound opening (soft and hard tissues)
-  Implant field preparation (haemostasis)
-  Reconstitution of product
-  Administration (implantation)
-  Instrumentation
-  Containment of implanted materials (soft tissues)
-  Wound closure (drainage)
-  Follow-up measures

In addition, protocols for a study or studies to investigate the long term safety and efficacy of patients treated with Opgenra and also actual drug utilisation in real life will be submitted by the MAH and agreed with the CHMP  before product launch and before the study is started.

## User consultation

The user testing performed on the PL, which differs from the proposed PL of this MAA, is acceptable and  it  is  considered  to  comply  with  the  requirements  in  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  the  Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. However, bridging justification for the discrepancies with the proposed PL is to be performed and provided post-authorisation.

## Risk/Benefit Assessment

The population  represented  by  the  more  restricted  population  (adult  patients  with  spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed or is contra-indicated) has not been evaluated in a clinical trial. However, efficacy data can reasonably be derived from these trials and the US published experience to support a very restricted indication in these patients where autograft has failed or is contra-indicated.

There are no outstanding safety concerns identified in the pivotal study or post marketing experience that could not be adequately taken care of in the SPC and RMP.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  Opgenra  in  the  very restricted indication ' where autograft has failed or is contra-indicated' is positive .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recommendation following re-examination

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP revised its opinion by majority decision and concluded that the risk-benefit balance of Opgenra administered for posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion in adult patients with spondylolisthesis where autograft has failed or is contra-indicated satisfied the criteria for authorisation and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Divergent opinions were based on the following considerations:

-  Compelling efficacy data was lacking, since the pivotal study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to autograft with regard to the primary endpoint and also with regard to the primary radiographic endpoint (presence of bridging bone) in the broader indication, the population for the restricted indication was actively excluded from the pivotal study, and the other efficacy data available (case studies) described small numbers of a very heterogeneous population where Opgenra was used in combination with other strategies.
