Durvalumab is produced in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells by recombinant DNA technology.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).

Clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. The solution has a pH of approximately 6.0 and an osmolality of approximately 400 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

IMFINZI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by IMFINZI as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment, is indicated for the treatment of adults with resectable NSCLC at high risk of recurrence and no EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (for selection criteria, see section 5.1).

IMFINZI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (see section 5.1).

IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations.

## Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

IMFINZI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.

IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

## Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC)

IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

IMFINZI as monotherapy is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Endometrial Cancer

IMFINZI in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who are candidates for systemic therapy, followed by maintenance treatment with:

- IMFINZI as monotherapy in endometrial cancer that is mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)
- IMFINZI in combination with olaparib in endometrial cancer that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR).

## Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)

IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by IMFINZI as monotherapy adjuvant treatment after radical cystectomy, is indicated for the treatment of adults with resectable muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of cancer.

## PD-L1 testing for patients with locally advanced NSCLC

Patients with locally advanced NSCLC should be evaluated for treatment based on the tumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1).

## MMR testing for patients with endometrial cancer

Patients with endometrial cancer should be evaluated for treatment based on tumour MMR status confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1).

## Posology

The recommended dose for IMFINZI monotherapy and IMFINZI combination therapy is presented in Table 1. IMFINZI is administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour.

When IMFINZI is administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, refer to the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of the therapeutic agents for further information.

a  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal; BLV: baseline value.

b  For patients with alternative cause follow the recommendations for AST or ALT increases without concurrent bilirubin elevations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- c If AST and ALT are less than or equal to ULN at baseline in patients with liver involvement, withhold or permanently discontinue durvalumab based on recommendations for hepatitis with no liver involvement.
- d  Permanently discontinue tremelimumab for Grade 3; however, treatment with durvalumab can be resumed once event has resolved.
- e  Adverse drug reaction is only associated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab.
- f Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency.
- g Includes immune thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, immune-mediated arthritis, uveitis, cystitis noninfective and polymyalgia rheumatica.
- h  Adverse drug reaction is only associated when olaparib maintenance treatment is used in combination with IMFINZI, following treatment with IMFINZI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.
- i With the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment.

Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, IMFINZI and/or tremelimumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered (refer to section 4.4). After withhold, IMFINZI and/or tremelimumab can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to ≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. IMFINZI and tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 (severe) immune-mediated adverse reactions and for any Grade 4 (life-threatening) immune-mediated adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.1).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Data from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Data from patients with severe hepatic impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of IMFINZI in children and adolescents aged below 18 years of age has not been established with regard to NSCLC, SCLC, BTC and HCC. No data are available. Outside its authorised indications, IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab has been studied in children aged 1 to 17 years with neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma, however the results of the study did not allow to conclude that the benefits of such use outweigh the risks. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2.

## Method of administration

IMFINZI is for intravenous use. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion solution over 1 hour (see section 6.6).

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy

When IMFINZI is administered in combination with chemotherapy, administer IMFINZI prior to chemotherapy on the same day.

IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When IMFINZI is administered in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, tremelimumab is given first, followed by IMFINZI and then platinum-based chemotherapy on the same day of dosing.

When IMFINZI is administered in combination with a fifth dose of tremelimumab and pemetrexed maintenance therapy at week 16, tremelimumab is given first, followed by IMFINZI and then pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the same day of dosing.

IMFINZI, tremelimumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as separate intravenous infusions. IMFINZI and tremelimumab are each given over 1 hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. For pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion should be used.

During cycle 1, tremelimumab is to be followed by IMFINZI starting approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the tremelimumab infusion. Platinum-based chemotherapy infusion should start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the IMFINZI infusion. If there are no clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the physician's discretion, subsequent cycles of IMFINZI can be given immediately after tremelimumab and the time period between the end of the IMFINZI infusion and the start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.

## IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab

For uHCC, when IMFINZI is administered in combination with tremelimumab, administer tremelimumab prior to IMFINZI on the same day. IMFINZI and tremelimumab are administered as separate intravenous infusions. Refer to the SmPC for tremelimumab dosing information.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Refer to section 4.2, Table 2 for recommended treatment modifications.

For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm etiology or exclude alternate etiologies. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab should be withheld or permanently discontinued. Treatment with corticosteroids or endocrine therapy should be initiated. For events requiring corticosteroid therapy, and upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Immune-mediated pneumonitis

Immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI, IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, IMFINZI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by IMFINZI in combination with olaparib, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). For Grade 2 events, an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be initiated followed by a taper. For Grade 3 or 4 events, an initial dose of 24 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be initiated followed by a taper.

## Pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and the clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC Study, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of study treatment, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 161 (33.9%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including Grade 3 (3.4% vs. 3.0%) and Grade 5 (1.1% vs. 1.7%). In the AEGEAN study, in patients who have received post-operative radiotherapy (PORT), pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis occurred in 10 (33.3%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 3 (11.1%) patients in the placebo group, including 2 patients with maximum Grade 3 (6.7%) in the IMFINZI-treated group.

In the ADRIATIC Study, in patients who had completed chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of study treatment, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 100 (38.2%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 80 (30.2%) in the placebo group, including Grade 3 (3.1% vs. 2.3%), and Grade 5 (0.4% vs. 0.0).

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in section 4.2.

## Immune-mediated hepatitis

Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Monitor alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels prior to initiation of treatment and prior to each subsequent infusion. Additional monitoring is to be considered based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hepatitis should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by taper for all grades.

## Immune-mediated colitis

Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Adverse drug reactions of intestinal perforation and large intestine perforation were reported in patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered at an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper for Grades 2-4. Consult a surgeon immediately if intestinal perforation of ANY grade is suspected.

## Immune-mediated endocrinopathies

## Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis

Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy and hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. For immune-mediated hypothyroidism, initiate thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated for Grades 2-4. For immune-mediated hyperthyroidism/thyroiditis, symptomatic management can be implemented for Grades 2-4.

## Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency

Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For symptomatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper and a hormone replacement as clinically indicated for Grades 2-4.

## Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus

Immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. Treatment with insulin can be initiated as clinically indicated for Grades 2-4.

## Immune-mediated hypophysitis/hypopituitarism

Immune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper and a hormone replacement as clinically indicated for Grades 2-4.

## Immune-mediated nephritis

Immune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper for Grades 2-4.

## Immune-mediated rash

Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid), defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or dermatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper for Grade 2 &gt; 1 week or Grade 3 and 4.

## Immune-mediated myocarditis

Immune-mediated myocarditis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated myocarditis and managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 24 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by taper for Grades 2-4. If no improvement within 2 to 3 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive therapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month.

## Immune-mediated pancreatitis

Immune-mediated pancreatitis occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and chemotherapy, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.

## Other immune-mediated adverse reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Given the mechanism of action of IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have been observed in patients treated with IMFINZI monotherapy or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy: myasthenia gravis, myelitis transverse, myositis, polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, immune-mediated arthritis, uveitis, cystitis noninfective and polymyalgia rheumatica (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as recommended in section 4.2. Corticosteroids should be administered with an initial dose of 12 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by taper for Grades 2-4.

## Infusion-related reactions

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Severe infusionrelated reactions have been reported in patients receiving IMFINZI or IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab, or in combination with chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in section 4.2. For Grade 1 or 2 severity, may consider premedications for prophylaxis of subsequent infusion reactions. For Grade 3 or 4, manage severe infusion-related reactions per institutional standard, appropriate clinical practice guidelines and/or society guidelines.

## Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease

In patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease (AID), data from observational studies suggest an increased risk of immune-related adverse reactions following immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy as compared with patients without pre-existing AID. In addition, flares of the underlying AID were frequent, but the majority were mild and manageable.

## Disease-specific precaution (BTC)

## Cholangitis and biliary tract infections

Cholangitis and biliary tract infections are not uncommon in patients with advanced BTC. Cholangitis events were reported in TOPAZ-1 in both treatment groups (14.5% [IMFINZI + chemotherapy] vs. 8.2% [placebo + chemotherapy]); these were mostly in association with biliary stents and were not immune-mediated in aetiology. Patients with BTC (especially those with biliary stents) should be closely monitored for development of cholangitis or biliary tract infections before initiation of treatment and, regularly, thereafter.

## Treatment-specific precaution (IMFINZI in combination with olaparib in endometrial cancer) Haematological toxicity

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) (see section 4.8) was reported when olaparib maintenance treatment was used in combination with IMFINZI, following treatment with IMFINZI in combination with platinumbased chemotherapy. If PRCA is confirmed, treatment with IMFINZI and olaparib should be discontinued.

Autoimmune haemolytic anemia (AIHA) was reported when olaparib maintenance treatment was used in combination with IMFINZI, following treatment with IMFINZI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. If AIHA is confirmed, treatment with IMFINZI and olaparib should be discontinued.

## Metastatic NSCLC

Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) treated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended.

## Patients excluded from clinical studies

Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: a baseline ECOG performance score ≥ 2; active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI. In the absence of data, durvalumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. The safety of concurrent prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) with IMFINZI in patients with ES-SCLC is unknown.

For more information on exclusion criteria for each specific study see section 5.1.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of durvalumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting durvalumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).

No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. PK drug-drug interaction between durvalumab and chemotherapy was assessed in the CASPIAN study and showed concomitant treatment with durvalumab did not impact the PK of etoposide, carboplatin or cisplatin. Additionally, based on population PK analysis, concomitant chemotherapy treatment did not meaningfully impact the PK of durvalumab. PK drug-drug interactions between durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nabpaclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment. Furthermore, in the DUO-E study, the exposure to durvalumab was similar in both treatment arms which indicates that there were no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interactions between durvalumab and olaparib, although exposure to olaparib was not measured throughout the study.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with durvalumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab.

## Pregnancy

There are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, durvalumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy, and in a mouse allogeneic pregnancy model, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. Animal studies with durvalumab are not indicative of reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and placental transfer of durvalumab was confirmed in animal studies. Durvalumab may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether durvalumab is secreted in human breast milk. Available toxicological data in cynomolgus monkeys have shown low levels of durvalumab in breast milk on day 28 after birth (see section 5.3). In humans, antibodies may be transferred to breast milk, but the potential for absorption and harm to the newborn is unknown. However, a potential risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue or abstain from durvalumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

There are no data on the potential effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans or animals.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Durvalumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

IMFINZI is associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy and/or treatment modifications. The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions reflect the IMFINZI monotherapy combined safety database of 4 642 patients which includes the PACIFIC, HIMALAYA and ADRIATIC studies and additional studies in patients with various solid tumours, in indications for which durvalumab is not approved. Across all studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 1 500 mg every 3 or 4 weeks. Details for the significant adverse reactions for IMFINZI when given in combination with chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to IMFINZI monotherapy.

The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are also based on 2 280 patients who received IMFINZI 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg or IMFINZI 1 500 mg in combination with tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks. Details for the significant adverse reactions for IMFINZI when given in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison to IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab.

The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions also reflect the IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab 300 mg combined safety database of 462 patients with HCC (the HCC pool). In these two studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1 500 mg in combination with tremelimumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.

The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.2 and 4.4.

## Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity of IMFINZI as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 3 069 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as a single-agent and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Eighty-four patients (2.7%) tested positive for treatment emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% (16/3 069) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or safety. There are insufficient number of patients to determine ADA impact on efficacy.

Across multiple phase III studies, in patients treated with IMFINZI in combination with other therapeutic agents, 0% to 10.1% of patients developed treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0% to 1.7% of patients treated with IMFINZI in combination with other therapeutic agents. The presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety.

There was a higher frequency of discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older who received IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy relative to patients who received chemotherapy only (16.3% vs. 8.1%, respectively).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no information on overdose with durvalumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, PD-1/PDL-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1/death ligand 1) inhibitors. ATC code: L01FF03.

## Mechanism of action

Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that helps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokine production.

Durvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Selective blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions enhances antitumour immune responses and increases T-cell activation.

The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor functions to enhance anti-tumour T-cell activation and function at multiple stages of the immune response resulting in improved anti-tumour responses. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual blockade of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 resulted in enhanced anti-tumour activity.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 1 120 mg every 3 weeks or 1 500 mg every 4 weeks were evaluated in NSCLC, ES-SCLC and endometrial cancer clinical studies. Based on the modeling and simulation of exposure, exposure-safety relationships and exposure-efficacy data comparisons,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

there are no anticipated clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety between durvalumab doses of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 1 120 mg every 3 weeks or 1 500 mg every 4 weeks.

## Resectable NSCLC - AEGEAN Study

AEGEAN was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase III study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, then continued as IMFINZI monotherapy after surgery, in patients with resectable NSCLC.

The following selection criteria define patients with high risk of recurrence who are included in the therapeutic indication and are reflective of a patient population with Stage IIA to select Stage IIIB as per the AJCC/UICC, 8 th edition staging system:

- any patient with a tumour size ≥ 4 cm;
- any patient with N1 or N2 disease (regardless of primary tumour size), including multi-station N2 disease;
- patients with multiple tumour nodules in the same lobe or tumours that involve the main bronchus or tumours that invade visceral pleura, chest wall (including the parietal pleura and superior sulcus tumours), phrenic nerve or parietal pericardium; or tumours that are associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region or involves part or all of the lung.

The study enrolled previously untreated patients with documented squamous or non-squamous NSCLC and no prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, a WHO/ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1, and at least one RECIST 1.1 target lesion. Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 expression status confirmed using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay.

The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease, or use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days of the first dose of durvalumab. The study population for efficacy analysis (modified intent-to-treat [mITT]) excluded patients with known EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. Following a protocol amendment, local ALK testing (unless squamous histology) and central EGFR testing was mandated. There were 51 patients with EGFR mutations and 11 patients with ALK rearrangements randomised into and treated within the study; however, these patients were not included in the mITT efficacy analysis and robust conclusions cannot be drawn regarding patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements.

Randomisation was stratified by disease stage (Stage II vs. Stage III) and by PD-L1 expression (TC &lt; 1% vs. TC ≥ 1%) status.

Post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) was permitted for patients for whom it was indicated according to local guidance. PORT was to be started within 8 weeks of surgery and adjuvant durvalumab/placebo must then have been started within 3 weeks of the completion of PORT.

The AEGEAN study randomised 802 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive perioperative IMFINZI (Arm 1) or placebo (Arm 2) in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Crossover between the study arms was not permitted.

- Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles prior to surgery, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks for up to 12 cycles after surgery.
- Arm 2: Placebo + chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles prior to surgery, followed by Placebo every 4 weeks for up to 12 cycles after surgery.

In the 2 treatment arms, patients received one of the following histology-based chemotherapy regimens:

- Squamous NSCLC
- o Carboplatin + paclitaxel: carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for 4 cycles.
- Squamous NSCLC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Cisplatin + gemcitabine: cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for 4 cycles, and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 3-week cycle, for 4 cycles.
- Non-squamous NSCLC
- o Pemetrexed + cisplatin: pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for 4 cycles.
- Non-squamous NSCLC
- o Pemetrexed + carboplatin: pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  and carboplatin AUC 5 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for 4 cycles.

In the event of unfavourable tolerability, patients could switch from cisplatin to carboplatin therapy at any point and in patients with comorbidities or unable to tolerate cisplatin per Investigators judgement, carboplatin AUC 5 could be administered from cycle 1.

A RECIST 1.1 tumour assessment was performed at baseline, and upon completion of the neoadjuvant period (prior to surgery). The first post-surgical CT/MRI scan of the chest and abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenals) was acquired 5 weeks ± 2 weeks after surgery and prior to, but as close as possible to the start of adjuvant therapy. Tumour assessments were then conducted every 12 weeks (relative to the date of surgery) until week 48, every 24 weeks (relative to the date of surgery) until week 192 (approximately 4 years), and then every 48 weeks (relative to the date of surgery) thereafter until RECIST 1.1 defined radiological PD, consent withdrawal, or death. Survival assessments were conducted at month 2, 3, and 4 following treatment discontinuation and then every 2 months until month 12 followed by every 3 months.

The primary endpoints of the study were pathological complete response (pCR) by blinded central pathology review, and event-free survival (EFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment. OS was a key secondary endpoint.

Efficacy analysis was conducted based on 740 patients in the mITT population: 366 patients in Arm 1 and 374 patients in Arm 2. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the population were as follows: male (71.6%), female (28.4%), age ≥ 65 years (51.6%), median age 65 years (range: 30 to 88), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (68.4%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (31.6), White (53.6%), Asian (41.5%), Black or African American (0.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.4%), Other Race (2.6%), Hispanic or Latino (16.1%), Not Hispanic or Latino (83.9%), current or past smokers (85.5%), never smoker (14.5%), squamous histology (48.6%) and non-squamous histology (50.7%), Stage II (28.4%), Stage III (71.6%), PD-L1 expression status TC ≥ 1% (66.6%), PD-L1 expression status TC &lt; 1% (33.4%).

In the mITT population, there were 295 (80.6%) patients in Arm 1 who underwent curative intent surgery compared to 302 (80.7%) patients in Arm 2. The number of patients who underwent PORT were 26 (7.1%) in Arm 1 and 24 (6.4%) in Arm 2.

At the primary (pre-specified) EFS analysis (DCO: 10 November 2022), with a maturity of 31.9% and a median EFS follow-up in censored patients of 11.7 months, the study showed a statistically significant improvement in the IMFINZI arm compared to the placebo arm [HR=0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88), p=0.003902].

At the updated (pre-specified) EFS analysis (DCO: 10 May 2024), the median EFS follow-up in censored patients was 25.9 months. At this analysis, OS was not formally tested for statistical significance; the HR for OS was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.14) for IMFINZI arm compared to the placebo arm.

## NSCLC - PACIFIC Study

The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC Study, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 713 patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Patients had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation therapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study and had a ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Ninety-two percent of patients had received a total dose of 54 to 66 Gy of radiation. The study excluded patients who had progressed following chemoradiation therapy, patients with prior exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 10 mg/kg IMFINZI (n=476) or 10 mg/kg placebo (n=237) via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (&lt; 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years) and smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker). Patients with disease control at 12 months were given the option to be re-treated upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Where available, archival tumour tissue specimens taken prior to chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively tested for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) IHC assay. Of the 713 patients randomised, 63% of patients provided a tissue sample of sufficient quality and quantity to determine PD-L1 expression and 37% were unknown.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (70%), age ≥ 65 years (45%), age ≥ 75 years (8%), White (69%), Asian (27%), other (4%), current smoker (16%), past-smoker (75%), never smoker (9%), ECOG Performance Status 0 (49%), ECOG Performance Status 1 (51%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IIIA (53%), Stage IIIB (45%), histological sub-groups of squamous (46%), non-squamous (54%). Of 451 patients with PD-L1 expression available, 67% were TC ≥ 1% [PD-L1 TC 1-24% (32%), PD-L1 TC ≥ 25% (35%)] and 33% were TC &lt; 1%.

The two primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of IMFINZI vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS at 12 months (PFS 12) and 18 months (PFS 18) from randomisation and Time from Randomisation to Second Progression (PFS2). PFS was assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.

The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the IMFINZI-treated group compared with the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR)=0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.65), p &lt; 0.0001]. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in the IMFINZI-treated group compared with the placebo group [HR=0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), p=0.00251].

In the 5-year follow-up analysis, with a median follow-up of 34.2 months, IMFINZI continued to demonstrate improved OS and PFS compared to placebo. The OS and PFS results from the primary analysis and the follow-up analysis are summarized in Table 6.

The improvements in PFS and OS in favour of patients receiving IMFINZI compared to those receiving placebo were consistently observed in all predefined subgroups analysed, including ethnicity, age, gender, smoking history, EGFR mutation status and histology.

## Post-hoc subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression

Additional subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the efficacy by tumour PD-L1 expression (≥ 25%, 1-24%, ≥ 1%, &lt; 1%) and for patients whose PD-L1 status cannot be established (PD-L1

## Patient-reported outcomes (PRO)

Patient-reported symptoms, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 and C30 were assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until completion of the treatment period or discontinuation of IMFINZI due to toxicity or disease progression. Compliance was similar between the IMFINZI and placebo treatment groups (83% vs. 85.1% overall of evaluable forms completed).

At baseline, no differences in patient-reported symptoms, function and HRQoL were observed between IMFINZI and placebo groups. Throughout the duration of the study to Week 48, there was no clinically meaningful difference between IMFINZI and placebo groups in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL (as assessed by a difference of greater than or equal to 10 points).

## NSCLC - POSEIDON Study

POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumour aberrations. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were eligible for enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.

The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of IMFINZI or tremelimumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI and/or tremelimumab (see section 4.4).

Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC &lt; 50%), disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).

## Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:

- Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg with tremelimumab 75 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by, IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. A fifth dose of tremelimumab 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside IMFINZI dose 6.
- Arm 2: IMFINZI 1 500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.
- Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 2 additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at the Investigator's discretion.

In the 3 treatment arms, patients received one of the following histology-based chemotherapy regimens:

- Non-squamous NSCLC
- Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2  every 3 weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be given.
- Squamous NSCLC
- Gemcitabine 1 000 or 1 250 mg/m 2  on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2  or carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC
- Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2  on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.

Tremelimumab was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. IMFINZI and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance therapy (when applicable) was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.

The dual primary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for IMFINZI + platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The key secondary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for IMFINZI + tremelimumab + platinum-based chemotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DoR). PFS, ORR, and DoR, were assessed using BICR according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years (47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian (34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%), Other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%), PD-L1 expression TC ≥ 50% (28.8%), PD-L1 expression TC &lt; 50% (71.1%).

The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with IMFINZI + tremelimumab + platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy. IMFINZI + tremelimumab + platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised below.

## Elderly population

A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only (n=40) arms of the POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was observed for the IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory nature of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when considering this regimen for elderly patients.

## SCLC - ADRIATIC Study

ADRIATIC was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab. ADRIATIC was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 730 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed LS-SCLC (Stage I to III according to AJCC, 8 th edition) who had not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Patients who were Stage I or II had to be medically inoperable as determined by the investigator. Patients completed 4 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemoradiation, 60-66 Gy once daily (QD) over 6 weeks or 45 Gy twice daily (BID) over 3 weeks, within 1 to 42 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) could be delivered at the discretion of the investigator after chemoradiation therapy and within 1 to 42 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. Patients had a WHO/ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.

The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 5 years of initiation of the study; a history of active primary immunodeficiency; a history of Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis or active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection and patients with active interstitial lung disease. Patients with mixed SCLC and NSCLC histology were also excluded.

Randomisation was stratified by stage (I/II vs. III) and receipt of PCI (yes vs. no). Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:

- Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + placebo every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks.
- Arm 2: Placebo + a second placebo every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by a single placebo every 4 weeks.

- Arm 3: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks.

Once 600 patients had been randomised across all three arms, randomisation to arm 3 was complete and the subsequent 130 patients were randomised 1:1 to either arm 1 or 2, and received either IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every 4 weeks.

Treatment continued until disease progression, until unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 24 months. Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 72 weeks, then every 12 weeks up to 96 weeks and then every 24 weeks thereafter.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the IMFINZI and placebo arms were as follows: male (69.1%), age ≥ 65 years (39.2%), White (50.4%), Black or African-American (0.8%), Asian (47.5%), other (1.3%), Hispanic or Latino (4.2%), current smoker (22.3%), past-smoker (68.5%), never smoker (9.2%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (48.7%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (51.3%), Stage I (3.6%), Stage II (9.1%), Stage III (87.4%).

Prior to randomisation, all patients received platinum-based chemotherapy (66.2% cisplatin-etoposide, 33.8% carboplatin-etoposide); 72.1% of patients received RT QD (of which 92.4% received ≥ 60-≤ 66 Gy QD); 27.9% received RT BID (of which 96.6% received 45 Gy BID) and 53.8% of patients received PCI. Response to CRT was as follows: complete response (12.3%), partial response (73.8%), stable disease (14.0%).

The dual primary endpoints of the study were OS and PFS of IMFINZI vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR of IMFINZI vs. placebo. PFS and ORR were assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1.

At a planned interim analysis, the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for IMFINZI compared with placebo. See Table 8 and Figures 11 and 12.

## SCLC - CASPIAN Study

CASPIAN was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI with or without tremelimumab in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin. CASPIAN was a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in 805 treatment naïve ES-SCLC patients with WHO/ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1, body weight &gt; 30 kg, suitable to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as first-line treatment for SCLC, with life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks, at least one target lesion by RECIST 1.1 and adequate organ and bone marrow function. Patients with asymptomatic or treated brain metastases were eligible. The study excluded patients with a history of chest radiation therapy; a history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders including paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS); active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of systemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of IMFINZI.

Randomisation was stratified by the planned platinum-based (carboplatin or cisplatin) therapy in cycle 1.

Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:

- Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin.
- Arm 2: IMFINZI 1 500 mg + etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin.
- Arm 3: Either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/ml/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 and etoposide (80-100 mg/m 2 ) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for between 4 - 6 cycles.

For patients randomised to Arm 1 and 2, etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin was limited to 4 cycles on an every 3-week schedule subsequent to randomisation. IMFINZI monotherapy continued every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of IMFINZI

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator.

Patients randomised to Arm 3 were permitted to receive a total of up to 6 cycles of etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin. After completion of etoposide + platinum, PCI was permitted only in Arm 3 per investigator discretion.

Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.

The primary endpoints of the study were OS of IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) and IMFINZI + tremelimumab + etoposide + platinum (Arm 1) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3). The key secondary endpoint was PFS. Other secondary endpoints were ORR, OS and PFS landmarks and PRO. PFS and ORR were assessed using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms (268 patients in Arm 2 and 269 patients in Arm 3). Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (69.6%), age ≥ 65 years (39.6%), median age 63 years (range: 28 to 82 years), white (83.8%), Asian (14.5%), Black or African American (0.9%), other (0.6 %), non-Hispanic or Latino (96.1%), current or past-smoker (93.1%), never smoker (6.9%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (35.2%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (64.8%), Stage IV 90.3%, 24.6% of the patients received cisplatin and 74.1% of the patients received carboplatin. In Arm 3, 56.8% of the patients received 6 cycles of etoposide + platinum and 7.8% of the patients received PCI.

At a planned interim (primary) analysis the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS with IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum alone (Arm 3) [HR=0.73 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.909), p=0.0047]. Although not formally tested for significance, IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum demonstrated an improvement in PFS vs. etoposide + platinum alone [HR=0.78 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.936)].

The PFS, ORR and DoR results from the planned final analysis (DCO: 27 Jan 2020) are summarized in Table 9. Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is presented in Figure 14.

The OS results with the planned long-term OS follow-up analysis (DCO: 22 March 2021) (median follow-up: 39.3 months) are presented in Table 9. IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum (Arm 2) vs. etoposide + platinum (Arm 3) continued to demonstrate sustained improvement in OS. Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is presented in Figure 13.

## Subgroup analysis

The improvements in OS in favour of patients receiving IMFINZI + etoposide + platinum compared to those receiving etoposide + platinum alone, were consistently observed across the prespecified subgroups based on demographics, geographical region, carboplatin or cisplatin use and disease characteristics.

## BTC - TOPAZ-1 Study

TOPAZ-1 was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. TOPAZ-1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 685 patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC (including intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma) and ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had not received previous therapy in the advanced/unresectable setting. Patients who developed recurrent disease &gt; 6 months after surgery and/or completion of adjuvant therapy were included. Patients must have had an adequate organ and bone marrow function, and have had acceptable serum bilirubin levels (≤ 2.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)), and any clinically significant biliary obstruction had to be resolved before randomisation.

The study excluded patients with ampullary carcinoma, with brain metastases, active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, HIV infection or active infections, including tuberculosis or hepatitis C or patients with current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of IMFINZI. Patients with active HBV were allowed to participate if they were on antiviral therapy.

Randomisation was stratified by disease status (initially unresectable vs. recurrent) and primary tumour location (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs. extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs. gallbladder carcinoma).

Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Arm 1: IMFINZI 1 500 mg administered on Day 1 + gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m 2  and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2  (each administered on Days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks (21 days) for up to 8 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or
- Arm 2: Placebo administered on Day 1 + gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m 2  and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 (each administered on Days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks (21 days) for up to 8 cycles, followed by placebo every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumour assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks after the date of randomisation, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression.

The primary endpoint of the study was OS, the key secondary endpoint was PFS. Other secondary endpoints were ORR, DoR and PRO. PFS, ORR and DoR were investigator-assessed according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms (341 patients in Arm 1 and 344 patients in Arm 2). Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (50.4%), age &lt; 65 years (53.3%), white (37.2%), Asian (56.4%), Black or African American (2.0%), other (4.2%), non-Hispanic or Latino (93.1%), ECOG PS 0 (49.1%), vs. PS 1 (50.9%), primary tumour location (intrahepatic bile duct 55.9%, extrahepatic bile duct 19.1% and gallbladder 25.0%), disease status [recurrent (19.1%) vs. unresectable (80.7%), metastatic (86.0%) vs. locally advanced (13.9%)]. PD-L1 expression was evaluated on tumour and immune cells using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay and the TAP (tumour area positivity) algorithm, 58.7% patients had TAP ≥ 1% and 30.1% TAP &lt; 1%.

OS and PFS were formally tested at a pre-planned interim analysis (data cut-off 11 Aug 2021) after a median follow-up of 9.8 months. Efficacy results are shown in Table 10 and Figure 16. The maturity for OS was 62% and the maturity for PFS was 84%. IMFINZI + chemotherapy (Arm 1) showed statistically significant improvement vs. placebo + chemotherapy (Arm 2) in OS and in PFS.

## HCC - HIMALAYA Study

The efficacy of IMFINZI as monotherapy and given in combination with a single dose of tremelimumab 300 mg was evaluated in the HIMALAYA Study, a randomised, open-label, multicentre study in patients with confirmed uHCC who did not receive prior systemic treatment for HCC. The study included patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or B (not eligible for locoregional therapy) and Child-Pugh Score Class A.

The study excluded patients with brain metastases or a history of brain metastases, co-infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C; active or prior documented gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 12 months; ascites requiring non-pharmacologic intervention within 6 months; hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.

Patients with oesophageal varices were included except those with active or prior documented GI bleeding within 12 months prior to study entry.

Randomisation was stratified by macrovascular invasion (MVI) (yes vs. no), aetiology of liver disease (confirmed hepatitis B virus vs. confirmed hepatitis C virus vs. others) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). The HIMALAYA study randomised 1 171 patients 1:1:1 to receive:

- IMFINZI: durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks.
- Tremelimumab 300 mg as a single dose + IMFINZI 1 500 mg; followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks.
- Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily.

Tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival assessments were conducted every month for the first 3 months following treatment discontinuation and then every 2 months.

The primary endpoint was OS superiority for the comparison of IMFINZI given in combination with a single dose of tremelimumab vs. Sorafenib. The key secondary objectives were OS non-inferiority followed by superiority for the comparison of IMFINZI vs. Sorafenib. Other secondary endpoints included PFS, Investigator-assessed ORR and DoR according to RECIST v1.1.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced among study arms. The baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (83.7%), age &lt; 65 years (50.4%) White (44.6%), Asian (50.7%), Black or African American (1.7%), Other race (2.3%), ECOG PS 0 (62.6%); Child-Pugh Class score A (99.5%), macrovascular invasion (25.2%), extrahepatic spread (53.4%), baseline AFP &lt; 400 ng/ml (63.7%), baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml (34.5%), viral aetiology; hepatitis B (30.6%), hepatitis C (27.2%), uninfected (42.2%), evaluable PD-L1 data (86.3%), PD-L1 Tumour area positivity (TAP) ≥ 1% (38.9%), PD-L1 TAP &lt; 1% (48.3%) [Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay].

## Endometrial Cancer - DUO-E Study

DUO-E was a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with IMFINZI, followed by IMFINZI with or without olaparib in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Patients had to have endometrial cancer in one of the following categories: newly diagnosed Stage III disease (measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 following surgery or diagnostic biopsy), newly diagnosed Stage IV disease (with or without disease following surgery or diagnostic biopsy), or recurrence of disease (measurable or non-measurable disease per RECIST v1.1) where the potential for cure by surgery alone or in combination is poor. For patients with recurrent disease, prior chemotherapy was allowed only if it was administered in the adjuvant setting and there was at least 12 months from the date of last dose of chemotherapy administered to the date of subsequent relapse. The study included patients with epithelial endometrial carcinomas of all histologies, including carcinosarcomas. Patients with endometrial sarcoma were excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Randomisation was stratified by tumour tissue's mismatch repair (MMR) status (proficient versus deficient), disease status (recurrent versus newly diagnosed), and geographic region (Asia versus rest of the world). Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following arms:

- Arm 1 (Platinum-based chemotherapy): Platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles with durvalumab placebo every 3 weeks. Following completion of chemotherapy treatment, patients without objective disease progression received durvalumab placebo every 4 weeks and olaparib placebo tablets twice daily as maintenance treatment until disease progression.
- Arm 2 (Platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI): Platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles with 1 120 mg durvalumab every 3 weeks. Following completion of chemotherapy treatment, patients without objective disease progression received 1 500 mg durvalumab every 4 weeks with olaparib placebo tablets twice daily as maintenance treatment until disease progression.
- Arm 3 (Platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI + olaparib): Platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles with 1 120 mg durvalumab every 3 weeks. Following completion of chemotherapy treatment, patients without objective disease progression received 1 500 mg durvalumab every 4 weeks with 300 mg olaparib tablets twice daily as maintenance treatment until disease progression.

Patients who discontinued either product (IMFINZI/placebo or olaparib/placebo) for reasons other than disease progression could continue treatment with the other product if appropriate based on toxicity considerations and investigator discretion.

Treatment was continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 18 weeks relative to randomisation and every 12 weeks thereafter.

The primary endpoint was PFS, determined by investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1. Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, ORR and DoR.

The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT population, for patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI + olaparib compared to platinum-based chemotherapy [HR=0.55 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.69), p=&lt;0.0001], and for patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI compared to platinum-based chemotherapy [HR=0.71 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.89), p=0.003]. At the time of PFS analysis, interim OS data were 28% mature with events in 199 of 718 patients.

Mismatch repair (MMR) status was determined centrally using an MMR immunohistochemistry panel assay. Of a total of 718 patients randomised in the study, 575 (80%) patients had MMR-proficient (pMMR) tumour status and 143 (20%) patients had MMR-deficient (dMMR) tumour status.

## Patients with MMR-deficient (dMMR) endometrial cancer

Among patients with dMMR tumour status, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the treatment arms. Baseline demographics across all three arms were as follows: median age of 62 years (range: 34 to 85), 41% age 65 or older, 1.5% age 75 or older, 62% White, 29% Asian, and 2% Black or African American. Disease characteristics were as follows: ECOG PS of 0 (58%) or 1 (42%), 46% newly diagnosed and 54% recurrent disease. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid (83%), mixed epithelial (5%), serous (3%), carcinosarcoma (3%), undifferentiated (2%), and other (3%).

In patients with dMMR tumour status, the results are summarised in Table 12 and Figure 19. The median follow-up time for PFS in censored patients with dMMR tumour status was 15.5 months in the platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI arm and 10.2 months in the platinum-based chemotherapy arm. At the time of PFS analysis, interim OS data were 26% mature with events in 25 of 95 patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI and platinum-based chemotherapy.

## Patients with MMR-proficient (pMMR) endometrial cancer

Among patients with pMMR tumour status, demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the treatment arms. Baseline demographics across all three arms were as follows: median age of 64 years (range: 22 to 86), 48% age 65 or older, 8.1% age 75 or older, 56% White, 30% Asian, and 6% Black or African American. Disease characteristics were as follows: ECOG PS of 0 (69%) or 1 (31%), 47% newly diagnosed and 53% recurrent disease. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid (54%), serous (26%), carcinosarcoma (8%), mixed epithelial (4%), clear cell (3%), undifferentiated (2%), mucinous (&lt; 1%), and other (3%).

Results in patients with pMMR tumour status are summarised in Table 13 and Figure 20. The median follow-up time in censored patients with pMMR tumour status was 15.2 months in the platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI + olaparib arm, and 12.8 months in the platinum-based chemotherapy arm.

At the time of PFS analysis, interim OS data were 29% mature with events in 110 of 383 patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI + olaparib and platinum-based chemotherapy.

Among patients with pMMR tumour status, the PFS HRs were 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.61) in patients with PD-L1 expression positive status (236/383; 62%) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.28) in patients with PD-L1 expression negative status (140/383; 37%), for the platinum-based chemotherapy + IMFINZI + olaparib arm compared to the platinum-based chemotherapy arm. PD-L1 expression positive was defined as tumour area positive (TAP) ≥ 1%.

## Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) - NIAGARA Study

NIAGARA was a randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase III study designed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin followed by adjuvant IMFINZI monotherapy in patients with MIBC. The study randomised 1 063 patients who were candidates for radical cystectomy and had not received prior systemic chemotherapy or immunemediated therapy for the treatment of MIBC with clinical tumour stage T2-T4aN0/1M0. The study excluded patients with pure non-urothelial histology, any small cell histology and primary non-bladder (i.e, ureter, urethral, or renal pelvis) cancer of the urothelium, active or prior documented autoimmune disease, active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection, or use of immuno-suppressive medication within 14 days of the first dose of durvalumab except systemic corticosteroids when used at physiological doses or as premedication.

Randomisation was stratified by clinical tumour stage T2N0 vs. &gt; T2N0 (including T2N1, T3, and T4a), renal function (adequate renal function: creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min vs. borderline renal function: CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min to &lt; 60 mL/min), and PD-L1 expression (high vs. low/negative) status. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive perioperative IMFINZI with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Arm 1) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (Arm 2):

- Arm 1 (IMFINZI + chemotherapy): IMFINZI 1 500 mg + gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m 2  and cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles prior to surgery, followed by IMFINZI 1 500 mg every 4 weeks for up to 8 cycles after surgery, or
- Arm 2 (Chemotherapy): Gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m 2  and cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles prior to surgery, without post-surgery treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with borderline renal function received split dose cisplatin of 35 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 of each cycle.

A RECIST 1.1 tumour assessment was performed at baseline and upon completion of neoadjuvant therapy (prior to surgery). After surgery, RECIST 1.1 tumour assessments were performed every 12 weeks for the first 24 months, then every 24 weeks for 36 months, and then every 52 weeks thereafter until progression, the end of study, or death.

The primary endpoints were pathological complete response (pCR) by blinded central pathology review and event-free survival (EFS) which included blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment. Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary endpoint.

The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally well-balanced between the 533 patients in Arm 1 and 530 patients in Arm 2. Baseline demographics were as follows: male (81.8%), age &lt;65 years (46.9%), white (67%), Asian (27.9%), black or African American (0.9%), other (0.8%), Hispanic or Latino (8.0%), and ECOG PS 0 (78%) vs. PS 1 (22%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Tumour Stage T2N0 (40.3%) and &gt; T2N0a (59.7%), regional lymph nodes N0 (94.5%) and N1 (5.5%), adequate renal function (81.1%) and borderline renal function (18.9%), and PD-L1 expression status high (73.1%) and low/negative (26.9%). The histologic subtypes included urothelial carcinoma (84.5%), urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation (8.2%), urothelial carcinoma with variant histology (5.0%), and urothelial carcinoma with glandular differentiation (2.4%).

In the overall population, 469 (88.0%) patients in Arm 1 and 441 (83.2%) patients in Arm 2 underwent radical cystectomy.

Results are presented in Table 14, Figure 21 and Figure 22.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been established. Study D419EC00001 was a multi-centre, open-label dose finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab followed by IMFINZI monotherapy, in paediatric patients with advanced malignant solid tumours (except primary central nervous system tumours) who had disease progression and for whom no standard of care treatment exists. The study enrolled 50 paediatric patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years with primary tumour categories: neuroblastoma, solid tumour and sarcoma. Patients received either IMFINZI 20 mg/kg in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg or IMFINZI 30 mg/kg in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI as monotherapy every 4 weeks. In the dose finding phase, IMFINZI and tremelimumab combination therapy was preceded by a single cycle of IMFINZI monotherapy; 8 patients in this phase however discontinued treatment prior to receiving tremelimumab. Thus, of the 50 patients enrolled in the study, 42 received IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab and 8 received IMFINZI only. In the dose-expansion phase, an ORR of 5.0% (1/20 patients) was reported in the evaluable for response analysis set. No new safety signals were observed relative to the known safety profiles of IMFINZI and tremelimumab in adults. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of durvalumab was assessed for IMFINZI as a single agent, in combination with chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by IMFINZI in combination with olaparib.

The PK of durvalumab was studied in 2903 patients with solid tumours with doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered intravenously once every two, three or four weeks as monotherapy. PK exposure increased more than dose-proportionally (non-linear PK) at doses &lt; 3 mg/kg, and dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included 1878 patients who received durvalumab monotherapy in the dose range of  ≥ 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was 5.64 L. Durvalumab clearance (CL) decreased over time resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 ml/h at Day 365; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on baseline CL, was approximately 18 days. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the PK of durvalumab as a single agent, in combination with chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, in combination with tremelimumab and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by IMFINZI in combination with olaparib. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.

## Special populations

Age (19-96 years), body weight (31-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1, tumour type, race or ECOG status had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.

## Renal impairment

Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to influence durvalumab exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN or bilirubin &gt; 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence durvalumab exposure.

## Paediatric population

The PK of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab was evaluated in a study of 50 paediatric patients with an age range from 1 to 17 years in study D419EC00001. Patients received either durvalumab 20 mg/kg in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg or durvalumab 30 mg/kg in combination with tremelimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab as monotherapy every 4 weeks. Based on population PK analysis, durvalumab systemic exposure in paediatric patients ≥ 35kg receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks was similar to exposure in adults receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, whereas in paediatric patients (≥ 35kg) receiving durvalumab 30mg/kg every 4 weeks, exposure was approximately 1.5-fold higher compared to exposure in adults receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks. In paediatric patients &lt; 35kg receiving durvalumab 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks, the systemic exposure was similar to exposure in adults receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab has not been evaluated.

## Reproductive toxicology

As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus, and in mouse allogeneic pregnancy models disruption of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery, at exposure levels approximately 18-times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC), was associated with placental transfer but not with maternal toxicity or effects on embryofoetal development, pregnancy outcome or postnatal development. Negligible levels of durvalumab was found in milk of cynomolgous monkey on Day 28 after birth.

## 1. What IMFINZI is and what it is used for

IMFINZI contains the active substance durvalumab which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. IMFINZI works by helping your immune system fight your cancer.

IMFINZI is used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. It is used alone when your NSCLC:

- has spread within your lung and cannot be removed by surgery, and
- has responded or stabilised after initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It is used in combination with tremelimumab and chemotherapy when your NSCLC:
- has spread within both your lungs (and/or to other parts of the body), cannot be removed by surgery and
- has shown no changes (mutations) in genes called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) or ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase).

It is used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy prior to surgery (neoadjuvant treatment) and alone after surgery (adjuvant treatment) when your NSCLC:

- has spread within your lung and is able to be removed by surgery.

IMFINZI is used to treat a type of lung cancer called limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) in adults. It is used when your SCLC:

- has not been removed by surgery, and
- has responded or stabilised after initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is used to treat a type of lung cancer called extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in adults. It is used when your SCLC:

- has spread within your lungs (or to other parts of the body) and
- has not previously been treated.

IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is used in adults to treat a type of cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) and gallbladder that are collectively referred to as biliary tract cancers (BTC). It is used when your BTC:

- has spread within your bile ducts and gallbladder (or to other parts of the body).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IMFINZI is used alone or in combination with tremelimumab to treat a type of liver cancer called advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults. It is used when your HCC:

- cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), and
- may have spread within your liver or to other parts of the body.

IMFINZI is used to treat a type of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) that has spread beyond the original tumour or come back (recurred) in adults. It is used in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by:

- IMFINZI alone when your tumour is MMR-deficient, or
- IMFINZI in combination with olaparib when your tumour is MMR-proficient.

A test is used to find out the MMR status of your endometrial cancer.

IMFINZI is used to treat a type of bladder cancer called muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) which is when your bladder cancer has spread into the muscle layer of the bladder but not to other parts of the body. It is used in combination with chemotherapy (neoadjuvant treatment) prior to the surgical removal of your bladder followed by IMFINZI alone after surgery (adjuvant treatment).

If you have any questions about how IMFINZI works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

When IMFINZI is given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines, it is important that you also read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given IMFINZI

## You should not be given IMFINZI

- if you are allergic to durvalumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 'Contents of the pack and other information'). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor before you are given IMFINZI if:

- you have an autoimmune disease (an illness where the body's immune system attacks its own cells);
- you have had an organ transplant;
- you have lung problems or breathing problems;
- you have liver problems.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before you are given IMFINZI.

When you are given IMFINZI, you can have some serious side effects.

If you have any of the following, call or see your doctor straight away. Your doctor may give you other medicines that prevent more severe complications and to help reduce your symptoms. Your doctor may delay the next dose of IMFINZI or stop your treatment with IMFINZI, if you have:

- inflammation of the lungs : symptoms may include new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or chest pain;
- inflammation of the liver : symptoms may include nausea or vomiting, feeling less hungry, pain on the right side of your stomach, yellowing of skin or whites of eyes, drowsiness, dark urine or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- inflammation of the intestines : symptoms may include diarrhoea or more bowel movements than usual, or stools that are black, tarry or sticky with blood or mucus, severe stomach pain or tenderness, hole in the bowel;
- inflammation of glands (especially the thyroid, adrenal, pituitary and pancreas): symptoms may include fast heart rate, extreme tiredness, weight gain or weight loss, dizziness or fainting, hair loss, feeling cold, constipation, headaches that will not go away or unusual headaches, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting;
- type 1 diabetes : symptoms may include high blood sugar, feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, passing urine more often than usual, fast and deep breathing, confusion, or a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat;
- inflammation of the kidneys : symptoms may include decrease in the amount of urine you pass;
- inflammation of the skin : symptoms may include rash, itching, skin blistering or ulcers in the mouth or on other moist surfaces;
- inflammation of the heart muscle : symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, or irregular heartbeat;
- inflammation or problems of the muscles : symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness or weakness or rapid fatigue of the muscles;
- inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis): symptoms may include pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs; bladder or bowel problems including needing to urinate more frequently, urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating and constipation;
- infusion-related reactions : symptoms may include chills or shaking, itching or rash, flushing, shortness of breath or wheezing, dizziness or fever;
- inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the membrane around the spinal cord and brain (meningitis): symptoms may include seizures, neck stiffness, headache, fever, chills, vomiting, eye sensitivity to light, confusion and sleepiness;
- inflammation of the nerves: symptoms may include pain, weakness, and paralysis in the extremities (Guillain-Barré syndrome);
- inflammation of the joints : signs and symptoms include joint pain, swelling, and/or stiffness (immune-mediated arthritis);
- inflammation of the eye : signs and symptoms include eye redness, eye pain, light sensitivity, and/or changes in vision (uveitis);
- low number of blood platelets: symptoms may include bleeding (nose or gum bleeding) and/or bruising.
- low number of red blood cell counts on testing : symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, pale skin and/or fast heartbeat. When IMFINZI is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine (olaparib), low red blood cell counts could be a sign of 'pure red cell aplasia' (PRCA), a condition in which no red blood cells are produced, or 'auto-immune haemolytic anaemia' (AIHA), an excessive breakdown of red blood cells.

If you have any of the symptoms listed above, call or see your doctor straight away.

IMFINZI acts on your immune system. It may cause inflammation in parts of your body. Your risk of these side effects may be higher if you already have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells). You may also experience frequent flares of your autoimmune disease, which in the majority of cases are mild.

## Children and adolescents

IMFINZI should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age as it has not been studied in these patients.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

## Preparation and administration of the infusion

- Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, discoloured or visible particles are observed.
- Do not shake the vial.
- Withdraw the required volume of concentrate from the vial(s) and transfer into an intravenous bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection, to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 to 15 mg/ml. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.
- The medicinal product, once diluted, should be used immediately. The diluted solution must not be frozen. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 30 days at 2 ºC to 8 ºC and for up to 24 hours at room temperature (up to 25 ºC) from the time of preparation.
- From a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 ºC to 8 ºC or 12 hours at room temperature (up to 25 ºC), unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
- If refrigerated, intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. Administer the infusion solution intravenously over 1 hour using a sterile, low-protein binding 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter.
- Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.
- IMFINZI is single-dose. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
