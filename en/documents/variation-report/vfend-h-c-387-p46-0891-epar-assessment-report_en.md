## 1. Updated Assessment

The current updated report concerns the assessment of the responses as submitted by the applicant. The  first  round's  Rapporteur's  AR  was  circulated  and  concluded  to  in  the  December  CHMP.  The assessment of the RSI can be found at the end of the current AR under section 6.

## 2. Introduction

The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  investigating  the  safety, tolerability, and efficacy of voriconazole in paediatric patients from 2 to &lt;18 years of age. The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## About the product

Voriconazole (Vfend ® ) is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent. Its mode of action is inhibition of fungal  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)-mediated  14α-sterol  demethylation,  an  essential  step  in  ergosterol biosynthesis.  Voriconazole  is  active  against  a  wide  range  of  yeasts  and  filamentous  fungi,  including Candida,  Aspergillus,  Fusarium,  and  Scedosporium  species.  The  efficacy  of  voriconazole  for  the treatment of both invasive aspergillosis and  invasive candidiasis in adult patients  has  been demonstrated in prospective, randomised, controlled studies. Marketing approval has been granted in over 90 countries, including the United States, European Union (EU), and Australia, and a wealth of experience with the product has been accumulated over the past 10 years.

## Approved indication(s) and posology

## Indication

Voriconazole,  is  a  broad-spectrum,  triazole  antifungal  agent  and  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children aged 2 years and above as follows:

- Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
- Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.
- Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).
- Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.

VFEND  should  be  administered  primarily  to  patients  with  progressive,  possibly  life-threatening infections.

- Prophylaxis  of  invasive  fungal  infections  in  high  risk  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.

## Posology

Electrolyte  disturbances  such  as  hypokalaemia,  hypomagnesaemia  and  hypocalcaemia  should  be monitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.4).

VFEND is also available as 200 mg film-coated tablets, 200 mg powder for solution for infusion, 200 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion and 40 mg/ml powder for oral suspension.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment

## Adults

Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral VFEND to achieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of the high oral bioavailability  (96%;  see  section  5.2),  switching  between  intravenous  and  oral  administration  is appropriate when clinically indicated.

Detailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table:

|                                        | Intravenous            | Oral                      | Oral                      |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                        |                        | Patients 40 kg and above* | Patients less than 40 kg* |
| Loading dose regimen (first 24 hours)  | 6 mg/kg every 12 hours | 400 mg every 12 hours     | 200 mg every 12 hours     |
| Maintenancedose (after first 24 hours) | 4 mg/kg twice daily    | 200 mg twice daily        | 100 mg twice daily        |

米 This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older

Treatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient's clinical and mycological response.  Long  term  exposure  to  voriconazole  greater  than  180  days  (6  months)  requires  careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## Dosage adjustment (Adults)

If  patient  response  to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice daily for oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg twice daily. If patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose, reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the 200 mg twice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose.

In case of use as prophylaxis, refer below.

Children (2 to &lt;12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and &lt;50 kg) Voriconazole  should  be  dosed  as  children  as  these  young  adolescents  may  metabolize  voriconazole more similarly to children than to adults

The recommended dosing regimen is as follows:

|                                        | Intravenous            | Oral                                                       |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| LoadingDoseRegimen (first 24 hours)    | 9 mg/kg every 12 hours | Notrecommended                                             |
| Maintenance Dose (after first 24hours) | 8 mg/kg twice daily    | 9 mg/kg twice daily (a maximum dose of 350 mg twice daily) |

Note: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 2immunocompromised paediatricpatients aged 2 to &lt;12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to &lt;17 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It  is  recommended  to  initiate  the  therapy  with  intravenous  regimen,  and  oral  regimen  should  be considered only after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.

These  oral  dose  recommendations  for  children  are  based  on  studies  in  which  voriconazole  was administered  as  the  powder  for  oral  suspension.  Bioequivalence  between  the  powder  for  oral suspension and tablets has not been investigated in a paediatric population. Considering the assumed limited gastroenteric transit time in paediatric patients, the absorption of tablets may be different in paediatric  compared  to  adult  patients.  It  is  therefore  recommended  to  use  the  oral  suspension formulation in children aged 2 to &lt;12.

All other adolescents (12 to 14 years and ≥50 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight) Voriconazole should be dosed as adults.

## Dosage adjustment (Children [2 to &lt;12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to 14 years and &lt;50 kg])

If patient response to treatment is inadequate, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps  if  the  maximum  oral  dose  of  350  mg  was  used  initially).  If  patient  is  unable  to  tolerate treatment, reduce the dose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially).

Use in paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

## Prophylaxis in Adults and Children

Prophylaxis  should  be  as  short  as  possible  depending  on  the  risk  for  developing  invasive  fungal infection (IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to 180 days  after  transplantation  in  case  of  continuing  immunosuppression  or  graft  versus  host  disease (GvHD) (see section 5.1).

## Dosage

The recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age groups. Please refer to the treatment tables above.

## Duration of prophylaxis

The safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied in clinical trials.

Use of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

The following instructions apply to both Treatment and Prophylaxis

## Dosage adjustment

For  prophylaxis  use,  dose  adjustments  are  not  recommended  in  the  case  of  lack  of  efficacy  or treatment-related adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and use of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8) Dosage adjustments in case of co-administration Phenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased from 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

The  combination  of  voriconazole  with  rifabutin  should,  if  possible  be  avoided.  However,  if  the combination is strictly needed, the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5.

Efavirenz  may  be  coadministered  with  voriconazole  if  the  maintenance  dose  of  voriconazole  is increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50%, i.e. to 300 mg once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Elderly patients

No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Patients with renal impairment

The  pharmacokinetics  of  orally  administered  voriconazole  are  not  affected  by  renal  impairment. Therefore,no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

Voriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4-hour haemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.

## Patients with hepatic impairment

It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving voriconazole (see section 5.2).

Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C).

There is limited data on the safety of VFEND in patients with abnormal liver function tests (aspartate transaminase  [AST],  alanine  transaminase  [ALT],  alkaline  phosphatase  [ALP],  or  total  bilirubin  &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal).

Voriconazole  has  been  associated  with  elevations  in  liver  function  tests  and  clinical  signs  of  liver damage,such as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit  outweighs  the  potential  risk.  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  must  be  carefully monitored for drug toxicity (see section 4.8).

## Paediatric population

The  safety  and  efficacy  of  VFEND  in  children  below  2  years  has  not  been  established.  Currently available  data  are  described  in  sections  4.8  and  5.1  but  no  recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be made.

## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that studies A1501080 and A1501085 are stand alone studies.

## 3.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

The  currently  approved  paediatric  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic modeling approach, and are predicted to provide voriconazole exposures comparable to those in adult patients receiving the approved dosing regimens. These 2 paediatric studies were conducted with these regimens to confirm whether these doses are appropriate for paediatric use.

In addition ,  Study  A1501085 also enrolled 10 paediatric patients with EC. A lower dosing regimen was evaluated, which matched the dosing regimen used in adult patients with EC (200 mg oral (PO) every 12 hours (q12h) without loading doses).

The  initial  dosing  regimens  used  in  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  are  summarised  by  age  and indication in Table 1.

At the investigator's discretion a patient could receive dose reduction or escalation based on through samples collected on the 3 rd day (or later) of IV/oral therapy in line with the approved SmPC.

a Voriconazole  dose  may  be  adjusted  (dose  reduction  or  escalation)  based  on  clinical  response,  adverse  events,  or  voriconazole trough concentrations.

b Voriconazole  IV  loading  doses  should  be  omitted  if  the  patient  has  already  received  the  loading  doses  prior  to  starting  study therapy.

c  No loading doses were evaluated EC patients.

d  It should be noted that 9 mg/kg PO q12h in children will provide much lower voriconazole exposure than 8 mg/kg IV q12h, while it will provide exposure comparable to 4 mg/kg IV q12h.

e   It  should be noted that 200 mg PO q12h in adolescents will provide much lower voriconazole exposure than 4 mg/kg IV q12h, while it will provide exposure comparable to 3 mg/kg IV q12h.

f  For IA treatment, at the investigator's discretion, a dose of 300 mg PO q12h could be used in adolescents.

## CHMP comments :

The dosages used with these paediatric studies are in line with the approved SmPC.

Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. No new clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085. However, analyses to explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints in the paediatric patients in these studies are ongoing. The report will be submitted when available (Target completion date: end September 2014).

The Rapporteur will await the submission of these data.

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

## 3.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted final reports for:

- Study A1501080 : A Prospective, Open-Label, Non-Randomised, Multicenter Study to Investigate the  Safety  and  Tolerability  of  Voriconazole  as  Primary  Therapy  for  Treatment  of  Invasive Aspergillosis  (IA)  and  Molds  Such  As Scedosporium or Fusarium Species  (IFI;  invasive  fungal infection) in Paediatric Patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study  A1501085 :  A  Prospective,  Open-Label,  Non-Comparative  Study  to  Assess  the  Safety, Tolerability  and  Efficacy  of  Voriconazole  for  the  Primary  and  Salvage  Treatment  of  Invasive Candidiasis, Candidemia (ICC), and Esophageal Candidiasis (EC) in Paediatric Patients.

## 3.3.2. Clinical studies

Safety  was  considered  primary  end  point  in  both  open-label  studies.  The  observed  efficacy  of  both studies will be briefly presented by the Rapporteur as efficacy parameters were considered secondary endpoints.

Data from Studies A1501080 and A1501085, have also been evaluated taking into consideration the events of interest (i.e. important identified and potential risks included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP  Version  2.0).  Refer  to  paragraph  ' Important  Identified  and  Potential  Risks '  for  the  critical assessment in the paragraph on safety discussion.

## Results

## Efficacy

## Study A1501080

This  was  a  prospective,  open  label,  non-comparative  descriptive  study  conducted  to  evaluate  the safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of  voriconazole  in  paediatric  patients  2  to  &lt;18  years  of  age  with invasive  fungal  infection  (IFI)  due  to Aspergillus,  Scedosporium or Fusarium species.  Thirty-one patients were included. Demographics are presented in Table 2 (in the safety section).

Patients who met European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria for proven or probable IA were analysed for efficacy. No patients with infection due to Scedosporium or Fusarium species were enrolled.

A  total  of  31  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  voriconazole  and  were  included  in  the  safety population  (11  patients  were  2  to  &lt;12  years  old  and  20  were  12  to  &lt;18  years  old).  Of  these,  14 patients had proven or probable IA (5 patients were 2 to &lt;12 years old and 9 were 12 to &lt;18 years old), and were included in the modified intent to treat (MITT) population.

The overall rate of global response 1  was 64.3% (95% CI: 35.1, 87.2) at the 6-week timepoint, which is similar to that in adult therapeutic studies in IA (53% [1] ). Success rates were numerically higher in the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group than in the younger age group (77.8% (95% CI: 40.0, 97.2) and 40.0% (95% CI: 5.3, 85.3), respectively. The rates of successful global response and the number of patients with a successful response remained the same at the EOT timepoint.

1 A successful global response was defined as either a complete (resolution of all clinical signs and symptoms PLUS resolution of 90 percent or more of the lesions visible on radiological studies and attributed to IA at Baseline) or partial  response  (clinical  improvement  PLUS  50 percent  to  &lt;90  percent  resolution  of  the  radiological  lesions attributed to IA at Baseline) response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP comments:

Efficacy  was  considered  secondary.  Limited  number  of  paediatric  patients  (n=31)  were  enrolled.  Of these patients 14/31 had confirmed or probably IA. No patients with infection due to Scedosporium or Fusarium species were enrolled. Response rate at the 6-weeks timepoint was similar to the observed response rate adult therapeutic studies. The rates of successful global response and the number of patients with a successful response remained the same at the EOT timepoint. Due to the nature of the study and limited number of patients no definite conclusion can be drawn.

## Study A1501085

This  was  an  open-label,  non-comparative,  descriptive  study  of  voriconazole  for  the  treatment  of paediatric patients 2 to &lt;18 years of age with ICC and EC. In this study, voriconazole could be initiated either as primary therapy for ICC or EC, or as salvage therapy for ICC or EC with an unsatisfactory response to at least 7 days of treatment with at least 1 other antifungal agent.

A  total  of  22  patients  received  at  least  1  dose  of  voriconazole  and  were  included  in  the  safety population (14 patients were 2 to &lt;12 years old and 8 were 12 to &lt;18 years old. A total of 17 patients were included in the MITT population (9 were 2 to &lt;12 years old and 8 were 12 to &lt;18 years old. Demographics are presented in Table 4 (in the safety section)

A  total  of  7  patients  entered  the  study  with  a  diagnosis  of  ICC  and  10  entered  the  study  with  a diagnosis of EC. A total of 5 patients entered the study with a diagnosis of primary ICC, and 8 had the diagnosis of primary EC. A total of 2 patients entered the study with a diagnosis of salvage ICC, and 2 had the diagnosis of salvage EC.

Most patients had baseline Candida albicans (12 patients; 2 had isolates from blood only and 10 from other sources 2 ) and Candida tropicalis (3 patients who had isolates from blood only). Only 2 patients had baseline Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis (1 patient each, both with isolates from blood only.

The overall rate of global response (ICC and EC combined) was 76.5% (95% CI: 50.10, 93.19) at EOT. The rate of response was 88.9% (95% CI: 51.75, 99.72) for 2 to &lt;12 year olds and 62.5% (24.49, 91.48) for 12 to &lt;18 year olds. These rates are comparable with data in therapeutic studies in ICC (65% [2] ) and EC (98% [3] ).

The global response for patients with EC included success in 7 (70.0%) patients, failure in 1 (10.0%) patient, and indeterminate in 2 (20.0%) patients. The global response for patients with ICC included success in 6 (85.7%) patients and indeterminate in 1 (14.3%) patient.

The global response rate at EOT was success for 4 (80.0%) patients with primary ICC therapy and 2 (100.0%)  patients  with  salvage  ICC  therapy.  The  global  response  rate  at  EOT  was  success  for  6 (75.0%) patients with primary EC therapy and 1 (50.0%) patients with salvage EC therapy.

Two (2) patients with a diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis and global response of success at the EOT later  had  recurrence of esophageal candidiasis (14 and 16 days after the last dose of voriconazole, respectively).  One  (1)  patient  with  a  diagnosis  of  esophageal  candidiasis  and  a  global  response  of

2 Other specimen type includes culture result from throat/oral mucosa, esophageal mucosa, and perianal site.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

success  at  the  EOT  (in  relation  to  esophageal  candidiasis)  developed  suspected  splenic  candidiasis during therapy.

CHMP comments: Efficacy was considered secondary endpoint. Limited number of paediatric patients (n=22) were included. The global response rates at EOT were comparable with data in therapeutic studies in ICC (65% [2] ) and EC (98% [3] ). The quoted references were submitted by the applicant and are publication of the initial studies.

Due to the nature of the paediatric study and limited number of patients no definite conclusion can be drawn.

In conclusion: Both studies A1501080 and A1501085 were open label with safety as primary endpoint. All Efficacy parameters were considered secondary endpoints. In addition the total number of include patients  n=22  and  n=23  respectively  are  limited.  Hence  no  firm  conclusion  on  the  efficacy  of voriconazole can be drawn.

## Safety results

## Study A1501080

Patients in the safety population received IV voriconazole for a median of 8.0 days the median length of IV voriconazole treatment was similar in the 2 age groups (8 days and 8.5 days in the 2 to &lt;12 years age-group and 12 to &lt;18 years age/group, respectively). No patient received more than 33 days of IV treatment. The median length of oral voriconazole treatment was also similar in both age groups in the safety population (55 days and 59.5 days in the 2 to &lt;12 years age-group and 12 to &lt;18 years age-group, respectively).

Cm=centimeter; kg=kilogram; SD=standard deviation.

The number of snbiects was the total number of treated subiects.

All-causality  treatment-emergent  AEs  (Table  3)  were  reported  in  30  (96.8%)  of  the  31  patients (281 events). Similar results were observed across the age groups [11(100%) in age groups 2 to &lt;12 and 19 (95%) in age group 12 to &lt;18].

A  total  of  15  (48.4%)  patients  had  an  SAE;  similar  rates  were  observed  across  the  age  groups  [6 (54.6%) in age group 2 to &lt;12 and 9 (45%) in age group 12 to &lt;18].

The SOCs including the majority of patients that experienced all-causality AEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders  (18 patients),  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue  Disorders  (16  patients),  Infections  and Infestations (16 patients), Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders (14 patients), and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (14 patients). No new adverse events of concern were identified  when  compared  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole  in  adults  in  the  therapeutic studies. In general, the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. The safety profile in the 2 age groups was also similar. Where differences in frequencies were observed, they were not assessed as clinically meaningful.

AE=adverse event; SAE=serious adverse event.

The number of subjects evaluable for AEs was the total number of treated subjects. Data up to 7 days after the last dose of study drug was included. Except for number of AEs, subjects were counted only once per treatment in each row. Serious AEs were according to the investigator's assessment. MedDRA (v16 O) rnding dirtionarv was annlied

All SAEs were considered as unrelated to administration of voriconazole by the investigators, except the  event  of  renal  failure  acute  in  one  Patient  and  the  event  of  drug  induced  liver  injury  (DILI)  in another Patient. While the contributory role of voriconazole in developing these 2 SAEs is possible, one Patient  was confounded by concomitant use of vancomycin and ganciclovir and another Patient  was confounded  by  concomitant  use  of  paracetamol  and  concomitant  parainfluenza  virus  infection.  This patient  had  also  experienced  muscular  weakness  at  the  same  time,which  was  considered  by  in  the investigator as steroid induced myopathy.

One (1) patient (3.2%) discontinued the study drug due to sepsis. A total of 4 (12.9%) patients either reduced the dose (3 patients) or temporarily discontinued voriconazole (1 patient) due to an AE; in 3 patients  (,  all  in  older  age  group)  the  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  treatment-related  liver  enzyme abnormalities and all resolved. In 1 patient the AEs were Thrombocytopenia, Gastrointestinal bleeding, and Acute renal insufficiency, all considered due to the patient's acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

## Deaths

Three (3) patients in the 2 to &lt;12 year age-group and 2 patients in the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group died during the study. None of the deaths were related to study treatment. 2 Patients in the 2 to &lt;12 year age-group died from septic shock, and one Patient died of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm. In the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group, one Patient died of septic shock and another Patient died of acute lymphocytic leukemia.

## Other findings

No  new  safety  information  was  identified  upon  evaluation  of  laboratory  abnormalities,  vital  signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examination findings.

## CHMP comments:

Thirty-one paediatric patients were included in this study. Median IV treatment was 8 days and oral treatment was 55 days in the 2- &lt;12 years group and 59.5 days in 12 - &lt;18 years group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  total  of  15/31  patients  had  SAE.  Rates  were  similar  between  age-groups.  All  the  SAE  were considered unrelated to voriconazole by the investigators. Two patients experiencing acute renal failure and DILI respectively could be related to voriconazole treatment. However both patients also received concomitant medication (i.e. vancomycin, paracetomol, valganciclovir) which confounds the cases.

Most  experienced  AEs  were  gastrointestinal  disorders;  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders; infections and infestations; respiratory, thoraric, and mediastinal disorders; and general disorders and administration site disorders. All hepatic-related adverse events occurred in patients in the 12 to &lt;18 age group and resolved.

Three patients in the 2 to &lt;12 year age-group and 2 patients in the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group died during the study. None of the deaths were related to study treatment.

In  conclusion,  no  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  and  the  safety  data  from  the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

## Study A1501085

Of the 22 patients who received study drug and are included in the safety population, 9 received IV voriconazole only and 13 received both IV and oral voriconazole. The demographics of the included paediatric patients are presented in Table 4. The median duration of treatment was 7 days (range 2 to 24 days) for IV voriconazole and 9 days (range 2 to 37 days) for oral voriconazole. No patient received more  than  24  days  of  IV  treatment  or  37  days  of  oral  treatment.  The  median  duration  of  oral voriconazole treatment was higher in the 2 to &lt;12 year age-group [15 days (range 3 to 37 days)] than the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group [5 days (range 2 to 8 days)]. The median duration of IV voriconazole treatment was similar in the 2 age groups [6.5 days (range 2 to 24) in the 2 to &lt;12 year age-group and 8 (range 5 to 17) in the 12 to &lt;18 year age-group].

All-causality treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 19 (86.4%) of the 22 patients (113 events). No clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  frequency  of  AEs  were  observed  across  the  age  groups  [13 (92.9%) in the 2 to &lt;12 age group and 6 (75.0%) in the 12 to &lt;18 age group].

The  SOCs  including  majority  of  patients  that  experienced  all-causality  AEs  were  Eye  Disorders (9 patients)  and  Blood  and  Lymphatic  Disorders  and  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  and  Investigations (7 patients  each).  No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  when  compared  to  the  known safety profile in the adult therapeutic studies. In general, the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole. The safety profile in the 2 age groups was also similar. Where differences in frequencies were observed, they were not assessed as clinically meaningful.

MedDRA (v16.0) coding dictionary applied.

Abbreviations:MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; n/N=number of subjects; v=version

A total of 3 patients had an SAE; the occurrence of treatment emergent SAEs in both age groups was similar n=2 in the 12 to &lt;18 age group and n=1 in the 2 to &lt;12 age group). Only 1 patient a 12-yearold White female, experienced treatment related SAE of Severe progression of splenic candidiasis.

A total of 4 patients 2 in each age group discontinued the study drug due to an AE; in 3 patients the AEs were treatment related: Hyperbilirubinaemia (10191002), Mild liver disorders, and Progression of splenic candidiasis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total  of  3  patients  all  in  the  2  to  &lt;12  age  group  reduced  the  dose  due  to  an  AE  (all  treatmentrelated);  in  2  patients  the  AEs  were  liver  enzyme  abnormalities;  both  resolved.  The  AE  involving patient  was  mentioned  above  and  discontinued  study  drug  after  which  liver  disorder  resolved.  No temporary discontinuation due to an AE was reported in this study.

## Deaths

There  were  no  patient  deaths  during  the  study  period.  One  patient  died  after  the  safety  reporting period  (i.e.,  after  the  1-month  follow-up  visit).  The  patient,  a  3-year  old  Asian  male,  died  due  to progression of underlying disease (anaplastic medulloblastoma), 490 days after the first dose of study drug (455 days after the last dose of study drug).

## Other findings

No  new  safety  information  was  identified  upon  evaluation  of  laboratory  abnormalities,  vital  signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examination findings.

## CHMP comments:

Twenty-two paediatric patients were included in this study. Median IV treatment was 7 days and oral treatment  was  9  days.  No  patient  received  more  than  24  days  of  IV  treatment  or  37  days  of  oral treatment.

A total of 3/22 patients had SAE. Rates were similar between age-groups. All the SAE were considered unrelated  to  voriconazole  by  the  investigators.  One  patient  experienced  treatment  related  SAE  of severe progression of splenic candidiasis.

Most  experienced  AEs  were  eye  disorders;  blood  and  lymphatic  disorders;  and  gastrointestinal disorders. Two hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to &lt;12 age group.

No  deaths  occurred  during  the  study.  One  patient  died  after  the  safety  reporting  period  due  to anaplastic medulloblastoma.

In  conclusion,  no  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  and  the  safety  data  from  the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

## Important Identified and Potential Risks

Data from Studies A1501080 and A1501085, have also been evaluated taking into consideration the events of interest (i.e. important identified and potential risks included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP Version 2.0): Phototoxicity, Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Hepatic toxicity, QTc prolongation, Visual Events, Peripheral neuropathy, Skin cancers (non-SCC) and Suicide related disorders), and were also  compared  to  data  from  adults  in  the  same  indication,  as  shown  in  Table  6.  All  combined therapeutic paediatric data (N=105 from Studies 150-303, 304, 305, 307, 309, 602, 603, 604, 608, A1501080 and A1501085) were also compared to adult data from therapeutic studies (N=1603 from Studies 150-303, 304, 305, 307, 309, 602, 603, 604, and 608) as shown in Table 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  AEs  related  to  phototoxicity,  SCC,  skin  cancer  (non-SCC),  or  suicide  related  disorders  were observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population in all combined therapeutic studies was reviewed (N=105, Table 6).

## QT prolongation

A  search  of  the  clinical  database  using  the  QT  prolongation  (Torsades  de  Pointes/QT  prolongation). Broad  and  narrow  SMQ  was  conducted  to  capture  all  potentially  relevant  events.  No  patients  were identified in Study A1501085. Two (2) patients (6.5%) were identified in Study A1501080 (1 patient Loss  of  consciousness;  1  patient  -  Cardiac  arrest).  QT  prolongation  was  not  reported  in  these  2 patients.  When  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  population  in  all  therapeutic  studies  were  combined (N=105), the frequency of patients experiencing AEs identified by the wide search criteria (4.8%) was similar to that observed in adults (4.5%) (Table 6).

## Visual events

The frequency of patients experiencing visual events in Study A1501085 (36.4%: 8/22) was slightly higher  than  that  in  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies  (33.0%),  whereas  in  Study A1501080  the frequency of the patients with these events was lower (29%: 9/31). The type, severity and outcome of visual events reported in the 2 studies were similar to those observed in the adult therapeutic studies; the majority of the events were mild or moderate and resolved and none resulted in discontinuation of voriconazole. Visual safety testing results did not show new safety concerns. No clinically meaningful differences in the visual related AEs between the studies and between the age groups in each study were  observed.  When  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  population  in  all  therapeutic  studies  were combined (N=105), the frequency of patients with visual events was slightly higher than that in adults, however not statistical significant (35.2% and 33.0% respectively; p=0.6689).

## Peripheral neuropathy

The frequency of patients with peripheral neuropathy related events in Study A1501085 (4.5%) was lower than that observed in the adults from therapeutic studies (8.0%). However, in Study A1501080, a  numerically  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  peripheral  neuropathy  related  events  was  observed compared to the adults from therapeutic studies (12.9% and 8.0% respectively). All events in Studies A1501080  and  A1501085  were  unrelated  to  treatment  with  voriconazole  except  1.  The  nature  and severity of peripheral neuropathy related AEs in paediatrics from the 2 studies were consistent with the known profile for voriconazole. All except 1 (Muscular weakness) were mild or moderate in severity. The  outcome  was  reported  as  resolved  for  all  events  except  1  (Moderate  paraesthesia  Study A1501080). ). No SAEs or events resulting in permanent discontinuation or dose reduction/interruption were  reported.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  2  studies  and  between  age  groups within each study were observed. The peripheral neuropathy- related events were:

- Study A1501080- Paraesthesia, Skin burning sensation, Muscular weakness, and Arthalgia.
- Study A1501085- Paraesthesia.

When safety data from the paediatric population in all therapeutic studies were combined (N=105), the frequency of patients with peripheral neuropathy related-events (7.6%) was similar to that observed in adults (8.0% [Table 6]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic related events

A numerically higher frequency of patients with hepatic- related adverse events was observed in both studies (29% in Study A1501080 and 36.4% in Study A1501085) compared to that reported in the adult  therapeutic  studies  (24.0%).  However,  the  nature  and  severity  of  hepatic-related  AEs  in  the 2 studies  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  voriconazole  as  observed  in  the  adult therapeutic studies. No fatal outcome was reported with any of the hepatic related AEs. No cases of liver failure were reported.

In Studies A1501080 and A1501085, the hepatic-related AEs were primarily liver enzyme abnormalities  (mild/moderate) 3 except  in  2  patients  in  Study  A1501080  (1  patientreporting  severe Drug  induced  liver  injury  and  1  patientreporting  mild  Jaundice  cholestatic)  and  3  patients  in  Study A1501085 (1 patientreporting severe Liver disorder, 1 patientwith mild Hepatosplenomegaly and gall bladder disorder, and 1 patientreporting Jaundice cholestatic) and moderate Hyperbilirubinaemia). The outcome  of  the  majority  of  AEs  (all  except  mild  Alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  increased  in  1 patientand mild Jaundice cholestatic in 1 patient) was reported as resolved.

In the 2 patients reporting severe DILI term Hy's law and severe Liver disorder, a contributory role of voriconazole  is  possible,  however,  the  cases  were  confounded  by  concomitant  medications  and underlying diseases.

In  Study  A1501080,  none  of  the  hepatic-related  AEs  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  from treatment.  In  3  patients,  the  dose  was  modified  or  interrupted  due  to  treatment-related  mild  or moderate liver enzyme abnormalities with resolved outcome.

In  Study  A1501085,  voriconazole  was  permanently  discontinued  due  to  severe  Liver  disorder  in  1 patientand moderate Hyperbilirubinaemia in 1 patient, both resolved after drug discontinuation. Both AEs were reported as treatment related by the investigator but were confounded by concomitant use of chemotherapy  and  pancreatic  cancer,  respectively.  Dose  reductions  were  reported  in  3  patients  [1 patient liver disorder with permanently discontinued voriconazole, 1 patient due to moderate Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT and Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased and 1 patient due to mild hepatic enzyme increased], all resolved. These AEs were reported as treatment related but were confounded by chemotherapy, veno-occlusive liver disorder (VOLD), and sepsis at baseline, respectively. No temporary dose discontinuations due to AEs were reported in this study.

All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to &lt;18 age group. Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to &lt;12 age group. Similar observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group.

When safety data from the paediatric population in all in therapeutic studies were combined (N=105), a similar observation of a higher frequency of patients with hepatic-related events, was observed in the paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population  versus  adults  (28.6%  and  24.0%  respectively [Table 6]) was mainly associated to an increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs in the Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).

3  Per the broad search strategy used, 2 AEs (hypoalbuminaemia and prothrombin time prolonged) were reported in two patients but in these two patients the involvement of liver was not confirmed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include this information in the paediatric population subsection.

The frequency of patients who experienced AEs in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC was similar in the combined paediatric population (7.62% compared to adults (8.05%. In addition, the type and severity of hepatic-related AEs in the paediatric population are similar to adults.

## CHMP comments:

The applicant evaluated the data from both studies (A1501080 and A1501085) taking the events of interest  (phototoxicity,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC),  hepatic  toxicity,  QTc  prolongation,  Visual Events, Peripheral neuropathy, skin cancers (non-SCC) and suicide related disorders) as identified in the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data.

No  AEs  related  to  phototoxicity,  SCC,  skin  cancer  (non-SCC),  or  suicide  related  disorders  were observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population in all combined therapeutic studies was reviewed (N=105).

The  observed  frequencies  of  QT  prolongation  and  peripheral  neuropathy  in  paediatric  patients  were similar  to  adults.  The  frequency  of  visual  events  observed  in  paediatric  patients  was  slightly  higher (non-significant) than the observed frequency in adults.

All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to &lt;18 age group. Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to &lt;12 age group. Similar observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher frequency in the combined paediatric population versus adults (28.6% and 24.0% respectively) was mainly  associated  to an  increased  incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs  in the Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).

The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include this information in the paediatric population  subsection.  This  is  agreed  upon  by  the  Rapporteur  a  type  II  variation  is  awaited.

## 3.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  (A1501080  and  A1501085).  Thirty-one  and  22 paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary endpoint.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  paediatric  study  and  limited  number  of  patients  no  definite conclusion on efficacy can be drawn .

Treatment dosage and duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend. The CHMP observed a probable discrepancy in the total number of paediatric patients stated in SmPC section 5.1 (n=54 aged 2 -15 years) whereas the overview states that n=52 patients were included. Applicant is requested to substantiate the discrepancy.

No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

Three patients died during study A1501080, their deaths were unrelated to the voriconazole treatment. After the safety reporting period of study A1501080 one patient expired due to underlying disease.

Additionally the applicant evaluated the data from both studies (A1501080 and A1501085) taking the events of interest (phototoxicity, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), hepatic toxicity, QTc prolongation, Visual  Events,  Peripheral  neuropathy,  skin  cancers  (non  SCC)  and  suicide  related  disorders)  as identified in the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data. No AEs related to phototoxicity, SCC, skin cancer (non-SCC), or suicide related disorders were observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population in  all  combined  therapeutic  studies  was  reviewed  (N=105).  The  observed  frequencies  of  QT prolongation and peripheral neuropathy in paediatric patients were similar to adults. The frequency of visual events observed in paediatric patients was slightly higher (non-significant)  than the observed frequency in adults.

All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to &lt;18 age group. Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to &lt;12 age group. Similar observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher frequency in the combined paediatric population versus adults (28.6% and 24.0% respectively) was mainly  associated  to an  increased  incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs  in the Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).  The applicant  proposes  to  update  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  include  this  information  in  the  paediatric population subsection. This is agreed upon by the CHMP a type II variation is awaited.

## 4. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  applicant  submitted  two  paediatric  studies  (A1501080  and  A1501085).  Thirty-one  and  22 paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary endpoint. Although the applicant presented some efficacy data no firm conclusions can be drawn due to  the  nature  of  the  studies  and  the  limited  number  of  included  patients.  Treatment  dosage  and duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend. The CHMP observed a probable discrepancy in the total number of paediatric patients stated in SmPC section 5.1 (n=54 aged 2 -15 years) whereas the  overview  states  that  n=52  patients  were  included.  Applicant  is  requested  to  substantiate  the discrepancy.

No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

The  numerical  higher  frequency  in  the  combined  paediatric  population versus adults  was  mainly associated to an increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs in the Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults. The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC to include this information in the paediatric population subsection. This is agreed upon by the CHMP a type II variation is awaited.

The benefit/risk balance of Vfend remains positive in the approved indications.

## Recommendation

## Fulfilled:

Type II variation to be requested from the MAH to amend the product information as follows:

1. The applicant is requested to submit a type II variation to update SmPC section 4.8 to include the observed increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities in paediatric patients.
2. Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. No new clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and A1501085. However, analyses to explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints in the paediatric patients in these studies are ongoing. The report will  be  submitted  when  available  (Target  completion  date:  end  September  2014).  The Rapporteur will await the submission of these data.

## Not fulfilled:

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarification requested as part of this procedure. (see section 4 'Additional clarifications requested').

## 5. Additional clarifications requested

3. The  applicant  is  requested  to  discuss  the  observed  discrepancy  regarding  the  numbers  in paediatric  patients  treated  in  the  therapeutic  studies  being  n=52  as  stated  in  the  overview.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Whereas the SmPC section 5.1 mentions n=61 paediatric patients of whom n=54 were aged 2 -15 years being treated in therapeutic studies.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

## Question 2

Limited voriconazole concentration data were obtained from Studies A1501080 and A1501085. No new clinical  pharmacology  information  is  currently  available  from  Studies  A1501080  and  A1501085. However, analyses to explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints in the paediatric patients in these studies are on-going. The report will be submitted when available (Target completion date: end September 2014). The CHMP awaits the submission of these data.

## Summary of the Applicant's Response

The  MAH  clarifies that the  PK-PD  report  (PMAR-EQDD-A150f-DP4-245:  Voriconazole,  Pediatric Population  PK-PD  Analysis  Report)  was  completed  in  September  2014  and  is  provided  with  this response.

The  currently  approved  paediatric  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic modeling  approach.    These  dosing  regimens  are  predicted  to  provide  voriconazole  exposures comparable  to  those  in  adult  patients.    These  2  paediatric  studies  were  conducted  with  the  same regimens  and  confirm  these  doses  are  appropriate  for  paediatric  use.    No  update  to  the  SmPC  is proposed as a result of this analysis.

The objectives of the population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analyses were:

- To describe the PK of voriconazole in the target pediatric patient population based on limited sparse PK samples, if data permit
- To  predict  individual  exposure  parameters  (eg,  area  under  the  curve  over  12-hour  dosing interval  [AUC0-12]  and  trough  concentration  [Cmin])  based  on  the  final  PK  parameter estimates, if data permit
- To explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure parameters (AUC0-12 and Cmin) and key efficacy endpoints (survival and global response), if data permit

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To explore the relationship between voriconazole exposure parameters (AUC0-12 and Cmin) and key safety endpoints (hepatic, visual, psychiatric, skin and subcutaneous tissue AEs), if data permit
- To identify and characterize patient factors which influence the variability in the PK and PD of voriconazole (eg, CYP2C19 genotyping status), if data permit
- To evaluate the model performance of voriconazole PK and PD models, if data permit
- To  explore  the  relationship  between  voriconazole  PK/PD  index  [eg,  AUC0-12/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] and efficacy endpoints in a subset of patients, if data permit

Data from two studies were included in the analysis, i.e. study A1501080 and study A1501085 (see table below).

In both studies, to facilitate potential dose adjustment, voriconazole trough samples were collected on the 3rd day (or later) of IV or oral therapy or after each dose adjustment. To enable rapid turnaround analysis,  the  voriconazole  samples  were  shipped  to  designated  non-GLP  (Good  Laboratory  Practice) reference laboratories  for  assay  or  analyzed  locally.  In  Study  A1501080,  the  key  efficacy  endpoints included all-cause mortality at 6 weeks and EOT and global response at 6 weeks and EOT. In Study A1501085, the key efficacy  endpoints  included  global  response  at  EOT  and  all-cause  mortality  at  4 weeks  (Day  28).  Four  types  of  AEs  (including  hepatic,  visual,  psychiatric  AEs,  as  well  as  skin  and subcutaneous tissue disorders) were the focus of this analysis. Each type of AE from these two studies was pooled and analyzed separately.

Previously,  a  two-compartment  PK  model  with  first-order  absorption  and  mixed  linear  and  timedependent nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination was developed based on voriconazole concentration  data  from  5  studies  (A1501007,  A1501037,  A1501081,  A1501088  and  A1501092), including immunocompromised children and adolescents as well as healthy adults (PMAR-00204). All clearance terms [maximum elimination rate (Vmax) at 1 hour after the start of dosing (Vmax,1), linear clearance (CL) and inter-compartmental clearance (Q)] were scaled allometrically, using weight to a power  of  0.75;  and  all  volume  terms  (volume  of  distribution  for  the  central  and  peripheral compartments, V2 and V3) were scaled allometrically. Only one parameter, maximum fraction of Vmax inhibition (Vmax,inh), in healthy adults was impacted by the CYP2C19 status, where HEMs and PMs were  predicted  to  have  full  inhibition  (Vmax,inh  =  100%,  Vmax  =  0)  of  the  nonlinear  pathway  at maintenance dosing. The final model used first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method on logtransformed  concentrations.  This  PK  model  was  subsequently  adopted  to  fit  the  voriconazole concentration data from a Phase 3 Study A8851009 (adult patients with IA comparing voriconazole and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anidulafungin combination therapy  with voriconazole monotherapy, PMAR-00284) and a Phase 2 PK Study A1501096 (immunocompromised Japanese pediatric subjects, PMAR-00320), respectively.

For  PK/PD,  Voriconazole  doses  could  vary  with  time  within  a  patient  since  dose  adjustment  was allowed per protocol. Therefore, for PK-PD analysis, individual voriconazole exposures were estimated using  individual  PK  parameters  from  the  final  PK  model  and  the  actual  doses  administered  to  each patient. For the efficacy analysis, average AUC0-12 and Cmin over the treatment period were used. The average AUC0-12 values were also used for the calculation of the PK/PD index (AUC/MIC) for the subset of patients with MIC data available. For the safety analysis, when patients had no hepatic or visual AEs reported, average AUC0-12 and Cmin over the treatment period were used. When patients experienced an AE, the AUC0-12 and Cmin from the onset day of this AE were used. When using the single-panel  analysis  approach,  for  patients  experiencing  multiple  AEs,  the  AUC0-12  and  Cmin associated with the first AE occurrence were used. All the efficacy and safety data were evaluated as binary data. For efficacy analysis, only graphical examination was performed given the small sample size and high success rate. Additionally, AUC/MIC was explored as a potential predictor for efficacy. The safety data were evaluated using a logistic regression model in NONMEM with the second order conditional  (Laplacian)  estimation  method.  Each  safety  endpoint  was  analyzed  separately  using voriconazole exposure parameters (AUC0-12 and Cmin) as potential predictors. Other covariates (eg, CYP2C19 genotyping status, gender and race) were also examined in each analysis.

This  previously  developed  PK  model  continued  to  be  adopted  to  fit  the  current  data  from  studies A1501080 and A1501085.

The  final  PK  dataset  contained  96  voriconazole  concentrations  from  48  patients.  Six  concentration records with missing collection time, levels below the limit of quantitation, or inconsistent concentration values were excluded from the PK analysis. The demographics of the patients included in the PK analysis are presented in Table S2.

There were 30 mITT patients with exposure and efficacy data pairs. Among them, 14 patients were diagnosed with proven or probable IA, 6 patients with ICC and 10 patients with EC. The MIC data for Aspergillus (ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 μg/ml) are available in 5 IA patients only, and the MIC data for Candida (0.03 μg/ml are available in 14 patients.

In  both  studies,  only  a  few  concentration  data  were  collected  from  the  absorption  phase  and  the concentration data were quite variable, which posed a challenge in the model fitting. The simplified model with first-order absorption and linear elimination was selected as the final PK model to describe the pediatric data. Compared to the previous PK model, the removal of the nonlinear clearance from the PK model did not show any degradation of model performance. Based on the parameter estimates and the diagnostic plots, two runs (Run 6 and Run 13) showed better performance than other runs (ie, lower  OFV,  improved  diagnostic  plots,  improved  precision  of  parameter  estimates,  and  successful convergence). These two runs represent two different model structures. Run 6 is a two-compartment

model with first-order absorption and mixed linear and time-dependent nonlinear elimination, which is similar to the previous PK model. Run 13 is a simplified model with less parameters for the elimination phase: a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination only. These two runs had similar results, and Run 13 had slightly better performance than Run 6. The simplified model (Run 13) was selected as the final PK model. No new covariates were identified in the current analysis. The comparison of the model parameter estimates is shown in the table below.

It indicated that the current sparse data did not support the time-dependent nonlinear clearance in the model  fitting.  Given  the  limited  concentration  data,  the  interindividual  random  effect  could  be estimated  for  linear  clearance  only  with  acceptable  shrinkage.  It  is  acknowledged  that  this  final  PK model was still not ideal since voriconazole concentrations with high values were underestimated (see figures below).

Key -- The horizontal line at the center of the box is the median; the box represents the inter-quartile distance; whiskers represent ≤1.5 times the inter-quartile range and outliers are represented by points outside of the whiskers. 500 replicates were simulated. Note that the simulated outliers represent 500 replicates of the observed outliers, which is reflected as many points above the whisker bar in the simulation anm.

Trough samples here were defined as those between ≥11 houus and ≤12.5 hours post-dose.

Twenty-tlhree (23) patients provided 30 trough samples at IV doses and observed median (range) Cm was 1.2 (0.11-17.4) μg/mL; 10 patients provided 10 trough samples at oral doses and observed median (range) C was 1.75 (0.25-11.9) μg/mL (source: artifact ID 8388154).

Nonetheless,  this  model  appeared  to  be  able  to  reasonably  describe  the  voriconazole  trough concentrations although the absorption phase was not estimated well. Overall, based on the totality of the  model  performance  metrics,  this  simplified  model  was  deemed  acceptable  to  provide  individual voriconazole  exposure  estimates  (AUC0-12  and  Cmin),  which  would  allow  subsequent  exploratory exposure-response analysis.

Based on individual PK parameters from the final PK model, voriconazole exposure parameters in these pediatric patients (N = 48) at recommended IV and oral dosing regimens for IA, ICC and EC infections were estimated, and are summarized by age and weight group in Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14, respectively.  At  the  matching  doses,  the  voriconazole  exposures  in  children  and  young  adolescents with low body weight were comparable to those in all other adolescents (heavier or older) given the large inter-individual variability. For instance, the geometric mean AUC0-12 at 8 mg/kg IV q12h (or 4 mg/kg IV q12h in heavier or older adolescents) were 49.63, 54.91, and 37.28 μg·h/mL, respectively, and there was a substantial overlap of AUC0-12 distributions across these 3 age-weight groups.

ePham location:/A150 UK109496 Voriconazole/A1501080&amp; A1501085/Pop PK Model/Exposure estimation/Run4 analysis step ID 529219 (artifact ID 8631436)

In  adult  patients  with  IA  from  Study  A8851009, the estimated voriconazole geometric mean (CV%) AUC0-12 and Cmin at 4 mg/kg IV q12h were 51.0 (43%) μg·h/ml and 3.10 (52%) μg/ml, respectively; those at 300 mg oral q12h were 32.9 (45%) μg·h/ml and 2.04 (54%) μg/ml, respectively; and those at 200 mg oral q12h were 22.0 (46%) μg·h/ml and 1.37 (54%) μg/ml, respectively (see table 17). Similarly, there was a concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole in approximately 30% of these adult IA patients. At matching IV doses, the average exposure values and exposure distributions in pediatric patients were comparable to those in adult IA patients. At matching oral doses, the average oral exposures in pediatric patients were higher than those in adult IA patients; however, there was a substantial overlap of exposure distributions between these two groups. Considering that treatment is being provided for potentially life-threatening infections, it is preferred to start with a relatively high dose  and  reduce  to  lower  doses  if  needed  to  ensure  sufficient  exposure  coverage.  Therefore,  the proposed dosing regimens as the initial recommendation for pediatric patients are deemed acceptable.

Although CYP2C19 genotyping status was not identified as being predictive of voriconazole PK in this analysis, a slight trend was observed that the average voriconazole exposure tended to be higher in HEM  group  (CYP2C19  heterozygous  extensive  metabolizers)  than  that  in  EM  group  (CYP2C19 homozygous extensive metabolizers).  Nonetheless,  there  was  a  substantial  overlap  of  the  exposure distributions across these groups due to large inter-individual variability.

Although race was not identified as being predictive of voriconazole PK in this analysis, a slight trend was observed that the average voriconazole exposure tended to be higher in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients. There was a substantial overlap of the exposure distributions between Asian and non-Asian groups due to large inter-individual variability.

Population PK-PD analysis:

## Efficacy

Since  there  were  very  few  failure  cases,  only  graphic  examination  was  performed.  For  the  failure, indeterminate or missing cases, the corresponding voriconazole exposures were above or close to the average values in patients who had success except for one EC patient. It indicated that failure was not due  to  low  exposure  to  voriconazole.  This  EC  patient  with  global  response  failure  had  the  lowest average voriconazole AUC0-12 and his corresponding Cmin was also in the lower end (although not the lowest),  who  was  neutropenic  at  baseline.  In  the  10  EC  patients,  there  were  7  global  success,  one failure and 2 indeterminate at EOT. Given only one failure case, no definitive conclusions can be drawn for the correlation between voriconazole exposure and global response in EC patients. All the 6 ICC patients had global success at EOT. In the 14 IA patients, 11 patients were alive, 2 were expired and one was lost to follow up at EOT. The 3 IA patients who were expired or lost to follow up had relatively high concentrations. Additionally, in the 14 IA patients, there were 9 global success, one failure, one indeterminate and 3 missing at EOT. This failure case had relatively high concentration. In addition, due to limited MIC data and failure cases, the correlation between the PK-PD index and the efficacy data could not be assessed adequately. The success rate was high for all indications, suggesting the dosing  regimens  evaluated  in  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085  are  appropriate  for  pediatric  use although the sample size was limited.

## Safety

Among  all  the  safety  endpoints  evaluated,  a  positive  association  with  voriconazole  exposure  was established for hepatic AEs only. It should be noted that this positive association was shown only when the  multiple-panel  data  were  analyzed.  When  the  single-panel  data  were  analyzed,  this  positive association diminished. It is noted that multiple-panel data analysis approach may have a slight overestimation on AE probability prediction since a patient with multiple AEs would be counted multiple times, which may introduce bias. Furthermore, for the all-cause hepatic AEs, the positive association was  only  related  with  voriconazole  AUC0-12  (voriconazole  Cmin  marginally  missed  the  inclusion criterion). Thus, the observed positive association between voriconazole exposure and the occurrence of  a  hepatic  AE  is  weak  which  is  further  evidenced  by  the  wide  95%  CI  around  the  population prediction of probability of hepatic AE occurrence (Figure 18 and Figure 19).

With the limited sample size, it is difficult to establish definitive exposure-response relationships for voriconazole  in  this  analysis  given  the  complex  clinical  situation  for  subjects  with  serious  fungal infections.  Thus,  management  of  voriconazole  treatment  (eg,  dose  adjustment)  remains  at  the discretion of the physician  taking into consideration  the  individual patient's clinical  response, tolerability profile and voriconazole concentration (if available).

## CHMP's assessment of the Applicant's Response

As  indicated,  limited  data  are  available  from  studies  A1501080  and  A1501085.  This  hampered  the development of a robust model. Despite the limitations of the model, with some underestimation of high  plasma  concentrations,  the  data  indicate  that  at  matching  doses,  voriconazole  exposures  in children  and  young  adolescents  with  low  body  weight  were  comparable  to  those  in  all  other adolescents  (heavier  or  older).  With  regard  to  adults,  there  is  an  indication  of  higher  exposure  in paediatrics, however, a large variability is observed, the data are limited and there is a large overlap in values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  already  concluded  based  upon  the  provided  results  of  both  studies,  no  new  adverse  events  of concern were identified from both studies and the safety data from the paediatric patients in this study are consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

With regard to efficacy, both studies A1501080 and A1501085 were open label with safety as primary endpoint. All efficacy parameters were considered secondary endpoints. In addition the total number of included patients is limited. Hence no firm conclusion on the efficacy of voriconazole can be drawn.

Taken together, the data is in line with the known safety profile in the paediatric population and no firm conclusion on efficacy can be drawn.

## Conclusion

Point resolved.

## Question 3

The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  observed  discrepancy  regarding  the  numbers  in  paediatric patients treated in the therapeutic studies being n=52 as stated in the overview. Whereas the SmPC section 5.1 mentions n=61 paediatric patients of whom n=54 were aged 2 -15 years being treated in therapeutic studies.

## CHMP's assessment of the Applicant's Response

The MAH clarifies that the 52 paediatric subjects quoted in the Clinical Overview from the recent Article 46  submission  represent  those  subjects  enrolled  in  the  original  therapeutic  studies    who  were  &lt;18 years old.  Section 5.1 of the current SmPC includes information that was approved at the time of the original  MAA  submission  in  2000,  and  refers  to  a  different  subset  of  paediatric  subjects.    The  MAH clarifies that the 54 subjects quoted in the current SmPC were from compassionate use studies as well as the therapeutic studies.  This together with the different age range presented in the current SmPC, explains the apparent discrepancy in numbers.

A Type II variation will be submitted to update Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC with regards to the safety  and  clinical  information  on  paediatric  patients  based  on  the  analysis  of  all  paediatric  data following completion of the 2 paediatric therapeutic studies (A1501080 and A1501085).

## Assessment of the Applicant's Response

The MAH's substantiation is clear and seems to be enough for the assessment of the awaited update of section 5.1.

## Conclusion

Point is solved.

## 7. OVERALL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE APPLICANT'S RESPONSES

The applicant submitted two paediatric studies (A1501080 and A1501085). Thirty-one and twenty-two paediatric  patients  were  included  respectively.  Both  studies  were  open-label  with  safety  as  primary endpoint. Although the applicant presented some efficacy data no firm conclusions can be drawn due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  the  nature  of  the  studies  and  the  limited  number  of  included  patients.  Treatment  dosage  and duration were in line with the approved SmPC of Vfend.

With regard to the developed population pharmacokinetic model, only limited data were available from studies A1501080 and A1501085. This hampered the development of a robust model. Although the limitations of the model, with some underestimation of high plasma concentrations, the data indicate that at the matching doses, the voriconazole exposures in children and young adolescents with low body weight were comparable to those in all other adolescents (heavier or older) given the large interindividual  variability.  With  regard  to  adults,  there  is  an  indication  of  higher  exposure  in  paediatrics, however, a large variability is observed, the data are limited and there is a large overlap in values.

No  new  adverse  events  of  concern  were  identified  from  both  studies  and  the  safety  data  from  the paediatric patients in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of voriconazole.

Three patients died during study A1501080, their deaths were unrelated to the voriconazole treatment. After the safety reporting period of study A1501080 one patient expired due to underlying disease.

Additionally the applicant evaluated the data from both studies (A1501080 and A1501085) taking the events of interest (phototoxicity, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), hepatic toxicity, QTc prolongation, Visual  Events,  Peripheral  neuropathy,  skin  cancers  (non  SCC)  and  suicide  related  disorders)  as identified in the RMP (V2.0) into account. Data was also compared to the adult data. No AEs related to phototoxicity, SCC, skin cancer (non-SCC), or suicide related disorders were observed in either study. Similarly, no AEs related to these risks were observed when safety data from the paediatric population in  all  combined  therapeutic  studies  was  reviewed  (N=105).  The  observed  frequencies  of  QT prolongation and peripheral neuropathy in paediatric patients were similar to adults. The frequency of visual events observed in paediatric patients was slightly higher (non-significant)  than the observed frequency in adults.

All hepatic-related adverse events in Study A1501080 occurred in patients in the 12 to &lt;18 age group. Whereas in Study A1501085 all but 2 hepatic-related AE occurred in the 2 to &lt;12 age group. Similar observation  was  made  for  clinically  significant  laboratory  abnormalities.  A  clinically  meaningful conclusion from this observation cannot be drawn due to limited sample size in each age group. When taking  into  account  all  safety  data  in  paediatric  patients  in  therapeutic  studies  (n=105)  a  similar observation  of  a  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic-related  events,  was  observed  in  the paediatric  population  when  compared  to  adults  in  the  therapeutic  studies.  The  numerical  higher frequency in the combined paediatric population versus adults (28.6% and 24.0% respectively) was mainly  associated  to an  increased  incidence of liver function test abnormalities (AEs  in the Investigation SOC) in paediatric patients compared to adults (21.90% and 16.09% respectively).

The applicant proposes to update Section 4.8 and section 5.1 of the SmPC to include this information in  the  paediatric  population  subsection.  This  is  agreed  upon  by  the  CHMP  and  a  type  II  variation  is awaited.

The benefit/risk balance of Vfend remains positive in the approved indications.

The MAH should submit within 2 months an update of Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include the information related to P46 89.1.
