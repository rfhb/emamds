## 1. Introduction

On October 15, 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Modigraf (CSR F506CL0403), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the follow up measure FUM008. Modigraf received a marketing authorisation from the European commission in May 2009 for the indication of prophylaxis and treatment of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients. In the opinion of the CHMP, the available pharmacokinetic data were considered limited in the paediatric population. This study therefore was performed to provide greater understanding of the pharmacokinetics in patients 12 years or younger undergoing liver, kidney or heart transplantation and forms an integral part of the follow up measures agreed to by the MAH.

The MAH does not suggest any updates of the Modigraf SmPC.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study (A multicentre, open-label, PK study of Modigraf (tacrolimus granules) in de novo paediatric allograft recipients) is a stand-alone study following the procedure for an art 46 paediatric study report.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation used in the study is the same as the formulation currently marketed in the EU. The Marketing Authorisation of Modigraf in the EU already includes a full paediatric indication.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study F506CL-0403:  A multicentre, open-label, PK study of Modigraf (tacrolimus granules) in de novo paediatric allograft recipients

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study F506-CL-0403 was a multicentre, open-label, single arm, phase 4 study designed to determine the pharmacokinetics of systemic tacrolimus following oral administration of Modigraf® (tacrolimus granules), after the first oral dose and at steady state in paediatric patients undergoing de novo liver, kidney or heart transplantation.

In the words of the MAH, the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice, ICH guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objective

- Primary objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus following oral administration of Modigraf, after the first oral dose and at steady state in paediatric patients undergoing de novo allograft transplantation.
- Secondary objective: To determine safety and efficacy of Modigraf

## Study design

This was a multicentre, open-label, single arm study.

## Study population

Paediatric patients undergoing liver, kidney or heart transplantation (or multiorgan transplants as long as one of the organs transplanted was liver, kidney or heart) and meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria prior to initiation of tacrolimus therapy were enrolled. Modigraf was specifically targeted for the paediatric population and for this reason it was deemed necessary to collect data from the 12-year-old and under age group, which represents the population most likely to have some difficulty or be unable to swallow capsule formulations. Prior to enrolment, IC was obtained from the patient's parent(s) or their legal representative(s). Assent from the patient was also obtained where applicable.

The exclusion criteria included:

1. The patient had previously received another organ transplant.
2. Patient had a high immunological risk, defined as a panel reactive antibody score &gt; 50% in the previous 6 months (only applicable for renal transplant recipients).
3. Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney greater than 30 h (only applicable for renal transplant recipients).
4. Patient received an ABO incompatible donor organ.
5. Patient had significant renal impairment, defined as having serum creatinine ≥230 µmol/L (≥2.6 mg/dL) pretransplantation (not applicable for renal transplant recipients).
6. Patient had significant liver disease, defined as having elevated ALT and/or AST and/or total bilirubin levels 3 times the upper value of the normal range during the 28 days prior to transplantation (not applicable for liver transplant recipients).
7. Patient with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 Wood units which was unresponsive to treatment.
8. Patients with malignancies or a history of malignancy within the last 5 years.
9. Patient had a significant, uncontrolled systemic infection and/or severe diarrhoea, vomiting, active upper gastrointestinal disorder that may have affected the absorption of tacrolimus or has an active peptic ulcer.
10. Patient required systemic immunosuppressive medication for any indication other than transplantation.
11. Recipient or donor known to be HIV, HCV or HBV positive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12. Known allergy or intolerance to steroids, macrolide antibiotics, basiliximab or tacrolimus.
13. Patient was participating in another clinical trial and/or has been taking an investigational drug in the 3 months prior to transplantation.
14. Patient was unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol. Patients taking or requiring to be treated with medication or substances prohibited by this protocol.

No power calculations had been performed; however based on previous experience from pharmacokinetic studies, 36 patients with 2 complete pharmacokinetic profiles, were likely to provide sufficient pharmacokinetic data.

## Treatments

The initial daily dose for Modigraf was 0.3 mg/kg per day orally given in 2 doses (equals 0.15 mg/kg twice daily) postoperatively. The first dose of 0.15 mg/kg of tacrolimus was to be administered within 24 h after reperfusion (this period may have been extended up to 5 days for heart transplant recipients). Subsequent oral tacrolimus doses were adjusted based on clinical evidence of efficacy and occurrence of adverse events, and observing the following recommended whole blood trough level range of 5 to 20 ng/ml.

The initial dose and dose modification recommendations for all patients in this study were in line with the Modigraf SmPC.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetics

Two pharmacokinetic profiles were taken as follows:

- Profile 1: First dose of tacrolimus after reperfusion
- Profile 2: Day 7 (+ 7 days) after a minimum of 4 days without a dose change (due to the higher clearance in very young children this may have been possible after 3 days), when the patients are expected to be at steady state.

The following pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus were determined: AUCtau, Cmax, tmax and Ctrough. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. Time of blood sampling was (hours after dosing): 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The lower limit of quantification for tacrolimus in whole blood is 0.5 ng/mL.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of Modigraf was described from the following parameters:

- Rejection episodes: Acute rejection episodes; Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) episodes; Severity of BPAR.
- Patient and graft survival: Death and reason for death; Graft loss and reason for graft loss.

The histological evaluation of the biopsy was performed by the local histopathologist following the 'Histological Grading of Liver Biopsies for Rejection', the 'Banff 97 diagnostic categories for renal allograft biopsies -Banff ' 07 update' or the 'standardised nomenclature of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Acute rejection episodes were classified as Spontaneously Resolving Acute Rejection, Corticosteroid Sensitive Acute Rejection, Corticosteroid Resistant Acute Rejection, or Other Acute Rejection Definitions.

Patient survival was defined as any patient known to be alive at week 2.

Graft survival was defined as any patient who did not experience graft failure during the study. As this is a 2-week study, graft failure was defined as retransplantation, nephrectomy, requiring ongoing dialysis, or death. The date of graft failure was the earliest date of any of these events. Kidney transplanted patients who underwent a nephrectomy or who required ongoing dialysis were counted as patients with graft failure with the date of nephrectomy or the date of started dialysis as date of event.

## Safety

AE collection began at the time of the first study related procedure at baseline (visit 1) and continued until up to 30 days after the final intake of study medication, i.e., even if they occurred after the ESV.

The following standard with 3 grades was to be used to measure the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values. Mild: No disruption of normal daily activities; Moderate: Affects normal daily activities; Severe: Inability to perform daily activities.

Day 1: from day 1 to day 3; Week 1: from day 4 to day 9; Week 2: from day 10.

In patients under 5 years of age, the mean (SD) trough level of tacrolimus was 8.86 (2.76) ng/mL in the heart transplant group, 14.20 (3.72) ng/mL in the liver transplant group and 9.73 (2.12) ng/mL in the kidney transplant group. In patients 5 years of age or older, the mean (SD) trough level of tacrolimus was 10.90 (2.91) ng/mL in the heart transplant group, 18.40 (7.72) ng/mL in the liver transplant group and 9.23 (2.28) ng/mL in the kidney transplant group.

Most of the patients (96.2%) had their dose adjusted during the study. Increases and decreases of dose were similarly reported in the heart and liver transplant groups. However, more decreases than increases of dose were reported in the kidney transplant group (12 [80.0%] vs 8 [53.2%]). These characteristics were similar in both age subgroups (age &lt;5 years and age ≥5 years).

## Pharmacokinetic Parameters

Day 1 : The mean AUCtau was 224.13 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 210.56 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 97.40 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant. Observations from studies in adult patients with heart, liver and kidney transplants have shown that the oral bioavailability was similar across different populations. However, a higher clearance has been observed from studies in adult patients with kidney transplant. Thus, the data generated from the current study in paediatric transplant patients are in line with the observations in adult populations.

Overall, the mean AUCtau was 209.29 h*ng/mL in patients 5 years of age or older and 163.42 h*ng/mL in patients under 5 years of age.

Steady state: The mean AUCtau was 165.17 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 195.08 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 208.32 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant. Overall, the mean AUCtau was 199.49 h*ng/mL in patients 5 years of age or older and 184.78 h*ng/mL in patients under 5 years of age. See Table 28 below.

Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively correlated both at day 1 and week 1 (Pearson's coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively). Overall, similar positive correlations between Ctrough and AUCtau were shown in both age categories (&lt; 5 years and ≥ 5 years).

## The MAH's PK conclusions

- Out of 52 patients enrolled, 38 patients had 2 evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles (12 [70.6%] in the heart transplant group, 14 [70.0%] in the liver transplant group and 12 [80.0%] in the kidney transplant group). The number of patients in the age subgroups was small, with fewer patients in the (≥5 years) cohort than in the (&lt;5 years) cohort (16 vs 36, respectively: 8 vs 9 in the heart transplant group, 3 vs 17 in the liver transplant group and 5 vs 10 in the kidney transplant group, respectively).
- Overall, the mean AUCtau for the first pharmacokinetic profile (day 1) was 224.13 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 210.56 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 97.40 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant. The mean AUCtau for the second PK profile (week 1) was 165.17 h*ng/mL in patients with heart transplant, 195.08 h*ng/mL in patients with liver transplant and 208.32 h*ng/mL in patients with kidney transplant.
- Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively correlated both at day 1 and week 1 on the PKAS (Pearson's coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively).

## CHMP's comment:

When Modigraf received a marketing authorisation for the indication of prophylaxis and treatment of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients, the available pharmacokinetic data were considered limited in the paediatric population by the CHMP. The MAH has therefore performed a study to provide greater understanding of the pharmacokinetics in patients 12 years or younger.

Tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, primarily eliminated via CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. In adults, the clearance of the compound has been shown to differ between healthy subjects and patients with increased clearance rates contributing to a shorter half-life in transplant recipients. In adult and paediatric liver transplant patients, the half-life of tacrolimus is 11.7 hours and 12.4 hours, respectively, compared with 15.6 hours in adult kidney transplant recipients.

In the Modigraf SmPC, it is also stated that highly variable age dependent clearance and half-life have been observed in limited paediatric clinical investigations, especially in early childhood. It is therefore not fully understood why the MAH has chosen to display the PK results with an age cut off of 5 years old, since the children which potentially may differ in tacrolimus PK are expected to be younger than 5 years.

It should be noted that Modigraf dosing is primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each patient individually, aided by blood level monitoring. The recommended initial doses in the Modigraf SmPC are intended to act solely as a guideline. For these reasons the way that the MAH has analysed the PK data from the present study may be considered sufficient, even though model based analysis would have been preferred over non-compartmental analysis to obtain the most efficient use of data. However, to further support the dose recommendation the MAH is asked to display the parameters dose normalised AUCtau and Ctrough and/or estimated Cl with age as a continues variable. Plots with the PK parameter on the y axis and age on the x axis for both Day 1 and steady state should be provided. Based on the results, the MAH should further discuss whether the starting dose and dosing frequency is optimal across the entire age range investigated.

The incidence of TEAEs was similar in patients under 5 years of age and 5 years of age or older (32 [88.9%] and 14 [87.5%], respectively.

The most commonly reported TEAEs in patients less than 5 years of age were hypertension (9 [25.0%] patients) followed by diarrhea (6 [16.7%] patients), vomiting, toxicity to various agents, metabolic acidosis, pyrexia, anemia and blood creatinine increased (5 [13.9%] patients each). The most

commonly reported TEAEs in patients 5 years of age or older were hypertension and hypokalemia (4 [25.0%] patients each).

There were 7 (13.5%) patients who reported 12 severe TEAEs. None of the severe TEAEs led to study discontinuation.

Overall, a total of 19 serious TEAEs were reported by 17 (32.7%) patients (4 [23.5%] patients with heart transplant, 9 [45.0%] patients with liver transplant and 4 [26.7%] patients with kidney transplant). The SOCs for which serious TEAEs were most commonly reported were ' injury, poisoning and procedural complications ' (4 [7.7%] patients) followed by ' hepatobiliary disorders ' and ' investigations ' (3 [5.8%] patients each). The most commonly reported serious TEAEs were toxicity to various agents and blood creatinine increased (3 [5.8%] patients each).

Overall, the highest incidence of high biochemistry potentially clinically significant (PCS) cuts for pediatrics was for alkaline phosphatase (34 [66.7%] patients) followed by AST (25 [48.1%] patients) and GGT (23 [45.1%] patients). The highest incidence of low biochemistry PCS cuts for pediatrics was for creatinine (36 [69.2%] patients) and total bilirubin (23 [44.2%] patients).

A mean decrease from baseline of eGFR was shown at weeks 1 and 2 in patients with heart and liver transplants (-9.0 and -16.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 and -53.0 and -52.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). At day 1, a mean decrease of eGFR from baseline was shown in patients with heart transplant whereas a mean increase of eGFR from baseline was shown in patients with liver transplant (-9.3 and 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively).

## The MAH's safety conclusions

- -Overall, 46 (88.5%) patients reported at least 1 TEAE. The most frequently reported common ( ≥ 10% in any organ transplant) TEAEs were hypertension (13 [25.0%] patients) followed by diarrhea (9 [17.3%] patients) and vomiting (8 [15.4%] patients).
- -Overall, 34 (65.4%) patients reported at least 1 drug-related TEAE. The most commonly reported drug-related TEAEs were hypertension (10 [19.2%] patients) followed by toxicity to various agents (6 [11.5%] patients).
- -Overall, 17 (32.7%) patients reported at least 1 serious TEAE. The most commonly reported serious TEAEs were toxicity to various agents and blood creatinine increased (3 [5.8%] patients each).
- -One patient with liver transplant reported 2 TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The incidence of TEAEs was similar in patients under 5 years of age and in patients 5 years of age or older (32 [88.9%] and 14 [87.5%], respectively). No unexpected clinically relevant differences between both age categories were identified.
- -Overall, there were no unexpected clinically relevant changes in laboratory evaluations or vital signs results.
- -There were no deaths.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH has provided pharmacokinetic data from children 12 years old and younger. Any updates of the SmPC are not suggested.

In the first round of assessment, some additional clarifications were requested from the MAH. A requested analysis with age as a continuous variable was provided, and no obvious relation was detected. The MAH explains that this is expected, during the immediate post-transplant period, many factors (e g hematocrit and plasma albumin) influence the PK of tacrolimus, and there is a high interand intra-patient variability. In this period, dose is a poor predictor of exposure, and after the fixed starting dose the subsequent doses are based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The MAH explains that the approved starting dose has been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and no change is indicated based on the new data. This is agreed.

The MAH also provided a discussion on the relevance of Ctrough as a surrogate for AUCtau. As Ctrough is the most used and validated surrogate marker for TDM, it is agreed that exploring other surrogate time points would be beyond the scope of this procedure. A discussion was also provided regarding the changes in tacrolimus PK over time, and it was concluded that the current data cannot be used to explore such changes further.

As a secondary objective also efficacy and safety data was collected in the study and non-randomised two weeks data reported in heart transplantation (n=17), liver transplantation (n=20), and kidney transplantation (n=15), including 30 days safety follow-up. The overall mean age was 4.3 years with almost 70% of patients below the age of 5 years, and the median duration of study drug exposure 12 days in the heart and kidney transplant groups and 14 days in the liver transplant group.

No graft losses or deaths were reported. Acute rejection was observed in 5 patients: 2 in the heart group whereof 1 BPAR and 3 in the liver group whereof all BPARs; 2 of the latter were classified as moderate rejection.

Serious TEAEs were recorded in 17 (33%) patients. Seven (14%) patients reported 12 severe TEAEs. One patient in the liver group had the study drug discontinued due to TEAEs. The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in the above and below 5 years age groups.

Given the non-randomised design, short study duration and small patient groups, no decisive conclusions on efficacy and safety can be drawn from this study.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

A study report providing some new information of the PK and PD of tacrolimus in children has been submitted, and the data has been discussed. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics is very variable and dependent on many factors apart from age, and dosing is based on therapeutic drug monitoring. It is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

agreed that the new data does not suggest any need for a modification of the starting dose recommendation in children. The MAH does not suggest any changes in the SmPC, which is supported.

## Recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No further regulatory actions needed.

## Additional clarifications requested

For questions in the first round of assessment, see below.

## Assessment of the MAH´s responses to the additional clarifications requested

The MAH has provided their response to the additional clarifications requested. A general description of the use of tacrolimus in children, the role of TDM and the impact of factors other than age on the PK of tacrolimus has been provided. The MAH´s concludes that the new data is limited, and does not suggest any need for an updated dosing instruction in children. This is agreed.

Question 1 Regarding Table 28, it appears that the column headers Cmax and Tmax have been switched. The MAH should clarify.

## MAH´s comment

The MAH agrees and is in the process of issuing an erratum as a corrected page

## CHMP´s comment:

The MAH will update the table.

## Issue solved.

Question 2 The MAH should clarify why a cut off of 5 years old has been used when analysing the pharmacokinetic (PK) data, since the children which potentially may differ in tacrolimus PK are expected to be younger than 5 years.

## MAH´s comment:

In the original protocol that was approved by the CHMP, there was no intention of analyzing PK as a function of age as the sample size in this study was too small to merit such evaluations.

## CHMP´s comment:

The study size and the many confounding factors are acknowledged, limiting the possibility to address the effect of age on tacrolimus PK from the current data. In addition, the MAH has provided a plot with age as a continuous variable, see below.

## Issue solved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Question 3. To further support the current dose recommendations, the MAH is asked to display tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters using age as a continues variable. Plots with PK parameter (e g dose normalised AUCtau and Ctrough and/or estimated clearance, respectively) on the y axis and age on the x axis for both Day 1 and steady state should be provided. Based on the results, the MAH should further discuss whether the starting dose and dosing frequency is optimal across the entire age range investigated.

## MAH´s comment:

To ensure that an appropriate systemic exposure is achieved, the prevailing practice is to conduct TDM based on the trough whole blood concentrations (Ctrough). Although tacrolimus systemic exposure (AUCtau) is the critical parameter for both safety and efficacy in transplant recipients (Undre et al, 1999 and Kuypers et al 2004) AUC monitoring is not practical in routine clinical practice. For this reason, Ctrough is used as a surrogate of overall exposure. The relationship between Ctrough and AUCtau has been evaluated in study F506-CL-0403. Overall, Ctrough and AUCtau were positively correlated both at day 1 and week 1 (Pearson's coefficients were 0.81 and 0.87, respectively). This is a more relevant parameter for TDM.

However, as discussed above, a relationship between age and PK parameter of exposure is not expected during the early post-transplant period owing to several confounding factors. Nevertheless, MAH has examined the relationship between age and AUCtau for the first profile and this is presented in Figure below.

Figure: Relationship between Age (years) and AUCtau (ng.h/mL) following first oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg of tacrolimus for all patients.

<!-- image -->

Age (years)

As expected there is no correlation between age (range 0.33 to 12.5 years) and AUCtau at a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg (equivalent to a daily dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day) recommended as starting dose. These data suggest that it is not possible to define the starting dose based on individual patient's age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP´s comment:

The MAH has provided the requested analysis with age as a continuous variable, and no obvious relation was detected.

The MAH explains that this is expected, during the immediate post-transplant period, many factors (e g hematocrit and plasma albumin) influence the PK of tacrolimus, and there is a high inter- and intrapatient variability. In this period, dose is a poor predictor of exposure, and after the fixed starting dose the subsequent doses are based on therapeutic drug monitoring. The MAH explains that the approved starting dose has been evaluated in phase 2/3 trials and no change is indicated based on the new data. This is agreed.

## Issue solved

Question 4. The MAH is also asked to comment on the use of Ctrough concentrations as a surrogate for AUCtau in this study considering that numerous studies have suggested inadequacy of Ctrough in reflecting total drug exposure. The MAH is asked to comment on alternative surrogate time points (e g 2 or 3 hours post-dose) to estimate AUC0-12 in this population.

## MAH´s comment:

Although a number of publications have suggested alternative surrogate marker for TDM, Ctrough remains the most used and validated surrogate for TDM. This issue was discussed by a group of experts, and they have reached a consensus position (Wallemacq et al, 2009). The consensus paper defines that Ctrough as optimal surrogate marker for TDM.

It is also important to note that Ctrough has been successfully used to optimize tacrolimus based immunosuppressive therapy in children for more than 2 decades; if an alternative surrogate is desired, it will need to undergo full clinical validation through randomized control trials.

## CHMP´s comment:

The MAH describes Ctrough as the most used and validated surrogate marker for TDM, and it is agreed that exploring other surrogate time points would be beyond the scope of this procedure.

## Issue solved

Question 5. Considering that physiological modifications (such as haematocrit level and those related to growth) are expected to occur during the first year post-transplantation in young transplanted patients and that cellular rejection episodes may occur up to 12 months post-surgery, the MAH is asked to comment on how these modifications may impact tacrolimus clearance after the early period, up to 1 year post-transplantation.

## MAH´s comment:

F506-CL-0403 is limited in that it is only a 2 week study and therefore limited in what conclusions can be drawn. Data from studies in adult patients suggest that it takes between 6 weeks to 12 weeks for haematocrit, plasma protein to normalize (Undre et al 2000 kidney and Undre et al 1998 Liver). Although it is not possible to analyse the data from this short term PK study, data from the follow up study F506-CL-0404 may be able to provide further opportunity to evaluate impact of other factors on PK of tacrolimus. However, it is unlikely that with such small number of patients any meaningful conclusions can be elucidated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP´s comment:

The MAH acknowledges that tacrolimus PK may change over time, depending on many factors. It is however agreed that data from the current study cannot be used to study long-term changes due to the short observation period. As regular monitoring of these patients is performed this is not considered a major issue.
