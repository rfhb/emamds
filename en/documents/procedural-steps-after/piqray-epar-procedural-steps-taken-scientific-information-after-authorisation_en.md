This is a non-interventional Post- authorisation Safety Study (PASS)/survey that was conducted to assess healthcare professionals' knowledge on management of hyperglycemia when using alpelisib in selected EU/EEA countries. The Annex II and RMP (version 9.0) have been updated accordingly.   |            |      | information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. In Annex II.D. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective used of the medicinal product. The paragraph on additional risk minimisations measures, describing the required educational programme aiming at increasing awareness and providing information concerning the signs and symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia, including ketoacidosis, and how to manage them, is deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Variation type II / EMA/VR/0000263396 | C.I HUMAN AND VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - C.I.4 Change(s) in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling or Package Leaflet due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data - Accepted Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC in order to reflect the results of the 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in rats (study R2070118). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC with regards to the drug- drug interaction study conducted with the CYP3A4 substrate everolimus.                                 | 24/07/2025 | SmPC | Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data Genotoxicity / Carcinogenicity Results of standard genotoxicity in vitro studies with alpelisib were negative. Alpelisib was not genotoxic in a repeated-dose rat toxicity study where micronucleus analysis was integrated, up to exposure levels approximately twice the estimated exposure (AUC) in humans at the recommended dose of 300 mg. Alpelisib was not carcinogenic in a 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in rats when administered by daily oral gavage at doses up to 4 mg/kg (approximately 0.2 times the clinical exposure in patients at the highest recommended dose of 300 mg/day based on AUC).
