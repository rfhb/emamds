## Introduction

On 22 November 2011, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Sprycel, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the follow up measure 035.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Sprycel and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that CA180018 is a phase 1 study conducted to investigate dasatinib given once daily for treatment of leukaemia in 1- 21 year old subjects. A paediatric formulation is being developed in another study (Study CA180352) for use in future phase II trials.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The CA180018 study conducted in pediatric subjects, used tablet formulations of dasatinib (5, 20, and 50  mg).  If  necessary  to  permit  administration  in  subjects  who  could  not  swallow,  tablets  were dispersed into 30 cc of 100% fruit juice with no preservatives. A new pediatric formulation of dasatinib powder for oral suspension is currently being tested in CA180352 for use in future Phase 2 trials.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

SPRYCEL  (dasatinib) is approved in 69 countries, including the United States and European Union, for the  treatment  of  adult  subjects  with  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML)  or  Philadelphia  chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. For the treatment of adult subjects with newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP)-CML, SPRYCEL was approved in the US (28-Oct-2010) and in the EU (6-Dec-2010). Marketing authorization approval for the indication of adult subjects with newly diagnosed CP-CML is currently under review in several other countries.

The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  study  CA180018,  a  Phase  1  study  conducted  to  investigate dasatinib given once daily (QD) for the treatment of leukemia in 1 to 21-year-old subjects.

## 2. Clinical study

Study  CA180018: Phase 1 Study of SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Dasatinib (BMS-354825) in Children and Adolescents with Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia, Protocol ITCC 005

## Description:

The primary objective of this Phase 1, dose-finding study was to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose of dasatinib in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia. In the absence of an MTD utilizing the pre-specified dose levels, efficacy, safety and PK data were reviewed to determine the  recommended  Phase  2  dasatinib  dose.  The  recommended  Phase  2  dose  is  60 mg/m 2 QD  for pediatric subjects with CP-CML (Stratum 1) and 80 mg/m 2  QD for pediatric subjects with Ph+ ALL or AP/BP-CML  (Stratum  2/3).  Due  to  the  lack  of  efficacy,  there  is  no  plan  to  move  forward  with  the development of dasatinib therapy for the Ph- leukemias in Phase 2 (Stratum 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

-  Objectives

## Primary Objective:

To establish, by stratum using a dose-finding design, a recommended Phase 2 dose of dasatinib (BMS354825) in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia.

## Secondary Objectives:

1)  To  determine  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  identify  any  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  of dasatinib in children and adolescents with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) (Ph+;Stratum 1) or advanced leukemias (Strata 2/3 and 4 aggregated)

2)  To  estimate,  by  stratum,  the  rates  of  morphologic  (major  hematologic  response  [MaHR]), cytogenetic (major  cytogenetic  response  [MCyR];  Strata  1  and  2/3 only),  and  molecular (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]; subjects with MCyR only, Strata 1 and 2/3 only) responses to dasatinib

3) To describe, by stratum, time to response, response duration, progression-free survival (PFS), and survival of children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib

4) To estimate, as a function of dasatinib dose, plasma and (if applicable) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of dasatinib

5) To describe the spectrum of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene (Strata 1 and 2/3) and in the FLT3 and  KIT  genes  (Stratum  4)  at  baseline  and  at  end  of  treatment  and  to  explore  the  role  of mutations as predictors of response.

In  addition,  protocol  Amendment  5  (approved  08-Dec-2009)  and  United  Kingdom  country-specific Amendment  06  (dated  05-May-2010)  added  laboratory  and  radiographic  assessments  to  monitor growth and development and bone mineral metabolism to be performed annually for up to 5 years of follow-up after completion of study drug.

##  Study design

CA180018 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation (3+3 design, intra-subject dose escalation) study in  which  eligible  subjects  were  treated  with  dasatinib  orally  QD  until  refractory  disease  progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient/physician preference. Dasatinib could be continued for as long as clinical benefit was maintained.

The target population included children and adolescents, ≥ 1 to &lt; 21 years of age, with Ph+ CML in chronic, accelerated, or blast phase (BP) resistant or intolerant to imatinib, or in first or subsequent relapse of Ph+ ALL after prior imatinib, or in second or subsequent relapse of Ph- ALL or AML.

-  Study population /Sample size

In  CA180018, 58 subjects were treated with dasatinib and were evaluable for the primary endpoint (selection of the Phase 2 dose):

-  17 in Stratum 1: all Ph+ CP-CML
-  17 in Stratum 2/3
- o 1 subject with Ph+ lymphoid blast phase (LBP) CML
- o 2 subjects with Ph+ AP CML
- o 14 subjects with Ph+ ALL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  24 in Stratum 4

- o 15 subjects with Ph- AML
- o 9 subjects with Ph- ALL

The mean age of the entire study population was 10 years. Fifty-seven of the 58 treated subjects were 1 to 18 years of age. This includes 34 subjects 1 to &lt; 12 years and 23 subjects 12 to &lt; 18 years. One subject with Ph- AML was 21 years and 1 month at baseline. Roughly two-thirds of the subjects in each stratum were male and 90% were white. A summary of dosing is provided in Table 4.2.

##  Treatments

Treatment  courses  were  defined  as  3  weeks  (21  days  plus  any  required  delay);  for  subjects  who stayed  on  treatment  &gt;  12  months,  courses  after  12 months  were  defined  in  quartiles  of  13  weeks. Subjects were to be followed until death or up to 5 years after end-of-treatment.  Dasatinib dose levels are provided in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1: Dasatinib Doses

|   Dose Levels | Dose                                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|            -1 | 50 mg/m 2 QD (-17%)                           |
|             1 | 60 mg/m 2 QD * Starting dose for all strata * |
|             2 | 80 mg/m 2 QD (+33%)                           |
|             3 | 100 mg/m 2 QD (+25%)                          |
|             4 | 120 mg/m 2 QD (+20%)                          |

150 mg/m 2   QD  was  planned  to  be  used  for  dose  escalation;  however,  no  subject  had  a dose escalation to 150 mg/m 2 .

The starting dose level for all strata was 60 mg/m 2  QD. Each stratum was escalated independently, following a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Intra-subject dose escalation was allowed based on tolerance and on individual response. This design ensured maximal therapeutic benefit for children and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adolescents with Ph+ disease, without a requirement to escalate to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and incur toxicity.

-  Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy: Efficacy variables included hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to dasatinib. Time  to  response,  response  duration,  progression-free  survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival  with relapsed or refractory leukemia treated with dasatinib were also measured. Mutations in the BCR-ABL (for  subjects  with  Ph+  leukemias  in  Strata  1  and  2/3)  and  mutations  in  FLT3  and  KIT  genes  (for subjects with Ph - leukemias in Stratum 4) were studied.

Safety: AEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs of special  interest,  laboratory  measurements,  electrocardiograms  (ECG),  echocardiograms,  and  deaths were  summarized.  Investigator  reported  AE  terms  were  coded  and  grouped  by  system  organ  class (SOC) using the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Affairs  (MedDRA)  dictionary  Version  14.  AEs  and other symptoms were graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 3.0. Specific measures for long-term follow-up of growth and development were added in protocol Amendment 5 (08-Dec-2009).

Pharmacokinetics: PK variables included: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC[0-T]), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinite time (AUC[INF]), terminal elimination half-life (T-HALF), dose normalized (DN) Cmax, DN AUC(0-T), and DN AUC(INF).

##  Statistical Methods

The  sample  size  was  not  based  on  statistical  power  to  detect  a  specific  response  rate  but  on  the feasibility of accrual and on the dose levels used for the escalations of the starting dose.

In Stratum 1 and in Stratum 2/3, at least 12 subjects in each stratum were to be treated to meet the primary objective (6 subjects at the 60 mg/m2 starting dose; and 6 subjects at the 80 mg/m2 starting dose, unless there was excessive toxicity at either dose, or no clinical need to escalate to 80 mg/m2). Up to additional 4 subjects were to be treated at the 60 mg/m2 dose level in Stratum 1 and at the 80 mg/m2 level in Stratum 2/3 to expand the number of subjects at the dose level selected for the Phase 2 study.

In Stratum 4, a maximum of 6 subjects were to be accrued per dose level; the highest starting dose was to be 120 mg/m2.

Dose escalation was based on the tolerability at a given dose level and the clinical efficacy at a given dose. The recommended Phase 2 dose was determined based on the aggregation of safety data for these strata, and an assessment of safety at a minimum of 2 dose levels was planned.

Best on-study hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response rates including key efficacy endpoints were estimated using all treated subjects by stratum and by dose cohort. Ninety-five percent exact confidence intervals (CIs) using the method of Clopper and Pearson were provided for rates computed on the recommended Phase 2 dose.

Kaplan-Meier  plots  for  PFS,  overall  survival  (OS),  duration  and  time  to  response  by  stratum  were planned  and  provided.  A  2-sided,  95%  CI  for  the  median  was  computed  using  the  method  of Brookmeyer and Crowley.

## Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

Of the 58 treated subjects, 51 subjects were off treatment at the time of database lock (Table 3). As of the data cut off for this report, a total of 7 subjects were still on study: 6 in Stratum 1 and 1 with Ph+ ALL in Stratum 2/3.

No hematologic responses were reported in subjects from Stratum 4.

Last MCyR was achieved by Week 26 in Stratum 1 and by Week 15 in the Stratum 2/3.

The MCyR and CCyR rates exclude subject (CA180018-10-10006) in the 80 mg/m 2  dose cohort, who did not have a CCyR. This subject was counted as having a CCyR due to a data entry error that was fixed after database lock for this CSR.

For Stratum 2/3 Unconfirmed CHR = unconfirmed MaHR

ALL - acute lymphoblastic leukemia, AP - accelerated phase, BP - blast phase, CHR - complete hematologic response, CML - chronic myeloid leukemia, CMR - complete molecular response, CP - chronic phase, MaHR - major hematologic response, MCyR - major cytogenetic response, MMR - major molecular response, OS - overall survival, PFS - progression free survival, Ph+ - Philadelphia chromosome positive

## Assessors comment

It  can  be  agreed  that  the  data  support  60  mg/m2  QD  for  paediatric  subjects  with  CP-CML  and  80 mg/m2 QD for paediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL  or  AP/BP-CML  as  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose (table  above)  as  clinical  activity  in  paediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  leukemias  with  resistance  or intolerance to prior imatinib was shown. Response rates in children with CP-CML at 60 mg/m2 QD and in children with AP-CML and Ph+ ALL at 80 mg/m2 QD was favourable.

The data also showed that no responses were observed in paediatric subjects with treatment-refractory Ph-ALL or AML (Stratum 4) despite escalations to the highest dose in this trial of 120 mg/m2.

AEs - adverse events, ALL - acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALT - alanine aminotransferase, AML - acute myeloid leukemia, AP - accelerated phase, AST - aspartate aminotransferase, BP - blast phase, CML chronic myeloid leukemia, CP - chronic phase, Ph+ - Philadelphia chromosome positive, Ph- - Philadelphia chromosome negative, SAEs - serious adverse events

Two subjects (both in Stratum 4) with other co-morbidities, had dose-limiting toxicities. One subject developed Grade 4 anaphylaxis 5 hours after the first dose of study drug (60 mg/m 2 ) and the event resolved the same day. This resulted in discontinuation of dasatinib therapy and discontinuation from study. The other subject (120 mg/m 2  dose cohort), who had a platelet count of 16 x 10 9 /L developed an upper GI hemorrhage (Grade 3) on Day 6 that resolved on Day 11 of the study. This event led to interruption of dasatinib dosing. A maximum tolerated dose was not established for any strata on this study.

## Rates of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and discontinuation from Therapy

A total of 38 subjects died: 3 (18%), 12 (71%), and 23 (96%) in Strata 1, 2/3, and 4, respectively; however, none of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study therapy. Most were related to disease progression and infections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  12%,  29%  and  33%  of  subjects  in  Strata  1,  2/3,  and 4, respectively.  With  the  exception  of  thrombocytopenia,  which  was  reported  in  2 subjects  (12%)  in Stratum 2/3, all other drug-related SAEs were reported by 1 subject each per stratum.

There were no drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of dasatinib reported in Strata 1 and 2/3. Two  (8%)  subjects  in  Stratum  4  had  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  dasatinib.  One subject (previously mentioned in Section 5) in the 60 mg/m 2  dose cohort (with a history of allergies) had Grade 4 anaphylaxis 5 hours after the first dose of dasatinib (60 mg/m 2 ). The other subject in the 100 mg/m 2  dose cohort (with no reported medical history of allergies) had an SAE of urticaria (Grade 2).

Drug-related non-hematologic AEs reported by  10% of subjects in any treatment group include the following: headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, pain in extremity, mouth ulceration, vomiting, arthralgia, back pain, fatigue, malaise, peripheral edema, pyrexia, pruritus, and urticaria in Stratum 1, diarrhea, nausea,  vomiting,  rash,  headache,  fatigue,  and  epistaxis  in  Stratum  2/3,  and  nausea,  vomiting, headache, and arthralgia in Stratum 4.

## Laboratory Assessments, Vital Signs, ECGs

Most subjects had some degree of cytopenia on study; however, no subject had cytopenia/myelosuppression that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. No other laboratory abnormalities led to discontinuation of dasatinib therapy.

ECG results were similar among the strata; most subjects had a decline in QTc(F) from baseline in the -60  to  0  msec  range  (median  7.5  msec  for  the  overall  population).  No  subject  had  a  QTc  (F) &gt; 500 msec.  Abnormal  echocardiogram  results  were  reported  for  1 subject  with  a  normal  result  at baseline;  this  subject  had  no  associated  cardiac  AEs  associated  with  the  abnormal  results  and subsequently had normal echocardiogram results. Two subjects with abnormal echocardiogram results at baseline also had abnormal results on study. There were no discontinuations of dasatinib therapy because of abnormal ECG or echocardiogram results.

Adverse events (AEs) of special interest  in  the  dasatinib  program  were  examined  either  because  of their  association  with  dasatinib  in  the  currently  approved  indications,  because  they  are  recognized events  in  other  agents  within  this  drug  class,  or  because  safety  data  from  nonclinical  and  clinical studies warranted careful evaluation. AEs of special interest include fluid retention, cardiac disorders, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, rash, bleeding events, hypersensitivity, and hearing loss.

Drug-related  severe  (Grade  3,  none  were  Grade  4)  AEs  of  special  interest,  were  uncommon, manageable, and generally did not lead to discontinuation of dasatinib. In this study, 7 subjects had drug-related Grade 3 AEs of special interest; this includes

-  Stratum 2/3:
- o bleeding event (n = 1), Grade 3 epistaxis on Day 57 that resolved in 2 days. The subject was thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 20 x 10 9 c/L on Day 58.
-  6 subjects in Stratum 4:
- o rash (n = 2)
- o bleeding event (n = 1), Grade 3 upper GI hemorrhage on Day 6 that resolved on Day 12. A platelet count was not available on Day 6; the platelet count on Day 8 was 52 x 10 9 c/L. This subject also had Grade 3 drug-related nausea.
- o pleural effusion (n = 1)
- o vomiting (n = 1)
- o hypocalcemia (n = 1)

Importantly,  no  pediatric  subjects  experienced  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  during  this  trial, including none of the 13 subjects treated for more than one year with dasatinib.

Tests  to  monitor  growth  and  development  and  bone  metabolism  were  added  to  the  study  as mandatory  protocol  procedures;  however,  at  the  time  these  tests  were  added,  only  18 of  the 58 subjects were either on treatment or in follow-up. Because of the limited amount of data available at  the  time  of  database  lock  for  the  CA180018  clinical  study  report  and  the  limited  follow-up,  no definitive  conclusions  can  made  on  the  effect  of  dasatinib  therapy  on  growth  in  pediatric  subjects, however,  preliminary  data  do  not  demonstrate  a  negative  impact  on  growth  and  bone  mineral metabolism. In CA180018, data for long-term growth assessment continues to be collected.

## Assessors comment

The data presented showed a safety profile that was manageable in pediatric subjects with leukemia.

No unexpected adverse events were observed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma PK data were available for 53 subjects. Each subject could have 1, 2 or 3 plasma PK profiles sampled, depending on the number of times the dose of dasatinib was escalated. CSF PK data were available for 9 subjects.

## Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Dasatinib in Plasma - Effect of Age and Dasatinib Dose

Dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Mean Tmax was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours. Mean T-HALF ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. High inter-subject variability was observed in the PK parameters of pediatric subjects.

The geometric means of dose-normalized (DN) dasatinib Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) appeared to be  similar  between  children  and  adolescents.  At  both  the  100  and  120  mg/m2  dose  levels,  PK parameters  were  available  from  one  subject  in  the  infants  and  toddler  age  group.  It  is  difficult  to compare the PK of dasatinib in the infant and toddler age group with children and adolescents due to insufficient sample size in the infant and toddler age group.

In  post  hoc  analyses,  the  geometric  means  of  dose-normalized  dasatinib  Cmax,  AUC(0-T)  and AUC(INF) appeared not to be statistically different between children and adolescents at the different dose levels.

## Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Dasatinib by Formulation

There were two dosage forms administered to subjects in this study: tablets and dispersed tablets. Subjects received their dasatinib dose as tablets (supplied as 5, 20, and 50 mg strengths) if they were able  to  swallow  tablets.  To  permit  administration  in  young  children  who  were  unable  to  swallow tablets, the dasatinib tablets were dispersed into 30 mL lemonade or orange juice or apple juice prior to  dose  administration.  The  overall  median  Tmax  was  0.5  hour  shorter  for  the  dispersed  tablet compared with the tablet  formulation.  PK  parameters  were  available  from  only  one  adolescent  who received the dispersed tablet; hence dasatinib exposure from the two dosage forms was compared in children group only. In a post-hoc statistical analysis comparing the exposure of dasatinib in children given tablets or dispersed tablets, no evidence of a difference between formulations could be seen in the children group. However, the relatively wide confidence intervals of the slope for the power models were obtained for all PK parameters.

## Pharmacokinetic Results in Cerebral Spinal Fluid

The mean 4 hour post-dose CSF concentration of dasatinib in children and adolescents ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 ng/mL, whereas the mean dasatinib plasma concentrations at the same time point ranged from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

38 to 88 ng/mL in the same groups of subjects. Hence, in pediatric subjects, the concentrations of dasatinib in CSF at 4 hours post-dose are 1% - 5% of the concentration in plasma.  Of the 32 CSF samples analyzed from 9 subjects, 21 samples had measurable concentrations of dasatinib, none had detectable  concentrations  of  BMS-582691,  and  2  samples  had  detectable  concentrations  of  BMS606181.

## Assessors comment

The pharmacokinetic data submitted showed that dasatinib was rapidly absorbed in paediatric subjects with  relapsed  or  refractory  leukemia  and  that  administration  of  dasatinib  resulted  in  systemic exposures in terms of Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) that were consistent with dose proportionality in the  dose  range  of  60  to  120  mg/m2.  Also,  the  median  Tmax  was  slightly  shorter  for  the  dispersed tablet compared with the tablet formulation. No statistical difference in Cmax, AUC(0-T), and AUC(INF) was observed between the tablet and the dispersed tablet.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Data for efficacy, safety and PK testing dasatinib 60 and 80 mg/m 2 QD in a paediatric population with Ph+  leukemias  showed  a  favorable  benefit  risk  profile.  But  additional  studies  will  be  conducted  to further support a once daily dosing in pediatric Ph+ CML and ALL.

It can be agreed that based on the data submitted the recommended dasatinib dose for future Phase 2 studies in paediatric subjects with Ph+ leukemias will be 60 mg/m 2  QD for subjects with CP-CML and 80 mg/m 2  QD for subjects with Ph+ ALL or AP/BP-CML.
