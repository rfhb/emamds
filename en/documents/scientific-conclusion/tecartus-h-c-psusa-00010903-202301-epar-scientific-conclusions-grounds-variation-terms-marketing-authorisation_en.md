## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for brexucabtagene autoleucel, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on infusion related reaction from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between brexucabtagene autoleucel and infusion related reaction to be a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing brexucabtagene autoleucel should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for brexucabtagene autoleucel the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brexucabtagene autoleucel is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
