## 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- The  Rapporteur's  and  Co-Rapporteur's  initial  assessment  reports  were  circulated  to  all Members of the previous CPMP on 12 October 1994.
- The consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 9 January 1995.
- The  company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on 12 April 1995.
- The  Rapporteur's  and  Co-Rapporteur's  assessment  report  on  the  responses  provided  by  the company was circulated to all CPMP Members by the Rapporteur on 31 May 1995.
- A revised Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) was circulated on 2 June 1995. Comments were required by 23 June 1995.
- The  company  was  asked  to  give  an  oral  explanation  on  11  July  1995  at  the  meeting  of  the CPMP. The oral explanation with the company took place to address concerns on the clinical safety profile and the lack of comparative clinical data in the Taxotere dossier. The company's answers  were  considered  by  the  CPMP  on  11-12  July  1995.  The  CPMP  took  on  board  the recommendations of the ad hoc Working Group on Oncology meeting on 12 June 1995.
- The CPMP, at its meeting of 12 July 1995, having considered the application, recommended the granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances,  in  accordance  with Article 13 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93 and adopted its final positive Opinion for each of the two presentations of Taxotere. The Opinion was forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission who issued a Marketing Authorisation for this medicinal product on 27 November 1995.
