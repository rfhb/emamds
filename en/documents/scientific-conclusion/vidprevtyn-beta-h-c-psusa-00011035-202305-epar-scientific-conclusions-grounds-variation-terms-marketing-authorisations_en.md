In view of available data on dizziness from clinical trials, spontaneous reports, including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 variant, prefusion Spike delta TM protein, recombinant and dizziness is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 variant, prefusion Spike delta TM protein, recombinant should be amended accordingly. Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 variant, prefusion Spike delta TM protein, recombinant the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 variant, prefusion Spike delta TM protein, recombinant is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
