| II/0012             | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add information deriving from new clinical data for the use of edoxaban as anticoagulant therapy for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation undergoing cardioversion (study ENSURE-AF). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives for Portugal in the Package Leaflet and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to introduce linguistic review in the Package Leaflet and to amend annex A as suggested during variation IA/05/G. | 15/06/2017 | 28/05/2018 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Lixiana can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. For transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, Lixiana treatment should be started at least 2 hours before cardioversion to ensure adequate anticoagulation. Cardioversion should be performed no later than 12 hours after the dose of Lixiana on the day of the procedure. For all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has taken Lixiana as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment should follow established guidelines for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion. |
