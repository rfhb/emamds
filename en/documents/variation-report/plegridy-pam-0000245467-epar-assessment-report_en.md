## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study 105MS306 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 105MS306 was Plegridy solution for injection, either in a prefilled autoinjector pen or prefilled syringe. In this assessment report, the product names Plegridy and  BIIB017  are  used  interchangeably.  No  specific  paediatric  formulation  is  available  or  under development.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted an interim report for:

- Study 105MS306

An Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Active-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,  and  Efficacy  of  BIIB017  in  Pediatric  Subjects  Aged  10  to  Less  Than  18  Years  for  the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, With Optional Open-Label Extension.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

This was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group study of BIIB017 in pediatric participants aged 10 to &lt; 18 years for the treatment of RRMS. This report provides the results for Part 1 up to the data cut-off date (28 August 2024). In Part 2 (up to Week 192), the open-label extension period of the study, the long-term safety of BIIB017 in the pediatric RRMS population will be investigated and reported in the final CSR upon study completion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After stratification, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with BIIB017 or Avonex for Part 1 of this Study. Participants who were randomized in Part 1 of the study to receive BIIB017, were administered 125 μg subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 96 weeks. Participants who were randomized to receive Avonex in Part 1 of the study self-administered (or given via a proxy) a dose of 30 μg intramuscular (IM) injection once weekly beginning with the Day 1/Baseline Visit.

## Methods

## Study participants

This study enrolled male and female participants, aged from 10 to &lt; 18 years old, with RRMS and an EDSS score between 0.0 and 5.5, inclusive, at the time of randomization (Day 1).

In addition, the patients m ust have had experienced ≥ 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to randomization (Day 1) or ≥ 2 relapses in the 24 months prior to randomization (Day 1) or had evidence of asymptomatic disease activity (Gd-enhancing lesions) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 6 months prior to randomization (Day 1).

The main exclusion criteria were:

- Primary  progressive,  secondary  progressive,  or  progressive  relapsing  MS.  These  conditions required the presence of continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Participants with these conditions may also have superimposed relapses but were distinguished from relapsing participants by the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical improvement.
- History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or known drug hypersensitivity.
- Known allergy to any component of Avonex or BIIB017 formulation.
- Occurrence of an MS relapse that occurred within 30 days prior to randomization (Day 1) and/or the participant had not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to randomization (Day 1).

## Treatments

Treatment:

BIIB017 was taken at a dose of 125 μg SC every 2 weeks for 96 weeks. To mitigate flu -like symptoms, participants were titrated to the target dose of BIIB017 125 μg as follows: BIIB017 63 μg on Day 1, 94 μg at Week 2, and 125 μg at Week 4. Once target dose was reached, participants continued on this dose for the remainder of the study.

Comparator:

Avonex was started at a dose of 7.5 μg and the dose increased by 7.5 μg each week for 3 weeks until the recommended dose of 30 μg was achieved. The purpose of the titration was to reduce the incidence and ameliorate flu-like symptoms. Note: At the discretion of the treating neurologist, dose titration may not have been necessary. Following titration, Avonex was administered once weekly by IM injection according to local prescribing information.

## Objectives

The primary objectives were to:

- evaluate the safety, tolerability, and descriptive efficacy of BIIB017 in pediatric participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB017 in pediatric participants with RRMS.

The exploratory Objective was to collect additional efficacy information.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was the Annualized relapse rate (ARR) at Week 48.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were

- ARR at Week 96
- Proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans at Weeks 24, 48, and 96
- Proportion of participants free of new MRI activity in the brain (free of Gd-enhancing lesions and new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions) at Weeks 24, 48, and 96
- Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans at Weeks 24, 48, and 96
- Number of Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI scans at Weeks 24, 48, and 96
- Time to first relapse
- Proportion of participants free of relapse up to Weeks 48 and 96
- Change from baseline in cognition as measured by the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) at Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96
- Change from baseline in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at Weeks 48 and 96
- Change from baseline in the quality of life as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96

## Exploratory endpoints were

- Time to progression of disability at Weeks 48 and 96 as measured by ≥ 1.0 -point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS ≥ 1.0 that was sustained for 12 weeks, or ≥ 1.5 -point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS = 0 that was sustained for 12 weeks
- Number of new T1 hypointense lesions on brain MRI scans at Weeks 24, 48, and 96

## Sample size

This study was not powered for the primary efficacy endpoint of Part 1. The sample size was originally primarily based on feasibility, with the goal of having at least 50 evaluable participants at the 2-year (96-week) timepoint of Part 1 in each treatment group.

The considerations in setting the sample size were based on a projected dropout rate of approximately 30% over a 2year period and approximately 142 participants at ≥ 60 sites globally, aged 10 to &lt; 18 years, were planned to be randomized in Part 1 of the study to obtain a total of at least 100 evaluable participants who have completed at least 48 weeks of treatment, and to include the following:

- At least 12 evaluable participants for the primary endpoint in the 10 to &lt; 13 years age group
- At least 80 evaluable participants for the primary endpoint in the 13 to &lt; 18 years age group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Participants were stratified by age group (10 to &lt; 13 years, 13 to &lt; 15 years, or 15 to &lt; 18 years), IFN use (yes/no) during the 4 weeks prior to study entry, and GA use (yes/no) during the 4 weeks prior to study entry. After stratification, participants were randomized using IXRS in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with BIIB017 or Avonex for Part 1 of this Study.

Study was open-label.

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis populations :

· Full Analysis Set (FAS), defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Part 1. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using the FAS. In analyses performed on the FAS, participants  were  analyzed,  based  on  the  intention-to-treat  principle,  according  to  their  randomized treatment assignment regardless of treatment received.

·  Safety  Analysis  Set,  defined  as  all  randomized  participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study treatment in Part 1, essentially the same set of participants included in the FAS. Safety endpoints were analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. In analyses performed on the Safety Analysis Set, participants were analyzed according to their actual treatment received.

·  Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  Set,  defined  as  all  participants  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  BIIB017 treatment in Part 1 and have at least 1 measurable drug concentration postbaseline.

· Per Protocol Set, defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and completed 48 weeks of Part 1 without major protocol deviations. These analyses commenced only if there are differences &gt; 10 in any treatment group in number of participants between the Per Protocol Set and FAS. Participants were analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment regardless of treatment received. The primary endpoint (ARR at Study Week 48) was analyzed in the Per Protocol Set in addition to the FAS.

Summary of statistical analysis plan for efficacy endpoints is presented in Table 1.

## Recruitment

A total of 152 participants (Avonex group, 77 participants; BIIB017 group, 75 participants) were enrolled in Part 1 of the study and were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. As of the data cut-off date, 124 participants (81.6%) completed Week 48 of the study: 58 participants (75.3%) in the Avonex group and 66 participants (88.0%) in the BIIB017 group. There were 96 participants (63.2%) who completed Week 96 of the study: 44 participants (57.1%) in the Avonex group and 52 participants (69.3%) in the BIIB017 group.

As of the data cut-off date, 52 participants (34.2%) discontinued study treatment overall: 33 participants (42.9%) in the Avonex group and 19 participants (25.3%) in the BIIB017 group. Overall, the most common reasons for study treatment discontinuation were physician decision (18 participants [11.8%]), AEs  and  participant  withdrawal  (11  participants  [7.2%]  each),  and  parent/guardian  withdrawal  (7 participants [4.6%]).

As  of  the  data  cutoff  date,  47  participants  (30.9%)  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  overall:  30 participants (30.9%) in the Avonex group and 17 participants (22.7%) in the BIIB017 group. Overall,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  most  common  reasons  for  withdrawal  from  the  study  were  physician  decision  (16  participants [10.5%]), participant withdrawal (12 participants [7.9%]), AEs (9 participants [5.9%]), and parent/guardian withdrawal (7 participants [4.6%]).

## Baseline data

Overall, the mean (SD) age of the 152 participants enrolled in the Part 1 was 15.1 (1.87) years and ages ranged from 10 to 17 years. Approximately two-thirds of the participants were female (95 participants, 62.5%). Most participants were aged 15 to 17 years ([104 participants, 68.4%] and most participants were White (135 participants, 88.8%]). The mean (SD) weight was 64.2 (15.29) kg, and the mean (SD) height was 166.3 (10.36) cm. Demographic characteristics were similar overall in both treatment groups.

Overall, the mean (SD) time since first MS symptoms was 1.2 (1.27) years with a mean (SD) time since diagnosis of 0.7 (1.02) years. Of 152 participants, most participants had only 1 relapse in the past 12 months (92 participants [60.5%]) or 24 months (73 participants [48.0%]). The mean (SD) time since the most recent pre-study relapse was 6.2 (7.25) months. Most participants (137 of 152) had an EDSS score between 0 and 2 at Baseline.

Of 152 participants, 35 participants (23%) took MS medication prior to enrollment. The most common medication (taken by &gt; 10% of participants overall) prior to enrollment was interferon β -1a, which was taken by 17 participants (11%). The percentage of participants who took prior MS medications was similar between participants in both groups.

## Number analysed

The FAS population included all 152 all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Part 1.

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy endpoint ARR at Week 48

In the FAS overall, 111 participants (73%) did not relapse up to Week 48: 53 participants (69%) in the Avonex group and 58 participants (77%) in the BIIB017 group. A total of 59 relapses were reported: 35 in the Avonex group and 24 in the BIIB017 group. The adjusted ARR (95% CI) was 0.521 (0.322, 0.843) in  the  Avonex  group  and  0.386  (0.231,  0.646)  in  the  BIIB017  group.  The  estimated  Kaplan-Meier proportion of participants who were relapse-free at Week 48 was 0.712 overall, 0.662 in the Avonex group, and 0.764 in the BIIB017 group.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

A total of 100 participants (66%) did not relapse up to Week 96: 45 participants (58%) in the Avonex group and 55 participants (73%) in the BIIB017 group. A total of 87 relapses were reported: 56 in the Avonex group and 31 in the BIIB017 group. The adjusted ARR (95% CI) was 0.526 (0.341, 0.812) in the Avonex group and 0.291 (0.177, 0.479) in the BIIB017 group.

The  mean  PedsQL  scale  scores  across  all  5  dimensions  were  similar  between  Avonex  and  BIIB017 treatment groups, with mean scores within 1 SD, except for the Work/School dimension.

Other secondary and exploratory endpoint results are presented in Table 2.

Overall, the most common TEAEs (reported in &gt; 20% of participants) by SOC were General disorders and administration site conditions (83 participants [54.6%]), Nervous system disorders (80 participants [52.6%]), and Infections and infestations (56 participants [36.8%]). The percentages of participants with TEAEs in each SOC was generally similar between Avonex and BIIB017 groups.

By PT, the most common TEAEs (reported in &gt; 10% of participants) were multiple sclerosis relapse (50 participants  [32.9%]),  influenza  like  illness  (41  participants  [27.0%]),  injection  site  erythema  (31 participants [20.4%]), headache (30 participants [19.7%]), and pyrexia (22 participants [14.5%]). Of these, the largest between-group difference was for injection site erythema: 6 participants (7.8%) in the Avonex group and 25 participants (33.3%) in the BIIB017 group; followed by multiple sclerosis relapse: 30 participants (39.0%) in the Avonex group and 20 participants (26.7%) in the BIIB017 group.

Overall,  in  the  safety  analysis  set,  94  participants  (61.8%)  had  TEAEs  that  were  considered  by  the Investigator related to study treatment. The percentage of participants who had TEAEs that were related to study treatment was 58.4% in the Avonex group (45 participants) and  65.3% in the BIIB017 group (49 participants).

By  PT,  related  TEAEs  experienced  by  ≥  20%  participants  overall  were  influenza  like  illness  (41 participants  [27.0%])  and  injection  site  erythema  (31  participants  [20.4%]).  The  related  TEAE  of influenza like illness was reported for 25 participants (32.5%) in the Avonex group and 16 participants (21.3%) in the BIIB017 group. The related TEAE of injection site erythema was reported for 6 participants (7.8%) in the Avonex group and 25 participants (33.3%) in the BIIB017 group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse events

Overall, 20 participants (13.2%) had at least 1 SAE during Part 1 of the study: 12 participants (15.6%) in the Avonex group and 8 participants (10.7%) in the BIIB017 group. Most common SOC were Nervous system disorders, Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders. SAEs in the Nervous system disorders SOC were reported for 11 participants (14.3%) in the Avonex group and 4 participants (5.3%) in the BIIB017 group. SAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC were reported for 2 participants (2.6%) in  the  Avonex  group  and  2  participants  (2.7%)  in  the  BIIB017  group.  SAEs  in  the  Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were reported for 1 participant (1.3%) in the Avonex group and 1 participant (1.3%) in the BIIB017 group.

By PT, treatmentemergent SAEs experienced by ≥ 2 participants overall were multiple sclerosis relapse and complicated appendicitis. The SAE of multiple sclerosis relapse was reported for 11 participants (14.3%) in the Avonex group and 4 participants (5.3%) in the BIIB017 group. The SAE of complicated appendicitis was reported only in Avonex group (2 participants [2.6%]).

The  Investigator  considered  the  following  treatment-emergent  SAEs  related  to  study  treatment: abdominal pain, hematuria, and hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (1 participant [0.7%] each], all occurred in the Avonex group).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall, 10 participants (6.6%) had a TEAE that led to discontinuation of study treatment: 7 participants (9.1%) in the Avonex group and 3 participants (4.0%) in the BIIB017 group.

By PT, the TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment in &gt; 1 participant were multiple sclerosis relapse and suicidal ideation (2 participants [1.3%] each). Multiple sclerosis relapse was reported for 1 participant (1.3%) in each group. Suicidal ideation was reported for 2 participants (2.6%) in the Avonex group and 0 participants in the BIIB017 group. Additionally, one AE (multiple sclerosis relapse) in each study arm (1 participant in the Avonex group and 1 participant in the BIIB017 group) were classified as not treatment-emergent because they occurred during the follow-up period.

Shift tables are based on the concept of subjects being at-risk for a change in status from baseline. The denominator for each parameter and study arm combination is the number of subjects at-risk for the shift. The numerator is the number of at-risk subjects who experienced the shift in question. The rate is the percentage of at-risk subjects who experienced the shift in question.

As of the data cut-off date, 8 participants had lymphocyte counts &lt; LLN, 5 participants in the Avonex group and 3 participants in the BIIB017 group. All 8 participants had post-baseline lymphocyte counts &lt; LLN; at some visits the lymphocyte counts were &lt; 0.9 × 109/L. All 8 participants completed the study and did not enter the long-term extension study.

Abnormal ALT and AST values were reported in following categories: &gt; 1 to &lt; 3 upper limit of normal (ULN), ≥ 3 to 5 × ULN, &gt; 5 to 10 × ULN, &gt; 10 to 20 × ULN, and &gt; 20 × ULN . However, none of the participants had laboratory results that met Hy's law criteria.

## Vital signs

The most common clinically relevant vital sign abnormality (reported in &gt; 10% of participants overall) was high pulse rate (&gt; 120 bpm postbaseline or an increase from baseline of &gt; 20 bpm) in 24 of 151 participants (15.9%) and a low pulse rate (&lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 20 bpm decrease from baseline) in 19 of 151 participants (12.6%).

Except for low pulse rate (12 of 77 participants [15.6%] in the Avonex group and 7 of 74 participants [9.5%] in the BIIB017 group) and low systolic blood pressure (0 of 77 participants in the Avonex group and 5 of 74 participants [6.8%] in the BIIB017 group), the percentages of participants experiencing each type of clinically relevant abnormality were generally similar in both treatment groups.

Overall, 11 of 133 participants (8.3%) experienced a shift to abnormal in their ECG results (6 of 67 participants [9.0%] in the Avonex group and 5 of 66 participants [7.6%] in the BIIB017 group). There were no adverse events associated with ECG shifts.

## Immunogenicity

Overall, 150 participants were included in this analysis (75 participants each in the Avonex and BIIB017 groups). Of these participants, 57 (38.0%) tested positive for anti-IFNβ -1a antibodies (28 participants [37.3%] in the Avonex group and 29 participants [38.7%] in the BIIB017 group) and 15 participants (10.1%) tested positive for neutralizing IFNβ -1a antibodies (13 participants [17.3%] in the Avonex group and 2 participants [2.7%] in the BIIB017 group). The incidence of participants with neutralizing IFNβ -1a antibodies in the BIIB017 group was low and nonpersistent. There was no apparent impact on safety or clinical efficacy, although the analysis was limited by the low incidence of immunogenicity. Anti-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PEG antibodies were present at Baseline in 92% of participants and were persistent during the study in participants taking BIIB017. Avonex participants were not tested for anti-PEG antibodies as Avonex is not pegylated.

## Pharmacokinetics

Sparse sampling and PK modeling and simulation was used to determine the PK of BIIB017. Samples for PK analysis were drawn postdose on Day 1, postdose during Week 4 (including Days 1, 3, and 6), and postdose during Week 24. The following parameters were calculated: AUCtau, Cmax at steady state and Tmax at steady state.

The  PK  analysis  dataset  included  306  measurable  PK  observations  from  75  subjects  from  Study 105MS306. Existing PPK model developed with data from adult subjects underpredicted the observed BIIB017 plasma concentration in pediatrics from Study 105MS306. The model was refined and thereafter used in simulations to generate steady-state Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC0-tau of adult and pediatric subjects included in the combined PK analysis dataset. Steady-state AUC0-tau in pediatric subjects is about 2.5 times greater than that of the adult subjects AUC0-tau. This was consistent with the estimated lower apparent  clearance  in  pediatric  participants.  Similarly,  simulated  steady-state  Cmax  and  Ctrough  were higher in pediatric compared to adult MS participants.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH submitted an interim report of ongoing open-label study 105MS306 in paediatric patients 10 to ≤ 18 years of age with RRMS. In this study, peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) or interferon beta-1a (Avonex) are administered to patients for a total duration of 192 weeks. The interim report covers the study period through week 48 (Part 1a) which is completed, and the available data up to week 96 (Part 1b) up to the data cut-off on 24 August 2024. This study is part of the agreed paediatric investigation plan for peginterferon beta-1a (EMEA-001129-PIP01-M06).

The study design in general follows a conventional study in RRMS in terms of duration and endpoints. A total of 152 participants were enrolled and randomized in Part 1 of the study, of whom 124 completed week 48 of the study. As per data cut-off, 96 patients have completed week 96.

The primary efficacy outcome was adjusted ARR at week 48, which was lower in the Plegridy group (0.386, 95% CI 0.231, 0.646)) as compared to the Avonex group (0.521, 95% CI 0.322, 0.843). MRI endpoints  were  overall  similar  between  Plegridy  and  Avonex,  with  slightly  higher  proportion  of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions or MRI activity in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex on week 48. Changes in EDSS scores were minimal.

Most adverse events occurred in similar rate in both treatment groups. Treatment-related adverse events with largest between-group difference were injection site erythema, which occurred more commonly in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex (33.3% vs. 7.8%). This may be due to different route of administration of the products (SC vs. IM). Overall, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported for Plegridy in the paediatric population are in line with those reported in adults.

Serious adverse events occurred in 13.2% of subjects, and apart from multiple sclerosis relapse occurred only in ≤2 patients per PT.

The known effects of Plegridy on hematology and blood chemistry in adults were observed also in the current study in children. A total of 2.7% of patients in the Plegridy group tested positive for neutralizing IFNβ -1a antibodies without apparent impact on efficacy or safety.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH has not submitted a clinical overview to discuss the observed efficacy and safety profile of Plegridy in paediatric patients based on data available so far, the possible impact to the B/R of Plegridy or proposed any regulatory actions.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted an interim report of ongoing open-label study 105MS306 in paediatric patients 10 to ≤ 18 years of age with RRMS. In this study, peginterferon beta -1a (Plegridy) or interferon beta-1a (Avonex) are administered to patients for a total duration of 192 weeks. The interim report covers the study period through week 48 (Part 1a) which is currently completed, and the available data up to week 96 (Part 1b) up to the data cut-off on 24 August 2024.

The MAH has not provided a critical discussion on the data submitted or a discussion on whether the submitted data have any regulatory consequences.

In terms of efficacy, the primary endpoint ARR at week 48 was lower in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex. MRI efficacy results were in general similar in both Plegridy and Avonex groups.

Treatment-related adverse events in paediatric patients in general seem to be in line with those reported in adults. Serious adverse events apart from multiple sclerosis relapse were rare.

Considering that there is no paediatric information included in the SmPC at the moment and that the interim report completes the requirement of the PIP and provides efficacy and safety data for a period of ~1 year of treatment, including the primary endpoint at week 48, the MAH was requested to provide a critical review of paediatric data available so far, the observed efficacy and safety profile (including comparisons to adult data in particular in terms of safety) and to justify why an SmPC variation is not required at this point (e.g. to include data in SmPC section 5.1). The MAH declared that they intend to submit  a  labelling  update,  including  a  critical  review  of  the  observed  efficacy  and  safety  profile,  as requested, in a separate Type II variation. This is acceptable, provided that this variation is submitted within 60 days after adoption of the CHMP conclusion.

Fulfilled : In view of the available data regarding efficacy and safety data in paediatric population, the MAH should submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The MAH has agreed on this. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

## 4. Request for supplementary information

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

1. Considering that there is no paediatric information included in the SmPC at the moment and that the interim report completes the requirement of the PIP and provides efficacy and safety data for a period of ~1 year of treatment, including the primary endpoint at week 48, the MAH is requested to provide a critical review of paediatric data available so far, the observed efficacy and safety profile (including comparisons to adult data in particular in terms of safety) and to justify why an SmPC variation is not required at this point (e.g. to include data in SmPC section 5.1).

The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clockstop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

The MAH acknowledges rapporteur's comment and intends to submit the labelling updates based on the data  from  CHARGE  study  in  a  separate  Type  II  variation  in  quarter  3  (Q3)  of  2025.  The  currently submitted interim CSR for the CHARGE study (105MS306) provides a review of the available paediatric data,  including  descriptive  efficacy  in  section  11,  and  safety  in  section  12.  A  critical  review  of  the observed efficacy and safety profile (including comparisons to adult data in particular in terms of safety) will be provided in the planned Type II submission in support of the label update.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH was requested to provide a critical review of paediatric data available so far, and justify why an SmPC variation is not required at this point.

The MAH declared that they intend to submit a labelling update in a separate Type II variation in Q3 2025; and that a critical review of the observed efficacy and safety profile (including comparisons to adult data, in particular in terms of safety) will be provided within this variation procedure.

This approach is accepted, provided that the variation is submitted within 60 days after adoption of the CHMP conclusion.
