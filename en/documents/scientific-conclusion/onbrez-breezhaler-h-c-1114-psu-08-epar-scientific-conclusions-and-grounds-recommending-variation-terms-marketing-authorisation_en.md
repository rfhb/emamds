## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Onbrez Breezhaler, Oslif Breezhaler and Hirobriz Breezhaler, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Intubation,  hospitalisation  and  death  due  to  asthma  related  events  related  to  use  in  the  asthma population is considered an important potential risk for indacaterol since it is a known class effect for long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists when used in asthma. No information is currently included in the SmPC  for  indacaterol  for  this  risk.  Indacaterol  is  only  indicated  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which distinguishes its use from that of other, established Long-Acting Beta- Agonists (LABA) which also have approved asthma indications. However some information regarding this risk should be included in the product information for indacaterol. Furthermore, it is relevant to state in the SmPC that the risk has been observed with LABAs when used for the treatment of asthma. Therefore, in  view  of  available  data,  the  PRAC  considers  that  inclusion  of  this  information  to  the  product information is warranted.

Long-acting  beta  agonist  agents  are  known  to  potentially  affect  QTc  intervals.  Available  data  for indacaterol do not demonstrate a relevant effect of QT prolongation from a dedicated QT-study during development  or  from  clinical  trials  in  COPD  (although  patients  with  a  medical  history  of  long  QT syndrome or long QT interval at baseline were excluded). Post-marketing reports for QT prolongation have  been  evaluated  in  the  PSURs  and  have  not  reveal  data  indicating  a  causal  relationship  with indacaterol so far. Therefore, in view of the available data, the PRAC considers that changes to the product  information  were  warranted  to  better  reflect  the  current  evidence  for  QT-prolongation  with indacaterol.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisations

On  the  basis  of  the  scientific  conclusions  for  Onbrez  Breezhaler,  Oslif  Breezhaler  and  Hirobriz Breezhaler  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  products containing  the  active  substance  indacaterol  is  favourable  subject  to  the  proposed  changes  to  the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.
