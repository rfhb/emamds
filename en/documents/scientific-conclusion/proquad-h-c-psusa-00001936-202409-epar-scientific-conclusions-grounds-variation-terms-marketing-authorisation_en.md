<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for measles / mumps / rubella / varicella vaccines (live), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on the literature regarding congenital rubella syndrome in pregnancy, the PRAC concluded that the product information of ProQuad (measles / mumps / rubella / varicella vaccines (live)) should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for measles / mumps / rubella / varicella vaccines (live) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing measles / mumps / rubella / varicella vaccines (live) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
