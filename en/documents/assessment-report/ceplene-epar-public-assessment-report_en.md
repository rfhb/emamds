## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML)  is  a  heterogeneous  haematological  malignancy  characterised  by abnormal proliferation of immature haematopoietic progenitor cells of the myeloid lineage. Diagnosis is made by morphologic examination of and immunophenotyping of myeloid progenitor cells from the bone marrow. The complete blood count (CBC) is almost always abnormal and often, leucocytosis, anaemia and thrombocytopenia are present. Current standard treatment includes chemotherapy with or without a bone marrow transplant.

The  standard  treatment of AML  in  adults  typically is divided into 2 phases: induction  and intensification. Induction treatment uses a combination of anthracyclines (most commonly daunomycin) and high dose cytarabine, with or without 6-thioguianine. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks until complete remission (CR), defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as including all of the following:

- peripheral-blood counts rising toward normal,
- a mildly hypocellular to normal cellular marrow with fewer than 5% blasts,
- no clinical signs or symptoms of the disease, including in the central nervous system (CNS) or at other extramedullary sites.

Complete remission may be achieved in 70-80% of the approximately 30,000 newly diagnosed AML patients worldwide. After induction chemotherapy, intensification (or consolidation) therapy (eradicate  any  microscopic  amounts  of  leukaemia)  can  be  initiated.  Many  patients,  especially  those younger than 60 years at the time of diagnosis and those with favourable cytogenetic patterns, may also  receive  consolidation  therapies  (generally,  1  or  2 courses),  including  high-dose  cytarabine (HDAC) and/or with other chemotherapy (daunomycin) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, the majority of AML patients (75-80%) in their first CR, who cannot be allotransplanted, will relapse after median remission duration of approximately 1 year. Where allogeneic transplantation is not an option, there is no expert clinical consensus regarding effective therapy for the maintenance of remission beyond the completion of consolidation chemotherapy. As a result, the standard of care for such AML patients in remission is no treatment.

Induction of remission and long-term survival are still major challenges in the care of patients with AML.  The  survival outcome after a leukaemic relapse is poor; thus, more than 80%  of non-transplanted AML patients will die within 2 years after onset of relapse. Overall, about 20-30% of people  survive  free  of  disease  at  5  years  from  diagnosis;  most  relapses  occur  within  2  years  of diagnosis.  If  a  patient  survives  induction  and  consolidation  chemotherapy  then  the  length  of  that patient's first remission is considered the primary prognostic indicator for the length of survival.

Novel  therapeutic  strategies  to  maintain  CR  in  AML  are  needed  because  leukaemic  relapse  is synonymous  with limited long-term survival. Currently, there is no recognised strategy or pharmacological  intervention  to  prevent  AML  relapse  and  for  this  reason  the  concept  of  relapse prevention using the combination of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) and histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) is of considerable scientific and therapeutic interest.

Histamine dihydrochloride is a synthetic immune modulator. The rationale for its use in combination with IL-2 in maintenance of first remission in adult patients with AML is based on its putative novel mechanism of  action  in  which  HDC  is  thought  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  cytokine,  IL-2. Activation of IL-2 receptor bearing lymphocytes NK and T-lymphocytes to kill tumour cells is the principal goal of IL-2 and IFNα therapy.

The therapeutic effect of histamine dihydrochloride is exerted by its effect on monocytes. Histamine dihydrochloride inhibits the function of a key enzyme in oxygen radical formation, NADPH oxidase,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reducing the detrimental effects of oxidative stress  on  NK and T-cells thereby preserving their cell cytotoxic activity against tumour cells. Histamine is involved in local immune responses, regulation of gastric  HCL  secretion  and  the  allergic  response.  Based  on  its  known  biological  effects,  histamine administered subcutaneously is expected to produce vasodilation (manifested as flushing), hypotension  and  a  corresponding  increased  heart  rate,  increased  gastric  acid  secretion  and  local injection site reactions.

Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride) solution for injection is classified as an immune modulator (ATC code:  L03A  X14).  It  is  used  in  conjunction  with  recombinant  IL-2.  The  proposed  indication  is 'administered in conjunction with interleukin-2, maintenance of remission in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission to prolong the duration of leukaemia free survival'. In some EU countries, recombinant IL-2 is approved for use in renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Ceplene contains histamine dihydrochloride as the active substance and it is presented as a solution for injection for subcutaneous use. Each vial contains 0.5 ml of the solution of histamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 1mg/ml.

Other  ingredients  include  sodium  chloride,  hydrochloric  acid  or  sodium  hydroxide  and  water  for injections.  All  excipients  used  in  the  product  are  of  non-animal  origin  and  comply  with  their corresponding European Pharmacopoeia monographs.

The immediate packaging materials are commonly used for these types of formulations and consist of Type  I  Ph.Eur.  clear,  colourless  glass  vials  sealed  with  bromobutyl  rubber  stoppers  and  flip-off aluminium seals

## Active Substance

Histamine  dihydrochloride  (C5H9N3  .  2HCl)  is  a  well-characterised  molecule  for  which  a  Ph.  Eur. Monograph exists. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder, very water-soluble, but less soluble in ethanol. It has a pKa of 6.12 and 9.85 and is moderately hygroscopic. Histamine dihydrochloride does not contain any optically active centres or isomerable double bonds and exhibits only one polymorphic form.

The proof of chemical structure was achieved by elemental analysis; analysis of the electron ionisation mass  spectrum, 1 H-NMR  and 13 C-NMR  spectra,  IR  and  UV  spectra,  while  X-Ray  diffraction confirmed that histamine dihydrochloride is a highly crystalline powder.

## · Manufacture

Histamine  dihydrochloride  is  produced  by  a  proprietary  process  and  purification  steps  to  achieve histamine dihydrochloride of satisfactory quality.

The  impurity  profile  of  histamine  dihydrochloride  has  been  extensively  investigated  and  meets  the ICH requirements. All potential impurities have been identified and characterised. All solvents used in the manufacture of the active substance are controlled in compliance with ICH guidelines.

- Specification

The  active  substance  meets  the  specification  in  the  current  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  for  histamine dihydrochloride.    The  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification,  assay  (HPLC), impurities  (HPLC, TLC, GC), water content, loss on drying, solubility. Whilst meeting the Ph.Eur. monograph for histamine dihydrochloride, other physico-chemical methods to characterise and control the quality of the active substance have also been established.

The analytical methods employed are either pharmacopoeial or have been adequately validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Batch analysis data have been provided for 10 batches of histamine hydrochloride, the 4 more recent manufactured by the method intended for commercial manufacturing. Earlier batches did not meet the Ph. Eur. requirements for appearance and clarity and as a result the purification process was modified. In all other cases the results comply with the proposed specifications.

- Stability

Stability studies were conducted according to the ICH requirements on three registration batches of histamine  dihydrochloride  using  the  commercial  manufacturing  process.  Samples  were  stored  at 40°C°C/75%RH , 25°C/60% RH, and 30°C /60% ..

The  parameters  tested  were  appearance,  assay,  chromatographic  impurities,  colour  and  clarity,  pH, water content, microbial limit and endotoxins. The analytical methods used were the same as those used for routine testing and have been shown to be stability indicating.

The stability data demonstrate that histamine dihydrochloride is very stable with values of known and unknown substances often below the limit of quantitation.

Stability  studies  were  also  carried  out  at  5 ° C.  In  addition,  photostability  studies  under  conditions, which were in compliance with the ICH Q1B guidance, were conducted on one batch of histamine dihydrochloride.  The  studies  showed  no  significant  differences  between  exposed  materials  and controls, therefore it can be concluded that the bulk histamine dihydrochloride does not require any special precautions to protect from light during storage.

Freeze/thaw  testing  confirmed  that  the  drug  substance  did  not  degrade  when  exposed  to  extreme temperature fluctuations as may be encountered during shipping.

## Medicinal Product

- Pharmaceutical development

Ceplene is  an  immunomodulator  that  is  administered  subcutaneously  as  an  adjunct  to  Interleukin-2 therapy  and  is  available  in  single/unit  dose  vials.  The  product  is  designed  for  self-subcutaneous administration by the patient. No diluent is required.

Pre-formulation  studies  were  carried  out  with  histamine  dihydrochloride  dissolved  in  saline.  The content of histamine dihydrochloride is based on findings of pre-clinical work. As the drug product is an  aqueous  solution  of  the  active  ingredient  there  are  no  physiochemical  or  biological  properties relevant to the performance of the finished product. The formulation is simple, with sodium chloride to provide an isotonic solution, and water for injections as the solvent. The product is formulated to maintain pH in the range necessary for optimal stability. The formulation has been shown to be stable and to withstand autoclaving. The manufacturing process is standard for this type of formulation.

Originally the product was developed to be filled in vials containing 1.2 ml of the Ceplene solution corresponding  to  2  doses,  which  were  to  be  used  within  12  hours  of  each  other.  In  response  to questions raised during the evaluation about the choice of the presentation the applicant reduced the fill  volume  of  the  vial  to  be  equivalent  to  that  of  a  single  dose  i.e.0.5  ml  (with  required  overfill). Although single dose preparations are typically presented  in  ampoules,  this  is  acceptable  since  this product will be self-administered in a home environment, and a vial is obviously more user friendly than an ampoule.

Compatibility  studies  monitoring  the  level  of  extractables  from  process  equipment  have  been performed  and  a  maximum  holding  time  of  the  solution  prior  to  filling  has  been  established.  The integrity of the container closure system has been evaluated using a challenge study with a microbial bath ( S.  Marcescens ).  The  stoppers  used  in  the  finished  product  have  been  evaluated  for  extraction characteristics in accordance with the Ph. Eur. (Type I Elastomeric Closures) and the results indicate compliance with the Ph. Eur. requirements.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical trials were undertaken using the proposed marketing formulation.

- Manufacture of the product

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described  and  all  critical  process  parameters  have been  identified  and  suitable  in-process  controls  have  been  implemented  to  monitor  the  active substance dispensing, bulk solution compounding, filtering, filling, sealing, terminal sterilisation and inspection  of  the  filled  vials.  Batch  analysis  data  demonstrate  that  the  process  is  reproducible  and provides a drug product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications.

## · Product specification

Specifications for the finished product at release and shelf life have been established. The specification includes tests for appearance, identification (HPLC), assay (HPLC), pH, impurities (HPLC), volume in container (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and particulate matter. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Batch analysis data have been presented. All batches met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of batch release.

## · Stability of the product

Stability studies were conducted on drug product batches according to ICH guidelines Samples were stored at 5ºC, 25ºC/60% RH and 30ºC/60% RH and six months at 40ºC/75% RH.

Supplementary stability studies were also conducted to assess photostability and syringe stability. A shipping  stress  study  has  also  been  performed.  In  addition  stability  studies  used  to  support  early clinical  development  have  been  conducted  on  five  lots  of  Ceplene  at  25ºC/60%  RH  and  have  been provided supporting data.

The analytical methods used to assess stability have been validated as stability indicating or are compendial in nature. In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product, as defined in the SPC

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of Ceplene is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements.

The active substance is well characterised and documented. The formulation is based on an  aqueous solution.  The  excipients  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard process that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Histamine is a pleiotropic endogenous biologically active amine that is widely distributed in the body and acts on multiple organ systems. Histamine is a mediator of immune and inflammatory reactions. Histamine  is  formed  de  novo  during  decarboxylation  of  histidine  by  histidine  decarboxylase (histamine  forming  capacity  or  HFC)  and  is  stored  in  the  cytoplasmic  granules  of  mast  cells  and basophils. Histamine synthesis, storage and release from endogenous pools are influenced by a variety of conditions including stress, circadian rhythms, drugs and allergens.

Endogenous histamine acts on a large variety of different cell types including smooth muscle, neurons, endocrine  and  exocrine  cells,  blood  cells  and  cells  of  the  immune  system.  Histamine  covers  its multiple biological actions via one of several receptors including H1, H2 and H3 and most recently, H4

receptors.  The  receptors  have  been  detected  in  mammalian  brain,  respiratory  tract,  genito-urinary system and vascular system, as well as on several types of leukocytes and haematopoietic cells. The principal receptors throughout the body are the H1 and H2 receptors.

- H1 -- smooth muscle contraction (most muscle other than that of blood vessels), vasodilatation and vascular permeability increase
- H2 -- leukocyte function, gastric parietal cell and cardiac stimulation
- H3 -- neurotransmitter in central nervous system (CNS) histaminergic nerve endings (also present in other parts of the body)
- H4 -- haematopoietic and immunocompetent cells (most recently discovered)

The mechanism whereby HDC exerts an anti-tumour effect is unknown but has been cited in literature since the 1970s. In combination with IL-2, it is thought that histamine acts as an immunomodulatory agent  by  binding  to  H2 receptors  on  phagocytes,  preventing  the  release  of  reactive  oxygen  species (ROS) and protecting natural NK  function. This in turn would enhance the activity of immunotherapeutic cytokines like IL-2 by protecting effector immune cells from oxidative damage. The effect is thought to be mediated by both H1 and H2 type receptors.

## In vitro effects

In  an in vitro study  blasts  recovered  from  peripheral  blood  of  patients  with  AML  were  lysed  by heterologous NK cells treated with IL-2, an NK cell activating cytokine (3, 4). The cytokine-induced killing  of  AML  blasts  was  inhibited  by  monocytes  recovered  from  peripheral  blood.  Histamine,  at concentrations exceeding 0.1 µM, abolished the monocyte-induced inhibition of NK cells. The effect of histamine was completely blocked by the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, ranitidine. Catalase, a scavenger  of  ROS,  reversed  the  monocyte-inducted  inhibition  of  NK cell-mediated  killing  of  blast cells, indicating the inhibitory signal was mediated by products of the respiratory burst of monocytes.

## Monotherapy

The effect of histamine on NK cell function was evaluated by Hellstrand (10) using an in vivo mouse model assay developed by Hanna and Fidler (17). In this model, mice were injected with histamine, ranitidine  or  a  control  solution.  Twenty-four  hours  later  they  were  injected  i.v.  with 51 Cr-labeled YAC-1 lymphoma cells which form tumour emboli in the lungs and which are extremely sensitive to lysis  by  NK  cells.  Four  hours  after  the  YAC-1  injection  the  animals  were  sacrificed  and  the radioactivity present in their lungs was measured. The levels of radioactivity in lungs has been shown to be inversely proportional to NK cell function in that the greater the lysis by NK cells of the target YAC-1 cells the less radioactivity is shown in the lungs.

Hellstrand et al. showed that histamine treatment reduced the amount of lung radioactivity by up to 2/3 when compared to the control group. On the other hand, treatment with the H2 antagonist, ranitidine, resulted  in  a  tripling  of  the  level  of  radioactivity.  This  suggests  that  histamine  increased  the effectiveness of NK cells in killing YAC-1 cell tumour emboli by preventing NK cell suppression by ROS. The inhibition of this effect by blockade of H2 receptors reduced NK cell lysis of YAC-1 cells by up to two thirds indicating that the effect is mediated through H2 receptors.

The effect of histamine and H2 receptor involvement in this effect on NK sensitive cells was replicated by Asea (11) as indicated in the table above. Effects were shown to be most effective when histamine was  administered  2-6  hours  prior  to  cell  inoculation,  whereas  administration  5  minutes  prior  to inoculation made no difference to tumour growth.

## Combination therapy with IL-2

The combined treatment with histamine in synergy with IL-2 effectively protected mice against B16 melanoma  lung  metastases.  IL-2  only  weakly  activates  NK cells  or  T cells  in  an  environment  of oxidative  stress.  By  inhibiting  ROS  production,  histamine  protects  NK cells  and  T cells  from down-regulation and apoptosis and thus markedly improves the IL-2-induced activation of T cells and NK cells in tumours (Table 2).

AML  is  not  able  to  be  fully  represented  by  animal  models  and  therefore  support  for  the  use  of histamine and IL-2 in this disease comes mainly from in vitro studies.

Below is listed the findings regarding cimetidine on tumour growth in animals and humans:

- -enhance the growth and metastases of Lewis lung cancer in mice (21)
- -slow metastatic development and prolong survival in mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma (22)
- -in a murine B cell leukaemia model it did not have an effect on BCL1 tumour cell growth (16)
- -cimetidine treatment of patients with gastric cancer has resulted in increased survival rates (23)
- -mice receiving cimetidine (100 to 200 mg/kg in drinking water) were partially protected against a lethal inoculum of EL-4 lymphoma cells (24)
- -cimetidine (100 mg/kg in drinking water) reversed the tumour growth enhancement in mice (25)
- -demonstrated that whereas cimetidine suppresses the formation of B16 melanoma metastases in mice at a high dose (100 mg/kg), cimetidine and other H2 receptor antagonists instead aggravate melanoma metastasis at lower doses (25 to 50 mg/kg) (10)
- -significantly increased the incidence of chemically induced intestinal tumours in rats (26)
- -long-term exposure (19 mg/mg) increases the frequency of spontaneous lymphoid neoplasms and potentiates chemical carcinogenesis in mice (27)

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Histamine has proliferative effects on human and murine cells in vitro . Tilly and others (1) examined several human and murine cell lines and reported that histamine at a single concentration of 0.1 mM enhanced the in vitro growth of 3 cell lines (HeLa carcinoma cells, A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and  A875 melanoma  cells)  (2).  This  effect  was  apparently  mediated  by  H1 receptors,  since  the histamine-induced growth was inhibited by the H1 antagonist, pyrilamine and not the H2 antagonist, cimetidine. There is no evidence that this is predictive of effects of histamine in vivo .

The  stimulation  of  histamine  release  or  the  administration  of  exogenous  histamine  may  produce  a multitude  of  physiological  responses  including  allergic  reactions  and  anaphylaxis,  vasodilation  and vasoconstriction,  gastric  acid  secretion  and  neurotransmission.  A  brief  summary  of  the  response  of multiple  organ  systems  to  histamine  exposure  in  various  species,  including  humans,  is  provided  in Table 3.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Histamine acts on multiple organ systems with the cardiovascular response being a major dose-limiting pharmacodynamic effect. For this reason, safety pharmacology studies were performed to evaluate the cardiovascular profile of histamine in the dog ( Study 82-0016 ) and an in vitro hERG assay ( Study sph03-037 ).

## In vitro hERG assay ( Study sph03-037 )

The assay evaluated the potential for HDC and its major metabolites, imidazole-4-acetic acid (IAA) and N-methyl histamine (NMH) to inhibit a hERG encoded channel tail current. The effects of 10 µM of  HDC,  IAA  and  NMH  were  investigated  after  exposure  of  hERG  assay  using  100 nM  E-4031 (a class III antiarrhythmic agent) as positive control. There was no statistically significant difference between  the  vehicle-  and  test  article-treated  groups,  while  a  substantial  tail  current  reduction  was observed  with  E-4031.  Based  on  these  results,  there  was  no  evidence  that  HDC  and  its  major metabolites inhibit hERG current in vitro .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Acute cardiovascular response in dog ( Study 82-0016 )

HDC was administered as a 10-minute s.c. infusion of 0.015 or 0.15 mg/kg (0.15 mg/kg approximately 20-fold a clinical single dose) to anaesthetised male dogs (n = 3). Blood sampling was made pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours following start of infusion. ECG (8 leads) were obtained pre-dose, at 15 and 30 minutes and at 30-minute intervals up to 4 hours after start of infusion. Mortality, clinical signs and gross pathology were also evaluated.

No treatment-related adverse clinical signs or gross pathology findings were observed. The death of one animal at 0.15 mg/kg was judged as related to pre-existing hypoxia (results of pre-dose blood gas analysis)  and  the  animal  was  replaced.  No  other  treatment-related  ECG  or  blood  gas  changes  were observed.  At  0.015 mg/kg,  no  treatment-related  changes  were  observed.  At  0.15 mg/kg,  most haemodynamic parameters, including effects on heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures (systemic, pulmonary),  left  ventricular  systemic  pressure,  ventricular  contraction/relaxation  and  cardiac  output and  stroke  volume,  were  minimally  to  moderately  affected.  Most  of  these  parameters  returned  to baseline levels.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Various  functional  classes  of  drugs  have  the  potential  to  interact  with  histamine:  compounds  that inhibit histamine metabolism pathways (e.g., anti-malarial and anti-trypanosomal agents, neuromuscular  blocking  agents),  release  endogenous  histamine  (include  a  variety  of  drugs),  act  as histamine antagonists (e.g., in treatment of gastric peptic ulcers, various anti-depressants) and/or act as cardiotonic agents (e.g., ouabain, digitalis).

The study ( Study 82-0039 ) was designed to investigate whether histamine exacerbates the IL-2-induced pulmonary capillary leakage. Male rats (10/sex/group) were administered subcutaneously  with  IL-2  and  HDC  in  saline  twice  daily  during  4 days  and  only  one  dose  on  the 5 th day, as follows:

| -   | Group #1   | Control (saline)   | -                                                         |
|-----|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| -   | Group #2   | Control (dextrose) | -                                                         |
| -   | Group #3   | IL-2 (low)         | 0.25 MIU/kg (to produce minimal to moderate toxic effect) |
| -   | Group #4   | IL-2 (high)        | 2.5 MIU/kg (to produce a moderate to severe toxic effect) |
| -   | Group #5   | HDC                | 100 mg/kg                                                 |
| -   | Group #6   | IL-2 (low)/HDC     | 0.25 MIU/kg/100 mg/kg                                     |
| -   | Group #7   | IL-2 (high)/HDC    | 2.5 MIU/kg/100 mg/kg                                      |
| -   | Group #8   | HDC/IL-2 (high)    | 100 mg/kg/2.5 MIU/kg                                      |

In each group 5 animals per sex were sacrificed at Day 5 to determine total fluid volume of the organs with no further pathology and the remaining at Day 6 for a complete histopathology performed.

No  mortality  occurred.  Clinical  signs  of  IL-2-induced  vascular  leak  syndrome  were  observed  in  a dose-related fashion. Neither IL-2, HDC nor the combination of HDC plus IL-2 had any effects on body  weights,  haematology,  urinalysis  or  clinical  chemistry.  Administration  of  both  doses  of  IL-2 alone produced histological findings (vasculitis of lungs, liver bile duct hyperplasia and inflammation of  injection  site  andiatic  nerve).  The  combination  of  IL-2  and  histamine  gave  similar  histological effects.  Female  spleen-weight  data  suggested  that  the  combination  treatment  might  enhance  the (high-dose) IL-2 effect of spleen total fluid volume. On the contrary, in males, by adding histamine, a significantly lower high-dose IL-2 effect on lung, spleen and liver total fluid volumes was observed. Thus, IL-2 alone induced a dose-related vascular leakage. The extent of the capillary leakage was not aggravated, but rather tended to decrease by addition of histamine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Methods of analysis

In  all  pharmaco-  and  toxicokinetic  studies  performed  by  the  applicant,  determination  of  plasma histamine levels was performed using commercially available ELISA (Immunotech) for rat, dog and rabbit and RIA (Immunotech) for monkey without subtraction of endogenous plasma histamine since none of the assays distinguish between exogenous and endogenous levels.

Rat  and  rabbit  plasma  histamine  were  tested  linear  in  the  250-8.000 nM  range,  while  dog  plasma histamine was tested linear between 25-800 nM. Inter-assay precision and intra-assay precision were below 18.5% CV within predefined limits with one exception.

Monkey,  but  not  apparently  rat,  rabbit  and  dog  plasma  histamine  was  highly  unstable  in  room temperature, but also after frozen storage. The stability was somewhat improved by the addition of aminoguanidine (diamine oxidase inhibitor).

## · Absorption

Endogenous levels of histamine were measured in various species with the highest levels found in the rat and the lowest in dogs and humans. The rabbit showed the greatest intra-individual variability in their endogenous plasma levels (Table 4). Higher levels of histamine were found in pregnant rats as also described in the literature.

a AUC(0.83-1h)

b Death of 4/5 rabbits - figures considered as estimates only

Toxicokinetic data from a 28-day study ( Study 82-0008PK ) shows that the Cmax values were variable but  did  increase  proportionally  from  between  5  and  100 mg/kg  on  Day  28.  Female  animals  were generally less exposed than male animals. Tmax typically occurred within 0.1 to 0.3 hour, while t½ was longer at the highest dose (100 mg/kg;  about  1 hour). Baseline Cmax levels  were  between 400-1,500 nM and AUC values at 0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg increased only slightly with dose; likely due to the high endogenous histamine levels.

Both  Cmax  and  AUC  were  dose-proportional  between  the  5  and  50  mg/kg  in  rabbits,  even  though plasma  concentrations  showed  a  high  variability.  This  was  probably  due  to  the  variable  and  high endogenous plasma levels of histamine in this species (baseline ~ 500 ± 500 nM).

Mean  Cmax  at  the  higher  doses  were  less  than  dose  proportional  in  dogs.  With  increased  dose, t½ increased.  AUC  values  were  slightly  greater  than  proportional  to  dose.  Only  female  dogs  were evaluated.  However  according  to  results  of Study 82-0105PK ,  female  dogs  were  somewhat  higher exposed than  male  animals  at  the  higher  dose  level  (0.75  mg/kg).  Clearance  (Cl/F)  decreased  with increasing dose.

No pharmacokinetic  parameters  could  be  calculated  for  0.05  mg/kg  dose  since  most  of  the  plasma concentration values were below the limit of quantification (25.0 nmol/l).

- Distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In mammalian tissues, endogenous histamine is present in all tissues in varying amounts ranging from less than 1 to over 100 μ g/g. The distribution of exogenous histamine was determined in male rats in Study 82-0119 (non-GLP) and in a study performed by Rizell et al (13).

## Study 82-0119

Intra-duodenal  administration  resulted  in  a  rapid  systemic  absorption  of  radioactivity  (plasma  and tissue tmax ~1h). Blood-to-plasma radioactivity ratios increased with time from 0.8 to 1.23, suggestive of  binding  to  blood  components.  Mean tissue-plasma concentration ratios were similar between the 2 doses and remained relatively constant over time. The highest radioactivity concentrations relative to plasma were found in tissues associated with excretion with levels up to 130 μ g-Eq./g (i.e., kidney, urinary bladder, liver and colon). The lowest levels were detected in the brain.

## Rizell et al. 2002b (13)

In this study, histamine concentrations were measured in interstitial fluid collected from normal and malignant tissues by microdialysis using a RIA assay ( 3 H-histamine) following a single i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg. The highest radioactivity (Cmax and AUC) was found in plasma, liver and in liver tumour while the levels in subcutis and subcutis tumour were lower.

There is no information on the distribution to the foetus.

## · Metabolism

Histamine metabolism is well documented in the literature (29). Histamine is mainly metabolised by oxidation  by  diamine  oxidase  (DAO)  or  histaminase  and  ring  methylation  by  histamine  N-methyl transferase  (HMT)  and  there  is  an  extensive  first  pass  metabolism.  The  metabolising  enzymes  are conserved between species, but show variations in tissue distribution.

Oxidation  by  DAO  is  the  preferential  pathways  of  renal  histamine  catabolism  in  several  species including dogs and humans. In this pathway, the biologically active IAA, which is a chemo-attractant for  leucocytes  and  an  inhibitor  of  histamine  release  from  leukocytes,  is  formed.  At  high  doses ( ≥ 50 mg/kg) IAA possesses analgesic and narcotic activities. This oxidative activity seems however low in rabbit and mouse kidney. Elevated DAO activity has been reported in the pregnant mouse, rat and hamster and there are high placental levels of DAO, especially in man and rat.

The kidney is rich also in HMT. In the rat and guinea pig, deamination is the dominant route while in humans, as well as in the mouse, cat and dog, ring methylation appears to be the major pathway. In the rabbit and guinea pig, both routes appear to be important.

One or both of the enzymes have also been found in the intestine, stomach, liver, lungs and heart in various species. In humans, DAO is primarily located in the small intestinal mucosa, placenta, liver, skin,  kidney,  thymus  and  granulocytes  whereas  the  HMT  activity  has  been  detected  in  the  small intestine, liver, kidney and monocytes.

## · Excretion

Histamine and its various metabolites have been identified in the urine of various mammals including man. Only a small fraction of histamine is excreted unchanged (30, 31).

After  subcutaneous  injection  of 14 C-histamine  to  male  dogs,  urinary  N-methyl  imidazole  acetic (NMIA)  acid  was  predominating,  followed  by  IAA  and  N τ -methylhistamine  (NHM).  Only  in  this species, no unchanged histamine was detected in the urine. In humans, besides a significant proportion of IAA riboside (~20%) and small amounts of unchanged histamine (2-3%), the ratio of histamine and metabolites in the urine in humans after intra-dermal administration was similar in humans as in dogs. After  infusion,  excretion  by  the  renal  route  was  85-95%  with  methyl  imidazole  acetic  acid  as  the major urinary metabolite. Less than 10% was excreted as free histamine.

Sex  differences  were  prominent  in  renal  histamine  metabolism.  In  the  mouse,  the  kidney  (and stomach) of females had a higher histamine-forming capacity (by action of histamine decarboxylase)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared  to  males.  The  females  also  excrete  more  histamine  than  the  males,  but  there  is  a  great individual variation (32).

In Study 82-0119 , mass balance parameters for a single dose of histamine were determined as shown in Table 5.

Table 5 Study 82-0119 - Mass balance parameter after single administration

| Species   | n Dose (mg/kg)   | Route         | Anal.   | Urine (% dose)   | Faeces (% dose)   | Recovery (% dose)   |   Time (h) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Rat       | 3 10             | intraduodenal | LSC     | 48±5             | 31±15             | 84±15               |         24 |
|           | 3 100            | intraduodenal | LSC     | 54.3±2.6         | 32.4±0.9          | 93.1±1.2            |         24 |

After 24 hours, the total recovery was 84 and 93% in the 10 and 100 mg/kg dose groups respectively. There were no major differences between the doses.

During  pregnancy,  urinary  excretion  of  histamine  is  increased  in  rodents.  During  the  last  third  of pregnancy, the rat produces large amounts of histamine as indicated by its secretion in urine (33). The mouse sometimes produces 100 times the pre-pregnant value (34). No such differences were reported regarding the pregnant rabbit. There is no information on whether histamine is excreted in breast milk.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

Two in vitro studies showed that histamine and its major metabolites (IAA, NMH) did not show any important effects on induction on ( Study XT033017 ) or inhibition ( Study XT035014 ) of the CYP450 expression in cultured human hepatocytes.

## Toxicology

The applicant has documented the safety profile of HDC alone in studies of single and repeat dose toxicity,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity,  genotoxicity  and  local  tolerance.  Subcutaneous administration was generally used. The dog, rat and rabbit were the main species. The dog is similar with human in terms of metabolic pathways as well as having low endogenous histamine levels and is thus considered to be a relevant species for human safety assessment. The rat has substantially higher endogenous histamine levels and it also tolerated much higher doses than the dog.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  of  HDC  was  studied  in  rats  (non-GLP  studies  only),  dogs  and  rabbits.  In  all species, expected histamine related effects were observed. In rats, one 'acute' maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  of  2,000  mg/kg  (death  within  48  hours,  Cmax  1,000-fold,  AUC  &gt;  500-fold  the  respective clinical exposure) and one 'delayed' MTD of 1,000 mg/kg (severe tissue necrosis at the injection site several weeks after administration, 25,000 times a proposed clinical single dose) were established. The highest non-lethal dose was 5 mg/kg in rabbits (Cmax, AUC about 100-fold the clinical exposure). The NOAEL in this species was 0.5 mg/kg, with Cmax and AUC 18- and 230-fold the clinical exposure after 1 mg. Dogs were most susceptible to histamine, where a 10-minute s.c. injection of 16.7 μ g/kg (100 μ g/kg/h) caused an increased heart rate, while &lt; 80 μ g/kg/h was without effect. In another dog study  (non GLP),  clinical  signs  occurred  at  1.5  mg/kg,  at  Cmax  and  AUC  20-30-fold  the  clinical exposure at 1 mg/day.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies were undertaken in rats (up to 100 mg/kg bid for 6 months) and  dogs  (up  to  0.5  mg/kg  bid  for  12 months).  Histamine-related  clinical  signs  occurred  in  both species (in rats: skin discoloration, warm to touch, injection site alopecia, dermal irritation, injection site  reactions,  in  dogs:  decreased  activity,  redness  of  ear,  eyes,  muzzle,  skin,  swelling  of  head, salivation, lacrimation and blood shot eyes). There were certain treatment-related changes of clinical chemistry and haematology parameters and in organ weights (in rats: increased adrenal, heart, liver and lungs at 200 mg/kg/day, in dogs: increased adrenals, reduced thymus and spleen at 1 mg/kg/day). However, there were no histopathological correlates. These changes were reversed after recovery in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both species. Thus, expected histamine related effects were observed, while there was no unexpected toxicity. In rats, the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg bid for 6 months, resulted 50-60-fold the Cmax and AUC the clinical exposure at 1 mg/day. In dogs, the NOEL was 0.05 mg/kg bid for 12 months, resulted in Cmax and  AUC in  the  clinical  dose  range  while  toxicity  (mainly  clinical  signs)  was  seen  at  4-5-fold  the exposure.

Table 6 shows comparative systemic plasma exposure to histamine following s.c. administration of HDC in  the  rats,  rabbits,  dogs,  healthy  human  volunteers  (1  mg  s.c.)  and  patients  with  metastatic melanoma.

## · Immunotoxicity

Effects of histamine on immune function (35-37) are:

- -Affects function of various cells including eosinophils, neutrophils, T lymphocytes and suppressor T cells
- -Down-regulates several immunological functions through its interactions with H2 receptors.
- -Inhibits the further release of histamine from mast cells and basophils
- -Shown to modulate the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and may restore the Th1/Th2 cytokine network and enhance anti-tumour activity of IL-2
- -Triggers  the  acquisition  of  CD86  and  HLA-DR  antigens  on  human  monocytes  and  thus,  may facilitate the development of antigen-presenting dendritic cells from monocyte precursors

The most relevant points in this context of this application are outlined below (the well-characterised role  of  histamine  as  a  mediator  in  immediate  hypersensitivity  and  allergic  response  is  not  further addressed).

Histamine down-regulates several immunological parameters through its interaction with H1 and H2 receptors.  The  suppressive  effect  on  lymphocyte  proliferation  and  cytokine  release  is  a  known property of histamine. Histamine inhibits certain functions of phagocytes and granulocytic cells, most notably, their ability to produce ROS and release TNFα and IL-1β .  The inhibition by histamine on T-cell  proliferation  and  cytokine  production  was  closely  related  to  suppression  of  autocrine  IL-2 synthesis in proliferating or cytokine-producing T cells (38-40). However, the dose and regimen of IL2  were  chosen  based  on  published  research  indicating  that  these  doses  and  schedule  will  have significant biological activities and overcome any suppressive effect of HDC. In support for the notion that  histamine  does  not  reduce  T-cell  activity  when  administered  with  IL-2,  Hansson  et  al. (41) showed that the addition of histamine and IL-2 to a mixture of mononuclear phagocytes and T-cells yielded a &gt; 5-fold more efficient activation than that induced by IL-2 alone (as reflected by appearance of the CD69 activation antigen on the T-cell surface).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Consequently,  when  histamine  is  administered,  a  parallel  inhibition  of  T-cell  proliferation  and phagocyte production of oxygen radicals may occur, which hypothetically could counteract the desired protection of tumour-killing lymphocytes. However, the inhibition of T-cell proliferation by histamine is unlikely to occur during the concomitant administration of histamine with IL-2. Thus, the inhibition is secondary to inhibition of endogenous synthesis of IL-2 in T-cells and the co-administration of IL-2 together with histamine counteracts the histamine-induced inhibition of T-cell function.

In  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  there  was  no  evidence  that  HDC  causes  adverse  effects  on  the immune system. In the rat studies, relevant parameters in terms of immunotoxicity were differential white-cell  counts;  lymphoid  organ  weights  (thymus,  spleen  and  lymph  nodes);  and  microscopy  of lymphoid  tissues.  Although  changes  occurred  in  some  haematological  parameters  at  the  6-month timepoint (increased white blood cell count, segmented neutrophils and monocytes in at least one sex), the effects resolved during the 4-week recovery period. No treatment-related changes were noted in lymphoid organ weights and no adverse histopathological effects were detected in lymphoid tissues. The doses tested resulted in several 100-fold higher exposure than the intended clinical use. Moreover, in the dog studies, there were no findings that raise major concerns, although reduced spleen weights were seen. Although not substantially evaluated, there was no indication from the non-clinical primary pharmacology studies that the combination of IL-2 and histamine results in immunosuppression.

## · Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity  was  investigated  in  accordance  with  ICH  Notes  for  Guidance  (Standard  battery  for genotoxicity  testing  of  pharmaceuticals  [ICHS2B]  [CPMP/ICH/174/95]  and  Specific  aspects  of regulatory genotoxicity tests for pharmaceuticals [ICHS2A]  [CPMP/ICH/141/95])  i.e., testing mutagenic  potential  in  bacteria,  a  mouse  lymphoma  assay  and  a  micronucleus  assay  in  the mouse (Table 7).

There was no indication that HDC has a genotoxic potential.

## · Carcinogenicity

Neither in vivo assay was performed for investigating carcinogenic potential nor formal carcinogenicity study was found in the published literature.

## · Reproduction toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity study was conducted in rats with doses up to 100 mg/kg bid. In all studies, the high dose caused toxicity in the parent generation (injection site reactions, reduced

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

body weight and food intake).  Effects  on  male  fertility  (decreased  weights  of  prostate  and  seminal vesicles and increased sperm density) were observed only at 100 mg/kg bid. In females dosed 15 days before  mating  to  gestation  Day  7,  reduced  numbers  of  implantations  and  of  viable  foetuses  were found.  The  incidences  were  similar  at  all  doses  and  the  reduction  was  statistically  significant vs. controls at low and high dose. No systemic exposure data were obtained but in non-pregnant rats, the low dose corresponded to an AUC &gt; 80-fold the clinical AUC after 1 mg HDC. No developmental toxicity was seen after dosing of rats (high dose 100 mg/kg bid) or rabbits (high dose 1.25 mg/kg bid) during the organogenetic period.

In  the  peri-  and  post-natal  development  study,  the  HDC  caused  maternal  toxicity  and  the  offspring showed toxicity during lactation (fewer live pups at lactation Day 21 compared to lactation Day 4) but not  after  weaning.  The  F2  generation  was  not  affected.  The  maternal  and  offspring  NOAEL  was 10 mg/kg/day. There is no information on exposure of maternal rats, of pups or about milk transfer. Based on these data, it is recommended that women treated with Ceplene should not breastfeed.

## · Local tolerance

Local  tolerance  studies  have  been  conducted  in  the  rabbits  and  guinea  pigs  with  an  HDC  gel formulation.  In  the  primary  ocular  irritation  test,  HDC  was  classified  as  a  minimal  eye  irritant.  No effects were seen in the delayed contact hypersensitivity test or in the primary dermal irritation test. In addition, injection sites have been investigated in detail in the repeat dose toxicity studies. Injection site reactions were common findings, primarily at high doses in rats (200 mg/kg/day).

## · Other toxicity studies

The  applicant  has  conducted  one  interaction/combination  toxicity  study  ( Study  82-0039 )  in  rats  to study the potential for histamine, known to increase capillary permeability, to aggravate IL-2 induced capillary leakage (see Pharmacodynamic drug interactions section).

Antigenicity Not applicable

Dependence Not applicable

## Metabolites

No study was conducted

## Studies on impurities

All impurities are generated during the drug substance manufacturing process and there are no new impurities in the final product. These impurities have been identified and characterised in accordance with  the  relevant  ICH  guidelines.  The  process  impurity  D704  has  been  fully  characterised  with  a specification level of ≤ 0.2% w/w.

One residual solvent (cyclohexanol) does not have a release limit in ICH Q3C (Note for guidance on Impurities:  Residual  Solvents  [CPMP/ICH/283/95]).  The  applicant  has  provided  calculations  of  a permitted daily exposure (PDE). The maximal daily intake is &lt; 1% of the estimated PDE raising no concern.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The  applicant  has  provided  an  environmental  risk  assessment,  taking  into  account  the  Guideline (Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use [CPMP/SWP/4447/00]) that came into operation on December 1, 2006. In line with this guideline, the applicant has identified a refined Fpen, which was justified by market penetration data, but also taken a worst case assessment with a higher Fpen. The following is concluded:

- The low market penetration factor of 0.007% is not unexpected for a new treatment in an orphan indication. However, in a worst-case assessment, an Fpen of 0.05% (i.e., the disease prevalence threshold  for  orphan  designation)  have  been  applied  as  follows:  The  PECSURFACE  WATER  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

estimated  to  be  1.0  x  10 -4 µg/l,  one  hundred  times  less  than  the  action  limit  of  0.01 µg/l  that triggers a Phase II assessment.

- The  above  low  predicted  surface  water  concentration  for  HDC,  combined  with  the  innocuous nature and likely ready biodegradation of histamine and its human metabolites, indicates that the use of HDC in the proposed indication should pose a negligible risk to the environment.
- No precautionary measures are considered necessary regarding environmental release following the use of HDC in patients.
- No special labelling requirements regarding environmental aspects are considered necessary for HDC.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

From  a  non-clinical  primary  pharmacodynamic  point  of  view,  the  applicant  did  not  provide  any proprietary studies for their proof of concept. The applicant commented that AML has no valid animal model that can simulate the disease correctly and therefore the best way to show its effect on AML is by in-vitro work.  Although  there  is  a  plausible  scientific  rationale  for  the  efficacy  of  histamine  in combination  with  IL-2,  a  definite  conclusion  cannot  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  non-clinical information.  There  are  too  many  uncontrolled  variables  in  the  literature  studies  such  as  timing  of dosing,  type  of  tumour,  doses  used,  length  of  treatment,  etc.  The  question  of  efficacy  in  AML  is deferred to the clinical dossier.

Histamine is a pleiotropic endogenous biologically active amine that is widely distributed in the body and exerts multiple functions. Physiological responses to histamine include anaphylaxis, vasodilation, vasoconstriction,  gastric  acid  secretion  and  neurotransmission.  The  cardiovascular  response  to histamine  may  be  considered  a  major  dose  limiting  effect  and  in  overdose  profound  tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and shock could be expected. Potential adverse reactions, including effects on the CNS, cardiovascular system, immune/inflammatory response, and respiration could be anticipated  from  the  known  pharmacology  of  histamine  in  an  overdose  situation.  These  effects influenced the selection of the therapeutic dose and the choice of 0.5 mg/day twice daily as likely the maximum, safe, well-tolerated dose in man administered on an outpatient basis.

The applicant conducted in-vitro and in-vivo studies to show that at doses up to 21 times the clinical dose, effects on cardiac conduction should be unlikely. Other haemodynamic parameters were affected at the highest dose but had returned to baseline by the end of the monitoring period.

Toxicity to IL-2 is related to its effect on increased capillary permeability. A proprietary study was conducted to show that histamine does not exacerbate the effects of IL-2 on capillary permeability as evidenced by histology. No other studies on the combination treatment were performed.

HDC has  the  potential  to  interfere  with  certain  drugs.  Certain  P450  isozymes  that  modulate  gene function  by  controlling  the  level  of  oxygenated  lipids  represent  at  least  one  common  intracellular target  of  growth-regulatory  biogenic  amines  (such  as  histamine).  In  addition,  exogenous  drugs including anti-oestrogens, anti-androgens and certain antidepressants also have the potential to target such  isozymes  and  modulate  cell  growth.  These  findings  could  be  viewed  as  being  of  potential relevance  to  the  use  of  HDC  as  part  of  a  treatment  for  AML.  Critical  drug  interactions  are  not anticipated under the current protocol.

The doses and regimen of IL-2 were chosen based on published research indicating that these doses and regimen will have significant biological activities on the target lymphocytes. The dose levels were selected  to  target  primarily  high  affinity  and  intermediate  affinity  IL-2  receptors  on  NK cells  and T cells.

Histamine binding to H2 receptors on parietal cells has been shown to produce a comparable median effective  dose  (ED50),  which  led  to  the  selection  of  the  human  dose  of  0.5  mg  of  the  histamine dihydrochloride  salt  as  a  compromise  to  allow  for  maximum  gastric  acid  secretion  and  minimal adverse  side  effects.  Twice-daily  dosing  appears  to  be  appropriate  to  allow  safe  and  effective

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

protection  of  NK cells  and  T cells,  and  yet,  not  compromise  the  innate  defence  against  infectious agents.

Similarities exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of histamine across the species studied (rats, rabbits, dogs,  humans).  Histamine  was  measured  in  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and  humans  by  a  validated  enzyme immunoassay. In monkeys, radioimmunoassay was used for histamine measurements. There was no way  to  differentiate  between  endogenous  and  exogenous  histamine  and  therefore  total  histamine measurements in plasma were reported with the assumption that at low doses the measurement would mainly  be  of  endogenous  levels,  whereas  at  high  levels,  the  most  likely  source  for  histamine  was exogenous. Endogenous circulating levels of histamine in plasma vary widely among species with the highest levels being reported in rat and guinea pig, followed by dog and monkey, and the lowest levels in man.

The  proprietary  pharmacokinetic  studies  conducted  by  the  applicant  were  limited.  There  were absorption studies conducted in the rat (single high dose), rabbit and dog. These studies showed that histamine  is  rapidly  absorbed  with  tmax  reached  in  approximately  one  hour.  Histamine  has  a  short plasma  half-life  that  is  associated  with  rapid  clearance  from  the  body  and  a  large  volume  of distribution. Cmax was slightly less than dose proportional but as the dose increased the plasma half-life increased  and  clearance  decreased.  Its  extensive  distribution  outside  of  the  plasma  compartment  is consistent  with  the  pleiotropic  effects  that  histamine  has  on  various  organ  systems.  As  mast  cell granules are the main storage site for histamine it logically follows that the distribution of mast cells in the body correlates with the areas where histamine levels are highest, such as skin, connective tissue, gastric mucosa and mucosa of the bronchial tree. The liver is the preferential site for histamine uptake.

The  metabolism  of  endogenous  or  exogenous  histamine  is  qualitatively  similar  in  all  mammalian species. Methylation, catalysed by HMT, is the major pathway of metabolism in humans, as well as in the mouse, cat, and dog. In the rat, deamination via the DAO (or histaminase) pathway is the dominant route.  Most of the product, NMH, is converted by monoamine oxidase to NMIAA. Each metabolic pathway can be blocked by enzyme inhibition or interfering compounds. Histamine metabolism has been  largely  elucidated  by  analysis  of  urinary  metabolites  after  the  administration  of  radiolabelled histamine.  From  the  applicant's  proprietary  studies,  it  is  unlikely  that  histamine  or  its  major metabolites are able to interact with CYP P450 enzyme system in any way.

Histamine is rapidly cleared from the body primarily via the kidneys at higher doses.

The  toxicity associated with the use of histamine dihydrochloride is related to  exaggerated pharmacological responses in the species studied (rats, dogs, rabbits and monkeys). The dog was the most sensitive species to the effects of histamine whilst the rat was the least sensitive species. This is evident from the wide variation in the dose that was maximally tolerated and the respective NOAEL.

The general lack of cross-species consistency of the various effects, the ready normalisation of the effects during the recovery period and the absence of any histopathological correlates, strongly suggest a  pharmacodynamic  rather  than  a  toxicological  mechanism.  In  rats:  red  skin,  warm  to  the  touch, effects on adrenals, heart, liver, lungs. In dogs: dermal irritation, hypoactivity, increased respiration, scratching, biting, rubbing dose site, vocalisation during and after dosing, warm to touch, recumbence, excessive  salivation,  decreased  blood  pressure  (Day 1),  selected  organ  weight  changes  (adrenals, spleen,  prostate  and  ovaries  not  correlated  with  adverse  histopathology  findings,  and  thus,  not considered to be biologically relevant), minor effects on clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters (not  associated  with  gross  pathology),  and  lymphoid  depletion  in  the  thymus.  All  findings  were resolved  following  the  recovery  period.  In  addition,  the  effects  noted  seem  most  unlikely  to  be clinically  relevant.  Although  the  precise  nature  of  the  pharmacological  mechanisms  involved  in  the causation  of  the  reversible  effects  noted  in  the  chronic  toxicity  studies  remains  unclear,  it  seems possible that changes in microvascular permeability may play a role (42-44).

Histamine  dihydrochloride  is  devoid  of  genotoxic  potential  as  described  by  the  ICH  battery  of genotoxicity  tests  performed  on  the  product.  No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed.  This  was considered  acceptable  based  on  criteria  such  as  the  conversion  of  the  active  ingredient  to  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nature-identical  substance  following  administration;  the  transient  increase  in  plasma  histamine  in patients leading to a relatively minor increase in the overall burden; the serious nature of the disease being treated and the associated low life expectancy; the non genotoxic nature of the drug substance.

The lack of carcinogenicity studies is acceptable, considering the severity of the disease with a short life  expectancy,  histamine  is  an  endogenous  substance,  the  use  of  HDC  will  lead  only  a  transient increase in plasma histamine in patients leading to a relatively minor increase in the overall burden, the non genotoxic nature of the drug substance and no absence evidence of pre-neoplastic pathology in the repeat dose toxicity studies.

Histamine dihydrochloride is not considered to have any adverse effects on reproduction. The effects noted  during  the  reproduction  studies  were  similar  to  those  noted  during  the  repeat  dose  studies. Although doses were, in some cases, maternally toxic, this did not have any effects on the embryo and foetus.

Dermal irritation tests performed in New Zealand white rabbits revealed that histamine dihydrochloride  would  be  classified  as  a  minimal  irritant,  but  the  study  showed  no  associated microscopic lesions caused by the treatment. HDC does not cause delayed contact hypersensitivity.

Ceplene solution for injection 1 mg/ml does not represent a risk to the environment primarily due to the  low  market  penetration  factor  of  0.007%  and  the  calculated  PEC SURFACEWATER  for  histamine dihydrochloride is below the 0.01 µg/l guideline threshold concentration.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Ceplene has been investigated clinically for use in combination with cytokines such as IL-2 and IFNα for the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and AML.

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The CHMP requested a GCP inspection of Study MP-MA-0201 which was conducted in May 2007 and concluded the sites were ICH-GCP compliant.

## Pharmacokinetics

Seven clinical studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics and potential PK/PD correlations, following the subcutaneous administration of HDC solution.

No clinical pharmacokinetic studies of HDC were conducted in the AML target patient population.

- Analytical methods

Three bio-analytical methods were used (RIA, HPLC and ELISA). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods.

- Absorption

The data from a total of 51 healthy subjects and 29 patients with malignant disease (mainly melanoma) were  analysed.  Each  subject/patient  received  1  mg  HDC,  infusion  rates  differed  between  studies (10-25 minutes). The calculated PK parameters for each study are presented in Table 8 for total and baseline corrected histamine.

Inter-individual variability is high. CV% was 40-60% for Cmax and 35-55% for AUC0-t, with a higher variability in patients than in healthy volunteers.

Pharmacokinetic  data  from  two  different  occasions  is  available  in  one  patient.  There  was  a  large difference in exposure in this patient (AUC0-t was 27.8 and 10.8 nmol ⋅ h/l, although the same dose was given at both occasions), suggesting large intra-individual variability.

The absolute bioavailability has not been determined.

## · Distribution

There  is  no  information  regarding  plasma  protein-binding.  As  there  are  no  data  after  intravenous administration, information regarding Vss is not available and Vss/F could not be estimated. However, Vz/F (parameter of limited value) was reported (Table 8) and differed considerably between studies.

## · Metabolism

No data on metabolism were provided. The pathways of synthesis and catabolism of histamine in man are well known (45).

Under physiological conditions, the  metabolites of histamine have very little or no activity and are excreted in the urine.

## · Elimination

Histamine is mainly eliminated by metabolism in the liver and other tissues. As there are no data after intravenous  administration,  information  regarding  CL  is  not  available.  CL/F  varied  considerably between studies and was on average around 2 l/h/kg. Half-life also varied between studies and was on average  between  0.5  and  1  hour  for  exogenous  histamine  and  between  0.75  and  1.5  hour  for  total histamine (Table 8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The renal handling of infused 14 C-histamine was studied in healthy male subjects by measurement of 14 C-histamine  and  its  metabolites  in  arterial  and  renal  venous  blood  and  in  the  urine.  In  man,  the radioactivity  of  exogenously-administered 14 C-histamine  is  largely  excreted  in  the  urine  during  the first 6 hours. A large part of the histamine removed from the blood is metabolised in the kidney with only a small fraction excreted unchanged in the urine. The major metabolites found in the urine of healthy persons are N-methylhistamine and N-methyl imidazole acetic acid (MIAA).

The renal extraction ratio of histamine from human kidney is 0.7-0.8. This high extraction ratio for whole blood implies that a tubular transport mechanism in the kidney is responsible for renal removal of histamine from the blood.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Dose proportionality and time dependency has not been studied. Pharmacokinetic data are available only after single dose administration of 1 mg.

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal function

The pharmacokinetics of HDC  was  evaluated 6 healthy and 17 renally impaired subjects ( Study MP-MA-0501 ).  HDC  was  administered  at  a  single  dose  of  1 mg/ml  by  s.c.  infusion  over 20 minutes  on  Day 1.  Renal  impairment  has  no  significant  influence  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of histamine.

Published data show that when renal function is compromised due to renal disease, e.g. in the case of chronic  pyelonephritis  (inulin  clearance  was  5 ml/min),  the  extraction  of 14 C-histamine  from  whole blood was reduced, 51% in patients vs. 74-86% in healthy volunteers. In addition, in chronic renal failure  in  23  patients  with  a  mean  serum  creatinine  concentration  of  5.1 mg/dl,  the  mean  plasma histamine concentration was 5.5 ± 2.0 nmol/l, compared to 1.9 ± 0.4 nmol/l in 16 healthy controls.

Vital  signs  were  monitored  and  it  was  reported  that  in  the  group  with  severe  renal  impairment, decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (for which baseline values were higher compared to the  other  groups)  were  observed  at  plasma  histamine  concentrations,  which  caused  no  appreciable decrease in blood pressure in the other groups.

## Impaired liver function

The  pharmacokinetics  of  HDC  was  evaluated  6  healthy  and  18  hepatically  impaired  subjects ( Study MP-MA-0502 ). Each subject was allocated to 1 of 3 grades (Grade A, B and C) using Pugh's modification of Child's classification, during a pre-study visit performed within 1 week of Day 1. On Day 1, each subject received a single dose of HDC at 1 mg/ml by s.c. infusion over 20 minutes.

A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Median plasma histamine concentrations were similar in subjects with normal hepatic function and in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, while median plasma histamine concentrations were higher in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

Vital  signs  were  monitored  and  it  was  reported  transient  effects  (decreased  in  supine  systolic  and diastolic blood pressure more pronounced according to the hepatic impairment) in which returned to baseline value within approximately 1 hour after the start of the injection. No significant differences were observed in histamine, baseline-corrected, N-methylhistamine or baseline-corrected N-methylhistamine  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  among  the  study  groups.  Therefore,  no alteration in dosing is indicated in subjects with hepatic impairment, although higher plasma histamine concentrations may be encountered in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

## Gender

Potential difference in pharmacokinetics between men and women was evaluated in healthy volunteers and in patients.

No  difference is observed in pharmacokinetic parameters using baseline-corrected histamine concentrations between male and female patients with advanced malignant melanoma except a shorter half-life than men (men: 0.53 hour, women: 0.28 hour).

## Race

A  comparison  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  by  ethnic  origin  was  provided  by  the  applicant. Although the study was small, with 5, 33 and 10 Asian, Caucasian and Hispanic subjects, respectively, no clinically significant differences between groups were observed.

## Weight

In  the  overall  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  weight  was  found  to  have  no  significant  influence  on  the AUC of histamine.

## Elderly

The  pharmacokinetics  of  histamine  was  examined  across  an  age  continuum  via  a  linear  regression analysis.  The  minimum  age  was  19  years  and  the  maximum  age  was  80 years.  The  mean  age  was 50 years.  Age  did  not  have  any  significant  effect  on  any  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of histamine.

## Children

Neither paediatric study was conducted nor patients less than 18 years of age enrolled in the clinical studies.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## In vitro

Two in vitro studies ( reports XT035014 and XT033017 )  to  determine the effect of histamine on a battery  of  CYP  450  isoenzymes  have  been  conducted.  The  results  indicated  that  histamine, N-methylhistamine and imidazoleacetic acid had little or no capacity to inhibit CYP 450 isoenzymes neither to induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.

## In vivo

In Study MP-MA-0503 the interaction between HDC and IL-2 was evaluated in a total of 12 patients with either malignant melanoma (8) or renal cell carcinoma (4). This was a single-site, crossover study whereby each patient received HDC (1 mg) alone; IL-2 (18 MIU) alone; IL-2 (18 MIU) followed by HDC (1 mg); and HDC (1 mg) followed by IL-2 (18 MIU) during separate clinic admissions. Table 10 summarises the study results.

IL-2 appeared having no clinically significant influence on histamine pharmacokinetics. HDC reduced IL-2 Cmax  in  malignant  melanoma  cancer  patients  but  had  no  or  limited  effect  on  histamine pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with renal cell carcinoma and on the other pharmacokinetic parameters than IL-2 Cmax in patients with malignant melanoma.

## · Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

In vivo pharmacokinetic interaction studies were conducted on cultures of human hepatocytes.

## Pharmacodynamics

No pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. Donskov et al. (46) have published pharmacodynamic data in renal cell carcinoma.

## · Mechanism of action

No clinical studies to elucidate the mechanism of action of HDC in conjunction with low dose IL-2 in AML have been presented.

## · Primary and secondary pharmacology

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

Study  MP-MA-103 comprised  a  substudy  with  the  objectives  to  evaluate  changes  in  biomarkers indicative of oxidative stress and immune cell function after HDC + IL-2 administration. The primary endpoints  were  changes,  over  time,  in  biomarkers,  including  CD3 ζ ,,  neopterin,  IL-6  and  oxidative burst. Treatment with HDC and IL-2 provided a durable effect leading to an increased expression of CD3 ζ ,  associated  with  a  significantly  increased  proportion  (p &lt;  0.0001)  of  circulating  NK  cells (CD56+)  in  responding  patients.  Oxidative  stress  parameters  at  baseline  and  during  therapy  were significantly elevated in patients with progressive disease.

## Secondary pharmacology

Study  MP-MA-403 was  a  Phase I,  dose-escalating,  safety  and  pharmacokinetic  study  of  HDC  in healthy  human  volunteers.  Three  dose  levels  were  tested  10,  15  and  20 μ g/kg  by  subcutaneous injection  BID  for  14  consecutive  days.  Thereafter  subjects  were  engaged  in  14  days  of  outpatient follow-up. On Day 29 they received a 1-mg dose of HDC given repeatedly at least 2 hours apart in 3 successively  increased  rates  of  injection  (50,  100  and  150 μ g/min).  For  safety  and  tolerance 25 subjects were analysed.

The  study  drug  was  generally  well  tolerated.  No  clear  dose-response  relationship  was  revealed. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures tended to fall from baseline (range 5-30 mmHg) and heart rate increased post-dose. These effects resolved without treatment in 40 to 60 minutes.

All subjects experienced at least one drug-related adverse event (AE). These were numerous (such as flushing, headache, nausea and injection site reactions), but generally they were expected effects of histamine,  transient  and  resolved  without  treatment  or  sequelae.  No  serious  adverse  events  (SAE) occurred in the study. Two subjects discontinued due to an AE, one with nausea and an ear disorder of moderate intensity and the other with severe asthenia. Apart from transient changes in one subject, no marked changes in haematology and chemistry laboratory parameters were seen.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy

A total of 15 clinical studies were conducted evaluating the efficacy and safety of HDC, only 2 clinical studies  ( Studies  AML-1 and MP-MA-0201 )  in  the  patient  population  of  the  proposed  indication (Table 11), the other studies in malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, chronic hepatitis C.

The  clinical  efficacy  data  arises  from  a  population  of  359  AML  patients. Study  AML-1 was  a single-arm, exploratory dose-finding Phase II single-arm study in 39 patients. Study MP-MA-0201 in 320 patients was a multi-national, randomised, pivotal, Phase III study designed to assess the efficacy of  HDC  administered  in  combination  with  IL-2  compared  to  standard  of  care  (defined  as  no treatment).

## · Dose response study

No dose-response study was performed.

Selection and timing of dose for the pivotal study was based on published data as mentioned in the primary and secondary pharmacology section.

Bibliographical data concerning the primary pharmacology were presented regarding IL-2 and HDC. Published data on histamine in normal human volunteers indicated that doses of 0.3-0.7 mg histamine base (corresponds to 0.5-1.0 mg HDC) were maximally effective on H2-receptors to induce gastric acid  secretion,  yet  minimising  intolerable  side  effects  such  as  intense  flushing,  hypotension  and headache. Histamine binding to H2-receptors on parietal cells (leading to maximal acid secretion) and leukocytes has been shown to produce comparable ED50-values. This assumption led to the selection of the human dose of 1 mg of HDC, producing maximum gastric acid secretion and tolerable adverse side effects. Twice-daily dosing was judged to be appropriate to allow safe and effective protection of NK-  cells  and  T-cells  and  yet,  not  compromise  the  innate  defence  against  infectious  agents  (See clinical efficacy supportive study AML-1).

For the evaluation of HDC in conjunction with IL-2 as immunomodulating therapy in patients with AML in remission, a dose of 0.5 mg HDC was chosen. This dose was tested in study AML-1 and found to be acceptable for chronic outpatient administration in clinical practice.

## · Main study

Study MP-MA-0201 was conducted as a pivotal, confirmatory, clinical study in patients with AML. This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of subcutaneous histamine dihydrochloride plus IL-2 versus no treatment in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first or subsequent complete remission (CR)'.

This was a multicentre study conducted at 100 investigational sites in 10 countries.

Main inclusion criteria were:

- -cytochemically-verified  AML  in  CR 1  (patients  in  first  remission)  or  CR 1+  (patients  post  first remission) and documentation of patient's remission status by bone marrow examination within 28 days of randomisation
- -age 18 years or older
- -prior  induction  therapy  or  consolidation  therapy  as  per  standard  practice  at  the  institution, including autologous stem cell transplantation
- -life expectancy of more than 3 months and able to comply with study requirements
- -a WHO Performance Status of 0 - 1 or Karnofsky score of 70 or greater

Main exclusion criteria were:

- -prior treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplant
- -abnormal cardiac function
- -presence of other active malignancies, except carcinoma in situ of the cervix, localised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin
- -presence of active peptic or oesophageal ulcer disease or with past peptic ulcer or oesophageal disease with a history of bleeding
- -requiring treatment for hypotension
- -history of asthma treated in previous 5 years
- -currently  receiving  continuing  systemic  treatment  with  clonidine,  steroids  and/or  H2  receptor blocking agents
- -history of hypersensitivity to histamine or histamine products, severe allergies to food or contrast media requiring treatment in the last 5 years

- -Combination of IL-2, 16, 400 IU/kg (1 µg/kg, twice daily) was first administered subcutaneously and 1-3 minutes after HDC 0.5 mg (twice daily) also subcutaneously over 5-15 minutes during a 21-day  cycle.  For  Cycles 1-3,  each  cycle  is  followed  by  3 weeks  of  rest,  for  Cycles 4-10,  each cycle followed by 6 weeks of rest
- -Standard of care: no active treatment/observation

The absence of treatment in the control arm is justified, since no treatment is the standard of care and there is no evidence that IL-2 alone improves leukaemia-free survival (LFS).

Treatment with HDC+IL-2 was started as soon as clinically feasible after completion of consolidation treatment  and  confirmation  of  complete  remission.  The  protocol  allowed  10  cycles  of  HDC+IL-2, approximately 18 months or until bone marrow relapse or death.

Treatment  duration  was  chosen  to  maintain  a  protective  level  of  immuno-stimulation  during  the high-risk phase that is during the initial 18  months  post-consolidation of remission when &gt; 85% of relapses would be expected.

## Objectives

The original objective was double:

1. to  determine  if  active  treatment  could  prolong  leukaemia-free  survival  (LFS)  compared  to standard of care in patients in first remission
2. to  determine  if  active  treatment  could  prolong  LFS  compared  to  standard  of  care  in  patients  in subsequent remission

Due to poor recruitment of patients in subsequent remission the hypothesis was amended to determine if active treatment could prolong LFS compared to standard of care in patients in first or subsequent remission.  These  groups  have  different  prognosis  but  the  change  of  primary  objective  is  not problematic since randomisation was stratified based on first or subsequent remission.

The secondary  objectives  included  LFS  at  6,  12,  24  and  36  months  after  randomisation,  effects  of treatment on LFS of patients in CR 1 and CR 1+, overall survival, safety, toxicity and quality of life.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The duration of LFS was the primary endpoint. LFS was defined as the time elapsed from the date of randomisation to the date of relapse of AML or death from any cause. The widely accepted and clinically  relevant  laboratory  definition  of  remission  was  &lt; 5%  blasts  in  bone  marrow  without extramedullary leukaemia, the standard goal in studies of leukaemia treatments.

Secondary efficacy endpoint of this study included duration of overall survival was treated in the same manner as  LFS,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  proportion  of  patients  alive  and  relapse-free  at  specific timepoints and disease-free survival (DFS) in various prognostic groups of AML patients. In addition to these secondary endpoints, quality of life (QoL) was studied.

## Sample size

The original statistical hypotheses were:

1. For a hypothesised improvement in median LFS of 50% in CR 1 patients in the combination group compared with control, a sample size of 96 patients with CR 1 in each treatment group reaching an evaluable endpoint within the 36-month follow-up would provide a statistical power of 80% to detect the hypothesised difference between treatment groups with a type I error rate of 0.05.
2. For  a  hypothesised  improvement  in  median  LFS  of  75%  in  CR 1+  patients  in  the  combination group compared with control, a sample size of 51 patients with CR 1+ in each treatment group would  provide  a  statistical  power  of  80%  to  detect  the  hypothesised  difference  between  the treatment groups with a type I error rate of 0.05.

The planned enrolment was 360 patients (240 in CR 1 and 120 in CR 1+), with equal distribution of each subset between the treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

Central randomisation and stratification based on country and CR 1 vs. CR 1+ was performed.

## Blinding (masking)

This study was not blinded due to the fact that there would be clearly observable physiological effects during  HDC+IL-2  administration,  such  as  skin  flushing.  However,  sponsor  staff  and  CRO  data management were blinded to patient treatment.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  analysis  was  performed  using  the  log-rank  test,  stratified  by  country  and  CR  stratum (CR 1 or CR 1+). The primary analysis was performed on the ITT population defined as all patients who were randomised, regardless of protocol violations. Secondary analyses to explore the impact of prognostic factors were conducted using standard survival analysis methods.

## Results

## Participant flow

<!-- image -->

Four patients (1 in the experimental arm, 3 controls) of the 320 patients dropped from the study 1, 7, 11 and 34 days after randomisation. The reasons were: one consent withdrawal, one lost to follow-up, one recurrent haematologic illness and one not eligible due to thrombocytopenia.

## Recruitment

In the accrual period from June 1998 to August 2000, a total of 320 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms, 160 in each treatment group. Date of last patient last visit was October 2004. A total of 91 centres and 1 consortium of 9 centres enrolled patients with the range of 0-17 patients per centre.

## Conduct of the study

The  protocol  was  amended  on  four  occasions  a  brief  description  of  the  principal  changes  is  given below:

- -31 st March 1998 - to make administrative changes, clarifications and minor changes e.g., a delay of one treatment cycle was allowed.
- -27 th August 1999 - to extend the allowed period from completion of induction therapy from 2 to 3 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -6 th September  2000  -  change  of  time  of  analysis  from  12  months  from  last  CR 1+  patient  and 18 months  from  last  CR 1  patient  to  24  months  after  last  patient  enrolled.  Removal  of  the proposed secondary analyses of relapse rates at 36 and 48 months.
- 1 st November 2001 - change of analysis to 36 months after the last patient enrolled. Pooling of CR 1+ and CR1 patients due to poor enrolment of CR 1+. The primary endpoint remains duration LFS.

Thirty-eight percent (38%) of patients in the HDC+IL-2 group had enrolment deviations, somewhat higher than the control group (31%). No patients failed to meet basic AML diagnostic or CR criteria.

Overall, patients in the 2 treatment groups were similar with respect to demographics or to disease characteristics. The majority of patients (83% of control and 81% of the HDC+IL-2 group) were in first  remission  or  CR 1  at  study  entry.  The  mean  number  of  induction/consolidation  treatments required to achieve the current remission was 1 (ranged from 0 to 4) for each treatment group.

Similarly, the  baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  were similar  when  the  study population is broken into patient with CR 1 or CR 1+.

In response to the Day 120 list of questions, the applicant provided results of analyses of Quality of Life (QoL). The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to evaluate the patients' QoL and was administered at baseline,  before  and  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  periods  of  Cycles  3,  6  and  8  and  at  the  study completion or at the early discontinuation visit. The QoL data analyses employed 7 scales for global QoL and personal functioning and 9 symptom scores which all showed modest differences that are consistent with the vasodilatory and immuno-inflammatory effects of HDC+IL-2. These analyses did not show  clinically relevant loss of QoL  due  to this treatment regimen. Quality-of-life in HDC+IL-2-treated  patients  was  maintained  at  levels  similar  to  that  of  control  patients  receiving standard of care.

In  response to the Day 180 list of outstanding issues, the applicant provided results of a sensitivity analysis censoring for deaths unrelated to AML relapse in the 261 patients with CR 1 using long-term follow-up data. Survival curve through 96 months showed a trend in favour of HDC+IL-2 over control (p = 0.090, stratified log rank test). At 5 years, the proportion of patients with CR 1 who died due to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AML  were  significantly  lower  in  the  group  who  received  HDC+IL-2  than  in  those  receiving  no maintenance therapy (p = 0.037, Kaplan-Meier).

## Ancillary analyses

In Study  MP-MA-0201 ,  there  appeared  to  be  an  association  between  age  60 years  or  less,  and treatment  effect  in  the  ITT  and  CR 1  populations.  The  log-rank  test  for  LFS  was  statistically significant  for  patients  up  to  60  years  of  age  (p = 0.02)  but  not  for  patients  older  than  60  years (p = 0.35).

For the overall population in Study MP-MA-0201 , a significantly worse hazard for LFS was shown for  men  than  for  women  (ratio  0.74,  p &lt; 0.036).  Both  men  and  women  showed  benefit  from HDC+IL-2 treatment.

No analysis on pooled data from different studies or meta-analysis has been performed.

- Clinical studies in special populations

No study in special populations has been performed.

- Supportive study

Study AML-1 was  a  Phase  II,  non-randomised,  uncontrolled,  open-label,  exploratory  evaluation  of feasibility,  safety  and  efficacy  of  HDC+IL-2 to prevent relapse in patients with AML in remission. The  trial  was  conducted  between  February  1993  (first  patient  first  visit)  and  December  1999  (last patient last visit) in Sweden. This study is considered only supportive since the study design would not allow comparative analysis of efficacy.

Objectives: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of IL-2 with the addition of HDC to extend  the  duration  of  leukaemia-free  survival  in  patients  with  AML  in  remission.  Secondary objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  the  combination  treatment  and  to  evaluate  feasibility  of self-administration at home of this treatment.

Methods: Eligible  patients  were  treated  with  IL-2  (1 μ g/kg s.c., twice daily) and HDC (0.3-0.7 mg [starting  dose]  s.c.,  twice  daily)  in  treatment  cycles  (3-week  treatment  plus  rest  periods  of  variable duration). Treatment cycles were given repeatedly for a duration of two years of complete remission or until relapse or death. Based on the medical status of the patient, individual adjustments of doses and duration of treatment and rest periods could be made.

Eight patients received IL-2 as a single agent for the first immunotherapy course. Another cohort of 30 patients  received  IL-2  as  a  single  agent  only  during  the  first  week  of  the  first  immunotherapy course. After the initial single drug IL-2 treatment, all patients were to receive the combination of IL-2 and HDC. Chemotherapy (low dose chemotherapy with cytarabine and thioguanine between the initial courses of immunotherapy) was given to some patients in addition study drugs.

Results: 39 patients were enrolled: 25 with CR 1 at baseline and 14 with CR 1+. A review of data by December 1999 showed relapse in 14 of the 25 patients with CR 1 at baseline and in 11 of 14 with CR 1+. Median leukaemia-free survival was 117 weeks for patients CR 1 at baseline and 49 weeks for patients CR 1+ at baseline. Leukaemia-free survival was in line with what has been reported for AML patients in the literature. Prognostic factors were overall not very favourable. The results of this initial study led to the development of the protocol for Study MP-MA-0201 .

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

Study MP-MA-0201 showed a statistically significant difference in terms of LFS (p = 0.008, stratified log-rank test). For the CR 1 population, the difference in median survival was 159 days. Kaplan-Meier estimates  of  3-year  LFS  in  the  CR 1  population  were  26%  in  the  control  group  and  40%  in  the HDC+IL-2 group (p = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in the CR 1+ population. No significant differences were observed in terms of overall survival.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  demonstration  of  efficacy  of  HDC  in  AML  is  entirely  dependent  on Study  MP-MA-0201 .  In order  that  a  single  study  may  form  the  basis  for  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  it  should  be adequately conducted and the results should be compelling.

A SAG-Oncology was consulted to advise on matters relating to the clinical relevance of maintenance treatment in adult patients with AML after the first remission, and in this patient population, whether IL-2 alone could be considered as an effective maintenance treatment and whether an improvement in LFS would represent a meaningful clinical benefit. In addition, the SAG-Oncology was asked to give its viewpoint on whether the non-clinical and clinical data demonstrated that histamine enhances/protects the activity of IL-2 and whether it would be feasible to perform further studies that seek to establish the effect size of histamine and IL-2 respectively in AML.

- -The SAG-Oncology stated that there was no established maintenance treatment in adult patients with AML after first remission with the exception of ongoing investigational studies.
- -There is no proof supporting that IL-2 alone is an effective maintenance treatment in adult patients with AML after the first remission. Several clinical studies, in general with a small sample size, have been conducted and none have demonstrated a benefit of IL-2 alone in this setting. However, there  are  larger,  trials  investigating  this  question  and  it  should  be  noted  that  these  studies  have used varied dosing and schedules.
- -LFS is an important clinical benefit endpoint, especially, for a patient population over 65 years of age.  If  LFS  is  the  primary  endpoint,  overall  survival  should  be  a  secondary  endpoint  and  the clinical study must have sufficient evidence to allow concluding that overall survival is unlikely to be adversely affected by the treatment.
- -The  data  provided  do  not  demonstrate  unequivocally  that  histamine  enhances  or  protects  the activity of IL-2. The proposed mechanism of action of histamine in this combination is plausible. The effect and the efficacy of histamine are supported with sparse data from very few non clinical experiments and the results of the clinical trials included in this application. The opinion on the robustness of the efficacy data presented diverged between participants at SAG-Oncology. Some were of the opinion that the single pivotal trial did not provide convincing evidence due to marked heterogeneity  between  participating  centres/countries,  insufficient  support  of  pharmacological rationale, non-clinical data provided, absence of proof of concept in eradication minimal residual disease and finally the negative outcome of the clinical trials with HDC+IL2 in other indications questioned the validity of the rationale. Others considered that the biological rationale was sound and although the individual effects of the combination could not be delineated, the combination showed efficacy using a clinically relevant endpoint and given the unmet medical need and the manageable  toxicity  of  the  combination,  the  benefits  were  considered  important,  even  in  the absence of extensive supportive data. The negative results in solid tumours should not detract from the clinically relevant and statistically compelling results observed in AML based on good quality data confirmed by a GCP inspection.
- -Many but  not  all  SAG-Oncology  members  were  of  the  opinion  that  a  clinical  study  aiming  at establishing the effect size of the combination histamine and IL-2 in treatment in adult patients with  AML  after  the  first  remission  could  be  performed  and  desirable.  Others  expressed  the concern  that  the  formal  positive  outcome  for  the  primary  endpoint  is  an  issue  because  AML patients in this situation might be deprived of a potentially efficacious therapy for some years until further data might become available and further supportive clinical data could be acquired postauthorisation.

## Clinical safety

- Patient exposure

Patients suffering from AML in first or subsequent remission and from metastatic melanoma (MM) constitute the  main patient populations in the clinical development programme. In addition, smaller studies  were  conducted  in  renal  cell  carcinoma  and  hepatitis  C.  A  total  of  patients  of  1,188  were treated with HDC and 689 control patients (not exposed to HDC) were part in the clinical development programme (Table 16).

## · Safety in special populations

## Age

Overall, there was no major clinical differences between the incidences of AE in patients &lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years of age in any of treatments (IL-2 alone, HDC+IL-2, HDC 0.5 mg+IL-2, HDC 1 mg+IL-2 or standard care) or when comparing across the treatments.

## Gender

It  did  not  appear  to  be  any  consistent  relationship  between  the  patient  gender  and  the  treatment administered  (IL-2  alone,  HDC+IL-2,  HDC 0.5 mg+IL-2,  HDC 1 mg+IL-2  or  standard  care)  for almost all of the AE in which there was a difference of at least 5% between male and female patients. However, difference between males and females for headache NOS, nasal congestions, hypotension NOS and injection site erythema appeared to be consistent across the different treatment administered.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Study MP-MA-0503 was the only drug interaction study conducted (see section on pharmacokinetics).

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The most frequently experienced AE that led to premature discontinuation of study drugs in patients in the AML studies were thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, neutropenia and pyrexia.

## · Post-marketing experience

HDC has not been approved or marketed in any country.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

A total 196 patients with AML have been exposed to HDC and IL-2 combination treatment, the size of this safety dataset is considered acceptable. Almost all patients received 0.5 mg of HDC.

The  most  common  adverse  drug  reactions  induced  by  the  addition  of  HDC  to  IL-2  are  flushing, hypotension, headache and injection site reactions, as identified in studies malignant melanoma where the comparison with IL-2 alone was possible.

Despite  the  higher  rate  of  side  effects  in  the  experimental  arm  (33 vs. 17%)  and  the  treatment constraints, the proposed treatment regimen does not appear to impact negatively on the quality of life of patients.

Very few deaths were reported during the treatment period or shortly after in the AML studies. All cases were attributed to the underlying disease and not related to study medication (1 death vs. 4 in the control and combination arms, respectively). The proportion of patients with SAE is slightly higher in the  HDC+IL-2-treated  patient  group,  24.0 vs. 21.8%.  Thrombocytopenia,  infections  and  back  pain were causes that were increased in this group.

The  defence  against  infectious  agents  may  be  affected  by  HDC  due  to  the  phagocyte  inactivation. Considering the overall treatment duration (18 months) and the therapy affecting the immune system it

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

could be postulated an increased risk of infection, as shown by the slightly increased number of SAE with infection as cause.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects relevant to the consistent clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in  a  satisfactory  way.  There  are  no  unresolved  quality  issues,  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the Benefit:Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Pharmacodynamic  data  are  mainly  based  on  bibliographic  references.  The  effect  on  acute  myeloid leukaemia (AML) is based on in vitro studies. Although there is a plausible scientific rationale for the efficacy  of  histamine  dihydrochloride  (HDC)  in  combination  with  interleukin  (IL-2),  a  definite conclusion cannot be made on the basis of the non-clinical information.

The  proprietary  pharmacokinetic  studies  conducted  were  limited.  Data  showed  similarities  in  the pharmacokinetic profile of histamine across the species studied (rats, rabbits, dogs, humans).

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose toxicity, local tolerance and genotoxicity. The toxicity associated with the use of HDC was related to exaggerated pharmacological responses in the species studied (rats, dogs, rabbits and monkeys) and were observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human exposure.

Histamine dihydrochloride is not considered to have any adverse effects on reproduction. The effects observed during the reproduction studies were similar to those noted during the toxicity repeat dose studies.  Although doses were, in some cases, maternally toxic, this did not have any effects on the embryo and foetus.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of the combination treatment of HDC and interleukin-2 (IL-2) was investigated in one pivotal study ( Study MP-MA-0201 ) and showed in the ITT population that combination HDC+IL-2 resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  of  leukaemia-free  survival  (LFS).  The  effect  was observed only in the population in first remission. In the subset of patients in CR 1, median LFS was increased by 22.7 weeks (p = 0.0113, stratified log-rank test) and LFS at 36 months was almost 40% in  patients  treated  with  the  combination  compared  with  26%  in  the  control  group  (p = 0.02).  The applicant has suggested an indication accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP initially  concluded  that  statistical  significance  of  the  outcome  observed  for  the  pivotal study on maintenance treatment with HDC+IL-2 cannot be considered statistically compelling. The clinical efficacy cannot be considered as established.

## Safety

The safety profile of HDC combines common adverse drug reactions such as flushing, hypotension, headache  and  injection  site  reactions  and  a  slightly  increase  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  for thrombocytopenia,  infections  and  back  pain  compared  with  the  observational  arm.  However,  the proposed  treatment  regimen  does  not  impact  negatively  on  Quality  of  Life  of  the  treated  patients, despite a treatment of 18-month duration with twice daily administrations during 3 weeks, followed by resting periods of 3 and then 6 weeks.

## User consultation

The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Ceplene  (histamine  dihydrochloride)  has  been  tested  in English  in  accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by Directive 2004/27/EC. The PIL for Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride) was found to contain all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test.

It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The demonstration of the efficacy of HDC in combination with IL-2 for preventing or delaying relapse in  AML  relies  on  one  single  pivotal  Phase III  study  ( Study  MP-MA-0201 ).  The  combination demonstrated a statistically significant increase in LFS over a 36-month observation period in patients with  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  in  remission.  A  subgroup  analysis  showed  that  the  effect  was  only observed in the population of patients in first remission.

The  contribution  in  the  treatment  effect  of  each  individual  drug  has  been  evaluated  neither  in non-clinical nor in clinical study in the claimed indication. This has been seen as a major deficiency in the drug development.

The safety data of the combination treatment were not of major concern.

The  applicant  was  invited  to  present  an  oral  explanation  to  the  CHMP  to  address  the  outstanding issues. In summary, the applicant argued that:

- -There  are  several  peer  reviewed  articles  supporting  the  rationale  of  mechanism  of  action  of HDC+IL-2
- -Five randomised trials (n = 899) did not show a benefit of IL-2 alone (wide range of doses and schedules) for preventing the first relapse in AML patients
- -LFS is a reliable marker to assess remission, commonly used in similar trials
- -In Study  MP-MA-0201 ,  LFS  was  significantly  prolonged  in  the  combination  treatment  arm compared  with  the  control  arm  and  extensive  sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  that  were  not confounding prognostic factors
- -The Study  MP-MA-0201 was  not  designed  for  concluding  statistically  on  overall  survival, however in the population of the claimed indication the overall survival is prolonged
- -Negative  study  results  in  other  indication  are  explainable  by  the  higher  of  tumour  burden  of metastatic cancer compared with AML after the first complete remission.

Having considered the arguments and justifications presented by the applicant and the advice from the SAG-Oncology, the CHMP considered that the benefit risk of histamine dihydrochloride administered in  conjunction with interleukin-2 for maintenance of remission in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission was not considered favourable due to the following grounds.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The application is dependent on one single pivotal study. This study, Study MP-MA-0201 , cannot be considered to meet the requirements for approval with a single pivotal study according to the CHMP points to consider CPMP/EWP/2330/99 for the following reasons:

- -The requirement of statistically compelling results is not fulfilled
- -Supportive clinical data for efficacy are very limited and consist of a Phase II study evaluating in 39 patients  with  AML  in  remission,  feasibility,  safety  and  efficacy  of  HDC+IL-2  to  prevent relapse
- -The pharmacological rationale is weak in particular concerning the use of the combination and the supporting non-clinical data are not considered to be sufficient.

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Ceplene administered in conjunction with interleukin-2, for maintenance of remission in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission to prolong the  duration  of  leukaemia-free  survival,  was  unfavourable  and  therefore  did  not  recommend  the granting of the marketing authorisation in the first instance.

## 2.7 Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 19 March 2008

Following  the  CHMP  Opinion  concluding  that  the  benefit  risk  of  histamine  dihydrochloride administered  in  conjunction  with  interleukin-2  for  maintenance  of  remission  in  adult  patients  with acute  myeloid  leukaemia  in  first  remission  was  not  considered  favourable,  the  applicant  submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

The Applicant argued that data presented in the original application satisfactorily address each of the grounds for refusal raised by the CHMP and that the assessment should take into account the unmet medical need, the sound pharmacological rationale supporting the use of Ceplene/IL-2 immunotherapy, the claimed clinical benefits supported by robust and clinically meaningful data set, the acceptable safety profile and patient convenience

Concerning the requirement of statistically compelling results, the Applicant argued that the results of the pivotal Phase III 0201 of Ceplene/IL-2 treatment for remission maintenance in AML patients are scientifically valid, internally consistent, and robust.  These characteristics, combined with the clear demonstration of clinical benefit on leukaemia-free survival in the target population, and viewed in the context of an orphan treatment for a poor prognosis disease, can be considered statistically as well as clinically compelling. The applicant also submitted the opinion of expert European biostatisticians to support its argumentation.

The applicant disagreed that supportive clinical data for efficacy are very limited and argued  that the totality  of  data  collected  during  the  clinical  development  program  of  Ceplene  and  previously submitted in the Ceplene MAA is sufficient to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and positive benefitto-risk balance of this therapy for prevention of relapse in AML patients. According to the applicant, the published peer-reviewed  preclinical  and  clinical  pharmacodynamic  data  reviewed  provide compelling  evidence,  and  concluded  that  this  evidence  unequivocally  supports  the  pharmacological rationale for the use of Ceplene/IL-2 in AML. The applicant has reviewed 5 clinical trials investigating different  doses  of  IL-2  in  patients  with  AML  and  concluded  that  these  trials  have  not  shown significant  clinical  efficacy  of  IL-2  treatment  as  monotherapy  at  doses  ranging  between  25  and  91 MIU/m 2 /month.

Concerning the pharmacological rationale, the applicant reviewed and discussed the role of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in eradicating leukaemic cells in AML patients, the rationale and results for IL-2  in  AML,  the  mechanisms  of  T  and  NK  cell  inactivation  and  their  implications  for  IL-2 immunotherapy  in  AML,  the  rationale  and  preclinical  pharmacodynamic  basis  for  improving  IL-2 efficacy  with  HDC,  as  well  as  the  clinical  pharmacodynamic  effect  of    HDC  in  improving  IL-2induced immunoactivation. The applicant also reviewed the likely mechanism of action of HDC by

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overcoming cancer-related immunosuppression or immunosuppression in AML  (in terms of dysfunctional T and NK cells recovered from AML patients) respectively based on in vitro or ex vivo data.

## Report from the CHMP Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology

Following the request from the applicant, as agreed by the CHMP, a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting has been convened on 10 July 2008 to provide comments on the grounds for negative opinion and advice on the list of questions raised by the CHMP and adopted at the June 2008 CHMP meeting.

The SAG considered the CHMP grounds for refusal and agreed that the statistical significance of the log-rank test was convincing from a purely statistical perspective, but also concurred that there were only very little supportive clinical data, and that the pharmacological rationale, although plausible, was adding little to the clinical data. The SAG also agreed that the toxicity of the combination regimen was in  itself  manageable  and  not  unacceptable  in  absolute  terms,  if  clear  evidence  of  efficacy  could  be established.

However,  when  judging  the  evidence  of  efficacy,  two  opposing  views  emerged.  According  to  one view, the efficacy has been clearly established, and the clinical trial provided sufficient evidence to establish a positive benefit-risk in the target population. Since such an assessment is based on a single pivotal-trial,  the  evidence  of  efficacy  is  not  overwhelming.  However  the  large  effect  in  terms  of  a relevant  clinical  endpoint,  the  lack  of  alternative  established  maintenance  treatments  and  the acceptable  toxicity  profile  were  considered  together  as  sufficient  to  establish  an  adequate  level  of efficacy of the combination of histamine+IL2. According to this view, although there are a number of issues  that  could  be  further  clarified,  the  efficacy  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  in  the  target population. The heterogeneity of the randomized study was considered to be no greater than in any other large AML study. Furthermore, it is a regular finding in every unselected AML study that one cannot classify in terms of risk a fair proportion of AML patients due to failed cytogenetics (i.e., no metaphases). It was also acknowledged that , subgroup analysis is of course of interest but cannot be required  for  registration  if  a  predefined  clinical  relevant  endpoint  on  the  total  population  is  met. However, the efficacy should be further characterised in subgroups of poor prognosis patients (e.g., patients &gt;60 years old), e.g., through adequate studies, if necessary post-approval.

According to the opposing view, the efficacy cannot be considered established. The trial included a heterogeneous population in terms of known and unknown prognostic factors. Although the applicant showed that concerning known prognostic factors no important imbalances were apparent, reliable risk classification based on cytogenetics could only be determined in 69% of the patients due to missing data.  Thus,  important  heterogeneity  in  the  population  recruited  and  imbalances  between  treatment arms cannot be excluded. The poor performance of the observation arm might indeed be due to such an imbalance. Given the lack of a second confirmatory trial, the problematic experience with similar immunotherapies, the lack of other clinical efficacy and pharmacological supportive data, there remain fundamental doubts about the efficacy of the combination and this could only be resolved with the conduct of a randomized clinical trial of similar design, designed and conducted according to state of the art standards in the treatment of AML.

The  SAG  agreed  that  historical  comparisons  are  very  difficult  to  interpret  and  can  be  in  fact misleading.  Historical  comparisons  cannot  be  used  to  conclude  or  even  speculate  on  whether  there exist or not any differences between histamine dihydrochloride+ IL-2, compared to IL-2 alone. The SAG considered that the more relevant question is rather concerning the effect of the combination of histamine  dihydrochloride+IL-2 versus observation.  Indeed,  there  is  a  catalogue  of  questions  that could be of academic interest, trying to determine exactly the contributions of all the components of the combination, optimising the doses of the two agents, etc., but it is highly unlikely that all such answers could be obtained in a rare disease setting such as the maintenance treatment of AML. Given the  large  unmet  medical  need,  a  reasonable  combination  regimen  with  convincing  evidence  of adequate efficacy and safety would be of clear clinical usefulness in this disease setting, despite the unknown contribution of the individual agents.  According to one view, the fact that other trials using higher doses of IL2 were negative and/or too toxic was viewed as indirect evidence of the contribution of histamine to the combination. According to other members the single pivotal trial using IL-2 plus histamine should be considered as one positive trial amongst five negative trials using IL-2 as single agent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SAG had divergent views on the need for a second randomized controlled trial to establish the benefit of the combination (see SAG comments on the CHMP grounds for refusal). There were two views  concerning  the  feasibility  of  such  a  study.  One  view  suggested  that  a  second  randomized controlled  trial  study  should  indeed  be  conducted  according  to  state  of  the  art  standards,  including stratification  for  known  prognostic  factors  such  as  age,  WBC  count  at  diagnosis,  cytogenetics  and molecular  markers  ( flt-3 mutation, MLL partial  tandem  duplication),  in  order  to  allow  proper assessment  of  the  efficacy  and  adjustment  for  important  prognostic  factors.  The  opposite  view maintained  that  the  efficacy  was  not  in  question  and  that  no  second  randomized  controlled  trial  is necessary or even feasible. Any outstanding uncertainties about subgroups where the efficacy has been less  convincingly  shown  (e.g.,  patients  &gt;60  years  old)  should  be  addressed  as  post-authorisation commitments (see SAG comments on the CHMP grounds for refusal).

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group.

The CHMP considered all the new evidence submitted by the applicant and the argumentation put forward by the applicant and the SAG experts. The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance for the combination of Ceplene plus IL-2 was positive. The CHMP agreed that despite its limitations in terms of design, the results of study MP-MA-0201, can be considered to meet the requirements for approval with a single pivotal study according to the CHMP points to consider CPMP/EWP/2330/99, i.e., that the pivotal study can be considered as exceptionally compelling particularly due to the high quality of the conduct of the study, the clinically and statistically significant results, and the internal validity.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  concept  of  immune-surveillance  of  cancer  is  established  and provides a plausible rationale for pharmacodynamic strategies to enhance antileukemic effects of Tand NK cells. However, the CHMP considered that further clinical data should be provided in order to provide a better understanding of the clinical efficacy of Ceplene in combination with IL-2, and  to confirm the underlying mechanism of action. However, the CHMP, in agreement with the SAG, also recognised that certain relevant questions remain unanswered, in particular concerning the contributions to the effect of all the components of the combination, as well as optimising the doses of the two agents, etc., but it is highly unlikely that all such questions could be addressed comprehensively  in  a  rare  disease  setting  such  as  the  maintenance  treatment  of  AML.  Thus,  the CHMP proposed a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances, after having consulted the applicant.

In  particular  there  is  a  need  to  gain  more  understanding  with  regard  to  the  benefit-risk  profile  of Ceplene  plus  IL-2  combination  and  the  role  of  Ceplene  in  such  a  combination.  The  applicant  will provide clinical data to assess the immunologic and anti-leukaemic activity of Ceplene/IL-2 in adult AML patients in CR1, to study the effect in patients &gt;60 years old compared to younger patients, and to  assess  the  anti-leukaemic  activity  of  Ceplene/IL-2  in  adult  AML  patients  with  minimal  residual disease. To this end, the applicant has committed to conduct the following studies:

- -Multicenter Open-Label Clinical Pharmacology Study to Evaluate the Biomarkers and Pharmacologic Endpoints of Ceplene (Histamine Dihydrochloride) plus low dose Interleukin-2 in approximately  100  Adult  Patients  stratified  by  age  great  or  less  than  60  with  Acute  Myeloid Leukemia in First Complete Remission (CR), with well characterized Morphologic, Cytogenetic and Molecular profiles
- -Open label clinical study to evaluate Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) for the assessment of the anti-leukaemic  activity  of  Ceplene/IL-2  Ceplene  (Histamine  Dihydrochloride)  plus  low  dose Interleukin-2  in  approximately  150  Adult  Patients  stratified  by  age  great  or  less  than  60  with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Complete Remission.

The  applicant  has  also  committed  to  assessing  the  feasibility  and  if  applicable  to  conducting  a controlled clinical study in order to confirm the clinical benefit of the combination of Ceplene/IL-2 in adult AML patients in CR1:

- -The applicant has also committed to determining the feasibility of conducting,  in conjunction with collaborative groups in Europe and/or the United States, a Multicenter Randomized Open-Label Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  Immunotherapy  with  Subcutaneous  Ceplene

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Histamine  Dihydrochloride)  plus  low  dose  Interleukin-2  Versus  a  comparator  arm  to  be determined  in approximately 350 adult Patients (stratified by age great or less than 60) with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Complete Remission.

Divergent  views  were  expressed  by  some  CHMP  members  who  considered  that  the  benefit-risk balance could not be considered to be positive and that the grounds for refusal should be maintained, because  the  data  presented  are  not  sufficiently  compelling  to  establish  the  efficacy  of  the  product based  on  a  single  pivotal  study,  because  of  the  absence  of  supportive  data,  and  because  relevant clinical data to confirm the pharmacological rationale for Ceplene + IL2 have not been submitted.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- -No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

In  this  application,  the  Applicant  has  provided  arguments  discussing  the  issue  of  similarity,  in  the context  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000,  regarding  the  orphan  medicinal  product Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) authorised in the EU for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia.

## The CHMP concluded that:

-  A  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product  Trisenox  containing  arsenic  trioxide  for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) exists with orphan market exclusivity.

- Histamine dihydrochloride and arsenic trioxide are considered not to be similar with regards to the mechanism of action since they act on different pharmacodynamic targets.

-  Histamine  dihydrochloride  is  not  structurally  similar  to  arsenic  trioxide  as  both  molecules  do  not share the same principal molecular structure pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000.

Therefore, the CHMP considered Ceplene not to be similar to any of the authorized orphan medicinal products (as defined in Art. 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication.

## Recommendation following re-examination

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion  and  in  its  final  opinion  concluded  by  a  majority  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of Ceplene  maintenance  therapy  for  adult  patients  with  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  in  first  remission concomitantly  treated  with  IL-2  was  favourable  and  that  the  application  satisfied  the  criteria  for authorisation  and  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  under  exceptional circumstances.
