## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Inpremzia 1 international unit/ml solution for infusion.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

The potency of insulin human is expressed in international units.

Inpremzia dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1 international unit/kg/day. Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their usual diet or during concomitant illness.

Each bag contains 100 ml equivalent to 100 international units (equivalent to 3.5 mg). 1 ml solution contains 1 international unit insulin human*. *Produced in Pichia pastoris by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect Each bag contains approximately 17 mmol sodium (approximately 386 mg) of sodium. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for infusion. Clear, colourless and aqueous solution. The pH range is 6.5 - 7.2 and the osmolality range is 255-345 mOsm/kg. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Inpremzia is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Medicinal product no longer authorised

Special populations

Elderly (≥ 65 years old)

Inpremzia can be used in elderly patients.

In elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified, and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal and hepatic impairment

Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patient's insulin requirements.

In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the Inpremzia dose adjusted on an individual basis.

## Paediatric population

Inpremzia can be used in children and adolescents.

## Transfer from other insulin medicinal products

<!-- image -->

When transferring from other insulin medicinal products, adjustment of the insulin human dose may be necessary. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer, while the patient is receiving short term therapy with Inpremzia, and upon transfer back to previous insulin therapy (see section 4.4). Method of administration Inpremzia is a fast-acting human insulin. It is administered intravenously as an infusion. This should be carried out by healthcare professionals. The infusion rate should be adjusted according to the individual circumstances and blood glucose levels. Monitoring of blood glucose is necessary during the insulin infusion. For detailed instructions, please refer to the end of the package leaflet. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. Visual inspection Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Use only if the solution is clear, without visible particles and the container is undamaged. Administer immediately following the insertion of infusion set. Hyperglycaemia Medicinal product no longer authorised

Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth and loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is potentially lethal.

## Hypoglycaemia

Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected, Inpremzia must not be used. After stabilisation of the patient's blood glucose, adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.8 and 4.9).

Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g., by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes.

Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose.

This medicinal product contains 386 mg sodium (approximately 17 mmol ) in each 100 ml infusion bag, equivalent to 20% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Inpremzia is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a low salt diet.

When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with their previous insulin. Transfer from other insulin medicinal products Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal insulin, human insulin, or insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may result in a need for a change in dose. As treatment with Inpremzia is not intended for the long term, following treatment, patients can continue to use any other type of insulin they have been prescribed. Injection/infusion site reactions As with any insulin therapy, infusion site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. On rare occasions, infusion site reactions may require discontinuation of treatment with this medicinal product. Combination of Inpremzia with pioglitazone Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Inpremzia is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. Excipients (sodium) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism.

The following substances may reduce the patient's insulin requirement: Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids, and sulfonamides.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following substances may increase the patient's insulin requirement: Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol.

Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.

Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement.

Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

<!-- image -->

Summary of the safety profile

Pregnancy There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not pass the placental barrier. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero . Intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. Breast-feeding There is no restriction on treatment with Inpremzia during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the dose may need to be adjusted. Fertility Animal reproduction studies with insulin human have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of hypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control, please see Description of selected adverse reactions below.

At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection/infusion site reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection/infusion site) may occur. These reactions are usually of a transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials of insulin human, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population.

* see 'Description of selected adverse reactions' Description of selected adverse reactions Anaphylactic reactions The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. Hypoglycaemia The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentrating, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea, and palpitation. In clinical trials of insulin human, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control. Paediatric population Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Other special populations

Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials of insulin human, the frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages if too high a dose relative to the patient's requirement is administered.

· Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing products. · Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in order to prevent a relapse. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, insulin (human), ATC code: A10AB01. Inpremzia is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver. A clinical trial in a single intensive care unit treating hyperglycaemia (blood glucose above 10 mmol/L) in 204 diabetic and 1344 non-diabetic patients undergoing major surgery showed that normoglycaemia (blood glucose 4.4-6.1 mmol/L) induced by intravenous insulin reduced mortality by 42% (8% versus 4.6%). Inpremzia is a fast-acting insulin which is administered by intravenous infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals, within the same individual, and different doses.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics.

Inpremzia is administered intravenously and therefore typical patient factors that influence absorption such as injection site and thickness of subcutaneous fat do not impact the pharmacokinetic profile as the product immediately reaches the patient's systemic circulation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

In comparison to subcutaneously administered insulin which have a peak insulin effect between 1.5 and 2.5 hours post dose, serum insulin concentrations increase rapidly immediately upon administration by intravenous infusion.

## Distribution

No profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been observed.

<!-- image -->

Biotransformation Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the insulin human molecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active. Elimination The elimination half-life of Insulin is a few minutes. Paediatric population No studies on the pharmacokinetics of Inpremzia have been performed in pediatric patients. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. 6.

It is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Inpremzia is given by healthcare professionals by an infusion into a vein. It will start to lower your blood sugar shortly after administration and during treatment your blood sugar levels will be carefully monitored to ensure they are well controlled. 2. What you need to know before you are given Inpremzia Do not use Inpremzia: -if you are allergic to insulin human or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). -if you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), see Summary of serious and very common side effects in section 4. -if it has not been stored correctly or if it has been frozen, see section 5. -if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If any of these apply, do not use this medicine. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice.

## Warnings and precautions

Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Inpremzia if:

- you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands.
- you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your blood sugar level.
- you currently have another illness or infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Inpremzia

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.

## Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:

- Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression).
- Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure).

· Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure). · Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever). · Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone). · Sulfonamides (used to treat infections). Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: · Oral contraceptives (birth control pills). · Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention). · Glucocorticoids (such as 'cortisone' used to treat inflammation). · Thyroid hormone (used to treat thyroid gland disorders). · Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol or terbutaline used to treat asthma). · Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounce influence on the body's metabolic processes). · Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). Octreotide and lanreotide (used to treat acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes) Some patients with long standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Inpremzia with alcohol If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.

Inpremzia can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.

There are no restrictions on treatment with this medicine during breast-feeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

Ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or operate a machine if you have frequent hypoglycaemia or find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia.

If your blood sugar is low or high, it might affect your concentration and ability to react and therefore also your ability to drive or operate a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others.

## Inpremzia contains sodium

This medicine contains 386 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 100 ml infusion bag. This is equivalent to 20% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

3. How Inpremzia is given This medicine is given by doctors or nurses in a health care setting. It is given by intravenous infusion, through an injection into a vein. The doctor decides the number of units to be administered, and for how long, based on your medical needs. Details regarding the administration process for health care professionals are at the end of this leaflet. Use in children and adolescents This medicine can be used in children and adolescents. Use in special patient groups If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check your blood sugar more regularly. Discuss the use of this medicine with your doctor. If you are given too much Inpremzia The amount of Inpremzia is determined by the doctor. During treatment your blood sugar will be monitored to ensure you receive the correct amount (see summary of Serious and very common side effects in section 4). If glucose levels decrease to the hypoglycaemic range, the Inpremzia dose should be decreased and glucose or sugary products given orally in the cases of mild hypoglycaemia. In cases of severe hypoglycaemia glucagon can be given by a trained person or glucose can be given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. If you stop using your insulin Do not stop using your insulin without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 4. Possible side effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Serious and very common side effects

Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect which may affect more than 1 in 10 people.

## Low blood sugar may occur if you:

- Receive too much insulin.
- Eat too little or miss a meal.
- Exercise more than usual.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Drink alcohol, see section 2 'Inpremzia with alcohol'

## Signs of low blood sugar:

Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating.

Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital.

<!-- image -->

What to do if you experience low blood sugar: During treatment your blood sugar will be monitored, and your dose level will be adjusted by your doctor or nurse if required. Serious allergic reaction to Inpremzia or one of its ingredients is a very rare side effect, which may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people, but it can be potentially life threatening. Seek medical advice immediately: · If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. · If you suddenly feel unwell , and you start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. List of other side effects Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people ) · Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching) at the injection/infusion site may occur, these usually disappear within a few days to a few weeks after receiving your insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor immediately. See also Serious allergic reactions above. · Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the disturbance is usually temporary. · Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. · Swollen joints: When you start using insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. Very rare side effect (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people ) · Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. Ask your doctor about this. Medicinal product no longer authorised
