## 1. Introduction

## Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria

Paroxysmal  nocturnal  haemoglobinuria  (PNH)  is  a  rare  blood  disorder  with  high  morbidity  and mortality. PNH is clinically defined by the deficiency of the endogenous glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored complement inhibitory protein CD59 on the surface of blood cells. CD59 normally blocks the formation of the terminal complement complex (also called the membrane attack complex) on the erythrocyte surface, thereby preventing haemolysis. The pathophysiology of PNH is directly linked to the complement-mediated destruction of the susceptible PNH red blood cells, which results in  intravascular  haemolysis, the primary clinical manifestation in all PNH patients. PNH is a clonal acquired  genetic  disease  arising  from  a  somatic  mutation  in  the  gene  pig-A,  located  in  the  Xchromosome.  Inactivating  mutations  appear  only  in  a  proportion  of  cells  (PNH  cells)  and  this proportion can vary among patients and over time in a single patient.

The  estimated  prevalence  of  PNH  is  13  cases  per  million.  Patients  have  an  approximately  15  year median survival from its initial diagnosis. PNH is associated with multiple serious morbidities, several of which are potentially life threatening. The common clinical manifestations of PNH are haemolytic anaemia,  venous  thrombosis  and  deficient  haematopoiesis.  Excessive  levels  of  cell-free  plasma haemoglobin during  intravascular  haemolysis  contribute  to  platelet  activation,  procoagulant  activity and thromboembolism (TE), the leading cause of mortality in these patients (45%). Anaemia is highly variable  with  haematocrit  values  ranging  from ≤ 20%  to  normal.  Red  blood  counts  (RBC)  are normochromic and normocytic unless iron deficiency has occurred from chronic iron loss in the urine. Granulocytopenia  and  thrombocytopenia  are  common  and  reflect  deficient  haematopoiesis.  Clinical haemoglobinuria  is  intermittent  in  most  patients  and  never  occurs  in  some,  but  haemosidenuria  is usually present.

There  are  no  therapies  specifically  approved  for  the  treatment  of  PNH  and  no  generally  applicable therapy  adequately  treats  the  serious  conditions  associated  with  PNH.  The  only  curative  treatment available  to  patients  is  bone  marrow  transplantation,  which  allows  the  replacement  of  the  defective cells, however, this treatment is available for only a small proportion of patients since a suitable donor is required. Furthermore, transplantation may be associated with substantial risks. Current treatments for PNH are palliative and do not address the underlying disease process. Transfusion therapy is useful for  raising  the  haemoglobin  level  and  also  for  suppressing  the  marrow  production  of  RBC  during episodes of sustained haemoglobonuria. Iron replacement may be used, however it usually exacerbates haemolysis because of the formation of many new RBC, which may be sensitive to treatment. This may  be  minimized  by  giving  prednisone  (60  mg/d)  or  by  suppressing  the  bone  marrow  with transfusions. Thrombolytic agents are used for acute thrombosis and antithymocite globulin is often used for treating the marrow hypoplasia.

## About the product

Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the human C5 complement protein. The antibody  is  an  IgG2/4  kappa  immunoglobulin  comprised  of  human  constant  regions  and  murine complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) grafted onto human framework light- and heavy-chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa.

Eculizumab recombinant antibody inhibits C5 cleavage to C5a and C5b, preventing the generation of the  terminal  complement  complex  C5b-9  and  thus  blocking  complement-mediated  cell  lysis  and activation.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

The active substance of Soliris, eculizumab, is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG2/4 kappa immunoglobulin) to human complement protein C5. Binding to this protein blocks its cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby inhibiting terminal complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis.

Eculizumab is expressed in a NS0 murine myeloma cell line, produced in a 5,000 L-scale bioreactor and purified using a series of chromatography, concentration and diafiltration, and viral inactivation and  filtration  steps.  The  active  substance  is  formulated  with  a  sodium  phosphate  buffer,  sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections.

The medicinal product is manufactured by sterile filtration and aseptic filling into vials.

Soliris is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion (300 mg/vial) and is diluted in sodium chloride or in a dextrose solution prior to administration.

## · Description of the active substance

The eculizumab antibody (h5G1.1 mAb) is a humanised IgG2/4 kappa antibody, consisting of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains. The heavy chains are comprised of human IgG2  sequences  in  constant  region  1  (CH1),  the  hinge  and  the  adjacent  portion  of  constant region  2  (CH2),  and  human  IgG4  sequences  in  the  remaining  part  of  CH2  and  constant  region 3 (CH3). The light chains are comprised of human kappa sequences. The variable chains consist of human framework regions with grafted murine complementarity determining regions which form the antigen binding site.

There is one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn298 of the heavy chain that is occupied by a range of biantennary oligosaccharides.

Inter-chain disulfide bonds are expected between Cys136 of the heavy chain and Cys214 of the light chain and between Cys228 and Cys231 of the heavy chains.

The  expected  molecular  mass  of  the  protein  is  approximately  148  kDa  based  on  the  predicted amino-acid sequence and the expected glycosylation profiles.

## · Manufacture

The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Portsmouth,  New  Hampshire,  USA  and released by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cheshire, Connecticut USA. These facilities are operated in accordance  to  EU  current  Good  Manufacturing  Practices  (EU  cGMP),  with  standard  operating procedures in place to describe all procedures and controls.

## Development genetics:

The expression plasmid containing the DNA encoding the genes for the heavy chain and light chain was transfected into NS0 cells obtained from a host cell bank. The cells were adapted to suspension culture and following cloning and subcloning steps, one clone was selected as the lead cell line.

Cell bank system:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A two-tiered cell banking system of MCB and Working Cell Bank (WCB) has been developed and maintained in accordance to cGMP and ICH guidelines.

One single ampoule of the pre-seed stock of the lead cell line was thawed and the MCB was obtained following culture and sub-culture in a selective medium, re-suspension of the cells and storage in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen.

The WCB was prepared from one single ampoule of MCB, using the same procedures and media as described for the MCB.

Procedures  followed  in  the  preparation  of  MCB  and  WCB  have  been  appropriately  described.  An extensive  range  of  tests  has  been  performed  for  their  characterisation,  in  accordance  with  ICH guidelines, including identity, viability, stability, presence of adventitious agents.

## Fermentation process

Eculizumab active substance is manufactured in a 5000-L scale production bioreactor. The cells used to  inoculate  the  production  bioreactor  originate  from  a  single  ampoule  taken  from  the  WCB.  Cell culture continues until pre-determined harvest criteria are reached.

Only one bioreactor train is used during the manufacture of a single batch of eculizumab.

There are no reprocessing steps for the cell culture and harvest process.

## Purification process:

Eculizumab  is  purified  using  a  series  of  chromatography,  concentration  and  diafiltration,  and  viral inactivation and filtration steps.

Each  step  of  the  purification  process  has  been  adequately  described,  including  description  of  the elution  buffers,  exchange  buffers,  column  regeneration  and  storage  conditions  of  both  columns  and product after each step.  Suitable in-process controls (IPC) are in place, with acceptable limits.

Two reprocessing  steps  have  been  identified,  consisting  in  the  re-filtration  following  integrity  test failure of the virus reduction filter or of the 0.22 µm final filter

## Manufacturing process development and process validation:

A number of manufacturing changes have been introduced during development, resulting in five main processes for the active substance (A, B, C, D and the commercial process referred to as process E). These changes include:

- A change in cell line at an early stage of development: cell line LEX98 demonstrated higher expression than the original HAL1 cell line used in Process A and was therefore selected. The main clinical studies were conducted with material derived from LEX98 cell line;
- Changes to cell culture medium;
- Various changes to the purification process;
- Scale up of the fermentation process from 200 L to 2000 L and 5000 L;
- Change of manufacturing site.

The comparability exercise to support the different changes is considered adequate and the overall data provided were considered acceptable.

The  validation  program  covers  the  validation  of  the  upstream  and  downstream  processes  of  five consecutively-manufactured  batches  of  active  substance  using  the  proposed  commercial  process (process E) and scale (5000 L).

For the fermentation process, individual results for each lot were provided for all IPCs. The validation program  included  a  complete  analysis  of  several  growth  parameters,  as  well  as  other  process parameters.

The validation of the purification process included analysis of intermediates obtained at each step, and purified  after  several  chromatography  cycles,  with  respect  to  product  purity,  identity,  integrity  and yield.  Reduction  of  process-related  impurities,  bioburden  and  endotoxin  were  also  covered  by  this program. The validation of the purification process was further supported by the evaluation of the re-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

use  of  filtration  membranes,  column  resins,  and  small-scale  evaluation  of  DNA  elimination.    A validation protocol was also provided for the two reprocessing steps.

The overall results obtained generally support the consistency of the active substance manufacturing process.

## Characterisation:

a) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics:

The structure of eculizumab antibody was mainly characterised using Process C material.  Part of these studies was also performed on batches produced with the commercial Process E.

The primary structure was analysed by several methods and no variability has been detected, with the exception of the N- and C-terminal residues on the heavy chain.

The presence of intra-chain disulfide bonds was confirmed and found consistent with those expected for an IgG2/4 antibody.

The amount of alpha-helix and beta-sheet was analysed by circular dichroism.

The  oligosaccharide  analysis  predominantly  showed  bi-antennary  core  fucosylated  glycans  with varying amounts of terminal galactose.

The biological  properties  of  eculizumab  have  been  properly  characterised  and  the  assays  that  were chosen and the data provided are considered adequate.

## b) Impurities

The  potential  product-related  impurities  identified  are  aggregates,  fragments  and  other  product variants.  Potential  process-related  impurities  include  cell  substrate  derived  impurities  (host  cell proteins, DNA), cell culture derived impurities.

Overall, impurities have been properly identified and characterised and are considered well controlled.

## · Specifications

The proposed commercial active substance specifications  have  been  established  in  accordance  with ICH Q6B Guideline.  Tests and acceptance criteria are based upon data obtained from batch analysis of  clinical  supplies  and  manufacturing  process  validation  batches,  stability  studies,  validation  of analytical procedures and development activities. Justification for the specifications was provided.

## · Stability

The  design  of  the  stability  program,  including  the  testing  intervals  and  storage  conditions,  are  in accordance with ICH guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.

Long  term  stability  data  (at  2-8°C)  were  provided  for  commercial  process  E  for  up  to  18  months. Materials from these batches were stored in a container representative of the active substance storage.

All these batches were also monitored in accelerated stability studies at 20-25°C for up to 6 months.

Supportive stability data obtained from process D materials, stored in a non-representative container were also provided for up to 30 months at 2-8°C, and 12 months at 22-28°C.

All results were within the initially proposed specifications for up to 18 months at 2-8°C and up to 3 months at +20-25°C.

As  discussed  below,  several  specification  limits  initially  proposed  by  the  applicant  were  not considered  acceptable.  On  the  basis  on  the  additional  information  provided  during  the  evaluation procedure and the commitment that was made to provide additional stability data considering the new revised specifications, the claimed shelf life of 18 months at 2-8°C was acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The formulation  for  eculizumab  was  based  on  excipients  which  are  commonly  used  in  monoclonal antibody  products  intended  for  administration  by  intravenous  infusion.    The  formulation  did  not change  throughout  the  clinical  development  program  and  is  the  same  as  that  proposed  for  the commercial  product.    Both  long-term  and  accelerated  stability  data  showed  that  this  formulation  is suitable for product stability.  Parameters that can influence protein stability in solution, such as ionic strength, surfactant type and concentration, were evaluated in seven different formulations based on the use of sodium phosphate as a buffering agent.

The proposed container for the medicinal product is a single-use vial (type I glass) with a siliconised butyl  stopper,  an  aluminium  seal  with  a  polypropylene  flip-off  cap.  One  vial  contains  30  ml  of concentrate  to  be  diluted  to  a  final  concentration  of  5  mg/ml  by  addition  into  the  infusion  bag  of 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride, or 5% dextrose in water as diluent.

## · Manufacture of the product

The medicinal product is manufactured at Ben Venue Laboratories, Ohio, USA and Almac Pharma Services, Craigavon, UK is responsible for batch release in the EU. These facilities are operated in accordance to EU cGMP, with standard operating procedures in place to describe all procedures and controls.

The medicinal product manufacturing process mainly consists in a double 0.22 µm filtration followed by an aseptic filling into vials. Filled vials are stoppered and sealed. Medicinal product vials are stored at 2-8°C prior to shipping for secondary packaging.

Sufficient information was provided on all process and operating parameters. Process validation data have shown that the sterile filtration and aseptic filling process are robust and well controlled and that the medicinal product can be consistently manufactured.

## · Specifications

The control of medicinal product relies to a large extent on the same analytical methods as those used for the control of the active substance. The issues that were raised during the evaluation procedure for the active substance generally apply to the medicinal product.

## · Stability of the Product

Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance with ICH guidelines and per protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of medicinal product. Based on the data provided, the approvable shelf life for the medicinal product is 24 months (2 years) at 2-8GLYPH&lt;31&gt;C.

However, a commitment was made to provide additional stability data considering the specifications that the applicant was asked to revise during the evaluation procedure (see below).

Studies  were  performed  to  demonstrate  compatibility  of  the  diluted  medicinal  product  with  the infusion  diluents  (0.9%  sodium  chloride,  0.45%  sodium  chloride,  or  5%  Dextrose  in  water)  and infusion  bag  and  support  a  24  hour  expiry  of  the  diluted  solution.  However,  after  dilution,  it  is recommended to use the medicinal product immediately.

## · Adventitious agents

The raw materials of animal origin used in the manufacturing process of eculizumab are:

- FBS  used  as  a  cryopreservative  agent  in  the  preparation  of  the  MCB  and  WCB.  FBS  is sourced from New Zealand and TSE certificates were provided. Since non-inactivated FBS is used, the Applicant committed to screen cells derived from the WCB for bovine viruses. The Applicant also committed to use inactivated FBS for future cell banks.
- Bovine serum albumin (BSA) used as a medium component for cell banking and cell culture. This raw material is obtained from bovine blood and sourced from Australia and the USA. TSE certificates were provided.
- Cholesterol used as a medium and feed component for cell banking and cell culture. This raw

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

material is obtained from sheep wool grease sourced from Australia and New Zealand.

It was confirmed that polysorbate 80 is manufacture from substances of vegetable and chemical origin.

The low-pH treatment has been validated at pH 3.73 and 3.74 for X-MuLV and 3.78 for HSV. The inactivation kinetic of HSV has been performed in a single run. The Applicant committed to perform additional investigational studies on the efficacy of pH 3.7 treatment on HSV and X-MuLV viruses

Nanofiltration  with  Planova  filters  was  validated  using  X-MuLV,  HSV,  BAV,  and  MVM as model viruses.  The  data  were  generally  satisfactory  but  the  applicant  committed  to  perform  an  additional study to provide duplicate validation data for Planova filters on MVM clearance.

The viral  safety  of  Soliris  is  considered  acceptable  due  to  i)  the  satisfactory  level  of  cell  bank  and unprocessed bulk testing  for  adventitious  viruses,  and  ii)  the  clearance  efficiency  of  the  production process. The applicant satisfactorily clarified some points relating to viral inactivation studies.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines.

No major objection on Quality aspects was identified during the initial evaluation.

The generation of the original cell line, from the expression construct to the selection process was well described. Cell banks have been established and adequately characterised. The Applicant was asked to clarify several aspects of the cell culture procedure and the genetic stability of the cells. These points have been solved.

Other  aspects  of  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  for  which  clarification  and/or  further documentation was requested have been either solved or will be addressed as follow-up measures. The same  conclusion  applies  to  the  comparability  exercise  to  support  the  changes  introduced  in  the manufacturing process.

The  medicinal  product  manufacturing  process  was  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  is  considered adequately controlled. Further information was requested regarding process validation and the issues raised have been satisfactorily addressed.

The description and validation of analytical procedures for the active substance and medicinal product were generally satisfactory except for certain methods for which additional information was requested. These  issues  have  been  solved  except  for  some  minor  points  that  will  be  addressed  as  follow-up measures.

Viral  safety  and  safety  concerning  other  adventitious  agents  including  TSE  were  appropriately demonstrated although several minor points needed to be clarified. These points are now clear and no further concerns have been raised.

The  main  concerns  after  the  initial  assessment  referred  to  the  suitability  of  the  methods  and specifications  in  place  to  detect  the  major  degradation  species  potentially  expected  in  this  type  of product. Although in principle these methods could provide information on oxidised, deamidated and clipped forms, their limits were considered too wide  to reflect variation of these variants. Consequently, the applicant was requested to:

- i) Reconsider the proposed specifications for active substance and medicinal product, and discuss their suitability with regard to monitoring these variants.
2. ii) Provide the release data using tightened specifications for at least batches derived from processes D and E.
3. iii) Commit to develop appropriate methods to specifically monitor these variants, and to implement these methods with appropriate acceptance criteria into the specifications, if appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a consequence, stability analysis would have to be revised taking into account the considerations expressed in the previous paragraph concerning oxidised, deamidated and clipped forms.

The Applicant revised the specifications for both batch release and stability studies, the acceptance criteria  for  several  tests  have  been  tightened  as  requested  and  the  available  data  re-analysed accordingly.  In  addition,  the  suitability  of  the  current  tests  to  detect  the  major  variants  has  been demonstrated by forced degradation studies.

Except  for  a  number  of  quality  points,  which  will  be  addressed  as  part  of  post-approval  follow-up measures, the quality of Soliris has been adequately demonstrated.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

All non-clinical safety studies including the tissue cross reactivity study were GLP compliant.

## Pharmacology

Eculizumab has minimal cross-reactivity with non-primate and primate species, therefore only in vitro pharmacodynamic studies were performed.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

To generate and select an anti human C5 antibody, a panel of mouse hybridomas specific for hC5 were generated and the antibodies produced by these hybridomas were evaluated for their ability to block complement-mediated  haemolysis  and  C5a  generation.  One  hybridoma,  m5G1.1,  was  selected.  The produced antibody m5G1.1 mAb blocked 100% of complement-mediated C5a release and haemolysis at a concentration of 10 µ g/mL. The affinity of m5G1.1 mAb for hC5 under equilibrium conditions in solution was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The calculated Kd for m5G1.1 was 30 pM.

A  humanized  version  of  the  molecule,  h5G1.1  G2/G4  (eculizumab),  was  generated  to  minimize immunogenicity.  The  humanization  strategy  consisted  on  the  graft  of  complementarity  determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody of interest into a human antibody framework. Data presented on the haemolytic assay indicated that the humanization process had no effect on the functional activity of the antibody. The dissociation constant (KD) of eculizumab calculated following on Biacore analysis was 46 pM and 120 pM (at 25°C and 37°C, respectively).

The m5G1.1 mAb epitope on hC5 mapped to the alpha chain. Identical recognition of the hC5 epitope was demonstrated with the single-chain variant of eculizumab, h5G1.1-scFv, which has the variable regions responsible for antigen (hC5) specificity that are identical to those in eculizumab.

Species  cross-reactivity  was  assessed  using  eculizumab  and  sera  from  8  different  species  including human,  baboon,  Rhesus,  Cynomolgus,  chimpanzee,  rat,  pig,  guinea  pig  and  rabbit.  Eculizumab effectively  blocked  haemolytic  activity  of  human  serum  with  complete  inhibition  demonstrated  at approximately 100 nM of antibody. Eculizumab did not effectively block haemolytic activity of sera from any primate or non-primate species tested, even at extremely high concentrations of antibody.

Due to the species specificity of eculizumab, potential pharmacological activities in  vivo have  been explored  with  murine  antibodies  targeting  rodent  C5.    Since  there  are  no  murine  models  of  PNH, studies targeting other therapeutic areas with potential involvement of C5 activation (arthritis, lupus, airway inflammation and cardiac allograft models) have been presented.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Eculizumab  was  tested  for  potential  cross-reactivity  with  normal  human  tissues.  The  antibody  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

applied  to  cryosections  (3  donors  per  tissue)  at  two  concentrations,  5µg/mL  and  30  µg/mL. C5-specific  staining  was  observed  in  smooth  and  striated  (skeletal)  muscle  in  various  tissues  and expressed  in  multiple  cell  types  including  myoepithelium,  myofibroblasts,  renal  tubular  epithelium, and reticulum cells in the human tissues examined. These results are consistent with published reports of C5 expression.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

No specific nonclinical safety pharmacology studies have been conducted.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No specific studies were performed.

## Pharmacokinetics

The potential plasma disposition of eculizumab was evaluated measuring the PKs of an eculizumab variant, h5G1.1 G4 mAb, in a C5-deficient mouse model. The pharmacokinetic study was followed measuring  hC5  and  h5G1.1G4  mAb  concentration  using  a  haemolytic  assay  and  an  ELISA  assay. Methods  used  in  the  plasma  clearance  study  were  not  validated.  The  plasma  clearance  study  was performed as a non-GLP research study.

## · Absorption-Bioavailability

Intravenous  (i.v.)  or  subcutaneous  (s.c.)  doses  of  50,  100  or  150 µ g  of  h5G1.1  G4  mAb  were administered  to  C5-deficient  male  mice  (B10.D2  oSn)  that  had  been  fortified  with  hC5.  Serum samples were collected up to 48 hours after dosing and assayed for the presence of the mAb and hC5 as well as for haemolytic activity. A dose of 50 µg of h5G1.1 G4 mAb administered i.v. resulted in a rapid  and  potent  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  hC5-dependent  serum  haemolytic  activity  that  was maintained  for  at  least  48  hours.  s.c.  administration  also  provided  protection  from  hC5-dependent serum haemolytic activity for at least 48 hours, although there was an initial 12-24 hour delay in this effect.  Serum  hC5  levels  and  antibody  concentrations  were  also  followed.  After  i.v.  injection,  a relatively rapid t 1/2 α of four hours was followed by a slow decline in serum concentrations over the next  48  hours.  In  contrast,  s.c.  administration  was  followed  by  a  progressive  rise  in  serum concentration. Serum levels of the antibody at 24 hours and thereafter were comparable in both s.c. and i.v. injections over the next 48 hours.

The molar ratio of antibody to hC5 required to inhibit in vitro serum complement haemolytic activity was approximately 0.5 to 1.

No pharmacokinetics studies of absorption after repeated doses were performed.

## · Distribution

No specific studies were performed. No protein interaction studies were performed.

## · Metabolism

No metabolism studies have been conducted.

## · Excretion

No specific studies were performed.

## · Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

No single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted with BB5.1 mAb in mice.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with Pharmacodynamic analysis)

In a four week range finding study BB5.1 mAb was administered to Crl:CD-1®(ICR) BR female mice by IV route, once, twice, or three times weekly resulting in weekly dose levels of 30, 60 or 90 mg/kg. Controls received vehicle three times weekly. Neither treatment-related clinical signs nor effects on body weight or body weight change were observed . Serum analysis indicated similar extents of serum complement  inhibition  (mean  haemolysis  &lt;20%,  on  days  8,  15,  23  and  29)  for  mice  treated  with BB5.1 mAb at 60 versus 90 mg/kg/week. Since the extent of haemolytic prevention was so similar at both 60 and 90 mg/kg, and greater at these doses than at 30 mg/kg/day (34±12% haemolysis day 8, 20%±13% day 15, &lt;20% days 22 and 29), the recommended high dose of BB5.1 mAb in subsequent future toxicity studies in mice was 60 mg/kg/week.

A twenty-six week study evaluated the toxicity of BB5.1 mAb. Crl:CD-1®(ICR) BR mice received by IV route BB5.1 mAb at 0 mg/kg twice weekly, 30 mg/kg once weekly, or 30 mg/kg twice weekly (resulting in dose levels of 0, 30 and 60 mg/kg/week respectively). No unscheduled deaths occurred in the 30 mg/kg/wk dose group. Nine unscheduled deaths occurred during the study (4 in controls, and 5  in  high  dose  group);  none  were  related  to  treatment.  Treatment  did  not  affect  any  of  the  toxicity parameters examined. Serum analysis indicated that the extent of mean % haemolysis decreased from pre-treatment levels of 70-80 % to below 20 % in treated mice at weeks 12 and 25. Although results were  similar  for  both  treated  mice  groups,  the  mean  %  haemolysis  was  slightly  less  for  the 60  mg/kg/week  mice  in  most  instances.  Following  a  four-week  recovery  period,  the  mean  % haemolysis approximated pre-study values for both treatment groups.

## · Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  eculizumab  or  any  other  surrogate  anti-C5 antibodies.

## · Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with eculizumab or any surrogate anti-C5 antibodies. The 26-week repeat dose toxicity study with a murine anti-mouse C5 antibody (BB5.1mAb) showed no cytotoxic or proliferative activities suggestive of carcinogenic risk at dose levels up to 60 mg/kg/week, i.e. a dose level showing significant inhibition of C5 activation.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

All studies were claimed to be performed according to GLP.

## Fertility and early embryonic development

BB5.1 mAb was administered by IV injection to male and female Crl:CD-1®(ICR) BR mice at doses of 0, 30 mg/kg/dose once weekly or twice weekly (resulting in 0, 30 or 60 mg/kg/week, respectively) prior to mating and until termination (males) or through early gestation (females).

BB5.1  mAb  showed  no  effect  on  the  reproductive  performance.    Sperm  count  and  motility  were unaffected  and  there  were  no  changes  observed  upon  caesarean  section,  indicative  of  effects  on implantation or embryo-foetal viability.

Analysis of haemolytic activity showed systemic exposure. The mean haemolytic activity at week 10 from low and high dose males was 27.2% and 16.2% respectively. In females, where samples were taken on GD 12, both low and high dose groups had a mean haemolysis of 50.6 %, but the within group variability was significant. The NOAEL for male toxicity was determined to be 60 mg/kg/week, while  the  NOEL  for  female  toxicity,  male  and  female  fertility  and  embryo-foetal  viability  was determined to be ≥ 60 mg/kg/week

## Embryo-foetal development

Premated  female  Crl:CD-1®(ICR)  BR  mice  were  given  BB5.1  mAb  by  IV  injection  either  0  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30  mg/kg/dose  on  GD  6,  9,  12  and  15  (resulting  in  0  or  60  mg/kg/week,  respectively)  or  30 mg/kg/dose on GD 6 and 12 (resulting in 30 mg/kg/week). There was no maternal toxicity and no effect on embryo/foetal viability and growth. No treatment-related foetal malformations were observed in mice treated with 30 mg/kg/week. A single incidence of umbilical hernia and two foetal incidences of  retinal  dysplasia  (one  foetus  from  two  separate  litters)  were  observed  in  offspring  born  from mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose.

The  percentage  of  haemolysis  was  highly  variable  in  the  treated  groups  although  mean  percentage haemolysis was ≤ 62.4% indicating systemic exposure.

The NOEL for maternal toxicity and embryo/foetal toxicity was determined to be ≥ 60 mg/kg/week, based on the lack of maternal and caesarean section findings at 60 mg/kg/week (i.e., the highest dose tested).  Based  on  the  observed  foetal  soft  tissue  malformations  at  60  mg/kg/week,  the  NOEL  for developmental toxicity was determined to be 30mg/kg/week.

## Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function

Female  Crl:CD-1®(ICR)  BR  mice  received  BB5.1  mAb  at  30  mg/kg/dose  once  or  twice  weekly (groups 2 and 3, low and high dose, respectively) or vehicle. The control and high-dose groups were dosed on GD 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 and on LD 2, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.  The low-dose group was dosed on GD 6,  12,  and  18  and  LD  6,  12,  and  18.  There  were  no  compound-related  mortalities  or  clinical observations.  Gestational  and  lactational  body  weights  and  gestational  food  consumption  were unaffected by BB5.1 mAb. There were no compound-related necropsy findings. Natural delivery and litter  data  from  the  F1  offspring  were  unremarkable.  Survival  indices  and  means  for  all  maturation landmarks were similar across groups. Exploratory activity, learning and memory of the F1 offspring were  unaffected  by  BB5.1  mAb  treatment.  There  were  no  compound-related  mortalities  or  clinical observations during the maturation phase.  BB5.1 mAb had no effect on body weight or body weight gain  in  F1  males  (maturation  phase)  or  females  (maturation  and  gestational  phases),  or  overall reproductive  performance  in  the  F1  generation.  Analysis  of  haemolytic  activity  showed  that  mean levels were only slightly lower in treatment groups compared to control group

The NOEL for maternal toxicity and F1 pup development and reproductive performance through to parturition of the F2 generation was determined to be ≥ 60 mg/kg/week.

## · Local tolerance

Local  tolerance  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  eculizumab  or  any  other  anti-C5  antibodies. There were no remarkable macroscopic observations or histomorphological findings at the injection site related to BB5.1 mAb treatment in the toxicity studies performed. Infusion reactions and injection site reactions have been monitored in over 700 patients exposed to eculizumab.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

There were no remarkable macroscopic observations or histomorphological findings in mandibular or mesenteric lymph nodes related to treatment with the surrogate antibody, BB5.1 mAb, in the twenty six week mouse study.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The main route of release will be in waste water, and the PECSURFACE/WATER for eculizumab is below the threshold for Phase I assessment, according to the Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

Results  from in  vitro pharmacology  studies  demonstrate  that  the  humanized  monoclonal  antibody eculizumab inhibits the cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b as well as blocking C5b-9-mediated serum haemolytic activity.

C5 expression has been reported in normal human tissues. Eculizumab binds to C5 on smooth muscle (intrinsic/vascular) and skeletal muscle, myoepithelium, myofibroblasts, renal tubular epithelium, and reticulum cells. Staining of platelets was also observed. The reticulum cell staining likely represents staining  of  C5  associated  with  intracellular  filaments.  Intracellular  staining  is  due  to  the  method  of acetone fixation and cryotomy of the tissue/cell samples.

Pharmacodynamic  studies  have  only  been  performed in  vitro .  Eculizumab  is  a  highly  specific monoclonal antibody binding only to human C5 and not to C5 from any other mammalian species tested.  As  stated  in  the  CHMP  scientific  advice  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  S7,  the  approach  to characterize  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  eculizumab  by in  vitro methods  is  considered  as acceptable in the light of the species specificity. Moreover, no specific safety concerns related to CNS, CV  or  RS  functional  effects  are  reported  from  clinical  safety  data.  Therefore,  the  lack  of  safety pharmacology studies is considered justified.

Although no formal pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed, eculizumab has been administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of medications commonly used in patients with PNH including erythropoietin, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. Therefore, the absence of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is justified taking into account clinical data.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  studies  show  that  the  humanized  mAb  is  functional  in  the  murine  vascular compartment for at least  48  hours  after  injection.  Furthermore,  based  upon  an  average  hC5  plasma concentration of 76 µg/mL [15], and a plasma volume of 3.0 L for a 70kg human, it is predicted that a single  dose  of  1.5-2.0  mg/kg  of  h5G1.1  G4  mAb  should  be  sufficient  to  acutely  mediate  complete inhibition of complement-dependent serum haemolytic activity in vivo in humans.

No tissue distribution studies were performed, since eculizumab bind to a soluble protein, hC5, which is  secreted  into  the  blood.  Eculizumab  cannot  bind  to  mC5  or  function  in  a  murine  system.  No placental  transfer  studies  have  been  done  due  to  the  specificity  of  the  antibody.  However,  IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental/foetal barrier from mother to offspring.

According to the Guideline CHMP/ICH/302/95, the lack of metabolism studies is acceptable.

No  excretion  studies  have  been  performed.    It  is  expected  that  since  antibodies  are  transmitted  in mother's milk, eculizumab will probably also be excreted in the milk.

Although no formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed, eculizumab has been administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of medications commonly used in patients with PNH including erythropoietin, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. Therefore, the absence of pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies is justified taking into account clinical data.

## Toxicology

Toxicological  studies  were  performed  in  mice  using  a  surrogate  murine  anti-mouse  C5  antibody (BB5.1 mAb).  BB5.1 mAb specifically binds to mouse C5 but there was no information on whether the cross-reactivity profile of BB5.1 mAb with normal mouse tissues is similar to the cross-reactivity profile of eculizumab with normal human tissues.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Genotoxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  eculizumab  or  any  other  surrogate  anti-C5 antibodies.  Non-clinical  genotoxicity  studies  are  not  generally  considered  relevant  to  biotechnology products (ICH S6 guideline). Antibodies, in general, do not interact directly with DNA, and therefore are unlikely to have any genotoxic potential.

Reproductive  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  2002  and  2003  and  reviewed  by  an  independent consultant (Rochelle W Tyl, RTI international) that concluded that the observed foetal malformations were unlikely to be treatment related. Nevertheless, these findings could not be discarded and have been addressed in the SPC.

Local effects  following  therapeutic  route  of  administration  are  well  characterized  following  clinical monitoring and, in a lesser extend, repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with the surrogate antibody.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Schematic for Eculizumab PNH clinical studies

<!-- image -->

Additional supportive safety data was obtained in 11 studies in 716 patients in 6 non-PNH indications.

## GCP

According to the applicant, the pivotal study was performed in full compliance with the principles of good clinical practices (GCP). Ethical principles according to the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki were pursued in the major clinical studies.

No special reasons triggering a need for a GCP inspection has been identified.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  applicant  has  conducted  16  eculizumab  clinical  trials  wherein  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  and pharmacokinetics (PK) data were collected and analyzed.

These analyses were performed on patient serum samples derived from both single and multiple dose studies.

PK studies have not been conducted in healthy subjects.

The PK of six single doses of eculizumab was studied in fifty patients in two diseases in two studies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (C97-001-01) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (C97-002-01). These studies  were  conducted  using  a  dense  blood  sampling  schedule.  In  these  phase  I  trials,  serum eculizumab concentrations were recorded over doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg, after single IV bolus injections.

Phase II multiple-dose studies were conducted in patients with RA (C01-004), idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy (IMG) (C99-004), and PNH (C02-001). These multiple-dose studies measured only serum trough and peak eculizumab concentrations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pilot  studies  have  been  conducted  with  eculizumab  in  psoriasis  (C99-007)  and  dermatomyositis (C99-006). These studies measured serum trough eculizumab concentrations.

PK  simulations  were  used  to  predict  eculizumab  concentration  variability  in  PNH  patients  and  to assess the exposure and potential accumulation of eculizumab after repeated administration of fixed doses.

## Methods

## · Analytical methods

To measure the total concentration (bound + free) of eculizumab in human serum samples, an ELISAbased PK assay was developed.

The  ruggedness  of  the  assay  was  validated  by  evaluating  the  effects  of  day-to-day  variability, instrument  variability,  and  user  variability  on  the  reproducibility  of  assay  results.  No  robustness variables were identified for the assay. Quality control samples containing eculizumab concentrations of 20, 120, and 240 µ g/mL were evaluated by 2 separate analysts, using 2 different instruments, on 2 different days.

The stability of QC test samples at multiple concentrations of eculizumab (20, 120, and 240 µ g/mL) was evaluated over time and at multiple storage conditions.

For multiple-dose patients  the  mean  body-weight  normalized  clearance  (CL)  and  volume  of distribution  (Vx)  parameters  were  used  to  derive  values  which  approximate  the  time  to  reach 99%  steady-state  (i.e.  T0.99 )  and  the  accumulation  ratio  (Racc).  Both  of  these  derivations  require calculation  of  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vapp )  at  steady-state  and  the  effective  half-life (T1/2). The apparent volume (Vapp) was calculated as the sum of the central (V1 or Vc) and peripheral (V2 or Vp) compartment volumes. The effective half-life (T1/2) was calculated as 0.693*Vapp/CL. The AUC was calculated from the mean dose ( µ g/kg) divided by the mean clearance (mL/hr/kg). The time to  reach  99%  steady-state  (T0.99 )  and  the  accumulation  ratio  (Racc )  were  then  calculated  using  the formulas [T0.99 = -3.32*T1/2Log(1-0.9999)], and [Racc = (1-2 -ε ) -1 where ε equals the ratio tau/T1/2 and where  Tau  was  estimated  using  the  average  repeated  dosing  interval  of  504  hours.  Re  area  was calculated as the ratio of the single and multiple dose areas under the curve (AUCss,inf/AUCsd,inf).

Kinetics  appear  linear  regarding  clearance.  Elimination  half-life  and  distribution  volume  are  both dose-dependent.

## · Absorption

Eculizumab is administered intravenously with 100% bioavailability.

## · Distribution

Eculizumab's distribution seems to be primarily limited to the vascular space.

The amount of eculizumab associated with non-C5 plasma proteins and the effects of plasma protein binding on eculizumab distribution have not been determined.

## · Elimination

Eculizumab has a mean elimination half-life of approximately 131 hours (from the multiple dose study in RA  patients). Using  sparse PK/PD  data  from  40  PNH  patients  in C04-001,  a standard one-compartmental model analysis yielded higher estimates for T1/2 (271 hours)

## · Excretion

No  specific  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  specific  pathways  of  eculizumab excretion.  According  to  the  applicant,  due  to  its  molecular  size  (148  kD)  eculizumab  like  other immunoglobulins are expected to be excluded from filtration in normal kidneys.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Metabolism

Eculizumab  contains  only  naturally  occurring  amino  acids  and  has  no  known  active  metabolites. Human antibodies are predominately catabolised by lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino acids.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependency

Eculizumab appears to demonstrate dose-dependent elimination and/or distribution in the therapeutic dosing  range.  While  the  exact  mechanisms  of  its  elimination  are  not  completely  understood, eculizumab clearance is thought to be mediated both by specific and non-specific pathways. Saturable specific pathways may be associated with the soluble antigenic target C5, and with the FcRn receptor.

## · Intra- and inter-individual variability

No clinical  studies  have  been  specifically  conducted  to  discern  the  effects  of  age,  race,  gender,  or metabolic status (renal or hepatic impairment) on the PK of eculizumab.

## · Pharmacokinetics in target population

PK parameters were determined from two PNH patient studies: C02-001 (pilot study) and C04-001 (pivotal study).

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Eculizumab binds with high affinity to human serum complement protein C5 (hC5) and inhibits the production of C5b-9 by blocking C5 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner such that a 1:1 molar ratio of eculizumab to C5 is sufficient for C5 inhibition.

A PD assay was developed to measure the haemoglobin release from antibody-sensitized chicken red blood cells (RBC) due to lysis by the terminal complement complex (C5b-9) deposited on the surface of these cells after activation of the classical pathway. C5 cleavage being an obligatory step, the ability of patient serum to lyse sensitized chicken RBCs in this assay is directly proportional to the amount of residual circulating C5 (not neutralised by eculizumab).

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Eculizumab  inhibits  complement-mediated  haemolysis  of  sensitized  red  blood  cells in  vitro and similarly  blocks  the  lysis  of  PNH  red  blood  cells in  vivo in  a  dose-dependent manner,  thus demonstrating effective inhibition of the terminal complement pathway.

The  affinity  of  eculizumab  for  C5  has  been  measured  in  non-clinical  studies  at  30  picomolar  by ELISA  and  120  picomolar  by  surface  plasma  resonance.  Eculizumab  demonstrates  no  appreciable species cross-reactivity. It is highly species specific. with no appreciable activity against chimpanzee, baboon, rhesus or cynomologous monkey, pig, rabbit, guinea pig, or rat complement.

There are no known secondary pharmacological effects of eculizumab because of the highly specific interaction of eculizumab with its target as indicated by the lack of cross-reactivity with C5 from other species.

## · Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

Relationship between eculizumab serum concentration and inhibition of complement activity across multiple  disease  states  suggests  a  specific  minimum  serum  concentration  that  is  sufficient  to  block complement activity in most patients.  This  relationship  exists  at  any  time  during  the  PK  profile,  at peaks and troughs, whether in steady-state or not, and at any time during the dosing interval. Taken together,  these  data  suggest  that  a  target  trough  serum  eculizumab  concentration  of  approximately 35 µ g/mL will be required to maintain complete serum complement inhibition in patients regardless of their  underlying  disease.  For  the  intended  PNH  population,  maintaining  terminal  complement inhibition is necessary to mitigate intravascular haemolysis.

Thus, the dosing schedule of 600 mg weekly for four weeks followed one week later by 900 mg and then a maintenance schedule of 900 mg every 14 (± 2) days has been chosen to maintain the serum concentration of approximately 35 µ g/mL in nearly all treated PNH patients.

No clinically relevant PD interactions between eculizumab and other medications or substances have been observed in any of the clinical subjects.

## Clinical Efficacy

- Dose response study

A formal dose response study was not performed in PNH patients.

Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  pilot  PNH  study,  722  unique  patients  had  been  exposed  to eculizumab in dosing durations ranging from 1 day to almost 3 years. Pharmacokinetic and studies in all relevant patient populations demonstrated that an eculizumab serum concentration of 35 µ g/mL or greater  effectively  inhibited  complement-related  haemolysis using in vitro assays on serum samples from these patients. Extensive PK/PD modelling from human studies indicated that fixed dosing was not  obviously  different  (from  dosing  by  weight.  A  review  of  safety  data,  including  adverse  events (AEs)  and  clinical  laboratory  results,  and  the  potential  for  the  development  of  human  antihuman antibody (HAHA) revealed that the chosen dose would be expected to be safe and well tolerated in the PNH  population.  Data  from  the  C02-001  open-label  pilot  PNH  study  showed  that  treatment  with eculizumab at induction doses of 600 mg per week and maintenance doses of 900 mg every 2 weeks in PNH  patients  demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvements  in  efficacy  endpoints  of  serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and units of PRBCs.

Study C04-001 (TRIUMPH): A Haemoglobin Stabilization and Transfusion Reduction Efficacy and Safety  Clinical  Investigation,  Randomized,  Multi  Centre,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Using Eculizumab in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria Patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## METHODS

## Study Participants

This  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  multicentre,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  trial  using eculizumab in PNH patients.

The  main  inclusion  criteria  were  age ≥ 18 years,  patients  must  have  required  at  least  4  episodes  of transfusions in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 for anaemia or anaemia-related symptoms, patients must have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-deficient red blood cell clone (type III cells) by flow cytometry of ≥ 10%, patients who were taking erythropoietin had to have been on a stable dose for 26 weeks prior to the  screening  visit  (Visit  1)  and  the  dose  remained  stable  during  the  observation  period  and  the treatment phase and patients must have had a platelet count of at least 100,000/mm3 either at Visit 1 or during the observation period.

The main inclusion criteria were patients whose mean haemoglobin level prior to transfusion over the previous 12 months was greater than 10.5 g/dL and patients whose absolute neutrophil count of less than or equal to 500/ µ L.

## Treatments

The treatment was placebo or eculizumab. Placebo patients received placebo IV once a week (within 5-9 days) for 5 doses, then once every 2 weeks (within 12-16 days).

Eculizumab patients received 600 mg of eculizumab IV once a week (within 5-9 days) for 4 doses, followed  by  900  mg  eculizumab  IV  1  week  later  for  1  dose,  then  900  mg  eculizumab  IV  every 2 weeks (within 12-16 days). There was a total of 26 weeks of treatment.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the study population. The  co-primary  endpoints  were  haemoglobin  stabilization  and  number  of  packed  red  blood  cell (PRBC) units transfused.

Secondary objectives were transfusion avoidance, haemolysis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  during  the  treatment  period  from  baseline  to  Visit  18,  and Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Therapy  fatigue  (FACIT-Fatigue)  scale  changes  from Baseline  to  Visit  18.  Exploratory  endpoints  included  LDH  changes  from  baseline  to  Visit  18, European  Organisation  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer  quality-of-life  (QoL)  questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) changes from baseline to Visit 18, thrombosis, platelet activity, and measures of nitric oxide (NO) and free haemoglobin from baseline to Visit 18.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The co-primary endpoints were haemoglobin stabilization and units of PRBCs transfused during the treatment phase. For the haemoglobin stabilization endpoint, patients that reached or dropped below their predetermined haemoglobin set point did not achieve haemoglobin stabilization.

In  order  to  assess  the  robustness  of  results  for  the  co-primary  endpoints,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was performed.

Secondary endpoints included transfusion avoidance, haemolysis as measured by the AUC of LDH, and QoL as measured by the FACIT-Fatigue scale.

Exploratory endpoints included changes of LDH from Baseline to Visit 18, QoL changes as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument, thrombosis rate, platelet activity, and free haemoglobin and NO measures.

## Sample size

The  sample  size  was  selected  to  show  that  incidence  rates  of  haemoglobin  stabilization  during  the treatment phase are 20% and 55% for the placebo and eculizumab groups, respectively. The median units  of  transfusion  during  the  treatment  phase  were  assumed  to  be  6  and  2  for  the  placebo  and eculizumab  groups,  respectively.  Based  on  these  assumptions,  with  35  patients  per  group  and  a 5% Type I error rate for each of the co primary endpoints, the study sample size of 75 patients was designed  for  approximately  82%  power,  using  the  2-sided  Fisher  exact  test  for  haemoglobin stabilization and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for units of PRBCs transfused.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Randomisation

All  the  patients  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  placebo  or  eculizumab  by  a  centralized allocation method. Random assignment took place within 10 days of the qualifying transfusion in the observation period. Randomization was stratified according to the number of PRBC units transfused within 1 year prior to screening. The 3 randomization strata used were:

- between 4 and 14 units, inclusive
- between 15 and 25 units, inclusive, and
- greater than 25 units.

## Blinding

The double-blind  was  maintained  by  using  identical  study  drug  kits  and  labels  for  eculizumab  and placebo.

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis method for the co-primary endpoints was the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

The  analysis  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  transfusion  avoidance  was  carried  out  using  the  2-sided Fisher  exact  test.  As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  those  patients  who  dropped  out  of  the  study  during  the treatment phase prior to having a transfusion are classified as not requiring a transfusion.

The AUC of LDH from Baseline to Visit 18 is presented for each patient and was analyzed using the Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test.  For  the  co-primary  endpoints  and  all  secondary  endpoints,  the  primary analysis was based on the ITT population.

The  FACIT-Fatigue  scale  collected  secondary  endpoint  QoL  data  and  was  scored  according  to  the scoring guideline for this instrument. The change of total FACIT-Fatigue scale score from Baseline was analyzed using a mixed-effects model with Baseline as a covariate, treatment and time as fixed effects, and patient as a random effect.

The exploratory endpoint of the changes of LDH from Baseline up to Visit 18 was analyzed using a mixed-effects model, with treatment and time as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect. Also, LDH change from Baseline to Visit 18 was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

<!-- image -->

## Recruitment

The  patients  were  recruited  at  34  sites  located  in  North  America,  Europe,  and  Australia:  the  first patient/first visit in August 2004 and the last patient/last visit in December 2005. The study period was 1.33 years.

## Conduct of the study

Patients who discontinued study drug during the treatment phase but remained in the study in order to be eligible for a separate extension study underwent all the assessments that would normally have been done at the Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 18, as appropriate, excluding PK/PD assessments. Patients  who  discontinued  the  study  drug  and  chose  to  leave  the  study  before  completing  all  visits were  asked  to  complete  all  the  assessments  that  would  have  been  performed  at  Visit  18,  the  last scheduled study visit.

## Primary efficacy results

Haemoglobin stabilization was achieved in 48.8% of eculizumab patients indicating that these patients did not require any transfusions during the 26-week study duration because their haemoglobin levels remained above their individual set points. Haemoglobin stabilization did not occur among any of the placebo patients and the difference between the treatment groups is statistically significant ( P &lt;0.001). The sensitivity  analysis  performed on the haemoglobin stabilization endpoint confirms this efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

outcome. Those Soliris treated patients who  did not achieve haemoglobin stabilisation still experienced improvements in anaemia with statistically significant reductions in transfusion requirements (p&lt;0.001).

After study treatment, statistically significant differences in haemoglobin stabilization were observed in the low and mid transfusion strata but not the high stratum ( P =0.09).

## Secondary efficacy results

Transfusion avoidance was achieved in half of the patients treated with eculizumab while in none of those treated with placebo. This difference was observed independently of the stratum considered.

Study  C04-002  (SHEPHERD):  Safety  in  Haemolytic  PNH  Patients  Treated  with  Eculizumab:  A Multi-centre Open-label Research Design Study

This was a phase III, open-label, multicentre study of eculizumab administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion to 97 PNH patients with haemolysis for a total of 52 weeks, with a pre-specified 26-week interim analysis.

The primary objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  eculizumab  in  patients  with  at  least  one  blood transfusion in the previous 24 months.

Patients ≥ 18  years  who  had  received  at  least  1  blood  transfusion  in  the  previous  24  months  were eligible.  A  PNH  type  III  erythrocyte  population ≥ 10%,  platelets ≥ 30,000/mL,  and  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were also required as inclusion criteria. Patients  who  had  received  another  investigational  drug  within  30  days  of  the  first  visit  or  had  an absolute  neutrophil  count  &lt;  500/ µ L  were  excluded.  Patients  with  complement  deficiency,  active bacterial infection, prior meningococcal disease, or prior bone marrow transplant were also excluded.

During the induction period, patients received 600 mg of eculizumab administered by IV infusion once a  week  for  4  doses,  followed  by  900  mg  eculizumab  IV  1  week  later  for  1  dose.  During  the maintenance period, patients received 900 mg eculizumab IV every 2 weeks for a total of 52 weeks treatment. Each dose was administered by IV infusion over 25 to 45 minutes.

The primary surrogate of efficacy was haemolysis as measured by LDH area under the concentration curve (AUC). The secondary endpoints were haemolysis as measured by LDH change from baseline and quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue  (FACIT-Fatigue).  Exploratory  endpoints  were  Quality  of  life  as  measured  by  the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), thrombosis, platelet activity, nitric oxide (NO), and free haemoglobin measures.

from baseline, with median LDH decreasing from 2,051 U/L pre-treatment to 269 U/L at 52 weeks (P&lt;0.001).  Assessments  of  functional  status  as  the  Fatigue  Scale  Scoring  also  showed  relevant differences from baseline.

Study E05-001 (An extension study of C04-001, C04-002, and C02-001): A Phase III, Open-Label, Extension  Study  of  Eculizumab  in  Patients  with  Transfusion  Dependent,  Haemolytic  Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) Who Have Participated in the TRIUMPH (C04-001), SHEPHERD (C04-002) or X03-001 Studies.

E05-001  is  a  phase  III,  open-label,  extension  study  of  eculizumab  in  patients  with  transfusion dependent, haemolytic PNH who have participated in the TRIUMPH (C04- 001), SHEPHERD (C04002), or X03-001 Studies. Thus virtually all patients enrolled in eculizumab trials in PNH were entered in this extension protocol. TE events is the leading cause of morbid-mortality in patients with PNH.

The E05-001 statistical analysis plan prospectively identified that TE event rates would be analyzed as a cumulative event rate in the combined eculizumab-treated study population including data from all PNH trials (C02-001, E02-001, X03-001, C04-001, and C04-002). As was specified for all E05-001 planned comparisons, TE event rates during eculizumab treatment were compared to pre-eculizumab event rates in the same patients. However, it should be noted that findings from these studies were shown in non-controlled clinical trials.

Eculizumab  treatment  substantially  reduced  TE  events  in  the  combined  eculizumab-treated  PNH patient  population.  The  reduction  in  TE  event  rate  during  eculizumab  treatment  as  compared  to individual matched patients pre-treatment was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001).

Updated study E05-001 analysis of November 2006 data base lock of all eculizumab-treated patients which includes an additional 120 patient years of exposure shows that the reduction in thromboembolism risk has been maintained. When compared to the rate of thromboembolism events in all enrolled patients before treatment, eculizumab  treatment  results in a reduction in the thromboembolism  event  rate  in  the  same  patients  in  each  of  the  individual  clinical  studies  and  a significant  7-fold  reduction  in  the  thromboembolism  event  rate  overall  from  7.37  events  per  100 patient  years  pre-eculizumab  treatment  to  1.07  events  per  100  patient  years  during  eculizumab treatment (P&lt;0.001) (see table below).

- Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  demonstration  of  efficacy  of  Soliris  in  PNH  patients  with  haemolysis  was  assessed  in  a randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  26  week  study  (C04-001).  PNH  patients  were  also treated with Soliris in a single arm 52 week study (C04-002) and in a long term extension study (E05001)

In  TRIUMPH,  study  patients  treated  with  Soliris  had  significantly  reduced  (p&lt;  0.001)  haemolysis resulting in improvements in anaemia as indicated by increased haemoglobin stabilization and reduced need  for  RBC  transfusions  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients.    These  effects  were  seen  among patients  within  each  of  the  three  pre-study  RBC  transfusion  strata  (4  -  14  units;  15  -  25  units; &gt;  25  units).  After  3  weeks  of  Soliris  treatment,  patients  reported  less  fatigue  and  improved  healthrelated quality of life. In SHEPHERD, a reduction in intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in increased transfusion avoidance, a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. From the 195 patients that originated in C04-001, C04-002  and  C02-001,  Soliris-treated  PNH  patients  were  enrolled  in  a  long  term  extension  study (E05-001). All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular haemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months.  There were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, this finding was shown in non-controlled clinical trials.

## Clinical safety

Actually, the safety and efficacy of eculizumab were assessed in three separate studies including

- Study  C02-001:  an  11  patient  open-label  12  week  phase  2  study;  this  study  had  two study-specific extension studies (E02-001 and X03-001) totalling an additional 156 weeks).
- Study  C04-001  (TRIUMPH):  a  87  patient  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 26-week phase 3 study,
- Study C04-002 (SHEPHERD) : an ongoing 97 patient open-label 52 week phase 3 study,

Since  eculizumab  is  a  humanised  monoclonal  antibody,  expected  class  effects  included  immune responses  such  as  post-infusion  reactions  and  human-antibodies  (HAHA),  though  the  frequency  of these across PNH and non-PNH patients has been similar between Soliris and placebo treated patients. In  addition,  due  to  the  inhibition  of  the  distal  complement  components,  an  increased  incidence  of infections  by  encapsulated  bacteria  was  expected.  Literature  describes  an  increased  susceptibility  to Neisseria in patients with terminal complement deficiencies, particularly N. meningitides . Pneumococcal or Haemophilus influenzae infections are not described as increased in the literature as opposed to in patients with early complement components (C1-C4). Nevertheless, although with a less empirical basis, general infections were considered as a relevant potential risk. The potential for severe haemolysis  following  discontinuation  of  eculizumab  due  to  the  possible  increase  of  the  PNH  RBC clone during treatment also emerged as a potential risk haemolysis.

## · Patient exposure

All patients successfully completing studies previously mentioned were eligible to enrol in an ongoing open-label  104  week  phase  3  extension  study  (Study  E05-001)  which  is  anticipated  to  enrol approximately 190 patients.

The  PNH  safety  database  reflects  a  cumulative  264  patient-years  during  review  of  the  dossier. Supportive safety data were obtained in 11 clinical studies that included 716 patients (492.20 patient years) exposed to eculizumab in six other indications.

## · Adverse events

Adverse  events  reported  at  a  very  common  ( ≥ 10.0%)  or  common  (5.0  -  10.0%)  frequency  with eculizumab in a total of 140 patients in C04-001 and C04-002 are listed by system organ class and preferred term in the following table. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity.

In  the  combined  Phase  III  PNH  studies  C04-001  and  C04-002,  headache  was  the  most  common adverse  event  observed  with  eculizumab.  Headaches  were  observed  in  49.3%  (69/140  patients)  of patients  treated  with  eculizumab  and  27.3%  (12/44  patients)  in  placebo-treated  patients  and  were mild/moderate in all  but  5  eculizumab  treated  and  1  placebo-treated  patients.  Most  headaches  were mild  and  did  not  persist  after  the  initial  administration  phase  of  Soliris.  In  addition,  the  following adverse  events  were  increased  in  frequency  by  5%  or  more  with  Soliris  as  compared  to  placebo: headache  (49.3%),  nasopharyngitis  (25.0%),  nausea  (17.1%),  pyrexia  (14.3%),  myalgia  (7.9%), fatigue  (7.9%),  and  herpes  simplex  (5.7%).  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  incidence  of infection across PNH studies with eculizumab as compared to placebo, including serious infections, severe infections or multiple infections. In C04-001 and C04-002, Soliris treatment was discontinued following adverse events in one patient (pregnancy). This event was unrelated to Soliris.

## · Serious adverse events and deaths

In study C04-001, 4 eculizumab patients reported 5 severe TEAEs including haemolysis, abscess limb (left arm), headache, pregnancy, and exacerbation of PNH that required hospitalization. Eight placebo patients reported 14 severe TEAEs including anaemia, neutropenia (2 events), constipation, cellulitis, folliculitis,  viral  infection,  dehydration,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  upper  abdominal  pain,  and exacerbation  of  PNH  that  required  hospitalization  (3  events).  Serious  adverse  reactions  occurred among 4 (9%) patients receiving Soliris and 9 (21%) patients receiving placebo. The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In C04-001 and C04-002 combined, SAE occurred in more than one patient and at a frequency greater than placebo for two SAEs, namely: intervertebral disc protrusion (1.4%, vs 0%) and headache (1.4% vs 0%).

The SAE incidence rates for patients who were enrolled in C04-001 and have accumulated 6 months of exposure in E05-001 were generally similar compared to those observed in the C04-001 eculizumab and placebo treatment groups.

There were three deaths in PNH patients treated with eculizumab and two deaths in non-PNH patients treated  with  eculizumab.  No  death  related  to  eculizumab  was  reported  by  the  applicant.  The  first patient with PNH died due to cerebral herniation with a previous history of multiple TE events. He had experience a TE event following subtherapeutic anticoagulation, after the withdrawal of eculizumab. The investigator considered not to be related to eculizumab treatment. The second died due to chronic myelomonocytic  leukaemia  in  a  patient  with  a  previous  history  of  myelodisplastic  syndrome (considered  not  related  to  eculizumab  treatment  by  the  investigator).  The  third  died  due  to  a cerebrovascular  accident  in  a  patient  treated  under  compassionate  use  with  life-threatening  anaemia and  presumed  intermittent  sepsis  (considered  also  not  related  to  eculizumab  treatment  by  the investigator).  The  two  cases  occurred  in  non-PNH  patients  were:  an  accidental  electrocution (eculizumab unrelated, according to the investigator) and a sepsis due to Candida species following gallbladder  surgery  complicated  by  abscess  formation  and  bowel  resection  for  a  perforation  of  the diverticulum.

## · Laboratory findings

In 151 patients included in the eculizumab population versus 44 with placebo, increased RBC indices MCH, MCHC and MVC, as well as a positive shift in the reticulocyte differential count were observed in eculizumab-treated patients but not in the placebo arm (shift table analysis). LDH, AST, CK and free  haemoglobin  levels  shifted  from  high  to  normal.  There  was  also  a  shift  to  high  ferritin  in eculizumab-treated PNH-patients.

The  shifts  from  normal  to  low  WBC  (24  patients  treated  with  eculizumab  vs  0  with  placebo)  and absolute  neutrophil  counts  were  slight  and  without  apparent  clinical  significance.  There  was  also  a shift  from  normal  to  high  in  alkaline  phosphatase  (normal  to  high  in  19  patients  treated  with eculizumab versus 0 in placebo), direct bilirubin levels (42 patients treated with eculizumab vs 8 with placebo) and APTT (43 patients treated with eculizumab versus 2 treated with placebo). No shifts were detected for INR or ATT ratio. 28/43 of these patients were on concomitant anticoagulant medication. Three patients for eculizumab and 0 for placebo shifted from normal to high for creatinine. Serum total protein and uric acid showed shifts towards normal.

666 patients treated with eculizumab were included and 221 patients with placebo. In the non-PNH patients  treated  with  eculizumab,  haematological  parameters  (monocytes  and  RBCs)  tended  to  shift towards normal. ALT (15 for eculizumab, 4 for placebo), AST (12 for eculizumab, 2 for placebo), BUN (40 for eculizumab, 10 for placebo) and uric acid (27 for eculizumab, 8 for placebo) shifted to high in treated populations and creatinine levels (27 for eculizumab, 8 for placebo) in both treated and untreated  patients.  There  were  no  shifts  in  creatinine  levels.  Serum  albumin  and  total  protein  count rose to normal.

## · Safety in special populations

There have been no studies of eculizumab in patients with any disease and less than 18 years of age.

## · Immunological events

Adverse  events  related  to  the  specific  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  drug  class  may  include infusion  reactions  and  immunogenicity.  For  all  HAHA  (Human  Anti-Human  Antibody)  analyses, positive and negative both IgG and IgM responses were provided at each study visit where a sample was collected and analysed.

In  the  C04-001  study,  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  reported  a  24  hour  post-infusion  AE  with eculizumab than with placebo (79.1% versus 65.9%), and a slightly larger proportion of eculizumab patients reported a 48 hour post-infusion AE (86.0% versus 70.5%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1  of  43  eculizumab-treated  patients  and  1  of  44  placebo-treated  patients  demonstrated  a  detectable HAHA response during the C04-001 study. The single response in the eculizumab cohort was of low titer,  and  had  no  apparent  effect  on  the  PK/PD  of  eculizumab.  There  was  no  evidence  of  reduced biological or clinical activity of eculizumab in PNH patients irrespective of HAHA. Infusion reactions, including allergic reactions, were not associated with any HAHA responses.

In general, no neutralizing HAHA responses have been observed with eculizumab treatment in 911 patients, some of whom have had chronic exposure for up to 4 years.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Soliris  was  investigated  in  PNH  studies  in  which  patients  received  conventional  treatments  as background treatment. Although no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, Soliris has been administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of medications commonly used in patients with PNH including erythropoietin, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Soliris.

- Discontinuation due to AES
- The single DCAE [explain] with eculizumab in C04-001 was due to pregnancy. The patient's pregnancy continued through to the full term with no foetal abnormalities reported.
- Subsequent to the database lock, a single E05-001 patient withdrew from the study due to an SAE, progression of his pre-existing MDS to CMML, which was determined to be unrelated to study medication. The patient subsequently died due to this pre-existing condition.
- A second patient discontinued due to newly recognized MDS. The patient was withdrawn to prepare for possible bone marrow transplantation. The cause of the MDS was identified to be the patient's underlying indication (PNH) and possibly related to eculizumab.
- One  patient  discontinued  C04-002  due  to  intervertebral  disc  protrusion  AE.  This  patient subsequently died. Both events were unrelated to eculizumab treatment.

Discontinuation  of  or  non-compliance  with  eculizumab  treatment  regimen  was  not  associated  with subsequent  serious  haemolysis  in  PNH  studies  C02-001,  C04-001,  C04-002,  and  E05-001.  Serious haemolysis  did  not  ensue  in  each  of  five  patients  who  discontinued  eculizumab  treatment  after receiving eculizumab for a range of 29-715 days prior to withdrawal. Updated safety database shows that  in  PNH  clinical  studies,  16  patients  discontinued  the  Soliris  treatment  regimen.    Serious haemolysis was not observed.

Furthermore,  in  an  additional  9  patients  with  12  episodes  of  non-compliance  with  the  eculizumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dosing regimen, there were no episodes observed in which patients demonstrated increased haemolysis over pre-treatment levels with signs and/or symptoms of serious haemolysis.

Patients  that  discontinued  eculizumab  treatment  were  effectively  managed  by  standard  of  care  and none reported serious haemolysis subsequent to discontinuation of eculizumab therapy.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

Safety data for eculizumab as a treatment for PNH was collected in six clinical studies that included 195 patients (147.44 patient-years) treated with eculizumab with approximately 70 % (138) treated for at least 26 weeks and approximately 20 % treated for at least 52 weeks. Updated safety information in PNH  reflects  264  patient-years  of  Soliris  exposure.  Supportive  data  were  obtained  in  11  clinical studies that included 716 patients (492.20 patient years) in other indications.

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  eculizumab  treated  patients  are  headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue, and herpes simplex, each occurring in 5 or more out of 100 patients. Eculizumab treatment did not seem to be associated with an increase in severity of AEs  in  treated  patients.  No  cumulative,  irreversible  toxicities  or  treatment  related  deaths  were reported.

Identified  risks  are  general  infections,  especially  meningococcal  infections,  haemolysis  after  drug discontinuation and haematologic abnormalities.

Three cases of meningococcal infections were reported, one in an unvaccinated non-PHN (idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis -IMG-) patient and one in each of two vaccinated PNH patients. The first case was considered as possibly related to eculizumab whilst the second two were considered to be probably related to eculizumab  by  investigators. Prior to initiating Soliris therapy, it is recommended  that  PNH  patients  should  receive  immunizations  according  to  current  immunization guidelines. Additionally, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcus at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris. If available, tetravalent, conjugated vaccines are recommended.

Infrequent, low titre antibody responses have been detected in Soliris treated patients across all PNH and non-PNH studies with a frequency (3.4%) similar to that of placebo (4.8%). No patients have been reported  to  develop  neutralizing  antibodies  following  therapy  with  Soliris,  and  there  has  been  no observed  correlation  of  antibody  development  to  clinical  response  or  adverse  events.  However,  the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies is highly dependent on the specificity and sensitivity of the technique and the applicant has committed to develop a specific HAHA technique to be used in future trials as a follow-up measure (FUM).

A number of laboratory parameters shifted from normal to high in ¨PNH and non-PNH patients. The applicant states that available information on haematological findings for PNH tends to reflect changes related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  eculizumab, although  this  statement  might be arguable. Most laboratory  parameter  alterations  in  PNH  were  not  confirmed  in  non-PNH  patients.  Of  particular relevance  are  the  increases  in  APTT,  direct  bilirubin  and  alkaline  phosphatase.  The  applicant  notes that a number of PNH patients with a APTT increase were on anticoagulant treatment, which is in fact quite frequent in PNH patients, although the type of treatment is not specified (e.g. heparin treatment). The presence of antibodies against anticoagulation factors was not detected. The rest of the findings were not confirmed in the non-PNH patients.

With the provided information, however, no specific laboratory parameter was consistently found for PNH  or  non-PNH  population  and  not  for  placebo.  To  date  there  are  no  reasons  to  suspect  any clinically relevant laboratory adverse event.

No second tumours, other than transformation in CMML in a patient with MDS, were detected. Due to eculizumab's proposed mechanism of action, tumoural immunity is not expected to be affected in a major manner. There were no preclinical findings regarding this issue either. However, since limited long-term safety data are available and long term treatment is expected to be the rule, it seems sensible to keep carcinogenic potential in focus, particularly regarding haematological abnormalities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Due to its mechanism of action, Soliris therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. The overall severity and frequency of infections in Soliris treated patients was  similar  to  placebo  treated  patients  in  clinical  studies,  although  an  increase  in  the  number  and severity of infections, particularly due to encapsulated bacteria, cannot be excluded. Patients should be provided  information  from  the  Patient  Information  Leaflet  to  increase  their  awareness  of  potential serious infections and the signs and symptoms of them.

Further  limitations  of  the  safety  database  include  renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  absence  of  data  in children  or  in  pregnant  and  lactating  women  and  the  lack  of  information  regarding  drug-drug interactions.

Treatment with Soliris should not alter anticoagulant management. If serious haemolysis occurs after Soliris discontinuation the procedures and treatments are described in the SPC.

Contraindications for the use of Soliris are hypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine proteins or to any of the excipients. Soliris therapy shall not be initiated in patients:

- with unresolved Neisseria meningitides infection.
- who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitides.
- who have known or suspected hereditary complement deficiencies.

Given the need to further collection of information of most important identified risks, and the need to complement global and long-term safety data, the safety registry has been included as a FUM with clearly predefined timelines for the provision of the revised registry protocol and its implementation. Periodic information from such registry will be provided with the PSURs.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is  of  the  opinion  that  the  risk minimisation activities listed under 3.5 are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## 5. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

## Risk Management Plan

Safety specifications have considered most important risks. There are some limitations regarding the size  of  the  safety  database  and  the  duration  of  a  treatment.  Further  experience  will  be  gained  from post-marketing experience.

Regarding specific risks, the immunogenicity of the drug in clinical trial appeared to be similar to the immunogenicity  profile  of  placebo  in  both  PNH  and  non-PNH  studies.  No  signal  regarding autoimmune-like  AE  related  to  eculizumab's  administration  have  been  detected.  However,  the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies is highly dependent on the specificity and sensitivity of the technique and the applicant has committed to develop a specific HAHA technique to be used in future trials (FUM).

No second tumours, other than transformation in CMML in a patient with MDS, were detected. Due to eculizumab's proposed mechanism of action, tumoural immunity is not expected to be affected in a major manner. There were no preclinical findings regarding this issue either. However, since limited

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

long term safety data are available and long term treatment is expected to be the rule, it seems sensible to keep carcinogenic potential in focus, particularly regarding haematological abnormalities.

Even  though,  in  general,  interactions  with  antibodies  are  difficult  to  predict,  no  formal  interaction studies have been performed. The lack of this information is clearly stated in the SPC.

Anticipated  use  in  populations  in  which  data  are  missing  has  been  discussed  (e.g.  use  during pregnancy).  However,  the  absence  of  a  paediatric  clinical  development  program  has  not  been  fully justified.  The MAH will address this issue as a part of the registry that will be set up with patients treated in clinical practice.

A  global  safety  registry  has  been  proposed  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity,  which  is considered  of  the  highest  interest. The proposed activities  seem  adequate  and  appear  to  be  feasible taking into account the incidence of the disease and the need of follow up usually required for patients with PNH.

Following review, the current safety protocol and CRF should be revised and an agreement with the CHMP should be reached prior to the actual launch of the product (FUM). The applicant should also assess the immunogenicity of eculizumab using samples collected in a cohort of patients through the Soliris  Safety  Registry  (FUM).  The  risk  of  haematological  abnormalities,  of Neisseria  gonorrhoea , pneumococcal infection and Haemophilus influenzae as well as the risk of off label use and paediatric off label use should be followed through the Soliris Registry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product:

## Risk minimisation activities

1.  The  MAH  shall  agree  the  details  of  a  distribution  system  with  the  National  Competent Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that:
- drug  distribution  will  only  be  possible  after  checking  that  the  patient  has  effectively received a meningococcal vaccination with a written confirmation
- prior to distribution, all health care professionals are provided with information on the following key safety concerns:
4. o Headache
5. o Infusion reaction
6. o Neisseria and general infection
7. o Risk of serious haemolysis following eculizumab discontinuation and proposed management
8. o Pregnancy and need of adequate contraception in women of childbearing potential
9. o Immunogenicity
10. o Renal and hepatic impairment.
2.  Prior to launch, the MAH shall agree on the implementation of a patient card system in each Member Sate. This patient card will provide details of the signs and symptoms of infection as  well  as  instruction  for  the  patient  to  immediately  seek  medical care. The card will also provide  information  to  health  care  professionals  that  the  patient  is  receiving  Soliris treatment.
3. The MAH shall propose a detailed methodology for the Health Care Professionals and Patient survey. In addition to the assessment of the satisfaction of eculizumab information provided, the proposed questionnaire will investigate other methods for assessing the effectiveness of the  risk  minimisation  program  (e.g.  surveys  to  follow  compliance  to  vaccination).    The evaluation of the goals for distribution of educational materials should also be considered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with  existing  guidelines.  The  fermentation  and  purification  of  the  active  substance  have  been adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance has been well characterised with regard  to  its  physicochemical  and  biological  characteristics,  using  state-of  the-art  methods,  and  the specifications that have been set are acceptable. The manufacturing process of the medicinal product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the medicinal product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. The viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents  including  TSE  have  been  sufficiently  assured.  Except  for  a  number  of  quality  points,  which will  be  addressed  as  part  of  post-approval  follow-up  measures,  the  overall  quality  of  Soliris  is considered acceptable.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

## Pharmacology

Eculizumab is a highly specific monoclonal antibody binding only to human C5 and not to C5 from any other mammalian species tested. As stated in the CHMP scientific advice and in accordance with ICH  S7,  the  approach  to  characterize  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  eculizumab  by in  vitro methods is considered as acceptable in the light of the species specificity. Moreover, no specific safety concerns related to CNS, CV or RS functional effects are reported from clinical safety data. Therefore, the lack of safety pharmacology studies is considered justified.

In  vitro pharmacology  studies  demonstrate  that  the  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  eculizumab inhibits  the  cleavage  of  C5  to  C5a  and  C5b  as  well  as  blocking  C5b-9-mediated  serum  haemolytic activity.

C5 expression has been reported in normal human tissues. Eculizumab binds to C5 on smooth muscle (intrinsic/vascular) and skeletal muscle, myoepithelium, myofibroblasts, renal tubular epithelium, and reticulum cells. Staining of platelets was also observed. The reticulum cell staining likely represents staining  of  C5  associated  with  intracellular  filaments.  The  tissue  and  cell  staining  likely  represents staining  of  intracellular  C5.  Intracellular  staining  is  due  to  the  method  of  acetone  fixation  and cryotomy of the tissue/cell samples.

Although no formal pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed, eculizumab has been administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of medications commonly used in patients with PNH including erythropoietin, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. Therefore, the absence of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is justified taking into account clinical data.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  studies  show  that  the  humanized  mAb  is  functional  in  the  murine  vascular compartment for at least 48 hours after injection. Furthermore, based upon an average hC5 plasma concentration of 76 µg/mL, and a plasma volume of 3.0 L for a 70kg human, it is predicted that a single  dose  of  1.5-2.0  mg/kg  of  h5G1.1  G4  mAb  should  be  sufficient  to  acutely  mediate  complete inhibition of complement-dependent serum haemolytic activity in vivo in humans.

No tissue distribution studies were performed, since eculizumab bind to a soluble protein, hC5, which is  secreted  into  the  blood.  Eculizumab  cannot  bind  to  mC5  or  function  in  a  murine  system.  No placental transfer studies have been done due to the specificity of the antibody.

## According to the Guideline CHMP/ICH/302/95, the lack of metabolism studies is acceptable.

No  excretion  studies  have  been  performed.    It  is  expected  that  since  antibodies  are  transmitted  in mother's milk, eculizumab will probably also be excreted in the milk.

Although no formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed, eculizumab has been administered to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of medications commonly used in patients with PNH including erythropoietin, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, anticoagulants, and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

immunosuppressants. Therefore, the absence of pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies is justified taking into account clinical data.

## Toxicology

Toxicological  studies  were  performed  in  mice  using  a  surrogate  murine  anti-mouse  C5  antibody (BB5.1 mAb).  BB5.1 mAb specifically binds to mouse C5 but there was no information on whether the cross-reactivity profile of BB5.1 mAb with normal mouse tissues is similar to the cross-reactivity profile of eculizumab with normal human tissues.

Genotoxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  eculizumab  or  any  other  surrogate  anti-C5 antibodies.  Antibodies,  in  general,  do  not  interact  directly  with  DNA,  and  therefore  are  unlikely  to have any genotoxic potential.

Reproductive toxicity studies revealed, that although the observed foetal malformations were unlikely to be treatment related, they can not be discarded.

Local effects  following  therapeutic  route  of  administration  are  well  characterized  following  clinical monitoring and, in a lesser extend, repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with the surrogate antibody.

## Efficacy

The efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with haemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (C04-001). PNH patients were also treated with Soliris in a single arm  52 week study  (C04-002) and in a long term  extension study (E05-001). In all studies, the dose of Soliris was 600 mg study drug every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration.  Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes.

Patients treated with Soliris had significantly reduced (p&lt; 0.001) haemolysis resulting in improvements in anaemia as indicated by increased haemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC  transfusions  compared  to  placebo  treated  patients.    These  effects  were  seen  among  patients within  each  of  the  three  pre-study  RBC  transfusion  strata  (4  -  14  units;  15  -  25  units;  &gt;  25  units). After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular haemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment.

## Safety

Safety data for eculizumab as a treatment for PNH was collected in six clinical studies that included 195 patients (147.44 patient-years) treated with eculizumab with approximately 70 % (138) treated for at least 26 weeks and approximately 20 % treated for at least 52 weeks. Supportive data were obtained in 11 clinical studies that included 716 patients (492.20 patient years) in other indications.

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  eculizumab  treated  patients  are  headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue, and herpes simplex, each occurring in 5 or more out of 100 patients. Eculizumab treatment did not seem to be associated with an increase in severity of AEs  in  treated  patients.  No  cumulative,  irreversible  toxicities  or  treatment  related  deaths  were reported.

Identified and potential risks are general infections, especially meningococcal infections, haemolysis after drug discontinuation and haematologic abnormalities.

Further  limitations  of  the  safety  database  include  renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  absence  of  data  in children  or  in  pregnant  and  lactating  women  and  the  lack  of  information  regarding  drug-drug interactions.

Given the need to further collection of information of most important identified risks, and the need to complement global and long-term safety data, the safety registry has been included as a FUM with clearly predefined timelines for the provision of the revised registry protocol and its implementation. Periodic information from such registry will be provided with the PSURs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the risk minimisation activities listed under 3.5 are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

- User consultation

The Applicant performed a readability testing ('user consultation') and a satisfactory report has been provided.

## Risk-benefit assessment

PNH is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Available therapies have a limited effect and do not affect the course of the disease. Eculizumab reduces C5-mediated intravascular haemolysis in  patients  with  PNH. This effect results in a relevantly reduced need of transfusions and improved functional and quality of life status. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular haemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment.

The identified safety risks have been adequately addressed by the applicant. The applicant agreed to collect  further  information  on  the  most  important  identified  and  potential  risks  and  to  complement global and long-term safety data using a global safety registry with agreed timelines for the provision of the revised registry protocol and its implementation. Periodic information from such registry will be provided with the PSURs.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
- the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:
1.  The  MAH  shall  agree  the  details  of  a  distribution  system  with  the  National  Competent Authorities and must implement such programme nationally to ensure that:
- drug  distribution  will  only  be  possible  after  checking  that  the  patient  has  effectively received a meningococcal vaccination with a written confirmation
- prior  to  distribution,  all  health  care  professionals  are  provided  with  information  on  the following key safety concerns:
-  Headache
-  Infusion reaction
-  Neisseria and general infection
-  Risk  of  serious  haemolysis  following  eculizumab  discontinuation  and  proposed management
-  Pregnancy and need of adequate contraception in women of childbearing potential
-  Immunogenicity
-  Renal and hepatic impairment.
2.  Prior to launch, the MAH shall agree on the implementation of a patient card system in each Member Sate. This patient card will provide details of the signs and symptoms of infection as  well  as  instruction  for  the  patient  to  immediately  seek  medical care. The card will also provide  information  to  health  care  professionals  that  the  patient  is  receiving  Soliris treatment.
3.  The  MAH  shall  propose  a  detailed  methodology  for  the  Health  Care  Professionals  and Patient survey. In addition to the assessment of the satisfaction of eculizumab information provided,  the  proposed  questionnaire  will  investigate  other  methods  for  assessing  the effectiveness  of  the  risk  minimisation  program  (e.g.  surveys  to  follow  compliance  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccination).    The  evaluation  of  the  goals  for  distribution  of  educational  materials  should also be considered.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Soliris  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation in the following indication:

'Soliris (eculizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).

Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited to patients with history of transfusions.'
