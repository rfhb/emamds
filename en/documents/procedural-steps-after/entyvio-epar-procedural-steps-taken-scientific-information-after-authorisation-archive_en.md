1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The RMP version 8.0 has also been submitted. Update of the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and Annex II (removal of additional risk minimisation measures based on data from this study. The package leaflet has been updated in accordance. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 06/07/2023 | 16/02/2024 | SmPC, Annex II and PL  | Following review of study MLN0002_401 SmPC 4.8 was updated to include Clostridoides diffiicle infection to 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 'common'. Furthermore, frequencies on herpes zoster, infusion site reaction (including: infusion site pain and infusion site irritation), and infusion related reaction, pneumonia and blurred vision were updated in 4.8 of the SmPC. No cases of PML were reported in the study and the study did not suggest an increased risk of malignancies. Patient alert card and Physician's Educational material was removed from Annex II of the MA. The package leaflet was updated in accordance.

| II/0059/G             | This was an application for a group of variations. C.I.4 Update of section 4.6 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) and the section 2 of the Package Leaflet (PL) in order to implement information on lactation based on study Vedolizumab-4001 (An Open-Label, Multicenter and Open Enrollment Model, Postmarketing, Milk-Only Lactation Study to Assess Concentration of Vedolizumab in Breast Milk of Lactating Women With Active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease Who Are Receiving Vedolizumab Therapeutically), including the concentration of vedolizumab in human breast milk and the estimated average daily dose of vedolizumab ingested by the infant. C.I.4 Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to adjust the values for clearance (CL) and serum half-life of vedolizumab IV and SC in subjects with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The updated pop PK dataset consists of pooled data across 4 phase 3 studies (C13006, C13007, MLN0002SC-3027, MLN0002SC-3031) and 1 open-label extension study (MLN0002SC-3030). The data on intravenous and subcutaneous CL changed from 0.169 L/day to 0.162 L/h and half-life changed from 24 to 26 days. | 14/10/2021   | 31/01/2022 | SmPC and PL | Study MLN0002-4001(open-label, multicenter and open enrollment model, postmarketing, milk-only lactation study to assess concentration of vedolizumab in breast milk of lactating women with active ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically) was designed to detect the presence of vedolizumab in breast milk but the effect of this medicine on infants remains unknown. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in lactating women should continue to take into account the benefit of therapy to the mother and potential risks to the infant. In order to inform Health Care Providers (HCP) when making prescribing decisions, it is proposed to update section 4.6 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) and the section 2 of the Package Leaflet (PL) to add the new data obtained from the study MLN0002-4001, including the concentration of vedolizumab in human breast milk and the estimated average daily dose of vedolizumab ingested by the infant. In the mentioned study, the concentration of vedolizumab obtained was approximately 0.4% to 2.2% of the maternal serum concentration obtained from historical studies of vedolizumab. The estimated average daily dose of vedolizumab ingested by the infant was 0.02 mg/kg/day, (which is approximately 21% of the body weight-adjusted average maternal daily dose. New pharmacokinetic data based on intravenous and subcutaneous analyses indicated that the clearance of vedolizumab is approximately 0. 162 L/day (through linear elimination pathway) and the serum half life is 26 days. Taking in consideration this data, the previous values of |

Immunogenicity data showed that during vedolizumab treatment antibodies to vedolizumab may develop, most of which are neutralising. The formation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance of vedolizumab and lower rates of clinical remission. Infusion related reactions after vedolizumab infusion are reported in subjects with anti-vedolizumab antibodies. |
