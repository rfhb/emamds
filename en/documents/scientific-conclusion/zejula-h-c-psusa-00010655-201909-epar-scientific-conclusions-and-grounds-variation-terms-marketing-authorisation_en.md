## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for niraparib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) from spontaneous reports, clinical trials and the literature and considering a plausible mechanism of action (severe hypertension in 4 out of 5 cases), the PRAC considers a causal relationship between niraparib and PRES is at least a reasonable possibility. Furthermore, a correlation between niraparib and hypertension with proven PRES exists. Therefore, the PRAC considers the adverse reaction PRES should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency rare. Furthermore, a warning should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to adequately inform prescribers about PRES.

In view of available data on hypertensive crisis from spontaneous reports, clinical trials and relevant literature and taking into account a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between niraparib and this risk is established. Hypertension is already an important identified risk for niraparib and is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The PRAC considers that hypertensive crisis should also be included as adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency rare.

Available data also showed that several hypertension events occurred within the first month of treatment. Furthermore, available data on PRES suggest it is closely linked to the regulation of blood pressure (4 out of 5 cases presented with hypertension) and several cases also occurred during the first month of therapy. Based on this information, there is a need to amend the existing warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC on hypertension to recommend a more frequent blood pressure monitoring especially at the beginning of treatment. A home-based monitoring of the blood pressure may also be considered when appropriate.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for niraparib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing niraparib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
