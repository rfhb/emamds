## 2 Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

The  medicinal product is a generic medicinal product containing pioglitazone as pioglitazone hydrochloride as active substance. The reference medicinal product is Actos 15, 30, 45 mg tablet. Pioglitazone is indicated as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described below:

Pioglitazone is a high affinity ligand for PPAR γ , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligandactivated  transcription  factors.  The  most  relevant  mode  of  pioglitazone  action  seems  to  be  the activation of this receptor. Once activated, PPAR γ forms a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, the  retinoid-X  receptor.  This  heterodimer  then  binds  to  specific  DNA  sequences  and  regulates  the transcriptional  activity  of  target  genes  that  play  a  role  in  the  metabolism  of  glucose  and  lipids  by regulating  synthesis  and  expression  of  cellular  glucose  and  fatty  acid  transporters.  Pioglitazone  is dependent on the presence of insulin in order to exert its beneficial effects. The activation of PPAR γ by pioglitazone leads to increased peripheral, hepatic and adipocyte insulin sensitivity. By reducing insulin resistance, pioglitazone lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations, circulating free fatty acids and insulin levels, and also hepatic glucose production may decline.

as monotherapy -in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. as dual oral therapy in combination with -metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin -a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea. as triple oral therapy in combination with -metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4). After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response,  pioglitazone  should  be  discontinued.  In  light  of  potential  risks  with  prolonged  therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The glucose-lowering effect of pioglitazone in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is also  related  to  its  ability  to  reduce  insulin  resistance  in  skeletal  muscle.  PPARγ activation  also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stimulates  differentiation  of  pre-adipocytes  and  bone  marrow  stromal  cells  into  mature  adipocytes. Barring  the  beneficial  effects  on  glycaemic  control,  insulin  levels  and  function  and  free  fatty  acids, pioglitazone  also  confers  benefits  in  terms  of  other  lipid  parameters,  hsCRP,  MMP-9,  MCP-1  and adiponectin.

Pioglitazone is indicated for the treatment of non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

It can be prescribed as monotherapy in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise in whom metformin is contraindicated or not adequately tolerated.

It  can  be  combined  with  metformin  or  sulphonylurea  in  patients  treated  with  metformin  or sulphonylurea drug who have insufficient glycemic control despite maximal tolerated doses of these drugs.

The  use  of  pioglitazone  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  bone  fractures.  This  risk  should  be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone.

It can be prescribed as a triple combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient blood sugar control. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with insufficient glycemic control with insulin. Pioglitazone is to be taken once daily regardless of food intake. The starting dose may be 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The maximal daily dose is 45 mg. When the pioglitazone is added on top of insulin, the latter  can  be  continued  as  previously,  while  attention  has  to  be  paid  on  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  If they occur, insulin dose should be reduced. Pioglitazone can be used in elderly and in patients with impaired renal function (bar dialysis patients) without any dose adjustment. There is a lack of information about the use in dialysis patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in this patient group. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) is also contraindication for the use of pioglitazone due to increased volume overload as a consequence of fluid retention. This can exacerbate or trigger heart failure. Therefore pioglitazone has to be administered with caution in patients with any risk factors for heart failure (careful titration and follow up). Pioglitazone must not be administered to patients with hepatic impairment (enzyme ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper normal limit or any other sign of hepatic disease) due to reports on hepatocelular dysfunction in patients treated with  pioglitazone.  During  the  treatment,  liver  enzymes  activity  has  to  be  controlled  and  treatement withdrawn in case of persistent elevations of ALT more than 3 times the normal value. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer, and uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Information about the manufacturing process has been provided using two Active Substance Master File  (ASMF)  procedures.  Detailed  information  about  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of  starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates and process development and process validation of the active substance has been supplied in the form of two active substance master files (ASMF). In one of manufacturing processes the active substance is synthesised in 4 steps and in the third step two routes of synthesis were considered. In other manufacturing processes the active substance is synthesised in 4 steps, but in the second step two alternatives routes of synthesis were  described.  In  the  last  step  of  both  manufacturing  processes  the  purification  of  the  active

2.2.2 Active Substance There  is  no  official  Pharmacopoeial  monograph  for  pioglitazone  hydrochloride,  however  a  draft Pharmeuropa monograph (Vol. 22, No. 4) has been published in October 2010. This  medicinal  product  contains  as  active  substance  pioglitazone  as  the  hydrochloride  salt.  The chemical name of pioglitazone hydrochloride is (±)-5-[[4-[2-(5-Ethyl-2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione hydrochloride. The molecular formula is C19H20N2O3S.HCl and the molecular weight is 392.90 g/mol. Pioglitazone is a white to off-white crystalline powder and soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide, slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, very slightly soluble in acetone and acetonitrile, practically insoluble in water. Pioglitazone hydrochloride is not hygroscopic active substance. It exhibits stereoisomerism due to  the  presence  of  one  chiral  center  and  is  synthesized  and  used  as  racemic  mixture.  The  two enantiomers of pioglitazone inter-convert in vivo. No differences were reported in the pharmacological activity between the two enantiomers.

substance  is  done  by  crystallisation.  The  purified  active  substance  is  packed  into  clear  LDPE  bags, purged with nitrogen and tied. The clear bag is placed inside black polythene bag with silica gel bag and tied. This double polythene bag pack is placed inside a triple laminated bag and sealed with sealer and kept in HDPE container with a HDPE lid and this outer container is also sealed with tamper evident seal. The purified active substance can also be packed into an LDPE bag cable tied and places into an outer aluminium laminated bag which is heat sealed and introduced into an outer HDPE container.

The chemical structure of the active substance has been confirmed by spectroscopy FTIR,  1 H-NMR,  13 CNMR, and MS). In addition the molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis.

Specification There is no Ph.Eur monograph for pioglitazone hydrochloride and hence the active substance is tested as  per  in-house  specifications.  The  active  substance  manufactureres'  specifications  include  tests  for appearance,  identification  (IR  &amp;  HPLC),  identification  of  chloride  (Ph.  Eur.),  XRD,  loss  on  drying, solubility, optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), palladium content, particle size, bulk density, tapped density and residual solvents (GC). A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. In general, the analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The  impurity  limits  are  acceptable  and  there  is  no  concern  from  the  point  of  view  of  safety.  Batch analysis data of five batches of active substance are provided. The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriates for controlling the quality of this active substance. Stability Stability  results  from  long-term  (25°C/60%RH)  and  accelerated  studies  (40°C/75%RH)  for  four production  scale  batches,  which  include  one  route  of  synthesis,  and  five  other  production  scale batches,  which  are  represented  from  other  route  of  synthesis,  were  completed  according  to  ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance.  The  following  parameters  were monitored  during  the  stability  studies:  appearance,  identification  (IR  &amp;  HPLC),  XRD,  water  content, impurities (HPLC) and assay (HPLC).It was noticed that the test methods applied are those used for release of the active substance. A photostability testing programme was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of ICH guideline Q1B. The results were found to meet the specifications and the finished product does not require any special light protection since this active substance is photostable. In can be concluded that the proposed re-test is justified based on the stability results when the active substance is stored in the original packing material. 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pharmaceutical Development

All information regarding the choice of the active substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The main aim of the pharmaceutical development was to formulate a conventional immediate-release tablet containing qualitatively and quantitatively the same active substance as the originator products Actos and Glustin (which are identical duplicate products marketed by Takeda) and exhibiting the same bioavailability. A common formulation and manufacturing process was developed for all 3 strengths. It was  noted  that  most  of  the  excipients  of  this  new  generic  medicinal  product  are  common  to  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reference  product.  All  excipients  selected  for  this  formulation  are  commonly  used  in  pharmaceutical formulations. During the pharmaceutical development critical formulation and manufacturing parameters  were  identified  and  adjusted.  The  comparative  dissolution  profiles  were  provided  for  all strengths. The results demonstrated that the generic batches used for the bioequivalence studies and the EU brand leader batches are similar with respect to dissolution rate.

## Manufacture of the product

The proposed commercial manufacturing process for the tablets involves standard technology and it is divided  into  the  following  steps:  mixing,  granulation,  drying,  milling,  blending,  compression  and packaging. The equipment used is commonly  available in the pharmaceutical industry. The manufacturing process has been adequately described and some steps have been identified as critical and optimised during the drug development (granulation and compression of tablets). The manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  validated  for  two  pilot  scale  batches  per  strength  per manufacturer of the active substance. Furthermore, the validation protocol proposed for the full scale batches has been provided and the quality of the production batches will be evaluated through the results of in process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. Product Specification The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, identification (HPLC &amp; UV), assay (HPLC), dissolution, uniformity of dosage (Ph.Eur), impurities (HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph.Eur), water content, average weight, individual weight, thickness, dimensions, friability (Ph.Eur) and  resistance to crushing of tablets (Ph.Eur). Impurities  and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. No impurities are caused by the interaction with the excipients used in the formulation. All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were properly described and satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The batch analysis data for two pilot batches per manufacture of the active substance confirm that the tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specifications. Stability of the product Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Stability  results  from  long-term  (25°C/60%RH) and accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH) for two pilot scales  batches  per  strength  and  per  active  substance  supplier  were  completed  according  to  ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance.  The  following  parameters  were monitored during the stability studies: assay, related substances, dissolution, water content, appearance and description and microbiological quality. It was noted that the test methods applied are those used for release of the finished product. All  the  results remained  well  within  the  specification limits  during  all  the  stability  studies.  For  bulk  storage  (LDPE  bags  with  desiccants)  studies  were performed at ICH long term conditions (25°C/ 60%RH) for 1 pilot batch per active substance supplier, per strength. A photostability testing programme was conducted in accordance with the recommendations  of  ICH  guideline  Q1B.  The  results  were  found  to  meet  the  specifications  and  the finished product does not require any special light protection. Forced degradation test were performed under sunlight, heat, hydrolysis, acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions. Based on the results, it was noted that  these  stress  conditions  have  shown  that  only  exposure  of  the  finished  product  to  highly extreme  condition  of  adding  strong  base  with  heating  may  cause  degradation.  Based  on  available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

There  is  no  official  Pharmacopoeial  monograph  for  pioglitazone  hydrochloride,  however  a  draft Pharmeuropa monograph (Vol. 22, No. 4) has been published in October 2010.

The pharmaceutical development of the formulation, the manufacturing process, control of the active substance  and  the  finished  product  have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner  and  justified  in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated for four the pilot scale batches per strength. Furthermore, the validation protocol proposed for the full scale batches has been provided and the quality of the production batches will be evaluated through the results of in process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The routine specifications and tests methods proposed for the active substance and finished product will adequately control the quality of the active substance and finished product. Analytical methods were well described and validated in agreement with relevant guidelines. Batch  analyses  were  presented  and  the  results  showed  that  the  finished  product  meets  the specifications proposed. The container-closure system was found to be suitable to ensure the quality of the finished product as shown by the stability data. The conditions used in the stability studies comply with the ICH stability guideline. The control tests and specifications for finished were adequately established. 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished products have been presented in a satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, all quality issues have been resolved. 2.2.6 Recommendation(s) for future quality development None Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.3 Non- Clinical aspects

A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need  to  generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product, Actos, which has been authorised for 10 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

## 2.3.1 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment has been conducted. The ERA is dated July 2010 and concludes that since  this  is  a  generic  product  there  will  be  no  increase  in  environmental  exposure  to  Pioglitazone hydrochloride following marketing authorisation. This was accepted by the CHMP.

2.4 Clinical Aspects 2.4.1 Introduction This  is  an  application  for  tablets  containing  pioglitazone  hydrochloride.  To  support  the  marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted a single bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Exemption A bioequivalence study using the 45mg dose has been carried out. The 45 mg strength was chosen because it is the largest dose, the conditions for a biowaiver for the 15 and 30 mg doses have been met in accordance with the current bioequivalence guideline apart from the fact that the applicant does not mention whether the pharmacokinetics are linear or not. A justification for the strength used is given in the overview of the Clinical Expert namely that the following general requirements for waiver for additional strengths are met: a) the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process; b) the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; c) the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths; d) appropriate in vitro dissolution data….' Therefore, a biowaiver for the lower doses was acceptable. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Clinical studies

A single bioequivalence study has been submitted in support of the application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

## Study design

A  single  bioequivalence  study  was  carried  out  in  Canada  in  March  2010  in  42  healthy  males  and females aged over 18 years.

The  study  was  an  open-label,  single-dose,  randomized,  two-period,  two-sequence,  two-treatment, crossover  study,  designed  to  evaluate  the  comparative  bioavailability  between  two  formulations  of pioglitazone HCl tablets administered to healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions.

Forty-two healthy males and females aged 18 years or older, with a BMI in the normal or overweight category, with no clinically significantly abnormal findings on laboratory examination, ECG examination or vital sign measurements and who did not meet any of the exclusion criteria. One subject withdrew from the study prior to Period 2 check-in due to personal reasons. A sample size calculation estimated that 36 subjects were required (assuming an intra-subject variability of for pioglitazone Cmax of 25% and  a  difference  between  the  treatment  means  of ≤ 5%)  to  ensure  a  90%  probability  of  the  90% confidence interval of the treatment mean ratio to be within the 80-125% range. Six further subjects were included in the study to account for dropouts.

The washout period between receiving the test and reference product or vice versa was 13 days and 23 hours (14 days in the protocol). The half life of piaglitazone is described as being from 3 to 7 hours and its metabolite from 16 to 24 hours. The test and reference products were administered after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and subjects continued to fast for at least 4 hours following drug administration. Study drugs were administered with 150 mL of ≈ 25% glucose solution. Subjects also received an additional 100 mL of 25% glucose solution at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 hours post-dose  (±10  minutes).  The  investigator  reserved  the  right  to  alter  the  glucose  administration schedule,  discontinue  glucose  administration,  or  administer  extra  glucose  solution  for  any  individual subject as necessary. 200 mL of apple juice may have been substituted for the 25% glucose solution at any time except at dosing and within 1 hour after dosing. In each period, 24 blood samples from 23 time points were obtained from an arm vein of each subject by direct venipuncture or from an indwelling cannula. Blood was collected prior to drug administration and at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 2.33, 2.67, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours following drug administration. The analytical personnel were blinded from the treatment sequence throughout the analytical process. Test and reference products The test product was Pioglitazone hydrochloride 45 mg tablets (Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd.); Batch No.: K-43813. The reference product was Actos 45mg tablets (Takeda Global Research and Development Centre (Europe) Ltd., UK); Batch No.: 4250008B. Population studied Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Of the 41 subjects who were included in the data analysis, 20 were White, 11 were Hispanic/Latino, 6 were Asian and 4 were Black. Twenty-two (22) subjects were male and 19 were female.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analytical methods

Subject plasma concentrations of pioglitazone were measured according to a liquid chromatographic (LC) tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) method) developed by a bioanalytical laboratory. The  method  involved  protein  precipitation.  Sample  analysis  was  conducted  using  reversed  phase chromatography. The method was GLP compliant.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  estimated  based  on  pioglitazone  levels  for  each subject in the dataset: AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞ , Cmax, Tmax, Kel and T1/2 The pharmacokinetic variables chosen were considered appropriate by the CHMP.

The  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  and  the  corresponding  90%  confidence  intervals  (test  versus reference) for AUCt, AUC ∞ and Cmax were as follows [mean (CI)]:

Statistical methods Analysis of variance (ANOVA)  was  applied to log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf,  and  Cmax parameters. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, and subject-within-sequence effects were tested. Using  the  same  statistical  model,  the  least-squares-means,  the  differences  between  the  treatments least-squares-means, and the corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ ,  and  Cmax parameters. Based on these statistics, the ratios of the geometric means for treatments and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Based on the log-transformed parameters, the following criteria was used to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference products. The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUC0-t and Cmax of the test to reference products should be between 80.00% and 125.00%. One subject withdrew from the study and was not replaced. Another subject vomited within 5 minutes of the first dose, was withdrawn from the study and subsequently replaced (contrary to the protocol). The  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  data  from  a  total  of  41  subjects.  A missing value was  used  in the pharmacokinetic analysis of pioglitazone concentration levels corresponding  to  the  following  sample  that  was  not  collected.  There  were  a  number  of  protocol deviations  including  some  late  blood  samplings.  However  for  the  latter,  actual  study  sampling  time rather than planned time was used in the PK analysis. Overall the protocol deviations were considered unlikely to have impacted on the study results by CHMP. Results 41 participants were included in the PK dataset. Results for arithmetic and geometric means of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞ and Cmax and arithmetic means of Tmax, Kel and T1/2 are shown in the following table. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

AUC0-t: 101.67% (96.57 - 107.04%)

AUC0- ∞

: 101.60% (96.57 - 106.89%)

Cmax: 101.03% (93.75 - 108.87%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  arithmetic  means  Tmax  values  were  4.52  hours  and  4.09  hours  for  the  test  and  reference products,  respectively.  ANOVA  did  not  detect  a  significant  difference  in  any  of  the  pharmacokinetic parameters.

Conclusion: As the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the test to reference product geometric means  of  AUC0-t,  and  Cmax  lie  between  80%  and  125%  bioequivalence  between  Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Teva) and Actos (Takeda) can be assumed. Safety data There were 60 adverse events involving 23 subjects in the study. All adverse events were categorised as mild. Most adverse events occurred only once. Four of those receiving product A had headache, 5 hyperglycaemia, 3 blood urine present and 2 red blood cell urine positive. Of those receiving treatment B, 4 had catheter site pain, 3 had dizziness and 2 hyperglycaemia. Conclusions Based on the presented bioequivalence study Pioglitazone Teva is considered bioequivalent with Actos. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics

## 2.4.4 Additional data

None

## 2.4.5 Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

2.4.6 Discussion on Clinical aspects A single GCP-compliant open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover study bioequivalence study was carried out in 42 healthy males and females aged over 18 years. Overall, the design of the trial and the analytical methods used were adequate. Protocol violations were considered to be minor. The ratios of the geometric means and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (test versus reference) for AUCt, AUC ∞ and Cmax were used to demonstrate bioequivalence. The pre-set bioequivalence criteria were met. 2.4.7 Conclusions on clinical aspects Bioequivalence between Pioglitazone Teva and Actos has been demonstrated as the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the test to reference product geometric means of AUC0-t, and Cmax were found to lie between 80% and 125%. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The applicant did not submit a risk management plan because this application concerns a generic for a reference medicinal product for which no safety concern requiring additional risk minimisation activities had been identified when the Marketing Authorisation application was submitted. However taking into account  the  outcome  of  the  Article  20  procedure  on  already  authorised  pioglitazone  containing products and the potential increased risk of bladder cancer, the MAH shall submit within one month of the Commission Decision a risk management plan which will incorporate risk minimisation measures, as detailed in  the conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product in Annex II, in line with those required for the reference medicinal product.

The MAH shall perform the Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, to be agreed in the Risk Management Plan to be submitted and any consequent updates to the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal product for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next PSUR.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- -When  new  information is received that may  impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
- Within 60 days of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
- At the request of the European Medicines Agency

PSUR submission The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product, which is on a 6 monthly cycle, having 1 February 2012 as its data lock point. User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 3 Benefit-Risk Balance This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  pioglitazone  tablets.  The  reference  product  Actos  is indicated as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the  active  substance  was  presented  and  considered  sufficient.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. The  bioequivalence  study  forms  the  pivotal  basis  with  an  open-label,  single-dose,  randomized, crossover  design.  The  study  design  was  considered  adequate  to  evaluate  the  bioequivalence  of  this formulation  and  was  in  line  with  the  respective  European  requirements.  Choice  of  dose,  sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. The  test  formulation  of  Pioglitazone  Teva  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when compared  with  Actos.  The  point  estimates  and  their  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- , and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80 to 125%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, the available data on the chosen reference medicinal product and the outcome of the Article 20 procedure on the already authorised pioglitazone containing products and the potential increased risk of bladder cancer, is of the opinion that  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information as per the conditions of the Marketing Authorisation included in Annex II.

## 4 Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy and taking into account the opinions adopted by the CHMP on 21 July 2011 and 20 October 2011 in the framework of the procedures under Article 20 of Regulation 726/2004 for pioglitazone containing medicinal products and the subsequent Commission  Decision,  the  CHMP  considers  by  majority  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Pioglitazone Teva is favourable as second or third line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described below:

as  monotherapy in  adult  patients  (particularly  overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance;

as dual oral therapy in combination with - metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin; - a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea; as triple oral therapy in combination with - metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy. Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. After initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate response,  pioglitazone  should  be  discontinued.  In  light  of  potential  risks  with  prolonged  therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained. The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation Risk Management System and PSUR cycle The MAH shall submit within one month of the Commission Decision a risk management plan which will incorporate risk minimisation measures, as detailed below, in line with those required for the reference medicinal product. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The MAH shall perform the Pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, to be agreed in the Risk Management Plan to be submitted and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

-When  new  information is received that may  impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities

- Within 60 days of an important (Pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached
- At the request of the European Medicines Agency

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product.

## Pioglitazone Teva (EMEA/H/C/2297)

## Divergent statement

We have a divergent position from the above mentioned positive opinion recommending granting of Marketing Authorisation from that which has been readopted by the CHMP during its January 2012 session:

We consider that the benefit-risk balance of pioglitazone has become negative given the increased risk of bladder cancer in addition to the other well known adverse effects (especially heart failure and bone fracture in post menopausal women) of this medicine, its questionable long term benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and the available alternative treatments in type 2 diabetic patients. 1. Pre-clinical data indicate an increased frequency of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone in male rats. Results of the PROactive trial show a significantly higher number of bladder cancer in patients treated with pioglitazone. Data provided by three epidemiologic studies (US, France and UK) provide very similar evidence of an increased risk of bladder cancer, even though the magnitude of such risk is low with a hazard ratio around 1.2, however, likely increasing with cumulative dose and duration of pioglitazone exposure. 2. This increased risk of bladder cancer includes invasive types of bladder cancer with major adverse impact on morbidity and mortality. No biomarker of bladder cancer is available which could provide effective screening and early treatment. Symptoms such as haematuria can occur late after the onset of tumour development and are not specific. Cystoscopy appears to be the only investigational procedure able to adequately establish the diagnosis of bladder cancer but its invasive nature precludes is use for systematic cancer screening. It appears impossible to define a subpopulation of diabetic patients where the benefits of pioglitazone would outweigh its risks. In addition, according to Proactive long term follow up and utilisation studies, a large proportion of patients stop pioglitazone treatment within the first years of treatment precluding potential long term benefit on prevention of cardiovascular events. The identified increased bladder cancer risk is likely to reduce adherence to pioglitazone long term treatment.
