6096A1-3024 : Evaluating  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  a  13-valent Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  Given  With  DTaP  Compared  to  Open-  Label  DTaP  in Healthy Japanese Infants

##  Description

Study  6096A1-3024-JA  (B1851056)  was  conducted  in  Japan  and  was  a  Phase  3,  parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  in  infants  and  toddlers  to  evaluate  the immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  subcutaneous  13vPnC  given  with  diphtheria,  tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) compared to subcutaneous 7vPnC given with DTaP or DTaP alone in healthy infants. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 13vPnC and concomitant DTaP (Group 1), 7vPnC and concomitant DTaP (Group 2), or DTaP (Group 3).

##  Methods

-  Objective(s)

Primary Immunologic Objectives:

-  To demonstrate that the immune responses to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) induced by 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC)  are  noninferior  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by  7valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (7vPnC)  when  measured  1  month  after  the infant series.
-  To assess whether the immune responses as measured by serum antibody responses to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis toxoid (PT), and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) induced by diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) given with 13vPnC were comparable to the immune responses induced by DTaP given alone when measured 1 month after the infant series.

Primary Safety Objectives:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC and 7vPnC given with DTaP as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs).

Secondary:

-  To demonstrate that the immune responses to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 3,  4,  5,  6A,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19A,  19F,  and  23F)  induced  by  13vPnC  are noninferior to the immune responses induced by 7vPnC when measured 1 month after the toddler dose.
-  To  describe  antibody  responses  to  the  13  pneumococcal  conjugates  after  the toddler dose compared to antibody responses before the toddler dose and after the infant series within each of Groups 1 and 2.
-  To  assess  whether  the  immune  responses  as  measured  by  serum  antibody responses to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT, and FHA induced by DTaP given with  13vPnC  were  comparable  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by  DTaP  given alone when measured 1 month after the toddler dose.

Exploratory:

-  In subjects that received ActHIB: To describe the immune responses as measured by  serum  antibody  responses  to  Haemophilus  influenza  type  b  (Hib)  induced  by ActHIB given concomitantly with 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant series and after the toddler dose.
-  Study design

This  was  a  Phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 13vPnC given with DTaP compared to 7vPnC given with DTaP or DTaP alone in healthy infants.

Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  13vPnC  and  concomitant  DTaP,  7vPnC  and concomitant  DTaP,  or  DTaP.  Administration  of  the  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccines  (13vPnC  and 7vPnC)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  was  blinded  due  to  the  identical appearance of the vaccines. DTaP was administered open-label.

In this study, the subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP, 7vPnC+DTaP and the DTaP groups received 3 doses of their  assigned study vaccine during the infant series and another toddler dose. In the infant series, dose 1 of the study vaccines was given at 3 to 6 months of age, dose 2 of the study vaccines was given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 1, and dose 3 of the study vaccines was given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 2. The toddler dose of the study vaccines was given at 12 to 15 months of age. In addition, subjects in the DTaP group received 3 catch-up doses of Prevenar (commercial product of 7vPnC for Japan, with catch-up dose 1 given approximately 1 month after dose 3 of the infant series, catch-up dose 2 given approximately 1 month after catch-up dose 1, and catch-up dose 3 given approximately 1 month after the toddler dose.

-  Study population /Sample size

Main  Criteria  for  Inclusion:  Subjects  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study  were  healthy  (as determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator) infants between ≥3 months and ≤6 months of age at the time of enrollment. Parent/legal guardian had to be able to complete all relevant study procedures during study participation, and was expected to be available for the duration of the trial.

Subjects were ineligible to participate in the study if they had previously been vaccinated with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis vaccine, had a previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccine-related component, contraindication to vaccination with a pneumococcal conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis vaccine, had a bleeding diathesis, had a known or suspected immune deficiency or suppression, had a history of culture-proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae , or had any of the other exclusion criteria specified in the protocol.

Sample  size  was  powered  to  confirm  the  noninferiority  of  immune  responses  to  the  13 pneumococcal  conjugates  induced  by  13vPnC  relative  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by 7vPnC  and  was  estimated  based  upon  the  proportions  of  responders  for  the  pneumococcal serotypes  for  both  the  7  common  serotypes  and  the  6  additional  serotypes  and  the  IgG geometric  mean  concentration  (GMC)  ratio  for  the  7  common  serotypes,  which  are  referred

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from  the  data  for  Wyeth  studies  6096A1-3003-JA  (Japan  study),  6096A1-010-KP  (Korea study), and 6096A1-3004-TW (Taiwan study).

A  sample  size  of  160  evaluable  subjects  per  group  was  estimated  to  provide  at  least  81% power to declare  noninferiority  for  all  primary  endpoints  (power  =  0.932  *  0.923  *  0.94  = 0.809%). Assuming a dropout rate of about 10%, 178 subjects per group (534 total) were planned to be enrolled to ensure that 160 subjects per group were evaluable.

Sample size estimation was also considered to provide appropriate precision from the clinical viewpoint for the proportion of responders for each antigen induced by DTaP. Vaccination of 160 subjects in each group was to provide 7.0%, 6.5%, 5.7%, and 4.6% precision (the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] is 73.0%, 78.5%, 84.3%, and 90.4%) from estimates of the proportion of responders of 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%, respectively.

##  Treatments

Subjects  received  1  dose  of  either  13vPnC+DTaP,  7vPnC+DTaP,  or  DTaP  depending  on treatment assignment at each of the 4 vaccination visits. Subjects in the DTaP group received 1 dose of Prevenar at each of the 3 catch-up dose vaccination visits.

Investigational products were administered subcutaneously by injecting 0.5 mL at each dose. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC, 7vPnC, or Prevenar) was administered in the left arm and DTaP was administered in the right arm.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity Evaluations :  Blood  samples  (approximately  5  mL)  were  collected  before the  first  vaccination  of  investigational  product,  at  1  month  (28  to  42  days)  after  the  infant series, before the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose.

Pneumococcal antibody response was assessed in the 13vPnC+DTaP and 7vPnC+DTaP groups. Using  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA),  serum  concentrations  of  anticapsular immunoglobulin G (IgG) that were elicited by each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) and 7 pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were determined in subjects for each blood sample. Assays of serum opsonophagocytic  activity  (OPA)  that  was  elicited  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  were performed on blood samples obtained 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose for subjects with an adequate amount of serum. This study used the improved microcolony  assay  for  determination  of  OPA.  The  new  microcolony  OPA  (mcOPA)  assay specified cutoff criteria for OPA assay data as the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for each serotype.  In  previous  infant  studies  using  the  dribble  OPA  (dOPA)  assay,  an  OPA  serum response was determined using an OPA titer cut-off of 1:8 for all serotype-specific OPA assays. However, in both assay methods, an OPA titer is defined as the interpolated reciprocal serum dilution that results in complement mediated killing of 50% of the bacteria in each OPA assay. Antibody responses to the diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) were measured in each serum sample for all 3 vaccine groups.

## Safety Evaluations:

Local  reactions  (tenderness,  redness,  and  swelling)  at  the  site  of  injection  of  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC or 7vPnC) in the 13vPnC+DTaP and 7vPnC+DTaP groups and at the site  of  injection  of  DTaP  in  the  DTaP  group  were  monitored  daily  for  7  days  after  each vaccination in electronic diary (e-diary). Tenderness was recorded as no discernible tenderness, tenderness present, or tenderness interfered with limb movement. For redness and swelling, the parent/legal guardian measured the actual size of the reaction with a caliper. For analysis  purposes,  measurements  recorded  for  redness  and  swelling  were  categorized  as absent (no redness or swelling present), mild (1 to 4 caliper units), moderate (5 to 14 caliper units), or severe (&gt;14 caliper units).

Systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, hives [urticaria],  and  the  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  prevent  or  treat  symptoms)  were monitored  daily  for  7  days  after  each  vaccination  of  investigational  product  (other  than Prevenar for catch-up doses in the DTaP group) using an e-diary. Temperature was measured at bedtime daily and at any time during the 7 days that fever was suspected. Severity of fever was  categorized  as  absent  (&lt;37.5°C),  mild  ( ),  moderate  &gt;39.0°C  to ) for analysis. Other systemic events were reported as present or absent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adverse  events:  AEs  were  categorized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The relation between an AE and study vaccine was categorized as related or not related. AE severity was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening.

AEs were collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) to at least 28 days after the administration of dose 3 of the infant series in all 3 vaccine groups and at least 28 days after the administration of catch-up dose 2 of 7vPnC in the DTaP group. AEs were also collected at the time of the toddler dose through at least 28 days after the toddler dose visit in all  3  vaccine  groups  and  to  at  least  28  days  after  the  administration  of  catch-up  dose  3 of7vPnC in the DTaP group.

##  Statistical Methods

Immunogenicity  Analysis  Comparisons:  To  assess  the  pneumococcal  immune  responses induced by 13vPnC as measured by IgG concentrations, noninferiority comparisons were made directly between the 13vPnC+DTaP and 7vPnC+DTaP groups for the 7 serotypes common to 13vPnC and 7vPnC. For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC, noninferiority comparisons were made  between  individual  serotypes  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  the  lowest  response observed  among  the  7  common  serotypes  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  For  the  6  additional serotypes in 13vPnC, a direct comparison was also done to assess superiority. To assess the pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  as  measured  by  OPA  titers,  the comparison  was  only  constructed  directly  comparing  13vPnC+DTaP  group  to  7vPnC+DTaP group for all 13 serotypes.

A  primary  immunological  comparison  for  the  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  was  the proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  1 month after the infant series in subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the immune responses  in  subjects  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  for  the  7  common  serotypes  and  the  6 additional serotypes.  Another  primary  immunological  comparison  for  the  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was the IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio 1 month after the infant  series  in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune  responses  in subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group for the 7 common serotypes.

A secondary immunological comparison was the IgG GMC ratio 1 month after the infant series in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune  responses  in  subjects  in  the 7vPnC+DTaP group for the 6 additional serotypes. Also, the comparisons of the proportion of subjects who achieved a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL and IgG GMC ratio 1 month after the toddler dose in subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the immune responses in subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group were secondary immunological comparisons.

Other comparisons for 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the immune responses in subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group were of the proportion of subjects with serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.15 μg/mL, the proportion of OPA titers ≥ the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of OPA for each of the 13 serotypes.

The immunological comparison of interest for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) was the responses in subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the responses  in  subjects  in  the  DTaP  group  for  each  antigen  following  the  infant  series.  The primary endpoints for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT  and FHA were the proportions of subjects achieving a predetermined antibody level measured 1 month after the infant series. Proportions were also calculated following the toddler dose. Antigen-specific GMCs/ GMTs after the infant series and after the toddler dose were also assessed.

Immunogenicity Analysis Methods: Within each 13vPnC+DTaP group and 7vPnC+DTaP group, the  GMCs  of  pneumococcal  IgG  and  the  GMTs  of  OPA  were  calculated.  The  IgG  antibody concentrations and OPA antibody titers were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results,  computed  using  the  Student  t distribution.  IgG  GMC  ratios  (13vPnC+DTaP  /  7vPnC+DTaP) and their corresponding 2-sided 95%  CIs  will  be  calculated.  The  geometric  mean  fold  rises  (GMFRs)  in  IgG  antibody concentration (measured from before the toddler dose to after the toddler dose and measured

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after the infant series to after the toddler dose) and in OPA titres (measured from after the infant series to after the toddler dose) were summarized by geometric means and 95% CIs. For each serotype after infant series and after toddler dose, noninferiority was declared if the lower CI for the IgG GMC ratio was &gt;0.5. Superiority was declared if the lower CI for the IgG GMC ratio was &gt;1.0. Although not prespecified by the SAP or the protocol, the same criterion for superiority as was used in previous infant studies was used in this study.

Within each 13vPnC+DTaP group and 7vPnC+DTaP group, the proportion of subjects achieving an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes was calculated for each serotypes and their exact, 2-sided 95% CIs for the proportions were calculated. The CI  for  the  single  proportions  was  computed  using  the  F  distribution.  The  differences  in proportions  (13vPnC+DTaP  -  7vPnC+DTaP)  and  their  corresponding  2-sided  95%  CIs  were calculated. For each serotype, noninferiority was declared if the lower CI for the difference was &gt;-0.10.  Superiority  was  declared  if  the  lower  CI  for  the  difference  was  &gt;0.  Although  not prespecified  by  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  or  the  protocol,  the  same  criterion  for superiority as was used in previous infant studies was used in this study.

Within each 13vPnC+DTaP group and 7vPnC+DTaP group, the LLOQ for OPA titers was used to compute  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  OPA  titers LLOQ  for  each  serotype,  along  with exact, 2-sided 95% CI.

Within each group and for each DTaP antigen separately, the proportion of subjects achieving at  least  a  prespecified  antibody  concentration  was  computed  for  each  blood  sample.  The prespecified  antibody  levels  for  each  antigen  are  diphtheria  0.1  international  unit  (IU)/mL; tetanus,  0.01  IU/mL;  PT,  5  ELISA  units  (EU)/mL;  and  FHA,  5  EU/mL.  The  differences  in proportions (13vPnC+DTaP - DTaP) and their corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated after  the  infant  series  and  after  the  toddler  dose.  Antigen-specific  GMCs/  GMTs  and  their corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated after the infant series and the toddler dose.

##  Results

## 

Recruitment/ Number analysed Four  (4)  analysis  populations  were  defined:  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity,  all  available infant immunogenicity, evaluable toddler immunogenicity, and all-available toddler immunogenicity. The evaluable infant immunogenicity population was the primary immunogenicity  analysis  population  in  this  study.  The  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity population comprised subjects who were eligible for the study, received all 3 study vaccinations with the correct study vaccine(s) for their group, had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result after the third vaccination, had their blood drawn after vaccination within the required time frame, and had no major protocol violations. The reasons for exclusion of subjects from the all-available infant and evaluable infant immunogenicity populations are presented in Table 21.

The demographic characteristics of the evaluable infant and toddler populations were similar to those of all subjects with respect to sex, race, racial designation, and weight at enrollment. The mean ages were 4.1 months at dose 1, 5.2 months at dose 2, and 6.4 months at dose 3. The mean age at the toddler dose was 13.4 months.

##  Efficacy results

## Infant series

Before vaccination, the percentage of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 7 common  serotypes ranged from 0.6%  (serotype 4) to 33.9%  (serotype 14) in the 13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  ranged  from  0.6%  (serotype  4)  to  27.8%  (serotype  14)  in  the 7vPnC+DTaP group.  Before  vaccination,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  IgG  concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 1.1% (serotype 1) to 41.5% (serotype 19A) in the 13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 1.1% (serotype 1) to 43.2% (serotype 19A) in the 7vPnC+DTaP group.

The direct  comparison of the proportion of subjects who achieved IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who  received  13vPnC+DTaP  and subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  23  for  the  evaluable  infant immunogenicity population. The noninferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes.

a. N = number of subjects with a determinate IgG antibody concentration to the given serotype.

b. n = Number of subjects with an antibody concentration ≥0.35 pg/mL for the given serotype.

C. Exact 2-sided confidence interval based on the observed proportion of subjects.

d. Difference in proportions, Group 1 (13vPnC+DTaP) - Group 2 (7vPnC+DTaP), expressed as a percentage.

e. Exact 2-sided confidence interval for the difference in proportions, Group 1 (13vPnC+DTaP) - Group 2 (7vPnC+DTaP). expressed as a percentage.

When comparing the proportions of subjects who achieved IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 6 additional serotypes 1 month after the 13vPnC+DTaP infant series to the lowest response observed among the 7 common serotypes in the 7vPnC+DTaP (96.6% for serotype 19F) the noninferiority criterion was met for all of the 6 additional serotypes.

The  direct  comparison  of  IgG  GMCs  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who received 13vPnC+DTaP and subjects who received 7vPnC+DTaP is presented in Table 25 for the evaluable infant immunogenicity population. For the 7 common serotypes, the IgG GMCs were numerically lower in the 13vPnC+DTaP group than in the 7vPnC+DTaP group. However, the noninferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes (lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &gt;0.5).

C. Confidence intervals (CIs) are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean logarithm of the concentrations.

d. Ratio of GMCs, Group 1 (13vPnC+DTaP) to Group 2 (7vPnC+DTaP).

e. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithms of the measures (Group 1 [13vPnC+DTaP] Group 2 [7vPnC+DTaP]).

The  direct  comparison  of  OPA  GMTs  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who received 13vPnC+DTaP and subjects who received 7vPnC+DTaP is presented in Table 27 for the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population.  Although  functional  antibody  response  was intended  to  be  descriptive  and  was  not  prespecified  as  a  criterion  of  comparison,  the  lower limits  of  the  95%  CI  of  GMRs  exceeded  0.5  for  all  7  common  serotypes.  In  addition,  the immune response was statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio &gt;1.0)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  than  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  for  2  of  the  7  common serotypes (serotypes 6B and 19F). After the infant series, the majority of subjects achieved an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ for the 7 common serotypes in the 13vPnC+DTaP group (91.3% [serotype 9V] to 100% [serotypes 4, 14, and 18C]) and the 7vPnC+DTaP group (89.5% [serotype 19F] to 100% [serotypes 4 and 18C]). The differences in proportion of responders (13vPnC+DTaP 7vPnC+DTaP) to each of the 7 common serotypes ranged from -1.8% (serotype 9V) to 9.8% (serotype 19F). Although functional antibody response was intended to be descriptive and was not prespecified as a criterion of comparison, the lower limits of the 95% CI exceeded -10% for all 7 common serotypes. In addition, the immune response in the 13vPnC+DTaP group was statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions &gt;0) than in the 7vPnC+DTaP group for serotype 19F.

## Toddler dose

Before the toddler dose, the percentage of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 7 common serotypes ranged from 84.2% (serotype 18C) to 97.5% (serotype 19F) in the 13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 83.0% (serotype 23F) to 98.7% (serotypes 4 and 14) in the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  Before  the  toddler  dose,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 72.2% (serotype 3) to 99.4% (serotypes 5 and 6A) in the 13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 1.3% (serotype 1) to 84.9% (serotype 19A) in the 7vPnC+DTaP group.

The direct  comparison of the proportion of subjects who achieved IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  between  subjects  who  received  13vPnC+DTaP  and subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  29  for  the  evaluable  toddler immunogenicity population. The noninferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes.

C. Exact 2-sided confidence interval based on the observed proportion of subjects.

d. Difference in proportions, Group 1 (13vPnC+DTaP) - Group 2 (7vPnC+DTaP), expressed as a percentage.

e. Exact 2-sided confidence interval for the difference in proportions, Group 1 (13vPnC+DTaP) - Group 2 (7vPnC+DTaP), expressed as a percentage.

The  direct  comparison  of  IgG  GMCs  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  between  subjects  who received 13vPnC+DTaP and subjects who received 7vPnC+DTaP is presented in Table 31 for the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. For 5 of the 7 common serotypes (all except serotypes 6B and 19F), the IgG GMCs were numerically lower in the 13vPnC+DTaP group than in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  However,  the  noninferiority  criterion  was  met  for  all  7  common serotypes.

Assessor's  comment:  The  response  to  serotype  3  in  the  13vPnC+DTaT  group  was  lower following the toddler dose compared to the response to the infant series, in contrast to all other serotypes.

The  direct  comparison  of  OPA  GMTs  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  between  subjects  who received 13vPnC+DTaP and subjects who received 7vPnC+DTaP is presented in Table 37 for the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. Although functional antibody response was intended  to  be  descriptive  and  was  not  prespecified  as  a  criterion  of  comparison,  the  lower limits  of  the  95%  CI  of  GMRs  exceeded  0.5  for  all  7  common  serotypes.  In  addition,  the immune response was statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio in  GMCs  &gt;1.0)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  than  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  for  common serotype 19F.

Assessor's  comment:  The  lower  IgG  GMT  response  to  serotype  3  following  the  toddler  dose compared to the response to the infant series was not seen for the OPA GMTs.

After  the  toddler  dose,  the  majority  of  subjects  achieved  an  OPA  titer  ≥  LLOQ  for  the  7 common serotypes in the 13vPnC+DTaP group (98.6% [serotype 6B] to 100%) [serotypes 4, 9V, 14, and 18C]) and the 7vPnC+DTaP group (95.5% [serotype 19F] to 100%).% [serotypes 4, 9V, 14, and 18C]). The differences in proportion of responders (13vPnC - 7vPnC) to each of the 7 common serotypes ranged from 0.0% (serotypes 4, 9V, 14 and 18C) to 3.8% (serotype 19F).  Although  functional  antibody  response  was  intended  to  be  descriptive  and  was  not prespecified as a criterion of comparison, the lower limits of the 95% CI for the differences in proportion of responders exceeded -10% for all 7 common serotypes.

After  the  toddler  dose,  the  majority  of  subjects  achieved  an  OPA  titer  ≥  LLOQ  for  the  6 additional serotypes in the 13vPnC+DTaP group (95.1% [serotype 5] to 100% [serotypes 1, 3, 6A, 7F, and 19A]). After the toddler dose, the percentage of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 0.7% (serotype 5) to 88.9% (serotype 6A) in the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  The  differences  in  proportion  of  responders  (13vPnC+DTaP -7vPnC+DTaP)  to  each  of  the  6  additional  serotypes  ranged  from  11.1%  (serotype  6A)  to 98.6%  (serotype  1).  The  immune  response  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  was  statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions &gt;0) than in the 7vPnC+DTaP group for all 6 additional serotypes. In the 7vPnC+DTaP group, there was a high

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

percentage of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ (88.9%) for serotype 6A, consistent with crossreactivity of functional antibody response between serotypes 6A and 6B.

## Concomitant Vaccine Antibody Response (DTaP Antigens)

The GMCs for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT, and FHA measured 1 month after the infant series  are  presented  in  Table  42  for  the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population.  All subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP,  7vPnC+DTaP,  and  the  DTaP  groups  had  the  prespecified antibody  level  after  the  infant  series  for  tetanus  in  the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity population.  All  subjects  in  the  3  groups  also  had  the  prespecified  antibody  level  for  tetanus before  the  infant  series,  so  there  was  no  change  in  immune  response  to  be  detected.  The majority of subjects achieved the prespecified level after the infant series for diphtheria toxoid, PT,  and  FHA  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  (99.4%  in  each  antigen),  7vPnC+DTaP  (96.6%  in  each antigen), and the DTaP (100% in each antigen) groups in the evaluable infant immunogenicity population. In all 3 groups there was a marked increase in the proportions of subjects with a prespecified antibody level for diphtheria toxoid, PT, and FHA after the infant series compared with the corresponding proportions before the infant series.

Local  reactions,  infant  series:  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  local  reactions within  7  days  after  doses  1  in  the  infant  series  are  presented  in  Table  53.  The  frequencies following the second dose were generally slightly higher compared to the first dose, but the frequencies for local reactions following the third dose were similar to those after the first dose (data  not  shown  in  this  AR).  Most  local  reactions  reported  within  7  days  of  vaccine administration were mild or moderate in severity.

Systemic reactions, infant series: The number and percentage of subjects reporting systemic events, including the use of antipyretic medications, within 7 days after doses 1, 2, and 3 of the  infant  series  are  presented  in  Table  61.  After  each  dose  of  the  infant  series,  the percentages of subjects who reported any systemic events in the 13vPnC+DTaP group were higher than those in the DTaP group but were similar to those in the 7vPnC+DTaP group. The frequencies of systemic reactions were similar following the second and third compared to the first dose.

Adverse events: AEs were reported by similar percentages of subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP, 7vPnC+DTaP,  and  DTaP  groups  during  the  infant  series  and  at  the  toddler  dose.  In  the  3 vaccine groups, the most frequently reported types of AEs were infections and infestations. The AEs reported were generally consistent with childhood illnesses.

Serious adverse events, Infant series: Febrile convulsion was reported during the study by 22 subjects: 6 subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP group, 9 subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group and 7 subjects in the DTaP group. All cases of febrile convulsion reported during the study met the criteria for an SAE, and all led to withdrawal. One (1) case of febrile convulsion that occurred after the toddler dose for a subject in the DTaP group (subject 10011016) persisted when the subject was discontinued from the study, and the event was resolved after the discontinuation. All other cases were resolved during the subject's participation to the study. The majority of febrile convulsions occurred due to fever caused by concurrent viral illness. None of the cases of febrile convulsion was considered related to the study vaccine.

Kawasaki's disease was reported as an SAE during the study by 4 subjects: 2 subjects in the DTaP  group  and  1  subject  each  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  7vPnC+DTaP  group;  all  of these cases led to withdrawal. In addition, 1 subject in the 13vPnC+DTaP group was diagnosed as having Kawasaki's disease after having completed the study, though the symptom had been reported at the toddler dose; as noted in Section 12.4.2.3, this event met the criteria for an SAE although it was not recorded as such in the study database.

All  cases  of  Kawasaki's  disease  persisted.  However,  all  acute  symptoms  resolved  and  all subjects are being followed for long term follow up. None of the cases of Kawasaki's disease was considered related to the study vaccine.

Based on recent national surveillance reviews in Japan in 2007 and in 2009, the number of patients with Kawasaki's disease is increasing. In the nationwide survey of Kawasaki's disease conducted in 2007, targeting patients who were affected by this disease in 2005 and 2006, the average  annual  incidence  rate  was  184.6  per  100,000  children  aged  0-4  years.  In  the nationwide survey of Kawasaki's disease conducted in 2009, which included patients treated for the  disease  in  2007  and  2008,  annual  incidence  rates  were  215.3  and  218.6  per  100,000

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

children  aged  0-4  years  in  2007  and  2008,  respectively.  These  were  the  highest  annual Kawasaki's disease incidence rates ever recorded in Japan.

Assessor's  comment:    There  was  a  significant  difference  in  the  proportion  of  recipients  of 13vPnc  and  7vPnC  who  experienced    fever  (≥37.5°C  but  ≤39°C)  compared  to  DTaP.  The serious adverse events of febrile seizures and Kawasakis disease were fairly equally distributed between all vaccine groups.

6096A1-1000 ; A Phase 1 Open-label Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of a Single Dose of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Chinese Adults, Children and Infants

##  Description

Study 6096A1-1000-CN (B1851046) was conducted in China and was a Phase 1, open-label, single-center  study  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  intramuscular  dose  of 13vPnC  for  approximately  1  month  after  vaccination  in  healthy  Chinese  subjects  in  3  age groups:

-  Group 1: Adults aged 18 through 55 years (before the fifty-sixth birthday)
-  Group 2: Children aged 3 through 5 years (before the sixth birthday)
-  Group 3: Infants aged approximately 2 months (42 to 98 days)

Subjects were enrolled into the 3 age groups sequentially: Group 1, followed by Group 2, and then  Group  3.  The  safety  of  subjects  in  Groups  1  and  2  was  assessed  by  a  safety  review committee prior to enrolling subjects in the subsequent age group.

All vaccinated subjects were assessed for safety for approximately 1 month after vaccination.

##  Methods

-  Objectives

To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 13vPnC in healthy Chinese subjects in 3 age groups:

-  Group 1: Adults aged 18 through 55 years (before the fifty-sixth birthday)
-  Group 2: Children aged 3 through 5 years (before the sixth birthday)
-  Group 3: Infants aged approximately 2 months (42 to 98 days)
-  Study design

This was a phase 1, open-label, single-center study to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 13vPnC for approximately 1 month after vaccination in healthy Chinese subjects in  3  age  groups:  adults,  children  3-5  years  and  infants  2  months  of  age.  Subjects  were enrolled into the 3 age groups sequentially: group 1, followed by group 2, and then group 3. The safety of subjects in groups 1 and 2 was assessed by a safety review committee (SRC) prior to enrolling subjects in the subsequent age group.

All vaccinated subjects were assessed for safety for approximately 1 month after vaccination. At the end of the study, parents/legal guardians of infants in group 3 were offered 3 additional doses of Prevenar for their children in order to complete the infant pneumococcal vaccination schedule recommended in China.

-  Study population /Sample size

Main Criteria for Inclusion: Healthy Chinese male or female adults, children and infants with a signed  and  dated  informed  consent  document  with  no  previous  vaccination  with  licensed  or investigational pneumococcal vaccine. At the time of enrollment subjects in group 1 were to be aged  18  through  55  years,  subjects  in  group  2  were  to  be  aged  3  through  5  years,  and subjects in group 3 were to be aged 42 to 98 days. Subjects were to be healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects  and/or  parent/legal  guardian  had  to  be  willing  and  able  to  comply  with  scheduled visits, and study procedures. All male and female subjects (in group 1) who were biologically capable of having children were to agree and commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control from the signing of the ICF until the end of the study. Female subjects (in group 1) who were biologically capable of having children were to have negative urine pregnancy tests.

Subjects  were  ineligible  to  participate  if  they  were  previously  vaccinated  with  a  licensed  or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, had a previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccine-related component, or if there was any contraindication to vaccination with pneumococcal  vaccine.  Subjects  with  previous  conditions  such  as  bleeding  diathesis  or prolonged  bleeding,  known  or  suspected  immune  deficiency  or  suppression,  major  known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder, significant neurological disorder or history of seizure, severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality were  also  ineligible  to  participate.  Women  who  were  breastfeeding  or  pregnant  (known  or suspected), and subjects who received any investigational products or medical devices within 28 days before investigational product administration or during the study were excluded from participation. Subjects who were related to site staff or Pfizer employees also were not eligible to participate.

Determination of Sample Size: Approximately 72 subjects participated in this study at 1 site. A sample size of 20 adults aged 18 through 55 years, 20 children aged 3 through 5 years, and 20 infants aged 42 to 98 days was required for this study based on regulatory requirements in China. An additional 4 subjects were to be enrolled in each age group for a total of 24 subjects per age group to allow for drop-outs.

##  Treatments

13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (13vPnC) is the investigational product used in this study. 13vPnC was supplied as a 0.5 mL suspension in a prefilled syringe.  A single dose (0.5 mL)  of  13vPnC  was  administered  intramuscularly  into  the  deltoid  muscle  of  the  arm  or anterolateral muscle of the thigh, as appropriate.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Safety Evaluations: Any subject who received at least 1 dose of investigational product was included  in  the  evaluation  for  safety.  Subjects  were  observed  for  any  acute  reactions  for  at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Each day for 7 days after vaccination (days 1 to 7, where day 1 is the day of vaccination), the subject or the subject's parent/legal guardian/caregiver monitored and recorded the following in an e-diary:

## Local reactions

-  Group 1: pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site
-  Groups 2 and 3: tenderness, redness, and swelling at the injection site

## Systemic events

-  Group 1: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain
-  Groups 2 and 3: fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and decreased sleep

Use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms

These  prospectively  collected  local  reactions  and  systemic  events  were  considered  solicited AEs. All other AEs (including SAEs) were collected and recorded in the CRF from the signing of the ICF until the end of the study (approximately 1 month after vaccination). A Safety Review Committee (SRC) reviewed safety data (SAEs, solicited local reactions and systemic events) during  day  1  through  day  7  and  determined  whether  the  study  should  proceed  to  enroll subjects  in  the  subsequent  age  group,  i.e.  in  progressively  more  vulnerable  populations, Groups 1 to 3.

##  Statistical Methods

The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  local  reactions,  systemic  events,  and  use  of antipyretic medications on any day within the 7-day period (days 1 to 7) after investigational product administration was summarized for each group.

Other AEs reported within approximately 1 month after vaccination were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and were summarized by group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All summaries showed, by group, the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 event and the number of events.

Safety data was summarized periodically during the study to ensure the safety of subjects or as needed for safety review by the SRC.

##  Results

a. These values are used as the denominators for percentages.

b. For subjects assigned the vaccine, but not vaccinated, the enrollment date was used instead of vaccination date. For screened only subjects, the visit/assessment date on the demographic page in case report form (CRF) was used. For group 1 and 2, the age at time of vaccination is calculated by (vaccination date - date of birth +1)/365.25. For group 3, the age at time of vaccination is calculated by (vaccination date -- date of birth +1).

-  Efficacy results Not applicable.
-  Safety results Local Reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 8 presents the subjects reporting local reactions within 7 days (safety population). In group 1, the most frequently reported local reaction was pain at the injection site, reported by 23 subjects (95.8%). The pain at the injection site was mostly mild to moderate in intensity. Table 8 also shows that 1 subject in group 1 had an emergency room (ER) visit due to pain. This was actually a data entry error in e-diary (the data entry error details have been recorded on  site  source  documents,  which  have  been  verified  by  the  site  manager  during  the  onsite monitoring visit). The subject visited the ER because of a fever of 38.5°C rather than pain at injection site.

In  group  2,  the  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  was  tenderness,  reported  by  18 subjects (75%), but in no case did it interfere with limb movement.

In group 3, the most frequently reported local reaction was swelling, reported by 6 subjects (25%), which was mild or moderate in intensity.

Abbreviation: NA = Not applicable; CRF = Case report form.

a. N = number of subjects reporting yes for at least 1 day or no for all days.

b. n = Number of subjects reporting the specific characteristic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

c. Exact 2-sided confidence interval (CI) based on the observed proportion of subjects.

d. For Group 1, mild is 2.5 to 5.0 cm, moderate is &gt;5.0 to 10.0 cm, severe is &gt;10.0 cm, and necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis, if any of them is recorded on the adverse event CRF to be evident. For Group 2 or Group 3, mild is 0.5 to 2.0 cm, moderate is &gt;2.0 to 7.0 cm, and severe is &gt;7.0 cm.

e. For Group 1 only. Mild = does not interfere with activity, moderate = interferes with activity, severe =prevents  daily  activity,  and  ER  or  Hospitalized  =  requires  an  emergency  room  (ER)  visit  or hospitalization.

f.  Data  entry  error  in  e-dairy  for  subject  10011024's  ER  visit  due  to  pain  at  injection  site.  Subject visited the ER due to fever rather than pain.

g. For Group 2 or Group 3 only.

h.  Any  local  reaction  =  any  redness,  any  swelling,  or  any  pain  at  injection  site  for  Group  1;  any redness, any swelling, or any tenderness for Group 2 or Group 3.

Table 11 presents the subjects reporting systemic events and antipyretic use within 7 days, in group 1. According to the SFDA grading for fever, 1 subject  in group 1 had fever ≥37.7°C which was considered mild and was ≥37.7°C but ≤38.5°C.

Table 12 presents the subjects reporting systemic events and the antipyretic medication use within 7 days in group 2 and 3 (safety population).

In group 2, only 1 subject reported a systemic event of increased sleep. In group 3, 3 subjects each reported irritability and increased sleep, while 4 subjects reported decreased sleep. No subjects in either group 2 or 3 reported fever ≥38.0°C. No subjects in either group 2 or 3 used antipyretic medication within 7 days of vaccination.

## Summary of Adverse Events

Only 1 AE (bronchopneumonia) was reported in this study, which occurred in group 3 and was also serious and severe. This AE was determined by the investigator to be not related to the vaccination. No non-serious AEs were reported during the study.

Assessor's  comment:  The  Chinese  study  was  very  small,  and  the  safety  data  obtained  are  not considered to add much to the already substantial safety data base of Prevenar 13.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  Japanese  study  generally  confirmed  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  results  obtained  in  other studies with Prevenar13. The Chinese study only had a safety objective, and considering the limited size of the study it is not considered to contribute to the overall safety information for Prevenar 13.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
