This interaction may be related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and applies to other opioids. The clinical relevance is unknown, but data indicate the potential for reduced ticagrelor efficacy in patients co-administered ticagrelor and morphine. In patients with ACS, in whom morphine cannot be withheld and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a parenteral P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered. The package |

In addition, several clinical studies on the adenosine effects have been provided. Three main clinical studies are noteworthy; one in healthy volunteers and 2 in ACS. The studies of Wittfeldt et al 2013 and Bonello et al 2013 provided clearest evidence of these effects. In the third study of Alexopoulos et al 2013, as previously noted, a link between the observed increases in adenosine and clinical outcomes has not been clearly elucidated, limiting the usefulness of the data. However, overall available data show that ticagrelor increases the levels of adenosine. Based on these data the CHMP consider it acceptable to include additional information in section 5.1 of the SmPC.                                                                                                                             |

| II/0021 | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC, based on data from the clinical study D5130C00070, in order to add information about the bioequivalence of crushed tablets mixed with water and administered orally or via nasogastric tube compared to whole tablets. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC have been updated in order to delete dexamethasone from the list of strong CYP3A inducers with the potential to decrease the exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details for the Bulgarian local representative in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 24/07/2014 | 17/07/2015 | SmPC and PL | To support the changes of SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2 the MAH conducted a comparative bioavailability study (D5130C00076) to evaluate alternative methods of administration in which the administration of crushed Ticagrelor tablets, 90 mg, was compared to whole Ticagrelor tablets, 90 mg. Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that there is no difference in the bioavailability of 90 mg ticagrelor crushed tablet administered orally and 90 mg ticagrelor when administered as a whole tablet and also no difference between the dispersed ticagrelor 90 mg tablet suspended in water and administered through a nasogastric tube and 90 mg ticagrelor when administered as a whole tablet. The t max of ticagrelor shifted and was found at 1 hour for the crushed tablet administered orally and through a nasogastric tube versus 2 hours for the whole tablet, however this shift is not considered clinically relevant. |

Recent guidance and literature indicate that dexamethasone can be removed from the list of examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers that may result in reduced efficacy of ticagrelor. The MAH provided appropriate justifications to support the changes in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. Based on the provided references on the potential for interaction with dexamethasone it is agreed that dexamethasone should not be classified as a strong inducer of CYP3A4 as the inducing effect of dexamethasone seems to be less pronounced than the effect of rifampicin. This conclusion is mainly based on the study by Hellmann et all. Although it is still not clear whether dexamethasone should be classified as a weak or a moderate 3A4 inducer, the deletion of dexamethasone from the list of strong   |

Update of sections 4.3 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add safety information regarding hypersensitivity including angioedema. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to propose minor corrections in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8.0. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- | 20/09/2012 | 24/10/2012 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Several events which could possibly be associated with hypersensitivity reactions coming from postmarketing and clinical trials experience were reported by the MAH. From the 75 cases reported 12 were considered serious and 3 were identified as possibly related to treatment with ticagrelor. These events included angioedema as adverse hypersensitivity event and were all retrieved from post- marketing experience. Based on these results the CHMP supported the inclusion of 'hypersensitivity including angioedema' under frequency 'uncommon' in section 4.8 of the SmPC. |
