The EMA concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear and consistent evidence of a difference in the incidence of inhibitor development between the two classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from plasma and those made by recombinant DNA technology. Due to the different characteristics of individual products within the two classes, EMA concluded that the risk of inhibitor development should be evaluated individually for each medicine, regardless of class. The risk for each product will continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes   |            |     |

| II/0017/G | This was an application for a group of variations. C.I.4: Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect available data from Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) from GENA-05 (interim report) study. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 8.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the Product Information throughout to bring it in line with the Core summary of product characteristics for human plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999 rev. 2) and with the QRD version 10 (affects labelling only). Moreover the MAH is combining the SmPC for all strengths and updating Annex A with detailed information on the packaging. C.I.11: Submission of an updated RMP version 8.0 in order to align the content in a single harmonised | 14/09/2017 | 24/11/2017 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The MAH provided an Interim Report on their PUP-study. Preliminary data regarding efficacy and safety is considered to be in line with previously collected data in children but should be updated, accordingly, as soon as the final study report is available. Consequently, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to remove the statement that safety and efficacy of Nuwiq in previously untreated patients (PUP) have not yet been established and additional information on treatment monitoring has been added. Section 4.8 has been updated to reflect the entity of 'Hypersensitivity'. Section 5.1 has been updated with a statement that the PUP-study is ongoing. The MAH should provide an update of the SmPC with the Final Study Report. |
