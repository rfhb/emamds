## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

More than 2% of the world population is chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The prevalence of HCV in Europe varies geographically, ranging from 0.4% to 3% in Western Europe. Chronic HCV infection is now a leading cause of liver transplantation and has superseded HIV infection as a cause of death in the United States.  Furthermore, HCV was associated with more than half of the estimated 18,910 liver cancer deaths in the United States in 2010 and has become the leading cause of primary liver cancer in Europe.

Approximately 20% of HCV-infected individuals develop liver cirrhosis, with thrombocytopenia as a clinical marker of progression to more severe hepatic impairment. Once cirrhosis develops, the outcome is predictable in patients who are not treated with antiviral therapy: patients develop complications of cirrhosis, including hepatic decompensation (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding), hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. For patients with chronic HCV and platelet counts &lt;100 Gi/L the prognosis is especially poor, with annualised incidence rates for hepatocellular carcinoma/clinical decompensation, death/liver transplantation, or death alone as high as 7.9%, 7.3%, and 5.3%, respectively. These yearly incidence rates mean that 2 out of 5 patients with chronic HCV and platelet counts &lt;100 Gi/L will have a life threatening complication in the next 5 years and at least 1 out of 4 will die during the same period.

Achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) is the primary goal of antiviral therapy.  It not only represents cure from viral infection, but also provides the prospect of changing the natural history of the disease.  The importance of SVR is reflected by a 4-10 fold decrease in mortality and a 2-4 fold decrease in the incidences of decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in HCV patients compared to patients with persistent HCV infection.  Even for patients who have developed hepatic decompensation, achieving SVR prior to liver transplantation can improve outcomes after transplantation by avoiding HCV recurrence. Peginterferon and ribavirin form the backbone of approved HCV antiviral therapy.  For patients with HCV genotype 1, the addition of a direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) protease inhibitor such as boceprevir or telaprevir to peginterferon and ribavirin (triple therapy) has led to SVR rates of up to 80% and has redefined the standard of care. Boceprevir and telaprevir are not approved for use in patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3, and their safety and efficacy in patients with marked thrombocytopenia have not been studied.

The etiology of thrombocytopenia in HCV-infected patients is multi-fold and includes impaired production of endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) in the liver and platelet pooling due to splenomegaly.  The severity of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of the liver disease. Consequently, low platelet counts are predictive of poorer outcomes.

Thrombocytopenia is also caused, or further aggravated, by interferon-based antiviral therapy due to its myelosuppressive effects.  Data from published Phase III studies for peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b, which excluded patients with platelet counts &lt;90 Gi/L, and &lt;100 Gi/L, respectively, showed that approximately 20 to 30% experienced thrombocytopenia during treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin.  The current peginterferon labels advise that they should be used with caution in patients with baseline platelet counts &lt;90 Gi/L and should be discontinued in patients who develop severe decreases in platelet counts.  It has been estimated that 6% of HCV patients are not eligible for peginterferon and ribavirin antiviral therapy due to thrombocytopenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The current clinical management of HCV-patients with thrombocytopenia receiving antiviral therapy relies primarily on reducing the peginterferon dose.  However, such dose reductions, particularly when occurring during the initial 12 weeks of antiviral treatment, are associated with a reduced ability to achieve the desired outcome of antiviral therapy, i.e. SVR.  In fact, data suggest that in patients with HCV and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, peginterferon dose reductions are particularly detrimental to achieving SVR. The window of opportunity to administer antiviral therapy is relatively short for patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and significant HCV-associated thrombocytopenia.  Most of them are at high risk of transitioning to hepatic decompensation.  Once patients have decompensated, initiation of antiviral therapy with peginterferon is contra-indicated due to high rates of treatment- associated side effects and low response rates to currently available antiviral therapies.

The treatment of hepatitis C virus infection is an area of intense current research, with various anticipated improvements to available treatment options emerging. Numerous antiviral agents are currently in various stages of development, most with the ultimate goal of achieving a successful and safe interferon-free treatment regimen.  Until interferon-free treatment regimens become available, IFN remains as the backbone of antiviral regimens in HCV.

Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist. It interacts with the TPO-R and induces proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells to increase platelet counts.

Eltrombopag is currently indicated in the treatment of adult patients with ITP not candidates or after failure to splenectomy. The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. For patients of East Asian or South East Asian ancestry, eltrombopag should be initiated at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily and the maximum allowed is do not exceed a dose of 75 mg daily.

The MAH submitted a variation to extend the indication for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C infection for the treatment of thrombocytopenia:

- To enable the initiation of interferon-based therapy; and
- During interferon-based therapy

The proposed starting dose is 25 mg eltrombopag once daily for all patients. After initiating eltrombopag, the dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve/maintain the minimum target platelet count necessary to maintain full-dose antiviral therapy, up to a maximum dose of 100 mg eltrombopag once daily.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The product is presented as tablets containing one new strength of eltrombopag olamine equivalent to 75 mg of eltrombopag as active substance.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied also for the 100 mg strength; however the application was withdrawn during the evaluation since problems were encountered during the validation process of the 100 mg strength. The Quality information of the withdrawn strength was similar to the one provided for the 75 mg strength.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other ingredients are: magnesium stearate, mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose, povidone (K30), sodium starch glycolate Type A, hypromellose, iron oxide red (E172), iron oxide black (E172), iron oxide yellow (E172), macrogol 400, and titanium dioxide (E171).

The product is available in aluminium blisters (PA/Alu/PVC/Alu) as the already authorised strengths.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

Eltrombopag olamine used for the manufacture of Revolade 75 mg film-coated tablets is of the same quality as the one used for the already authorised strengths. The applicant submitted a Type IA variation to reduce the limit for the potentially genotoxic oxime isomer impurities from 20ppm to 5ppm.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

Revolade 75 mg strength was developed to support the additional proposed indication for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with HCV infection.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied also for the 100 mg strength; however the application was withdrawn during the evaluation since problems were encountered in the validation process of the 100 mg strength.

All the excipients, except for the colorants, are controlled by the appropriate Ph Eur monograph. The formulae for the colorants mixtures and the specifications applied were provided and considered satisfactory. No compatibility issues were identified between the active substance and the excipients employed in the finished product

The finished product is an immediate release tablet dosage form that employs a common granulation to make tablets of different strengths; therefore, the particle size of the granule will impact the finished product content uniformity and must be controlled. Since the active substance has a low solubility, the active substance particle size will have an impact on tablet dissolution. Granulation is the only critical step identified. For all steps, both quality critical process parameters (QCPP) and quality process parameters (QPP) are defined by an acceptable range of values (defined as the Proven Acceptable Range) or by the desired end point.

The new strength 75mg is manufactured using a common granule as with the 25mg and 50mg tablets, so no new statistical design of experiments was performed on this critical process, but further process validation was performed on the blending and compression processes.

Eltrombopag olamine has a low solubility over the pH range 1 to 7.4.  It is considered to have moderate permeability so the bioavailability may be considered to be limited by its dissolution rate.  Because of its low solubility, a dissolution method was developed using a surfactant.

The primary packaging used for the 75mg is the same as that used for the 25mg and 50mg tablets, that is polyamide / aluminium foil / polyvinyl chloride (PVC) laminate blister which is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sealed with aluminium foil, nominally 20µm thick with a vinyl acrylic heat seal coating.  The product contact materials are the PVC and acrylic coating. Appropriate specifications applied by the product manufacturers have been provided together with supplier documentation indicating that the PVC complies with the PhEur and with the European Directive for contact with food.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of this new strength.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture of the product

The finished product manufacturing process covers dry mixing of ingredients, granulation, wet milling, drying, milling blending (pre-lubrication and lubrication), compression, coating and packaging and it is the same manufacturing process as the one used for the already authorised strengths.

## Product specification

The finished product release specifications are identical to the already authorized strengths and include appropriate tests for description, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), related impurities content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur), and microbiological test (Ph. Eur.).

Batch analysis results in 5 full-scale batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control.

## Stability of the product

Stability data was provided for 48 months at 30 °C / 65% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH for two commercial scale batches, for the 25mg, 50mg and 75mg strength tablets, in the proposed packaging.

Supporting stability data was provided for 48 months at 30 °C / 65% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH for three commercial scale batches, in the proposed packaging.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of this new strength Revolade 75 mg tablets has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

A number of additional nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies have been completed since the initial marketing application was submitted.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The effects of eltrombopag and TPO recombinant on cell proliferation of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell lines (Hep3B, Huh-7 and HepG2) and normal liver samples were investigated. Following treatment with recombinant TPO there was a small, but statically significant proliferative response in the Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines. Treatment with eltrombopag induced a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation with a mean of IC50 of 5.6, 26.1 and 15.9 μg/mL for the HepG2, Hep3B and Huh-7 cell lines, respectively.

The expression of the gene which encodes for TPO-R (MPL) mRNA was measured in HCC cell lines, patient-derived HCC and normal liver samples. MPL mRNA expression was very low, but detectable in the Hep3B, Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines; undetectable in HCV patient liver samples and higher in normal liver samples. TPO-R protein was also detected in the HCC cell lines.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

Three new pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted that are relevant for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic HCV infection:

An in vitro investigation of the role of organic anion transporter polypeptides in the hepatic uptake of [Ring-U-14C]SB-497115 using isolated human hepatocytes.

This study was conducted to investigate eltrombopag uptake into human hepatocytes in vitro. [14C] eltrombopag was incubated with cryopreserved human hepatocyte culture and its uptake by the hepatocytes, as measured by cellular radioactivity content, was determined in the absence and presence of an inhibitor cocktail of uptake transporters (rifamycin, montelukast, cyclosporine A and ketoconazole). This study demonstrated that eltrombopag transport into human hepatocytes was passive and nonsaturable, and that the uptake transporter inhibitors had no effect on the hepatic uptake. These results were consistent with a previous finding that eltrombopag was not a substrate of human OATP1B1. Hepatitis C viral infection has been shown to alter expression of hepatic transporters, including uptake transporters. Because the uptake of eltrombopag into hepatocytes is passive, uptake into hepatocytes of HCV patients should not be affected.

Qualitative investigation of the metabolites of eltrombopag (SB-497115) in human plasma following oral administration of eltrombopag olamine (50 mg) in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a study to qualitatively compare circulating metabolites in patients of renal impairment with healthy subjects. Plasma samples from a clinical study were analysed by LC/MS for eltrombopag and its metabolites. No notable differences were observed in circulating metabolite profiles between healthy and renally impaired subjects. The human radiolabel study indicated that metabolites derived from oxidation and glucuronidation of eltrombopag circulated at low levels in healthy humans. Therefore, renal impairment alone should not notably alter circulating metabolite profiles in HCV patients.

An in vitro investigation into the inhibition by SB-497115 (eltrombopag) of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol transport via human breast cancer resistance protein heterologously expressed in MDCKII cells.

This report described an in vitro study to characterize the effect of eltrombopag on breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (a metabolite of doxorubicin). Eltrombopag is an inhibitor of BCRP, of which both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol are substrates. In a polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line heterologously expressing human BCRP, eltrombopag up to 30 μM had no effect on BCRP-mediated transport of doxorubicin or doxorubicinol. These results indicated a low potential of clinical interaction of eltrombopag with the anthracycline and its metabolite.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Other toxicity studies

One toxicology study has been conducted with eltrombopag. This study provides an in vitro assessment of the genotoxic potential of the impurities GSK1719938A and SB-433049.

A reassessment of the route of synthesis for eltrombopag identified several potential genotoxins: SB-611855-AAB, SB-601205, SB-564758, GSK560666A, SB-710620-A, GSK1719938A and SB433049. With the exception of the additional impurities GSK1719938A and SB-433049, these potential genotoxins are the same as those highlighted in the initial marketing application for ITP.

GSK1720079A (a mixture of the isomers GSK1719938A and SB-433049 as pure preparations of these molecules could not be prepared) was evaluated in a screening Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101), in both the presence and absence of S9-mix and in concentrations ranging between 50 to 5000 μg/plate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GSK1720079A induced mutation in strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100 when tested in the presence of S9-mix and TA98, TA100 and WP2 uvrA pKM101 when tested in the absence of S9-mix.

Analysis of the eltrombopag drug substance confirmed that the levels of each of these potential impurities at the recommended clinical dose are below 1.5 μg/day, the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC).

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

For eltrombopag where the maximum recommended daily dosage is 100 mg/day, PECsurface water was 0.5 µg/L. Upon CHMP request the PECSURFACE WATER value was refined with information for the sum of all the indications including the sales forecast of Revolade. The refined PECsurface water was 0.069 µg/L. This value is greater than the nominal trigger value of 0.01 µg/L and therefore a Phase II environmental was performed.

In a phase II Tier A assessment, eltrombopag was investigated for determination of activated sludge sorption isotherm according to OPPTS 835.1110. Due to physico-chemical characteristics of the compound, no determination of the isotherm was possible in this study and a Phase II Tier B assessment was performed. See Table 1 for a summary of the studies performed.

Finally, the distribution coefficient for eltrombopag is 4.52 at ph=7 and it has been screened for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Eltrombopag has been considered persistent because the degree of ultimate biodegradation has been insignificant (14%, 28 days) and the parent compound has proved recalcitrant to primary degradation (10%, 28 days), but it does not fulfil the criterion for bioaccumulation (BCF=14) in a fish concentration study (OECD 305).

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress the CHMP recommends the update of the ERA including the following points for further investigation:

- -Tier A: Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediments system (OECD 308), Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211) and Fish, early life stage toxicity test (OECD 210)
- -Tier B: Aerobic transformation in soil (OECD 307), Soil microorganisms, nitrogen transformation test (OECD 216), Terrestrial plants, growth test (OECD 208), Earthworm, acute toxicity test (OECD 207), Collembola reproduction (ISO 11267) and Sediment - water chironomid (OECD 218/219).

In addition, the following standard sentence was added in the Package Leaflet as a precautionary measure until the studies have been performed: 'Do not throw away any medicines via waste water or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.'

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Eltrombopag is a trombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonist that functions in a similar manner to endogenous trombopoietin (TPO). Eltrombopag induces survival, proliferation and megakaryocyte differentiation activities in human bone marrow progenitors. Eltrombopag has no direct effect on in vitro platelet aggregation or activation, nor does it influence agonist-dependent aggregation or activation.

Safety pharmacology studies submitted as part of the initial marketing authorisation application did not reveal any adverse neurobehavioral, respiratory or cardiovascular effects in vivo at the highest doses tested. However, the doses tested did not result in exposure levels in animals compare to humans enough to discard the risk for patients with HCV infection treated with 100 mg of eltrombopag (~3-fold for neurobehavioral or respiratory systems and 1.2 for cardiovascular system). No clinically significant effects on cardiac repolarization were observed in clinical trials in healthy subjects and patients with HCV, but other cardiovascular damage, as thrombotic events and proarrhythmia, have been associated with eltrombopag treatment. Nevertheless the CHMP agreed that additional in vivo non clinical studies with higher doses of eltrombopag were not warranted based on the MAH's justification that dose higher than 30

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/kg/day could not be well tolerated by the animals. Further assessment of cardiac repolarization has been performed on a clinical level and the risk of thrombosis is currently adequately addressed in the SmPC.

Taking into account the proposed indication is for patients with hepatic damage, the MAH has discussed the clinical relevance of hepatic effect found in animals in HCV patients and review the available data on possible adverse effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver seen using models with hepatic disease. Hepatotoxicity has been observed in mice and rats generally associated with non-tolerated doses. It was considered a secondary effect of eltrombopag rather than a primary toxicity. In dogs, short treatment (4-14 days) with high doses of eltrombopag (≥60 mg/kg/day) induced hepatocellular degeneration/necrosis and/or apoptosis associated with marked increases from baseline values in serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase or total bilirubin. No similar findings were observed in dogs after 52 weeks of dosing at a maximum tolerated dose of 30 mg/kg/day. In addition, a review of recent literature on nonclinical models of HCV-related liver disease showed that there are no suitable animal models currently available to evaluate possible effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver.

Since animal models for the study of possible effects of eltrombopag treatment on liver of HCV are not available and the risk in humans is already known and it is included in the current SmPC, the CHMP was of the opinion that further studies were not necessary to characterise the hepatotoxicity associated with eltrombopag treatment from the non-clinical point of view.

According to the data submitted in the initial marketing application, eltrombopag is considered not genotoxic, not carcinogenic, not phototoxic and it does not affect the fertility. However, the doses tested did not allow a safety margin to exclude risk for HCV patients treated with 100 mg/day of eltrombopag. The safety margin was 6.8 (rat bone marrow micronucleus test) for genotoxic potential, below 2 for carcinogenic potential and 1.8 fold in mice/1.9 in rats for photoxicity. In addition low safety margins have been obtained for teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits and the development risk for humans cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, additional studies were not warranted because higher doses would not be tolerated by the animals. In this regard the SmPC currently describes the risk adequately. It states that mice and rats do not fully model potential adverse effects related to the pharmacology of eltrombopag in humans due to the TPO receptor specificity and safety margins are adequately described (see SmPC section 5.3).

Eltrombopag is not a PBT substance. The refined PEC surface water calculated for the maximum daily dose of 100mg exceeds the trigger value for a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis. An activated sludge sorption isotherm was not determined for eltrombopag due to instability problems, but a QSAR (PCKOC) evaluation of eltrombopag predicts that Koc will be significantly greater than 10,000 (Log Koc = 5.66). The CHMP was of the opinion that the risk to the environment has been properly assessed.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Eltrombopag has been well characterised in a comprehensive battery of nonclinical studies that support the clinical use of eltrombopag in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the

main factor preventing the initiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The effect of the co-administration of eltrombopag and IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin or IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin was studied by performing population PK analyses. An eltrombopag population PK model was developed using eltrombopag plasma concentration-time, dosing, demographic and covariate data collected from one Phase II pilot study in subjects with HCV infection (TPL102357)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and two Phase III studies (TPL103922 [ENABLE I] and TPL108390 [ENABLE II]) in subjects with HCV infection, combined with data from a healthy subject study (SB497115/002, N=28).

## Population PK model

Of the 663 subjects included in the population PK analysis, 28 were healthy subjects and 635 were HCV patients. The median (range) age across the 663 subjects was 52.0 (19.0-74.0) years, and 403 subjects (61%) were male. There were 144 elderly (&gt;60 years) subjects (22%) in the population. The median (range) body weight was 75.0 (41.0-164.0) kg. Of the 663 individuals, 362 subjects (55%) were White, 12 (2%) were Black or African-American, 145 (22%) were East Asian, 69 (10%) were South East Asian, 74 (11%) were Central/South Asian and 1 (&lt;1%) were classified as Other.

Of the 635 HCV patients included in the population PK and PK/PD analyses, 605 subjects (95%) were classified as Child-Pugh Class A (Child-Pugh score of 5-6, mild hepatic impairment), 27 (4%) as Child-Pugh Class B (Child-Pugh score of 7-9, moderate hepatic impairment) and none as Child-Pugh Class C (Child-Pugh score of 10-15, severe hepatic impairment).

The parameter estimates of the final PK model are presented in Table 2. There were a number of significant covariates identified.  CL/F of eltrombopag was, on average, 29% lower in female subjects compared to males, 27% lower in elderly (&gt;60 years) compared to younger subjects, and on average, 36% lower in East/Southeast Asian subjects compared to other races who are predominantly Caucasian. CL/F in subjects with a Child-Pugh score of 5 was estimated to be, on average, 50% lower than healthy subjects. As the severity of the hepatic impairment increased there was a further reduction in CL/F. For a patient with Child-Pugh score of 9, CL/F was estimated to be 71% lower compared to a patient with a Child-Pugh score of 5. CL/F was negatively correlated to AST levels. Vc/F was estimated to be 2.3-fold higher in Central/South Asians compared to all other races. For the range of weights in the analysis population (41-164 kg), Vc/F and Vp/F ranged from 7.1- 28.3 L and 12.7-50.6 L, respectively. For an average AST level in the HCV population of the current analysis (102 IU/L), CL/F value was estimated to decrease by 18% compared to HCV patients with normal AST (20 IU/L). All of the fixed effect parameters were estimated with good precision (%RSE &lt;24%). The inter-individual and interoccasional random effects were also estimated with reasonable precision, with %RSE less than 12%.

The final model was evaluated by performing a VPC stratified by study and dose. Only 9% of the observed concentrations fell outside the 90% prediction intervals, supporting the conclusion that the final model adequately describes the observed data.

The individual post-hoc parameter estimates were derived for all subjects in the PK dataset and to further characterize the difference in eltrombopag PK across various sub-populations, individual predicted steady state CL/F, Cmax, AUC(0-τ), and half-life (t1/2) were derived following repeat dosing of once daily 50 mg eltrombopag, and summarized by population in this model. Consistent with the final PK model, plasma eltrombopag exposure is higher in subjects with HCV compared to healthy subjects. For repeat daily dose of 50 mg eltrombopag, the geometric mean AUC(0-τ) and steady state Cmax in all HCV patients were 3.1 and 2.3-fold higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of eltrombopag was also significantly longer in HCV patients due to their reduced clearance (CL/F). Within HCV patients, exposure is higher in both females and East/Southeast Asians, and elderly subjects (&gt;60 years) due to their lower CL/F. The terminal half-life of eltrombopag derived from the final PK model for both healthy subjects and HCV patients (52.2 and 122 h, respectively) was longer than that previously reported for both healthy subjects and subjects with CLD (21.1 and 76.4 h, respectively). The estimates of the typical values of both CL/F and Q/F from Model 104 were in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

close agreement with those previously reported (0.938 vs. 0.953 L/h; 0.615 and 0.633 L/h). However, the estimates of the typical values for both volume terms (Vc/F and Vp/F) from the present analysis were higher than those previously reported, particularly for the peripheral volume term which was double the estimate from the CLD analysis (21.6 vs. 9.41 L).

A summary of eltrombopag PK parameter estimates by population is shown in Table 3.

b. HCV subjects with Part 1 PK samples were included in the summary (N=602).

A statistical analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effect of IFN alfa-2a and IFN alfa-2b on eltrombopag CL/F using a mixed effects model approach (Treatment as a fixed effect and Subject as a random effect) which showed that there was an estimated 9% and 11% drop in the CL/F of eltrombopag when IFN alfa-2a and alfa-2b were co-administered with eltrombopag, respectively. The ratios (90% CI) for the effect of IFN alfa-2a and IFN alfa-2b were estimated to be 0.910 (0.851-0.974) and 0.887 (0.823-0.956) (Table 4). The 90% CI for both the comparisons were within the 80 to 125% limit of the standard bioequivalence criteria suggesting that there were no clinically meaningful differences in the CL/F of eltrombopag with and without administration of IFNs.

In order to further assess the impact of more severe hepatic impairment on eltrombopag clearance (CL/F) and to test the impact of age on CL/F, the MAH provided upon CHMP request a combined PK population analysis including data from the previous HCV (ENABLE-based) and the CLD (ELEVATE-based) population PK analyses.

A total of 742 subjects were included in the combined PK dataset (28 healthy volunteers, 635 patients form the HCV studies and 79 patients from the CLD studies [38 of which were HCV patients]). Most of the subjects were males (61%), Child-Pugh Class A (90%) and the mean age was 52 years (range 19-81 years). Eleven percent (n=79) of the subjects were 65 years old or above, with very few subjects ≥75 years of age (n=4).

The combined model confirmed both, age and hepatic impairment, as significant covariates. The previously identified covariates remained significant as well. With regards to hepatic impairment, simulations performed with the combined model indicate that eltrombopag CL/F decreases with increasing degrees of hepatic impairment, assessed by Child-Pugh Scores. Therefore, the combined model confirmed that exposure increases with increasing hepatic impairment, as previously predicted. The estimated increase in exposure, compared to healthy subjects, was 111-183%, for subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.

Plasma eltrombopag concentration-time data collected in 590 subjects with HCV enrolled in Phase III studies TPL103922/ENABLE 1 and TPL108390/ENABLE 2 were combined with data from patients with HCV enrolled in the Phase II study TPL102357 and healthy adult subjects in a population PK analysis. Plasma eltrombopag Cmax AUC(0τ ) estimates for patients with HCV enrolled in the Phase 3 studies are presented for each dose studied in Table 5.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

An eltrombopag population PK/PD model was developed using platelet count over time and eltrombopag dosing from the Phase II (Study TPL102357) and the Phase III (ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2) studies were combined with the individual PK parameters obtained from the population PK model. The population PK/PD model was built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach with NONMEM program version VII.

## Population PK/PD Model for Eltrombopag without and with Interferon

The final dataset for the eltrombopag PK/PD model consisted of 1567 platelet observations from 633 subjects.  The structural PK/PD model for eltrombopag was the same as that previously developed for subjects with CLD. As higher dose levels were used in this study, this allows the relationship between plasma eltrombopag concentrations and the stimulation of platelet production in the thrombocytopenic HCV subjects to be described by the Emax model. The parameter estimates are shown in Table 6.

The typical estimates for KIN and KT were 10.6 Gi/L/day and 0.667 day-1, respectively. The maximal stimulatory effect was 15.4 and the associated EC50 was 29 μg/mL. The IIV for KIN and EC50 was 43.0 and 80.9%, respectively. The structural parameters for the model were estimated with reasonable precision, with %RSE less than 30%. The diagnostic plots for the final model indicated that the model adequately described the platelet count data for the thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV during the eltrombopag dose escalation phase of the studies, although there was a slight under-prediction of the higher observed platelet count data. The distribution of the random effects was close to normal and no strong unexplained covariate-parameter relationships were noticeable.

The eltrombopag PK/PD model was evaluated by performing a VPC, only 8% of the observed platelet concentrations fell outside the 90% prediction intervals.

The simulations of the eltrombopag dose escalation phase of the ENABLE 1 and 2 underestimated the percentage of subjects who would qualify for initiation of antiviral therapy after two weeks of receiving 25 mg eltrombopag QD. However, the subsequent predictions at Weeks 4, 6 and 9 were closer to the observed data. The simulations also predicted that, on average, only 3 and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5% of the HCV subjects would have failed to initiate antiviral therapy in ENABLE 1 and 2, respectively, which is almost identical to the actual study results.

The final model included separate models for the inhibitory effects of IFN alfa-2a and 2b therapy on platelet counts. Due to a lack of PK data for IFN, a KPD modelling approach was used (see Figure1). As with the eltrombopag PK/PD model, there was an under-prediction of the higher platelet counts.

The stimulatory effect of eltrombopag on platelet production was not shown to vary between different subpopulations. This is in contrast to the results obtained from a similar analysis in subjects with CLD (72 and 11% were identified as having HCVB and C aetiology, respectively), in which East Asian subjects were found to be less sensitive to the stimulatory effect of eltrombopag. In the analysis for CLD population, the majority of East Asian subjects were from one Japanese study. It is possible that the estimated racial effect on the platelet response was confounded by the difference or variability between different studies involved in that analysis.

## Simulations

A number of simulations were performed in order to assess the impact of alternate eltrombopag dosing regimens prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy and during the course of antiviral therapy.

Simulation indicated that steady-state platelet response was achieved between Week 5 and Week 6 following once daily dosing of eltrombopag (see Figure 2). Approximately 30% of the steady-state platelet response was achieved after 2 weeks dosing, and approximately 60% of steady-state platelet response was achieved after 3 weeks dosing.

Simulated platelet response following eltrombopag regimens of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg once daily is proposed to support eltrombopag 25 mg once daily as an appropriate initial dose. The simulation predicted that approximately 45% (35%) of patients would achieve platelet counts &gt;90 Gi/L (&gt;100 Gi/L) following once daily dose of 25 mg eltrombopag for 2 weeks, enabling initiation of antiviral therapy (90 Gi/L for IFN alfa-2a and 100 Gi/L for IFN alfa2b). Of these patients, approximately 97% would maintain platelet counts &lt;200Gi/L.

Similar results were predicted across different subpopulations, with slightly higher proportion of East/Southeast Asian patients, 57% (47%), than non-East/Southeast Asian patients, 43% (32%), achieving platelet counts &gt;90 Gi/L (&gt;100 Gi/L) following 2 weeks of once daily dose at 25 mg eltrombopag, however the proportion of patients with platelet counts &lt;200 Gi/L was comparable (94 to 98%) across subpopulations.

Simulation with a starting dose of 25 mg eltrombopag once daily followed by biweekly dose escalation up to 100 mg once daily were performed. In these simulations, the dose of eltrombopag was allowed to increase, in 25 mg increments up to a maximum of 100 mg, if the platelet count was predicted to be &lt;60 Gi/L and to decrease in increments of 25 mg if the platelet count was predicted to be &gt;200 Gi/L. Three different scenarios were simulated: platelet counts were evaluated once weekly, once every two weeks or once every three weeks. The dose of the pegylated IFN remained unchanged (180 μg/week for IFN alfa-2a or 1.5 μg/kg/week for IFN alfa-2b) during the course of the simulation.

Simulations indicated that approximately 50% of subjects required at least one eltrombopag dose adjustment during antiviral therapy to maintain sufficient platelet counts. Subjects who initiated antiviral therapy at the lowest eltrombopag dose of 25 mg were more likely to stay on the same dose through the antiviral therapy, whereas subjects who initiated antiviral therapy at 75 mg were more likely to require further eltrombopag dose escalation to 100 mg during antiviral

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapy. More frequent dose modification appeared to cause more subjects to be escalated to the higher eltrombopag doses.  Finally, the results of simulations at the steady state which occurs 6 weeks post the last eltrombopag dose adjustment are shown in Table 9.

## Drug-drug interaction study (TPL116010)

A drug-drug interaction (DDI) between eltrombopag and boceprevir or telaprevir has been initiated. The study evaluated the interaction between a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg and repeat doses of boceprevir 800 mg Q8h (Cohort 1) and telaprevir 750 mg Q8h (Cohort 2) in healthy adult subjects. Preliminary results suggested no interaction between eltrombopag and boceprevir or telaprevir (Tables 10 and 11). Results of the impact of eltrombopag on plasma boceprevir PK are not yet available.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Overall, the mean estimated PK parameters were similar to those published in literature. Certain subpopulations (females, elderly, East/Southeast Asian subjects) and HCV subjects with a ChildPugh Score &gt; 5 showed a lower CL/F, which translates into higher eltrombopag exposure. The PK parameters of pegylated IFN alfa-2a and alfa-2b were similar to what was already reported in the literature. The co-administration with eltrombopag did not show an impact on the PK of either IFN.

The influence of East Asian ethnicity (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai) on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 635 patients with HCV (145 East Asians and 69 Southeast Asians). Based on estimates from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, East Asian patients had approximately 55 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) values as compared to patients of other races who were predominantly Caucasian.

The influence of gender on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics analysis in 635 patients with HCV (260 females). Based on model estimate, female HCV patient had approximately 41 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) as compared to male patients (see SmPC section 5.2).

The influence of age on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics analysis in 28 healthy subjects, 673 patients with HCV, and 41 patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiology ranging from 19 to 74 years old. There are no PK data on the use of eltrombopag in patients ≥ 75 years. Based on model estimate, elderly (≥ 65 years) patients had approximately 41 % higher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0τ ) as compared to younger patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from the ELEVATE study were included in the model in order to have more subjects with a greater degree of hepatic impairment. The combined model confirmed both, age and hepatic impairment, as significant covariates. In addition, the MAH has also provided additional data on eltrombopag plasma exposure from HCV patients with and without hypoalbumemia (albumin&lt;35 g/L). Based on the provided PK estimates and the observed safety profile, the CHMP agreed that the use of eltrombopag in patients with moderate-severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh score &gt;5) should not be recommended. The SmPC has been updated to reflect the recommendations for eltrombopag use in subjects with hepatic impairment, including those with hypoalbuminemia. Moreover data available on patients with moderate-severe renal impairment is scarce and this fact has been appropriately reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.2).

The impact of age on eltrombopag CL/F was also re-evaluated on the combined model. Age remained a relevant covariate. The number of subjects ≥75 years old was small (n=4) and no PK data is available for subjects ≥85 years old. This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.2).

Results of a drug-drug PK interaction study show that co-administration of repeat doses of boceprevir 800 mg Q8h or telaprevir 750 mg Q8h with a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent. Co-administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200 mg with telaprevir 750 mg Q8h did not alter plasma telaprevir exposure. No information on the effect on boceprevir exposure is yet available (see SmPC section 4.5 and Benefit-risk balance). This data was considered important to address the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in combination with new direct acting agents and has been included in the RMP as missing information. The applicant will provide post-authorisation the final results of the drug-drug interaction study of eltrombopag with boceprevir and telaprevir (TPL110610), and it has been reflected in the PhV plan of the RMP as category 3 (required additional pharmacovigilance activity).

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The effect of the co-administration of eltrombopag and IFN alfa-2a plus ribavirin or IFN alfa-2b plus ribavirin was studied by performing population PK analyses. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data showed that repeat, once daily dosing led to platelet count increases after 8 days of dosing, and a maximal platelet count response was achieved approximately 2 weeks after the start of dosing. A PK/PD model estimated that 54% of subjects would require an eltrombopag dose of 100 mg to maintain a platelet count &gt;80 Gi/L during peginterferon therapy.

The simulations provided by the MAH are comprehensive for the current recommended posology prior to and after initiation of antiviral therapy with IFN.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

The primary evidence for the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in the treatment of adult patients with HCV-associated thrombocytopenia is provided by two  Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, TPL103922 (ENABLE 1) and TPL108390 (ENABLE 2). The design of both studies followed the advice received from the EMA prior to initiating the Phase III studies. An additional phase II supportive dose-finding study was submitted.

## 2.5.1. Dose response study

## TPL102357 Study

## Methods

Study TPL102357 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, doseranging, parallel group, Phase II pilot study in male and female subjects with HCV infection and platelet counts of 20 to &lt;70Gi/L who were otherwise eligible to begin treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin.

Approximately 160 subjects were planned to be randomized equally (1:1:1:1) into one of four treatment groups of 40 subjects. Stratification was according to baseline platelet count (20 to &lt;50 Gi/L and ≥50 to &lt;70 Gi/L). Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with chronic HCV (defined as the presence of HCV antibodies and detectable HCV RNA) who had compensated liver disease and pre-existing thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 20 to &lt;70 Gi/L) were recruited. Subjects were required to have a liver biopsy indicative of chronic hepatitis, or radiographic evidence of cirrhosis or endoscopic evidence of portal hypertension.

The study was conducted in two phases, Parts 1 and 2. In Part 1, study subjects were randomized to eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects who successfully completed Part 1 (achieved a platelet count ≥ 70Gi/L for Pegasys or platelet count ≥ 100Gi/L for PEG-Intron at Day 28) proceeded to Part 2. In Part 2, subjects received an additional 8-12 weeks of eltrombopag or placebo administered daily with antiviral therapy (peginterferon and ribavirin). At the completion of Part 2, subjects could continue to receive antiviral therapy per standard of care at the discretion of the investigator. Platelet counts were measured throughout the study and 4 weeks after the last dose of double-blind study medication.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag on platelet counts when administered once daily for 4 weeks (Part 1, Pre-antiviral Therapy Phase) to subjects with chronic HCV-related thrombocytopenia, prior to receiving antiviral therapy. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the following: effects of eltrombopag on platelet counts when administered once daily for 12 weeks during antiviral therapy (Part 2), effects of eltrombopag on markers of thrombopoiesis when administered once daily for 16 weeks, effects of eltrombopag on antiviral treatment outcome measures during and after antiviral therapy, safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered once daily for 16 weeks, and population pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of eltrombopag when administered once daily for 16 weeks to subjects with chronic HCV.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a shift from baseline platelet count (between 20 and &lt;70Gi/L) to ≥100Gi/L after 4 weeks (Part 1, pre-antiviral phase) of administration of eltrombopag prior to receiving antiviral therapy. For the purpose of the primary analysis, missing platelet count data from Weeks 2 to 4 in Part 1 was replaced with the previous observation, i.e. the last observation was carried forward (LOCF).

The study was initiated on 5 April 2005 in Europe and the USA. The study was originally planned with no interim analysis, except for a blinded review of safety and tolerability by an IDMC when 40 subjects completed Part 1. After the study began, Protocol Amendment 02 was implemented on 25 August 2005 which stipulated performing a formal interim analysis on the Part 1 data. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interim analysis was conducted to assess treatment effect with the purpose of supporting a possible extension of the treatment period to 48 weeks. The interim analysis, conducted on 8 November 2005, included subjects who had completed 4 weeks of treatment or were withdrawn as of October 2005. The number of subjects included in the interim analysis was 33.

As a result of this first interim analysis, plasma levels of eltrombopag were found at a higher level in HCV-infected subjects than previously documented in healthy volunteers. The eltrombopag exposures observed were between the NOAEL and the level where cataracts were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents. As a result of this unexpected finding, the sponsor decided to suspend further enrolment into this study as of 22 December 2005 while additional PK/pharmacodynamic analyses were undertaken to better understand the exposureresponse relationship and to try to identify if there were any underlying factors (e.g. decreasing liver function) that might explain the high exposure findings.

Subsequent inconclusive PK data generated from the first interim analysis resulted in Protocol Amendment 03 being implemented on 9 March 2006 to conduct a full analysis of Part 1 and Part 2 data from all subjects enrolled as of 22 December 2005 (N=74). This full analysis of all data collected in-house as of 2 June 2006 was planned to determine whether the data from additional subjects would provide sufficient evidence to permanently stop the study for efficacy or safety. Results from this analysis showed a statistically significant treatment effect on platelet response after 28 days of eltrombopag alone (p&lt;0.0001). As a result of reaching the pre-defined statistical stopping criteria for efficacy, the sponsor officially terminated enrolment to this study on 23 June 2006.

The 74 subjects contained in the second and final analysis continued to be followed-up until the all subjects' 6 month post-treatment ocular assessment had been performed. The database for this study was frozen on 30 November 2006. The final results presented are based on the 30 November 2006 database.

## Results

Subjects in the ITT Population had a median age of 51 years and 52 (70%) subjects were male. Most subjects (64 subjects, 86%) were White/Caucasian/European heritage. The four treatment groups were generally balanced with regard to demographic characteristics (see Table 12).

In Part 1, 25 subjects (34%) were withdrawn from the study. Most of the withdrawals were from the placebo group due to lack of efficacy and the fewest were from the 75mg treatment group. At all treatment visits, the highest response rate was observed in the eltrombopag 75mg group (see Table 13).

- b. Percentage is calculated with the number evaluable as a denominator.

In Part 1 (prior to antiviral treatment), subjects with a baseline platelet count of 50 to &lt;70Gi/L had higher response rates compared to subjects with a baseline platelet count of 20Gi/L to &lt;50Gi/L. The number and percentage of responders to treatment in Part 1 in the per protocol and ITT populations using the Observed dataset (adjusting for baseline platelet count strata) was similar to that in the ITT Population using the LOCF dataset.

The mean change in platelet count from baseline was analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline platelet count strata in the ITT Population (Observed Data). The mean change from baseline in platelet count with eltrombopag treatment increased in a dose-dependent manner at the Week 4 Visit (see Figure 3). There was a significant change from baseline in platelet counts compared to placebo at each dose of eltrombopag at the Week 4 Visit; results were -3.5, 119.9, 151.7 and 186.4 Gi/L for placebo, 30, 50 and 75 mg groups, respectively.

Figure 3. Median Platelet Counts in Part 1 Prior to Antiviral Therapy: ITT Population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of subjects who were responders with a platelet count &gt;200Gi/L increased in a dose-dependent manner with eltrombopag treatment; results were 0, 25, 47, and 52% at the week 4 visit for placebo, 30, 50 and 75 mg groups, respectively. Once platelet values exceeded 200Gi/L, subjects were instructed to interrupt treatment until the platelet count dropped below approximately 100Gi/L.

In Part 2, subjects were to receive an additional 8 to 12 weeks of eltrombopag or placebo administered daily during antiviral therapy. The median platelet counts decreased during the antiviral treatment phase compared to the pre-antiviral phase, however they remained above the median baseline platelet counts in each eltrombopag treatment group (see Figure 4).

Results of other endpoints:

- The proportion of subjects with any peginterferon dose reductions decreased with increasing doses of eltrombopag.
- The viral load (average serum HCV RNA) was reduced following initiation of antiviral therapy in a dose-dependent manner.
- The number of subjects with a viral response (&gt;2 log10 reduction from baseline assessment to endpoint assessment or undetectable HCV RNA at endpoint assessment) increased in a dose-dependent manner.

## 2.5.2. Main studies

Two pivotal Phase III studies investigating the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with HCV were conducted. ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2 were both multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, with identical study designs, differing only in the pegylated interferon (peginterferon) used.

## Title of Studies

ENABLE 1 (Eltrombopag to INitiate and Maintain Interferon Antiviral Treatment to Benefit Subjects with Hepatitis C Related Liver DiseasE): Randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic subjects with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are otherwise eligible to initiate antiviral therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin).

ENABLE 2 (Eltrombopag to INitiate and Maintain Interferon Antiviral Treatment to Benefit Subjects with Hepatitis C Related Liver DiseasE): Randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are otherwise eligible to initiate antiviral therapy (peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin).

## Methods

## Study Participants

## Main inclusion criteria

- Male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 years of age with chronic HCV infection who were appropriate candidates for peginterferon and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy
- Platelet count of &lt;75 Gi/L (calculated as the average of the screening and baseline counts. Up to one additional platelet count assessment was allowed between screening and baseline.)
- Haemoglobin concentration ≥ 11.0 g/dL for men or ≥ 10.0 g/dL for women
- Creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/minute
- Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750/mm 3
- Enrolment of subjects with a baseline platelet count of &lt;20 Gi/L, haemoglobin concentration &lt;13.0 g/dL (men) or &lt;12.0 g/dL (women), or ANC &lt;1500/mm 3  required approval from the GSK Medical Monitor to ensure subject suitability for the study (ie, to exclude underlying medical conditions, other than the disease being studied, and in consideration of the safety of the subject with regard to the possibility of randomising to placebo during Part 2).

## Main exclusion criteria

- Prior treatment with interferon within the 30 days of the screening visit
- Non-responders to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin who failed to achieve a SVR for reasons other than thrombocytopenia, despite an optimal course of combination therapy
- Subjects with a known hypersensitivity, intolerance or allergy to peginterferon, ribavirin, eltrombopag or any of their ingredients
- Decompensated liver disease, e.g. Child-Turcotte-Pugh score &gt;6 or history of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy or current evidence of ascites
- Evidence of portal vein thrombosis on abdominal imaging within 3 months of baseline visit
- History of arterial or venous thrombosis, and ≥ 2 of the following risk factors (except in Canada)
- hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g. Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, etc.); hormone replacement therapy; systemic contraception therapy (containing oestrogen); smoking; diabetes; hypercholesterolaemia; medication for hypertension or cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Any disease condition associated with active bleeding or requiring anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin
- Subjects with a history of platelet clumping that would prevent reliable measurement of platelet counts

## Treatments

Treatment consisted of an open-label (OL), Pre-Antiviral Treatment Phase (Part 1) and a randomised, double-blind (DB), placebo controlled, Antiviral Treatment Phase (Part 2) (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Study Schematic of Pivotal Studies ENABLE 1 and ENABLE 2

<!-- image -->

- Part 1 Pre-Antiviral Treatment Phase (OL Phase): All subjects received OL eltrombopag dosed once daily with the objective of increasing platelet counts to ≥ 90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or ≥ 100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2). Subjects started with a dose of eltrombopag (25 mg once daily) for 2 weeks. If after this time the platelet count was &lt;90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or &lt;100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2), subjects underwent a sequential dose escalation to the next highest dose (50 mg once daily for up to 2 weeks), with further dose escalations to 75 mg once daily (up to 2 weeks) and 100 mg once daily (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) to achieve a platelet count ≥ 90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or ≥ 100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2). Once subjects achieved platelet counts ≥ 90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or ≥ 100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2), they were eligible to enter the randomised part of the study (Part 2) and initiate antiviral therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a (ENABLE 1) or alfa-2b (ENABLE 2) plus ribavirin). Subjects with platelet counts &lt;90 Gi/L (ENABLE 1) or &lt;100 Gi/L (ENABLE 2) after the 9 week Pre-Antiviral Treatment Phase were discontinued from eltrombopag and switched to post-treatment follow-up visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Part 2 DB Antiviral Treatment Phase (DB Phase): The overall aim of Part 2 was to avoid dose reductions of antiviral therapy due to thrombocytopenia by optimising the dose of eltrombopag/matched placebo. Subjects were randomised 2:1 to either continue on the same dose of eltrombopag from Part 1 or received a matched placebo. Both treatments were given in combination with antiviral therapy for up to 48 weeks. In combination with ribavirin, the recommended dose of peginterferon alfa-2a is 180 μg per week, and that for peginterferon alfa-2b is 1.5 μg/kg per week; for genotype 2/3, 24 weeks treatment was to be given, for genotype non-2/3, 48 weeks of antiviral therapy. Subjects eligible to enter Part 2 of the study were instructed by study personnel on how to self administer the first dose of peginterferon at the Antiviral Treatment Phase baseline visit. Administration was by subcutaneous injection. Dose modifications of eltrombopag/matched placebo were permitted to maintain platelet counts at a level that enabled continuation of antiviral therapy, ideally at full dose, by allowing increases in the eltrombopag/matched placebo dose up to 100 mg once daily. Any dose modifications of peginterferon alfa-2a/alfa-2b or ribavirin were performed as directed within the product labels.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag treatment on sustained virologic response (SVR) in thrombocytopenic subjects (platelets &lt;75 Gi/L) with HCV infection.

The secondary objectives were

- to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable initiation of antiviral therapy in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection
- to evaluate the effect of eltrombopag on platelet counts in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection, before and during antiviral therapy
- to evaluate the effects of eltrombopag treatment on antiviral treatment outcome measures (rapid virologic response [RVR], early virologic response [EVR] and end of treatment response [ETR]) in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection
- to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable maintenance of antiviral therapy in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection
- to evaluate the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered once daily in thrombocytopenic subjects with HCV infection
- to evaluate the impact of eltrombopag on subject reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ)-HCV and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 version 2 acute recall (SF-36v2)
- to describe the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag and explore the relationship between the PK of eltrombopag and relevant safety and efficacy endpoints
- to describe the PK of peginterferon alfa-2a/b during concomitant dosing with eltrombopag.

Data published after the initiation of the ENABLE studies reported that genetic variants, rs12979860 and rs8099917, which map near IL28B are associated with IFN-induced SVR in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Therefore, a genetic analysis was conducted to evaluate if there

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were any differences in the distribution of IL28B favourable response genotypes between subjects receiving placebo versus subjects receiving eltrombopag and to evaluate the association of the published IL28B favourable response genotypes with virologic response.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

SVR rate defined as percentage of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment and all subsequent planned visits up to 24 weeks after completing treatment (generally Weeks 48 or 72 for genotype 2/3, or Week 72 for genotype non-2/3). If a subject had a positive HCV RNA ('blip') between two visits with undetectable HCV RNA, then the subject was considered a sustained virological responder provided that the detectable HCV RNA was of the same order of magnitude as the limit of detection.

## Secondary endpoints

- Initiation of antiviral therapy: platelet shift from baseline count to ≥ 90/100 Gi/L with OL eltrombopag; proportion of subjects initiating antiviral therapy; time to initiation of antiviral therapy
- Antiviral therapy dose reductions: proportions of subjects requiring dose reductions and/or dose cessation of peginterferon and/or ribavirin therapy; time to the first antiviral therapy dose reduction
- Adherence to Antiviral Therapy: proportion of subjects showing adherence (defined as receiving at least 80% of the prescribed dose of peginterferon and of ribavirin, for at least 80% of the planned duration)
- Platelet counts with antiviral therapy: assessment of platelet counts throughout the study
- Other Antiviral Endpoints: proportions of subjects achieving the following antiviral outcome measures
- undetectable HCV RNA after 12 weeks of antiviral treatment (cEVR)
- clinically significant reduction in HCV RNA ( ≥ 2 log10 drop or undetectable) after 12 weeks of antiviral treatment (EVR)
- undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks of antiviral treatment (RVR)
- undetectable HCV RNA at the end of antiviral treatment (ETR).
- Pharmacogenetic investigation: to determine that the IL28B genotype frequencies do not differ between the study treatment populations and if IL28B variants (rs12979860 and rs8099917) affect PEG-IFN alfa/RBV-induced virological response (SVR and RVR) in subjects treated with eltrombopag to enable the use of PEGIFN/RBV for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

Platelet count eligibility (&lt;75 Gi/L), confirmed at the baseline visit (Day 1) prior to administration of eltrombopag, was defined as the average of the screening and baseline counts. Up to 1 additional platelet count assessment was allowed between screening and baseline and in those cases the average of the 3 counts had to be &lt;75 Gi/L for the subject to be eligible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For subjects who prematurely withdrew, HCV RNA Viral Load was assessed at the 24 week follow up visit. The Hepatitis C Viral RNA quantitative transcription-mediated amplification was used to quantitate the level of HCV RNA in serum or plasma (down to the level of 5 IU/mL).

## Sample size

Determination of the sample size was based on the following assumptions: the proportion with SVR with placebo will be 10%; the study would have 92.5% power to detect a statistically significant treatment effect of 10% at two-sided alpha=5%; there would be three interim analyses and one final analysis; Haybittle-Peto criteria would be used to protect against increasing the type I error rate with repeated interim analyses; treatments would be allocated on a 2:1 ratio of eltrombopag to placebo.

A total of 675 subjects (450 on eltrombopag and 225 on placebo) were required to be randomised. It was estimated that approximately 10% of subjects would not complete the preantiviral treatment phase. Therefore, 750 subjects would be enrolled in order to randomise 675 subjects.

## Randomisation

All subjects received OL eltrombopag during Part 1 of the study. Prior to initiating antiviral therapy in Part 2, eligible subjects were randomised to either continue the eltrombopag dose from Part 1, or, matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio of eltrombopag: placebo in accordance with the randomisation schedule. Study centres registered and randomised subjects by telephone using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). The IVRS was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The OL eltrombopag and the DB eltrombopag/placebo supplies were managed through the IVRS.

Randomised treatment was given to the investigator or his/her designee through a mechanism which maintained the blind. Once allocated, a randomisation number was not reassigned to another subject.

## Blinding (masking)

During Part 1 of the study, eltrombopag treatment was open label. During Part 2, eltrombopag/matched placebo treatment (but not dose) was blinded to the research subjects and all study and sponsor personnel. Treatment blind was maintained by the use of matching eltrombopag placebo tablets. The antiviral therapy was open label. Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment was essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject, was the investigator or treating physician permitted to unblind a subject's treatment assignment via IVRS (preferably after discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel). Where the blind was broken for any reason, the investigator was required to notify the MAH immediately of the unblinding incident without revealing the subject's study treatment assignment, unless considered relevant to the safety of subjects in the study.

GSK's Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance staff could unblind the treatment assignment for any subject with a serious adverse event (SAE). If the SAE required that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the subject's treatment assignment, was sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy.

## Statistical methods

The ENABLE studies were monitored by an Independent Drug Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Three formal interim analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were planned: after 25%, 50%, and 75% of the subjects in each study had completed all their follow-up visits. The p-values and confidence intervals (CI) reported for the primary analyses were adjusted for the interim analyses.

Except where otherwise noted, the statistical model on which inference was based included terms for the strata: HCV genotype (genotype 2/3, non-genotype 2/3), baseline platelet count (&lt;50 Gi/L and ≥ 50 Gi/L), baseline HCV RNA (&lt;800,000 IU/mL and ≥ 800,000 IU/mL). The primary endpoint was analysed separately for subgroups of geographic region, and various demographic and baseline disease characteristics.

## Analysis populations

- Enrolled Population: subjects who had passed screening and entered the study.
- Safety population: subjects who had received OL study drug. The Safety population is a subset of the Enrolled population. The Safety population was used for the following objectives:
- o to evaluate the ability of eltrombopag to enable initiation of antiviral therapy;
- o to evaluate the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag.
- ITT population: all randomised subjects. Subjects were analysed according to the stratum and treatment they were assigned at randomisation, regardless of whether it was assigned correctly. The ITT population was a subset of the Safety Population and was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy during the DB Phase.
- Safety Double-Blind (DB) population: all randomised subjects who received DB study drug. Subjects were analysed as treated, i.e. according to the treatment received. The Safety DB population was a subset of the ITT population. The Safety DB population was used to compare the safety of eltrombopag (plus antiviral therapy) with placebo (plus antiviral therapy).
- Per-Protocol (PP) population: all randomised subjects who did not violate any important inclusion and exclusion criteria that pertained to the assessment of treatment efficacy, and who incurred no protocol deviations that pertained to the assessment of treatment efficacy. The PP population, identified prior to unblinding of the study, was used to analyse the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint.

## Missing data

For the primary analysis, if a subject had a missing value between visits, then the previous nonmissing HCV RNA assessment and associated classification was carried forward to fill in the missing value. If a subject's HCV RNA at 24 week follow-up assessment was missing for any reason, the subject was considered a non-responder. A subject with missing data due to premature discontinuation of treatment, or from the study for any reason was considered a nonresponder for all subsequent visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary efficacy analysis

The proportion of subjects with SVR was summarised by treatment group, and were compared between eltrombopag and placebo using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test statistics adjusting for HCV RNA genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of treatment effect was used to evaluate the relevant interactions. The model-adjusted absolute difference in proportions and associated 95% CI were estimated. The estimate was derived using general linear modelling with the SAS GENMOD procedure. The dependent variable was SVR (yes/no) and the independent variables were actual stratification factors as well as treatment. The binomial distribution with identity link function was specified.

## Secondary efficacy analyses

- Initiation of antiviral therapy: Platelet counts with OL eltrombopag were summarised using descriptive statistics for different levels of platelet cut off points. The proportion of subjects initiating antiviral therapy as well as the time to initiation of antiviral therapy was summarised. Endpoints related to initiation of antiviral therapy were analysed for the Safety Population.
- Antiviral therapy dose reductions: Subjects were assigned a score equal to the number of times their dose of antiviral therapy, either peginterferon or ribavirin was reduced. The proportions of subjects in each category were summarised by treatment group. The treatment groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Time to the first antiviral therapy dose reduction (peginterferon) was analysed using the stratified log-rank test adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Kaplan-Meier plot of time to first peginterferon dose reduction was produced.
- Adherence to Antiviral Therapy: Adherence has been defined as receiving at least 80% of the prescribed dose of peginterferon and at least 80% of the prescribed dose of ribavirin, for at least 80% of the planned duration (38 weeks for subjects with 48 weeks of planned treatment and at least 19 weeks for subjects with 24 weeks of planned treatment). The proportion of subjects showing adherence was analysed using stratified CMH chi-square test statistics adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Descriptive statistics for the association of adherence to antiviral therapy with SVR was computed. The strength of association was assessed using the chi-square tests for association.
- Permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy: The proportion of subjects who discontinued from antiviral therapy (peginterferon) for any reason was analysed using stratified CMH chi-square test statistics adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum (randomisation strata). Time to permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy was analysed using stratified log-rank test adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum. KaplanMeier plot of time to permanent discontinuation of peginterferon was produced. Reasons for permanent discontinuation were summarized by randomised treatment group.
- Platelet counts with antiviral therapy: Descriptive statistics were provided for platelet counts over time, change from baseline over time (i.e., at each scheduled visit), and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- changes from antiviral baseline over time. Durability or duration of platelet response (count achieved to allow initiation of antiviral treatment) was defined as the time in weeks from antiviral baseline to the first time platelets became &lt;50 Gi/L.
- Platelet counts with antiviral therapy after stopping DB study drug: Analysis of platelet counts after stopping double blind study drug were summarised using descriptive statistics or frequency counts as appropriate.

Other Antiviral Endpoints: The other antiviral endpoints were rapid virologic response (RVR), extended rapid virologic response (eRVR), early virologic response (EVR), end of treatment response (ETR), and virologic response at end of treatment as well as 12 week follow-up assessment. These were analysed for the ITT population using stratified CMH chi-square test statistics, adjusting for HCV genotype, baseline platelet count stratum, and baseline HCV RNA stratum wherever applicable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

ENABLE 1 ran from 30 Oct 2007- 31-Mar 2011, and ENABLE 2 from 30 October 2007 - 23 August 2011.

## Conduct of the study

The ENABLE protocols were amended 3 times.

- 24-Aug-2007 Amendment 01: Addition of enhanced renal safety monitoring. Revised Liver Chemistry stopping criteria. Modification of eligibility criteria. Addition of secondary endpoint Reclassification of exploratory endpoint to secondary endpoint. Minor changes to add clarity to protocol wording.
- 20-Nov-2007 Amendment 02: A Companion Protocol was written to encompass the pharmacogenetic research for Study TPL103922 in accordance with Brazilian Regulations. This amendment was required by Brazilian law and requested by the Comissao Nacional de Etica em Pesquisa (CONEP; National Comission for Ethics in Research). The Companion Protocol will apply only in Brazil to comply with Brazilian regulations and laws regarding genetic research (Rule 347, 2005).
- 19-Dec-2007 Amendment 03: A country specific Amendment to Exclusion Criteria No. 9. This amendment was requested by Health Canada to exclude subjects with any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis, irrespective of associated risk factors.

## Protocol deviations

In ENABLE 1, 6% of subjects were excluded from the PP Population; the exclusions were mainly due to evidence of decompensated liver disease (defined as a CP score &gt;6) at baseline and this was similar between treatment groups (see Table 14).

In ENABLE 2, 5% of subjects were excluded from the PP Population; again the exclusions were mainly due to evidence of decompensated liver disease at baseline and this was similar between treatment groups (see Table 15).

HCV FibroSURE is a noninvasive blood test that combines the quanitative results of 6 serum biochemical markers (α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and ALT), with a subject's age and gender to generate a measure of fibrosis/cirrhosis and necroinflammatory activity in the liver. It provides a numerical quantitative estimate of liver fibrosis ranging from 0.00 to 1.00 corresponding the the Metavir scoring system of stages F0 to F4 (F0=no fibrosis, F1=portal fibrosis, F2=bridging fibrosis with few septa, F3=bridging fibrosis with many septa, F4=cirrhosis). A high proportion of subjects had FibroSURE score equivalent to Metavir F3 or F4, indicative of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Subjects were stratified at baseline by platelet count, HCV RNA and genotype (see Table 17). The proportion of subjects in each stratum was evenly distributed across the treatment groups.

Patients who have been previously treated with interferon are associated with poorer antiviral response. A similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups had received prior HCV medications and the majority of these had received combination antiviral therapy (i.e. IFN+Ribavirin) (see Table 18).

- a. Adjusted for other actual strata
- b. P-value is a test of the null hypothesis of homogeneity (i.e., no treatment-by-subgroup interaction)

Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint using the PP population, and assessing the impact of using all assessments, of late treatment discontinuations and missing for other reasons, of LOCF, of using 24 week follow-up visit only, of using actual visits, of not using LOCF, and of using 12 week follow-up visit or later as LOCF for 24 week follow-up visit. Only the analysis using HCV RNA assessments at the actual end of treatment visit, 12 Week follow-up visit and 24 Week follow-up visit, regardless of the duration of treatment or the actual time relative to randomisation in ENABLE 2 showed a non-significant treatment difference in SVR rate (of 5%) between eltrombopag and placebo.

a. Differing requirements due to use of peginterferon alfa-2a in ENABLE 1 and peginterferon alfa-2b in ENABLE 2

b. Exact 95% Cl based on binomial distribution

The majority of subjects achieved a platelet count &gt;90/100 Gi/L within 4 weeks; the mean number of weeks required was 2.4 in ENABLE 1 and 2.8 in ENABLE 2.

A total of 2% of subjects in each study achieved the required platelet counts to initiate antiviral therapy but did not randomize to Part 2 (DB). There was no pattern in the reasons for this failure to initiate therapy within or across the studies.

The commonest reasons for premature discontinuation of antiviral therapy were adverse events (27% placebo, 19% eltrombopag; the difference being mainly due to an increase in events of thrombocytopenia in placebo-treated subjects), and lack of antiviral efficacy.

In both studies, the results at the early antiviral milestones of RVR and eRVR were similar between the eltrombopag and placebo treatment groups and did not show any statistically significant difference in response.

## · Pharmacogenetic investigation

A total of 906/1441 subjects, who were White and Asian subjects identified as non- Hispanic or Latino, were included in the combined PGx analysis population. No difference was detected in carriage frequencies for IL28B response genotypes between subjects randomized to the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups in the DB portions of these studies (see Table 34).

b. Denotes/28b favorableresponse genotype

A higher proportion of subjects achieved SVR in the eltrombopag treatment group than in the placebo treatment group. This result occurred for subjects carrying all IL28B genotypes. However, subjects who carried the IL28B favourable response genotype were more likely to achieve virologic responses than were subjects who did not carry the favourable IL28B genotype in both the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups. This trend was observed in subjects infected with any HCV genotype (see Table 35).

Subjects homozygous for the favourable response allele, 'C', of the IL28B polymorphism rs12979860 (i.e., subjects that carry 2 copies of the 'C' allele, 'CC') are more likely to achieve SVR compared to patients who carried one or no copy of this allele. Although both IL28B variants showed strong evidence for statistical association with virologic response, evaluating the effect of each marker conditioned upon the effect of the other indicated that rs12979860 represents the primary association with treatment response and the association with rs8099917 is secondary.

Analysis by viral genotype was performed in the Combined and in the White PGx Analysis subpopulations. Subjects infected with either HCV non 2/3 or 2/3 genotypes who carried the IL28B favourable response genotype were more likely to achieve virologic responses than were subjects who did not carry the favourable IL28B genotype. The strength of association between the IL28B response genotype was strongest in patients with baseline HCV non-2/3 genotypes (predominantly genotype 1; viral genotypes known to be less responsive to IFN/RBV treatment) compared with patients with either genotypes 2 or 3 (viral genotypes typically more responsive to IFN/RBV treatment).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The Applicant conducted an integrated analysis of pooled data from the pivotal studies. The studies were similar in design, the main difference being the type of peginterferon used, and the lower platelet threshold for dose adjustments. The results of the integrated analysis reflect the findings of the individual studies.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Thrombocytopenia associated to the HCV infection is a limiting factor for the access to a potentially curative therapy. The reason is that thrombocytopenia is a common AE of the currently available regimens and treatment related thrombocytopenia is one of the critical factors that may compromise the completion of an optimal HCV treatment regimen, which is a prerequisite for achieving a successful outcome. Therefore, any therapy able to allow patients to initiate and complete an optimal antiviral treatment are expected to increase the rates of sustained viral responses (SVR), which is a surrogate marker of the ultimate goal of treatment, i.e. to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to the chronic C hepatitis infection.

Results from the dose finding study TPL102357 support a 25 mg starting dose of eltrombopag. In this study 75% of HCV-infected subjects receiving the lowest dose of eltrombopag (30 mg) achieved platelet counts &gt;100 Gi/L after the initial 4-week pre-antiviral dosing period. Study TPL102357 used eltrombopag doses of 30, 50 and 75mg.

Platelet counts generally began to increase within 1 week of starting eltrombopag. The aim of treatment with eltrombopag should be to achieve the minimum level of platelet counts needed to initiate antiviral therapy, in adherence to clinical practice recommendations. During antiviral therapy, the aim of treatment should be to keep platelet counts at a level which prevents the risk of bleeding or the need for interferon dose reductions (50,000/µl). Platelet counts &gt; 100,000/µl should be avoided. The lowest dose of eltrombopag needed to achieve the targets should be used. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response.

Based on the data provided by the MAH the following posology was agreed and reflected in the SmPC:

Initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily. No dosage adjustment is necessary for HCV patients of East Asian ancestry or patients with mild hepatic impairment.

Adjust the dose of eltrombopag in 25 mg increments every 2 weeks as necessary to achieve the target platelet count required to initiate anti-viral therapy. Monitor platelet counts every week prior to starting antiviral therapy. On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose reductions should be avoided.

During antiviral therapy, adjust the dose of eltrombopag as necessary to avoid dose reductions of peginterferon due to decreasing platelet counts that may put patients at risk of bleeding (see Table 2). Monitor platelet counts weekly during antiviral therapy until a stable platelet count is achieved, normally around 50,000-75,000/µl. CBCs including platelet counts and peripheral blood smears should be obtained monthly thereafter. Dose reductions on the daily dose by 25 mg should be considered if platelet counts exceed the required target. Wait 2 weeks to assess the effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments.

Do not exceed a dose of 100 mg eltrombopag once daily.

Dose adjustments of eltrombopag in HCV patients during antiviral therapy:

| > 100,000/µl to ≤ 150,000/µl                      | Decrease the daily dose by 25 mg. Wait 2 weeks to assess the effects of this and any subsequent dose adjustments ♦ .                                                            |
| > 150,000/µl                                      | Stop eltrombopag; increase the frequency of platelet monitoring to twice weekly. Once the platelet count is ≤ 100,000/µl, reinitiate therapy at a daily dose reduced by 25 mg*. |

* - For patients taking 25 mg eltrombopag once daily, consideration should be given to reinitiating dosing at 25 mg every other day.

♦ -On initiation of antiviral therapy the platelet count may fall, so immediate eltrombopag dose reductions should be avoided.

If after 2 weeks of eltrombopag therapy at 100 mg the required platelet level to initiate antiviral therapy is not achieved, eltrombopag should be discontinued.

Eltrombopag treatment should be terminated when antiviral therapy is discontinued unless otherwise justified. Excessive platelet count responses or important liver test abnormalities also necessitate discontinuation.

Two pivotal Phase III studies were submitted to support the efficacy of eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic, compensated HCV and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. ENABLE 1 and 2 used a different peginterferon, but otherwise had a similar design. The design of the studies was appropriate, with an open-label, dose titration phase to establish efficacy in initiation of antiviral therapy, followed by a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled antiviral phase (peginterferon alfa-2a/b plus ribavirin). The duration of the doubleblind phase was dependent on the HCV genotype. The primary endpoint was the proportion achieving sustained virologic response (percentage of subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment and all subsequent planned visits up to 24 weeks after completing treatment). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects initiating antiviral therapy, requiring an antiviral dose reduction, adhering to antiviral therapy, and the platelet count during antiviral therapy.

Regarding the primary endpoint, treatment with eltrombopag produced a statistically significant absolute increase in the SVR rate of 8% in ENABLE 1 and 6% in ENABLE 2 over placebo. The other secondary endpoints were generally supportive of the efficacy of eltrombopag. In the double-blind treatment phase the rate of antiviral dose reductions in those on eltrombopag was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

40% that of placebo-treated subjects. Correspondingly, the average time to requirement for a dose reduction was slightly prolonged in those on eltrombopag, and fewer patients required premature discontinuation of antiviral therapy. Adherence to antiviral therapy was higher in SVR.

incorporated into the ENABLE studies. In addition, they are only licensed for subjects with HCV genotype 1, and were not investigated in those with platelet counts of less than 90 Gi/L. The protease inhibitors also exacerbate the thrombocytopenic effects of interferon-based therapy, suggesting that their use would be limited in patients with significant thrombocytopenia at baseline. To date only preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to investigate the potential for interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors boceprevir and direct acting antiviral agents. Full results are not yet available and are awaited but preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. However these results are unable to rule out potential safety concerns when combining these treatments. Therefore, at this stage the use of eltrombopag in patients receiving triple therapy including Additional efficacy and safety data in these patients will be investigated by the MAH postauthorisation as reflected in the PhV plan of the RMP which includes 3 Post-Authorisation Safety Studies (PASS) (category 3, required additional pharmacovigilance activity).

eltrombopag-treated subjects, and was shown to be related to a higher probability of achieving For all the important subgroups evaluated, the ENABLE studies demonstrated that eltrombopag use in combination with interferon-based HCV antiviral therapy results in an improvement in SVR compared to interferon-based therapy alone (see SmPC section 5.1). Protease inhibitors were not licensed in the EU until late 2011, and could not therefore have been telaprevir have been presented to support its use in association with HCV triple therapy including protease cannot be recommended and this has been clearly reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

## Additional expert consultation

The Scientific Advisory Group on HIV/Viral Diseases (SAG-HIV/Viral Diseases) was convened on 2 July 2013 to discuss the benefits of afatinib from a clinical perspective.

The SAG-HIV/Viral Diseases provided advice on the following questions raised by the CHMP:

1. Is there a place in therapeutics for eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with advanced HCV-liver disease otherwise candidates to antiviral therapy to allow initiation and maintenance of a full IFN-based regimen?
2. In the light of the safety findings, do you consider that a positive benefit/risk balance could be concluded for the whole studied population, in particular in those patients with the poorest prognostic i.e. thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as defined by low albumin levels (&lt;35g/L) or MELD score ≥ 10.
3. Subject to a positive answer to the previous one, could you discuss on the conditions for use under which a positive benefit/risk balance could be concluded.

The SAG addressed the points raised by the CHMP in the joint response below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The SAG agreed by consensus that there is public health need and a place for eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with advanced HCV-liver disease, although very restricted. Indeed, a small number of patients where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main reason for which an interferon (IFN)-based regimen is not feasible, could benefit from eltrombopag as its efficacy in treating thrombocytopenia would allow initiation and maintenance of a full interferon (IFN)-based regimen. Currently there aren't any treatment options available for this very advanced patient population since antiviral regimen cannot be initiated due to thrombocytopenia.

Indeed, while the SAG recognised that the use of eltrombopag was accompanied by a worrisome safety profile and that the rapid progress of HCV therapies might allow for IFN free regimens in the near future, the experts supported the use of this compound in a very limited population in which with the current practice an IFN-based regimen is not possible. The SAG defined this population as patients with advanced HCV-liver disease, in need of IFN-based therapy, and for whom the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor that limits the initiation or the ability to maintain the IFN-based treatment.

The experts acknowledged that in patients with the poorest prognostic i.e. thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease, as defined by low albumin levels (&lt;35g/L) or MELD score ≥ 10, the benefits were less pronounced and the risks more significant. Nevertheless they considered the risk/benefit balance positive.  However, they stressed the fact that adequate information should be provided to the prescribers to warn them of the increased risks and/or decreased efficacy which has been observed during the eltrombopag trials. In this regard the increased risk in portal vein thrombosis in these patients should be highlighted.

Moreover, due to the complexity in the treatment of such advanced patient population, the SAG was of the opinion that eltrombopag should be prescribed only by very experienced physicians in the treatment of HCV.

Finally, the SAG recommended the conduct of further studies on the use of eltrombopag, in particular the group agreed that there was a need to understand the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag as part of a triple therapy (IFN + ribavirin + direct-acting anti-viral agent). In addition, the long term benefits of achieving SVR, although described in the current literature, haven't been demonstrated in the data provided and should be confirmed post-authorisation.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In summary, the results of the ENABLE studies provide evidence for the efficacy of eltrombopag in allowing initiation of antiviral therapy in thrombocytopenic HCV patients with compensated advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and demonstrate a modest benefit for the outcome of sustained viral response rate due to antiviral therapy. The patient group studied represents a cohort of HCV sufferers with severe disease and no treatment options since antiviral regimen cannot be initiated due to thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the treatment effect, though modest, represents an appreciable benefit.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The safety of eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based antiviral therapy is supported by data from the 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies (ENABLE 1 and 2), and supportive data from the randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase II study TPL102357.

The MAH presented upon CHMP request during the D120 List of question revised tables for adverse events identified during the double blind phase, including on treatment plus 6 months follow-up period (data not shown). The results of the new analyses supported the conclusion of the on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up analyses previously presented.

In addition, a summary of adverse drug reactions observed for eltrombopag during treatment where causality was based on comparative incidence in clinical trials, 1 % higher incidence in the eltrombopag arm compared to placebo arm, is shown in Table 42.

## Deaths

In the open label phase there were 2 deaths.

- One subject experienced an SAE of hepatorenal syndrome on study Day 46, and died the same day. This subject had current medical history of cirrhosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia. The subject was interferon naive. Baseline platelet count was 20 Gi/L and baseline MELD score was 15. The subject received open-label eltrombopag 25 mg daily for 2 weeks. Eltrombopag was increased to 50 mg/day on Day 15 (platelet count 39 Gi/L), to 75 mg daily on Day 29 (platelet count, 35 Gi/L), and to 100 mg daily on Day 36 (platelet count, 36 Gi/L). On Day 46, the subject was hospitalized with general deterioration, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Laboratory tests showed elevated bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum creatinine, INR, and sodium. The event was not considered related to eltrombopag.
- One subject had a fatal hepatic neoplasm malignant and died more than one year after they had completed study treatment. The subject received open-label eltrombopag 25 mg daily for 15 days. The eltrombopag dose was increased to 50 mg/day on Day 16 (platelets 29 Gi/L), 75 mg/day on Day 31 (platelets 46 Gi/L), and 100 mg/day on Day 42 (platelets 42 Gi/L). The subject was withdrawn from open-label study treatment on Day 65 due to insufficient platelet response, and died on Day 626 (18 months post-therapy) due to HCC.

In the two Phase III studies, 39 subjects (3%) with 57 fatal AEs died during the ontreatment plus 6 months follow-up period: 29 (3%) in the eltrombopag group and 10 (2%) in the placebo group (see Table 44). Of these deaths, those that occurred within 30 days of treatment cessation numbered 19 in the eltrombopag group, and 4 in the placebo group.

Most of the subjects who died had baseline MELD scores ≥10 (22/29 subjects [76%] in the eltrombopag group and 8/10 subjects [80%] in the placebo group). Eleven deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to one of the investigational products (ie, either eltrombopag/placebo, or peginterferon/ribavirin), and all of these occurred in eltrombopagtreated patients. Five of these deaths were attributed to antiviral therapy, five to all of the investigational products, and one to eltrombopag.

This death  was classified as 'sudden death'. The subject had a baseline MELD score of 10, HCV RNA &gt;2 million IU/mL, and platelet count of 52 Gi/L. Concurrent medical conditions included hepatitis B, cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, and portal hypertension with oesophageal varices. The subject was found dead on Day 104 while on study treatment. In total, the patient received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

eltrombopag 25-50 mg/day for more than 79 days, and peginterferon 150 μg/week and ribavirin 1200 mg/day for more than 57 days. The cause of death was unknown, though a diagnosis of lobar pneumonia was made on autopsy.

## Adverse events of special interest

Based on non-clinical findings and clinical signals with eltrombopag and the mechanism of action of the drug, several categories of AEs of special interest were analysed further: thromboembolic, hepatobiliary, renal-related, malignancies, thrombocytopenia, bleeding and ocular.

## Thromboembolic Events

Thromboembolic events reported during the study were identified using the 'Embolic and Thrombotic Events' and 'Myocardial Infarction' standard MedDRA query and preferred terms. No thromboembolic event occurred during the OL Phase of either of the Phase III studies. During the on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up period, 36 subjects experienced 39 confirmed or suspected events. There were 34 events in 31 eltrombopag subjects (3%) and 5 events in 5 placebo subjects (1%). Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was the most common event in both the eltrombopag treated group (1%) and the placebo group (&lt;1%). Table 45 summarises the thromboembolic events observed during eltrombopag treatment.

Table 45. Summary of Thromboembolic Events During On-Treatment Plus 30 Days PostTreatment (Safety DB Population)

Subject 4081/TPL108390 thromboembolic event was reported by the investigator as \"minimal old thrombosis\" which was captured under preferred term *thrombosis\". GSK Medical Monitor considered this event of the portal venous system and is included in the subsequent section *Portal Venous System Events\".

The subjects in the placebo group had a median platelet count of 44 Gi/L at the time of the event. In the eltrombopag group, the median platelet count was 108 Gi/L at the time of the event; no subject with a thromboembolic event had platelets above 200 Gi/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A further 11 thromboembolic events occurred &gt;30 days post-treatment (10 in eltrombopag subjects). Seven events involved the portal venous system, including 2 subjects who had previously experienced an event of the portal venous system on treatment.

Upon CHMP request during the D120 List of Questions the MAH performed an additional assessment on the risk of TEE in ENABLE studies (separated and pooled). All cases were counted, avoiding the use of arbitrary limits (e.g. on-treatment plus 30 days). Cases of thromboembolic events were provided separately by trial, dose, duration, platelet counts, and risk factors. In addition, a comprehensive cumulative review of all cases of thromboembolisms including an analysis of time to onset, age, sex, dose, platelet counts, disease condition and severity (e.g HCV genotype, Child-Pugh classification, presence and/or stage of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis), prior antiviral medications, concomitant medications and outcome was also provided.

Results of these analyses showed a total of 50 TEE cases in 44 subjects, 38 (4%) eltrombopag patients vs 6 (1.2%) placebo treated patients. The time adjusted incidence was 3.9/100 PY in eltrombopag vs 1.38/100 PY in placebo (pool data), with around 30% and 50% being SAE in eltrombopag and placebo, respectively. Approximately half of subjects had a portal VT (20/44), while 13/44 VE and 10/44 arterial thrombosis. Recovery was only accounted in 66% of cases. The data indicated that eltrombopag was associated with an increased risk for TEE in this particularly advanced liver disease population. In this regard, age ≥60 years and albumin &lt;35g/L were significant risk factors for TEE in the ENABLE studies (see Table 46). The frequency of TEE was also higher in subjects with higher MELD scores (≥10), but one third of cases occurred in patients with MELD score &lt;10. No specific temporal relationship between start of treatment and TEE was observed. No discernible pattern was observed involving gender or dose of eltrombopag.

The majority of TEEs resolved and did not interfere with antiviral treatment (66%) but in 1/3 of cases not complete recovery could be reached (with 2 fatal cases, one in each treatment group).

With the exception of bilirubin abnormalities (largely due to increases in indirect bilirubin, which is generally considered benign) the distribution of all other combinations of laboratory abnormalities and the pattern of liver chemistry abnormalities were similar in the treatment groups, despite the longer observation period and the higher doses of antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin (see Table 48).

To evaluate hepatotoxic potential, the MAH presented a series of eDISH (evaluation of DrugInduced Serious Hepatotoxicity) plots showing the peak total bilirubin/ULN (upper limit of normal) against the peak ALT/ULN on-treatment during the DB Phase for both ENABLE studies (data not shown). This is based on the notion that a concomitant elevation in serum ALT and total bilirubin (Hy's Law) is the most specific biomarker for potentially serious Drug-Induced Liver Injury.

When ALT and bilirubin values were normalized for baseline, there were 17 subjects (11 eltrombopag and 6 placebo) with substantial elevations in both ALT and bilirubin during the study. When subjects were analysed relative to their own baselines, 11 eltrombopag subjects and 6 placebo subjects were located in the right-hand quadrants, associated with liver injury. In this setting, definition of Hy's Law cases is complicated by the fact that other causes for the increase in ALT and bilirubin exist, namely HCV infection and concomitant use of ribavirin and peginterferon.

In addition the MAH provided upon CHMP request a review of all cases of liver injury including an analysis of time to onset, age, sex, dose, outcome, among others (data not shown). Events of liver injury (ALT or AST &gt;3xULN) and severe liver injury (ALT or AST &gt;3xULN and total Bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN with fractionated bilirubin ≥35%) were reported at a similar frequency in eltrombopag and placebo-treated patients. The age and gender distribution of those with liver injury was similar in the two treatment groups. A greater number of placebo-treated subjects with severe and non-severe liver injury discontinued treatment than those on eltrombopag with liver injury.

Moreover a detailed presentation of the changes in hepatobiliary parameters during the DB phases of ENABLE 1 and 2 studies (on treatment plus 6 months follow-up) was provided. These data show that transaminases increments are similar between the treatment groups  with ALT or AST &gt;3x ULN in 46% placebo vs 44% in eltrombopag.

Potentially serious DILI (defined as increments in transaminases plus fractionated bilirrubin &gt;35%) were more common on placebo compared to eltrombopag, suggesting that eltrombopag doesn't cause hepatotoxicity in this patient population. However, hiperbilirrubinemia, associated with increments in transaminases, is a common AEs associated with the use of eltrombopog in this HCV population. 4(0.8%) cases of jaundice in placebo and 34(4%) in eltrombopag have been reported, of those experimented ALT or AST&gt;3xULN 2 case in placebo and 16 in eltrombopag. Overall 2/484 (0.1%) in placebo and 16/955(1.6%) in eltrombopag had jaundice and transaminases increments. Changes in bilirubin (&gt;2ULN) occurred in 55% of patients in eltrombopag vs 26% in placebo. In the majority of jaundice reported cases (23/38, 68%) patients recovered without sequelae.

## Hepatic decompensation

AEs suggestive of hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, HCC, death) were collected to identify patterns of events (see Table 49). A blinded independent review of these events was conducted by hepatology experts external to the MAH. The external adjudication panel assessment showed a 6% higher proportion of subjects experienced an event suggestive of hepatic decompensation in the eltrombopag treatment group compared with the placebo group.

a. Other decompensation events included hepatic failure (9 eltrombopag. 1 placebo), hepatorenal syndrome (1 eltrombopag). and other (5 eltrombogpag [1 hepatitis alcoholic, 2 hepatic cirrhosis, 1 hepatic function abnormal., 1 liver disorder]. 1 placebo [hepatic cirrhosis]) (Data Source Table 8.9018)

Factors related to an increased probability of experiencing a hepatic decompensation event included baseline MELD score ≥ 10, non-Asian ancestry, and baseline albumin ≤ 35 g/L.

There was no clear correlation between eltrombopag dose and hepatic decompensation events. The mean daily dose of eltrombopag was 65.6 mg in those experiencing an event, and 63.6 mg in those not. The cumulative eltrombopag dose was 9276 mg in those experiencing an event, and 14454 mg in those not (though around a third of those experiencing events had treatment withdrawn due to the event). The proportion who received the maximum dose (100 mg) of eltrombopag prior to an event was comparable in those experiencing an event (54%) and those not (53%). The distribution of eltrombopag doses taken (ie, proportions taking 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg doses) in those experiencing events and those not was also comparable. Similar results were observed for those randomised to placebo.

Six percent of placebo subjects had an increase of 2 or more points in the Child-Pugh score from baseline to the end of follow-up, compared with 8% of eltrombopag subjects.

Median MELD score increased during the open label phase, and in the double-blind phase for those treated with eltrombopag but not placebo (data not shown). Because MELD is dependent on serum bilirubin, which can be pharmacologically increased with concomitant eltrombopag and ribavirin, the MELD scores during the on-treatment period are difficult to interpret.

Median interquartile range (INR) values in the eltrombopag treatment group were stable in the DB Phase and were similar to the median INR values for placebo-treated subjects, including at end-of-treatment and during follow-up.

Two eltrombopag subjects who had a fatal AE of renal failure did so in the context of multi-organ failure.

- One subject died on Day 333, 17 days post-treatment, from generalized edema, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal failure, hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple organ failure (all Grade 4 SAEs). The subject's baseline MELD score was 14. Medical conditions ongoing at study entry included hypertension, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular overload, esophageal varices, and depression.
- One subject died 3 weeks post -therapy (Day 186) due to sepsis with ensuing hepatic and renal failure. Subject's baseline MELD score was 14. Medical conditions ongoing at study entry were reported as 'aplastic anaemia', glaucoma, and cirrhosis.

Subjects with increases in serum creatinine of 44.3 μmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) and 26.6 μmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) in ≥ 2 consecutive assessments were identified. More subjects treated with eltrombopag (16 subjects, 2%) had at least 2 consecutive assessments of creatinine ≥26.6 μ mol/L above baseline compared with placebo (4 subjects, &lt;1%). All other assessments were similar between both treatment groups. Similar proportions of subjects in both treatment groups (eltrombopag, 8%; placebo, 6%) had decreases in creatinine clearance (to 60-89 mL/min) at ≥ 2 consecutive visits (data not shown).

The occurrences of hypokalemia, hyponatremia or hypomagnesemia were investigated and compared between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups. Two subjects in the eltrombopag group (&lt;1%) and no subjects in the placebo group had a Grade3/Grade4 hypokalemia. Eight subjects in the eltrombopag group (&lt;1%) had a Grade3/Grade4 hyponatremia compared with none in the placebo group. Similar proportions of subjects in both treatment groups experienced a shift from baseline to a toxicity Grade ≥ 2 for magnesium (eltrombopag: 4%; placebo: 4%).

## Malignancies

Malignancies were reported by 66 subjects during the DB Phase (see Table 51).

a. Subject 31 1/TPL103922 was diagnosed post-study with *myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable\"; 6 months after radiotherapy for NSCLC and 13 months after last dose of study medication. A narrative for this subject is provided in Section 16 of the study TPL103922 CSR

During double blind phase, 81 subjects, 55( 6%) eltrombopag and 26 (5%) in placebo reported 'hepatic lesions', most of them were 'confirmed or suspected' hepatocelullar carcinoma HCC', 44 (5%) in eltrombopag and 19 (4%) in placebo. In addition four subjects had a report of hepatic neoplasm during open-label phase. Development of hepatocelullar carcinoma is not unexpected in patients with advance HCV disease. No relevant differences between treatment arms have been found.

The MAH also reported two patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, none of them related with eltrombopag therapy.

## Thrombocytopenia Adverse Events

During the DB Phase on-treatment plus 30 days follow-up period, the proportion of subjects reporting a thrombocytopenic event was lower in the eltrombopag group (17%) compared with the placebo group (40%).

## Bleeding Adverse Events

The following section is focused on non-variceal bleeding events. Variceal (oesophageal and/or gastric) bleeding events are considered a consequence of hepatic decompensation and are discussed in more detail above.

During the DB Phase On-treatment plus 30 days follow-up, the proportion of subjects reporting a non-variceal bleeding event was lower in the eltrombopag treatment group (16%) compared with the placebo group (21%) (see Table 52).

Seven subjects in the ENABLE studies (1 placebo, 6 eltrombopag) had a bleeding event that preceded a fatal event. The placebo event was due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The eltrombopag events include a haemorrhagic stroke, and 5 cases of GI haemorrhage.

In addition upon CHMP request during the D120 List of Outstanding issues the MAH has provided details about the post-therapy platelet counts and bleeding episodes during the follow up phase. In general a lower proportion of subjects in the eltrombopag group (50%) had post-therapy platelet  count less than baseline compared to the placebo group (73%). Moreover after withdrawal of eltrombopag, platelet counts gradually return to baseline values over a 24 week follow-up period, which is reassuring.

With regard to bleeding events, 48 (5%) patients in eltrombopag and 22(5%) in placebo experimented bleeding events, with higher numbers in the eltrombopag arm experiencing serious (27% vs 38% in placebo/eltrombopag, respectively), G3/4 bleedings (18% vs 35%, respectively) and fatal (4 subjects, 8% of cases in eltrombopag) bleedings. When the data are analysed by the type, either non-GI vs GI bleedings, it appears that these differences are mainly driven by the GI bleedings (19 subjects (2%) reported 22 events in eltrombopag arm vs 7 subjects (1%), 8 events in placebo arm) for which more cases/serious and fatal cases are reported in the eltrombopag treatment arm.

## Ocular Events

Cataracts were first observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in mice and rats, but not in dogs. Subjects were actively monitored and detailed ocular assessments (including assessments for cataracts) were therefore added at screening or baseline, every 12 weeks, end-of-treatment, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits. Cataract events were categorised as progression of existing cataracts and development of new cataracts. Results are shown in Table 53.

Comparative incidences by exposure time were provided by the MAH upon CHMP request during the D120 List of Questions. The rates of development of new cataract and the progression of preexisting cataract in subjects treated with eltrombopag were double those of placebo-treated subjects. Baseline risk factors for cataract were generally comparable in the groups. However, 33% of the placebo subjects with a cataract event had a history of diabetes, compared with 20% of the eltrombopag subjects. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for cataract, and the imbalance of this confounding factor may suggest a larger effect of eltrombopag on cataract risk than observed from the results observed in the ENABLE studies.

In addition four cases of cataract have been reported in the post-marketing data for eltrombopag in ITP. Assessment of causality was, however, confounded by the use of steroids in these patients.

## Laboratory findings

Overall, abnormalities in the haematology parameters were balanced between treatment groups with the exception of Grade 4 lymphopenia, which occurred more frequently with eltrombopag (25%) than placebo (13%).

Clinical chemistry parameters examined during the study included calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium. No systematic differences or patterns were observed between the treatment groups.

Each subject's vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) and weight were measured throughout the DB Phase. There were no consistent patterns of change in vital signs during the DB Phase. Subjects in both arms had a mean decrease in weight during the studies, with those in the eltrombopag arm consistently experiencing slightly greater weight loss (mean change from baseline at end of treatment -2.7 kg placebo, -4.4 eltrombopag). This weight difference between the arms became less evident during the post-treatment follow-up.

The proportions of ECG findings (normal, abnormal - not clinically significant, abnormal clinically significant) at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at the 24 week follow-up were similar in the two treatment groups, with most ECGs listed as normal or abnormal, not clinically significant. However, a greater proportion of eltrombopag subjects were considered to have a clinically significant change from baseline compared with placebo subjects (12 vs. 2).

With regard to the worst ECG finding during the study, the proportions with a clinically significant change from baseline were 2% (8 subjects) for placebo, and 5% (43 subjects) for eltrombopag. Of the 8 placebo subjects, there were 2 corresponding AEs, both involving ST segment abnormalities. Of the 43 eltrombopag subjects, there were 26 corresponding AEs:

- -3 atrial fibrillation
- -1 right ventricular failure
- -9 QT prolonged (3 to &gt;480 ms)
- -3 T-wave abnormalities
- -3 atrioventricular blocks
- -1 extra systoles
- -1 PR prolongation
- -1 ECG abnormal
- -1 bundle branch block left
- -1 bradycardia

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -1 bundle branch block right
- -1 acute myocardial infarction (ST elevated)

The proportions of subjects who had an increased QTcF from the screening assessment to the antiviral baseline assessment or end-of-treatment/withdrawal were similar between the eltrombopag group and the placebo group (see Table 54). A greater proportion of eltrombopag subjects had a worst case increase in QTcF of 31-60 msec compared with the placebo group.

The MAH provided a mixed effects modelling analysis to study the relationship between eltrombopag concentration and cardiac repolarization in patients with HCV (data not shown). A total of 98 subjects with time-matched electrocardiogram (ECG) and serial pharmacokinetics (PK) data were included in the analysis (analysis population). The analysis concluded that eltrombopag is predicted to have no clinically significant effect on QTc intervals at either therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses in subjects with HCV infection.

## Safety in special populations

The pooled safety analyses were evaluated for the impact of intrinsic factors on AE incidence. Subgroup analyses were performed for the on-treatment plus 30 days post-treatment follow-up period for subjects in the Safety DB Population for

- HCV Genotype (non-2/3 (69%), 2/3 (31%))

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- baseline MELD Score (&lt;10 (56%), ≥ 10 (43%))
- baseline albumin ( ≤ 35 g/L (29%), &gt;35 g/L (71%))
- fibrosis score (F0/F1/F2 (9%), F3/F4 (79%))
- age (&lt;65 years (93%), ≥ 65 years (7%))
- gender (Female (37%), Male (63%))
- race (Eastern Asian heritage (10%), other Asian heritage (13%), White and other (77%))
- BMI (&lt;30 (71%), ≥ 30 (28%))

## HCV Genotype

Subjects in the two HCV genotype subgroups were treated differently. The HCV genotype non2/3 subgroup had a longer median cumulative duration of treatment for all 3 IPs than the genotype 2/3 subgroup. In the HCV genotype non-2/3 subgroup, the safety profile was similar to that for the overall safety. In the HCV genotype 2/3 subgroup, the safety profile was similar between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups.

Subjects with HCV genotype non-2/3 had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than subjects with HCV genotype 2/3. There were 17 eltrombopag subjects (3%) with a fatal event in the HCV genotype non-2/3 group, compared with 6 subjects (2%) in the HCV genotype 2/3 group. Table 55 shows Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs by HCV Genotype.

## MELD Score

The median cumulative duration of treatment for DB study drug, peginterferon and ribavirin were all longer for the eltrombopag treatment group compared with the placebo group for both MELD subgroups. However, this difference between the treatment groups was greater in the MELD ≥ 10 (~35% difference) subgroup for each of the 3 IPs compared to MELD &lt;10 (~9% difference). This difference was primarily due to the shorter median cumulative duration of treatment for the MELD ≥ 10 placebo group compared to the MELD &lt;10 placebo group.

Subjects with a baseline MELD score ≥10 had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than subjects with a baseline MELD score &lt;10. There were 6 eltrombopag subjects (1%) with a fatal event in the MELD &lt;10 group, compared with 16 subjects (4%) in the MELD ≥ 10 group. For the

## Albumin

Subjects with baseline albumin ≤ 35 g/L had a higher frequency of AEs, including death, than subjects with baseline albumin &gt;35 g/L. There were 15 eltrombopag subjects (5%) with a fatal event in the albumin ≤ 35 g/L, compared with 8 subjects (1%) in the albumin &gt;35 g/L. For the baseline albumin &gt;35 g/L subgroup, the safety profile was similar between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups

Subjects with baseline albumin ≤ 35 g/L treated with eltrombopag had a higher incidence of AEs suggestive of hepatic decompensation (25%) compared with subjects with baseline albumin &gt;35 g/L treated with eltrombopag (8%), and higher than the corresponding placebo group (10%) (see Table 58 and 59).

## Overall Summary of Adverse Events by Baseline MELD Score and Baseline Albumin

In the ENABLE studies baseline MELD ≥ 10 was associated with a 3-fold higher rate of progression to decompensated liver disease in comparison to baseline MELD &lt;10. This was observed in both the placebo and the eltrombopag treatment groups. Subjects in both treatment groups with a baseline  MELD  score ≥ 10  had  a  higher  frequency  of  adverse  events,  including  death,  than subjects  with  a  baseline  MELD  score  &lt;10  (see  Table  60).  In  contrast,  the  safety  profile  was similar  between  the  placebo  and  eltrombopag  treatment  groups  for  the  baseline  MELD  &lt;10 subgroup. Subjects in both treatment groups with baseline albumin levels &lt;35 g/L had a higher frequency of AEs suggestive of hepatic decompensation, including death. Similar to subjects with baseline MELD score &lt;10, the safety profile was similar between the placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups for subjects with albumin levels &gt;35 g/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DataSource:SDAPTable8.1028

The safety profile was similar for patients treated with eltrombopag and placebo for subjects with genotype 2/3, MELD &lt;10, or albumin levels &gt;35 g/L, whilst the SVR rates were higher in the subjects in these subgroups.

## Fibrosis Score

FibroSURE category F0/F1/F2 had a lower incidence and occurrence of AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, drug related AEs and AEs leading to IP discontinuation when compared with category F3/F4 and the overall safety DB population, although this subgroup (F0/F1/F2) had a small number of subjects.

## Age

Although the proportion of patients aged at least 65 years was small, they appeared to experience a disproportionate number of adverse events of special interest (other than those suggestive of hepatic decompensation) (see Table 61). In particular, non-variceal bleeding events and cataract events occurred at a higher frequency in older subjects.

## Gender

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the AE profile was generally similar for the eltrombopag group compared with the placebo group for both genders.

## Race

Population PK analysis have shown that Eastern Asians (such as Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) have a higher plasma eltrombopag AUC value than non East Asians. The small number of subjects in the Eastern Asian (10%) and Other Asian (13%) categories, however, make it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding differences between the subgroups.

Eastern Asians received slightly lower cumulative doses of eltrombopag and antivirals than Whites, but over a longer duration than other racial groups.

Adjudicated events of special interest were analysed by the three racial groups (see Table 62). The AE profile was similar with that observed for the overall Safety DB Population, though events in East Asians were more common than in other racial groups.

## BMI

Overall, the adverse event profile was generally similar for the eltrombopag group compared with the placebo group for both BMI categories. The exception was the incidence of SAEs, which was higher in the eltrombopag group compared with the placebo group for the BMI &lt;30 category (20% vs. 13%). There was a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group compared with the eltrombopag group with AE leading to IP discontinuation for both BMI categories.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The potential for interaction of eltrombopag with the organic anion transporter polypeptide, OATP1B1, the breast cancer resistance protein, polyvalent cations, and high-fat foods is already detailed in the SmPC. Post-marketing reports have not highlighted any additional concerns regarding interactions.

Upon CHMP request the MAH provided preliminary findings of a DDI study to investigate the potential for an interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. The study involved 56 healthy volunteers; high single doses of eltrombopag were used (200 mg), with maximum recommended single and multiple dose levels of the protease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inhibitors. The study design, with steady-state dosing of the protease inhibitors, was designed to document the effect of protease inhibitors on eltrombopag pharmacokinetics. Preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag however the full study report is awaited before any conclusion can be made.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

A greater proportion of placebo subjects (29%) discontinued investigational product due to an AE compared with eltrombopag treated subjects (22%) as shown in Table 63. This difference was mainly attributed to events of thrombocytopenia. Hematological toxicities were the most common reasons for discontinuation in both treatment groups.

## Post marketing experience

Eltrombopag was first approved for marketing in the US on 20 November 2008 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). As of 31 March 2012, there were 2261 spontaneous and post marketing cases (5215 AEs) received for marketed use of eltrombopag, received from 41 countries (the majority from the US) (see Table 64).

a. Adverse events included in the eltrombopag Core Safety Information.

There were 489 cases with a fatal outcome out of the 2261 cases reported from marketed usage of eltrombopag. These cases have been presented in detail in periodic safety update reports. Many reports with fatal outcome primarily described elderly patients with multiple underlying medical conditions and co-morbidities that likely contributed to the fatal outcome. The majority of the cases with a fatal outcome were from the post marketing studies (402/489). There was a wide age range reported (3-100 years), with the majority of reported cases describing patients greater than 65 years of age. The cause of death was unknown or unspecified in over 30% of the cases received by GSK. The remaining causes of death pertained to primarily elderly patients with underlying malignancies, infections including sepsis, cardiac disorders, renal disease, respiratory conditions, and nervous system disorders.

The most frequently reported hepatobiliary events were liver function test abnormal (47), liver disorder (37), aspartate aminotransferase increased (29), alanine aminotransferase increased (27), hepatic enzyme increased (27), hepatic function abnormal (18), and blood bilirubin increased (15). The outcomes of the 206 cases were improved/resolved (80), unresolved (22), fatal (40), and unknown (64). In general, most cases describe mild and transient elevations in liver function parameters, which resolved or improved following eltrombopag discontinuation or dose reduction. Some cases were of severe liver injury or liver failure in the setting of other comorbid conditions such as sepsis leading to multi-organ failure, or worsening liver function in patients with pre-existing liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis).

There were 210 cases reviewed that pertained to thromboembolic events. The most frequently reported events in these 210 cases were deep vein thrombosis (58), pulmonary embolism (48), myocardial infarction (22), thrombosis (20), cerebrovascular accident (15), acute myocardial infarction (9), and portal vein thrombosis (9). The outcomes of the 210 cases were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

improved/resolved (81), resolved with sequelae (3), unresolved (24), worse (1), fatal (34), and unknown (67). The patients with a fatal thromboembolic event had multiple co morbidities including congestive heart failure, leukemia, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, carotid arterial stenosis, and hyperlipidemia.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety database for eltrombopag in combination with interferon-based antiviral therapy in chronic HCV comprises placebo-controlled data for 955 patients from up to 6 months of dosing in two double-blind trials, preceded by an initial uncontrolled dosing period. Supportive data are also available from the small dose-ranging Phase II study. Eltrombopag has been licensed for use in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura for over 2 years. It is known to be associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity (increases in serum transaminases and bilirubin) and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Eltrombopag has been also associated with cataract in rodent studies.

In the ENABLE studies there were significantly more AEs, including SAEs, fatal AEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, and AEs leading to study medication discontinuation, in those treated with eltrombopag as compared to placebo. The commonest SAEs and causes of death were related to hepatic decompensation. The incidence of SAEs related to hepatic decompensation in eltrombopag subjects was double that in placebo subjects (8% vs. 4%). There were 30 fatal events related to hepatic decompensation: 7 in the placebo group (1.4%) and 23 in the eltrombopag group (2.4%). There were also 5 cases of fatal GI haemorrhage, all occurring in those on eltrombopag.

Thrombotic/thromboembolic events were more common in those on eltrombopag. Upon CHMP request the MAH provided a very detailed discussion on the TEE cases observed during the ENABLE 1 and 2 studies showing that 38 out of 955 subjects (4 %) treated with eltrombopag and 6 out of 484 subjects (1 %) in the placebo group experienced TEEs. Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications included both venous and arterial events. The majority of TEEs were non-serious and resolved by the end of the study. Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment groups (2 % in patients treated with eltrombopag versus &lt; 1 % for placebo). In addition significant risk factors for TEEs included age ≥ 60 and albumin &lt; 3.5 g/L. This information has been included in the SmPC.

No cases of elevated platelet levels occurred in patients with maximum platelets counts &lt; 100 Gi/L and the majority of cases occurred in patients &gt;150 Gi/L (26/44) elevated platelet. Furthermore, median platelet levels near to the event tended to be higher in the eltrombopag treatment arms compared to placebo (93 Gi/L vs 50 Gi/L). Although low platelet levels do not prevent from TEE, there seems to be a higher risk in patients with higher platelet levels during the course of treatment. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the recommended posology should keep platelets values &lt;150 Gi/L and treatment with eltrombopag should be stopped when platelet values &gt;150 Gi/L to minimise the risk for TEE. In addition, an additional statement has been included in section 4.2 of the SmpC highlighting the need to use the lowest dose of eltrombopag to achieve and maintain a platelet count ≥50 Gi/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hepatobiliary events were also more common in those treated with eltrombopag. This was partly due to an increase in events of hyperbilirubinaemia; eltrombopag is known to inhibit a metabolising enzyme of bilirubin, resulting in elevation of unconjugated bilirubin. Although increases in serum transaminases were comparable to the placebo group, events suggestive of hepatic decompensation (such as ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic encephalopathy) occurred nearly twice as frequently in those on eltrombopag (OR 1.9, CI 1.3 to 2.9). This did not appear to be a dose-dependent finding, and is further complicated by the fact that those treated with eltrombopag were exposed to higher doses of peginterferon/ribavirin. However, the association between peginterferon/ribavirin therapy and hepatotoxicity is not strong. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that a statement regarding hepatic decompensation should be added to the eltrombopag SmPC to adequately address the risk. In addition the SmPC has been updated to provide appropriate information to warn physicians on the risk of transaminases increments and hyperbillirubinemia in relation to eltrombopag.

The numerical trend for more serious bleeding GI events after stopping therapy is a matter of concern and has been reflected adequately in the SmPC. Additional follow up of this risk at postapproval has also been included in the RMP.

The rates of development of new cataract and the progression of pre-existing cataract in subjects treated with eltrombopag were higher than those of placebo-treated subjects (8 % of the eltrombopag group and 5 % of the placebo group). Baseline risk factors for cataract were generally comparable in the groups. However, 33% of the placebo subjects with a cataract event had a history of diabetes, compared with 20% of the eltrombopag subjects. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for cataract, and the imbalance of this confounding factor may suggest a larger effect of eltrombopag on cataract risk than observed from the results observed in the ENABLE studies.

Nevertheless, cataract has been included as an 'important identified risk' in the RMP, since it has been demonstrated in non-clinical studies and confirmed by clinical data, and the magnitude of difference in occurrence between the eltrombopag and placebo groups is of sufficient magnitude, with no other convincing explanation, to suggest a causal relationship. Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been amended to add the rates of cataract events in the eltrombopag and placebo groups and the recommendation to monitor for cataract. The risk is adequately detailed in the SmPC and patient information leaflet.

A PK modelling analysis of subjects in the ENABLE studies to examine the relationship between plasma eltrombopag concentration and change in QTc interval from baseline revealed a low risk of QTc prolongation at maximum and supratherapeutic doses of eltrombopag. However, neither non-clinical studies nor the clinical thorough QT-Study conducted to assess the potential effect on eltrombopag on QT demonstrated any effect of concern. During the DB phase clinically significant changes from baseline in ECG were seen in 1% (12) patients in eltrombopag vs &lt;1% (2 cases) in placebo. Further, differences in the incidence of ECG related AEs during this D-B phase were also found, with again small differences between treatments (a total 3% in placebo vs 4% in eltrombopag). In addition, when considering only those cases of AE related to QT/repolarisation abnormalities, there were no cases in placebo vs 13 in eltrombopag treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While the specific studies to detect QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic effect concluded 'no effect', the results obtained from ENABLEs studies appears to contradict that conclusion and section 4.8 of the SmpC includes 'electrocardiogram QT prolonged ' as a common adverse reaction'. Given this discrepancies and the fact that this is a particularly susceptible population, the CHMP was of the opinion that this risk had to be included in the RMP as a safety concern and will be followed up by routine pharmacovigilance activities. The SmPC has been also been updated to better reflect this risk.

Patients with MELD score ≥10 and those with baseline albumin levels ≤ 35 g/L are at an increased risk of a SAE and fatal events. This is not unexpected and it is supported by the data provided, which indicates that patients with a more advance disease are at particular risk for AEs. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TEE (see Benedfit-risk balance and  SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Other baseline factors, such as age, gender, BMI, and race, did not appear to have a significant effect on the safety findings.

Relevant risks to the HCV-associated thrombocytopenia, in particular thromboembolic events, hepatic decompensation and fatal adverse events, will be addressed in the already existing healthcare professional information pack containing educational materials to be provided prior to launch to all physicians who intend to prescribe eltrombopag.

The CHMP was of the opinion that it was necessary to further characterize known safety concerns (e.g. thromboembolisms, hepatic decompensation) including possible risks factors, and to generate efficacy/safety data on populations with important missing information (e.g. safety and efficacy of eltrombopag with new acting agents). The effects of eltrombopag on liver-related outcome (including mortality) should be studied. Until these data is available, the CHMP was of the opinion that the safety and efficacy have not been established in combination with direct acting antiviral agents approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes an adequate warning informing of this fact.

The MAH agreed to further explore the safety and efficacy of using eltrombopag including combination with direct acting antiviral agents (triple therapy) in three post-authorisation safety studies (PASS). Two of the studies will be nested within existing multicentre, prospective observational cohort HCV Research UK and Hepatitis C Therapeutic Registry and Research Network (HCVTARGET), and the third one will be conducted by GSK.

Safety outcomes in all three post-authorization studies will include:

- Hepatic decompensation
- Myocardial infarction
- Ischemic Stroke
- Portal vein thrombosis
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Pulmonary embolism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- All cause mortality
- Cause-specific mortality from the death certificate
- Other long term outcomes, to be identified during protocol development

The studies will include the following effectiveness outcomes:

- Initiated interferon-based antiviral therapy
- Maintained interferon-based antiviral therapy
- Reached sustained virologic response or early virologic response
- Other long term outcomes, to be identified during protocol development

In addition, the CHMP was of the opinion that additional pharmacovigilance activities were necessary in order to characterise the off-label use of eltrombopag. To address this concern the MAH will perform a Drug Utilization Study (DUS) post-marketing.

Moreover, the CHMP agreed on the need to provide data on the effectiveness of the risk minimization measures, therefore the MAH was requested to conduct post-authorisation a study to measure the effectiveness of the educational material.

All requested studies have been included in the RMP and are listed in the approved pharmacovigilance plan as category 3 (required additional pharmacovigilance activity).

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated with a range of adverse events, but in particular an increase in fatal AEs, and an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD score ≥10 or albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high.

In summary, treatment with eltrombopag offers patients with end-stage HCV, and an otherwise poor prognosis, an opportunity to undergo antiviral therapy, increasing their chances of achieving SVR by half. The risks are not insignificant, but several may be associated with concomitant antiviral therapy, and may be treatable. Patients with the poorest prognosis face the highest risk, but this group of patients represents those most at need of successful antiviral therapy.

| Patients with hepatic impairment | The SmPC (Section 4.2 Posology) states the following: Hepatic impairment Eltrombopag should not be used in ITP patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 5) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. If the use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary for ITP patients with hepatic impairment the starting dose must be 25 mg once daily. After initiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic impairment wait 3 weeks before increasing the dose. No dose adjustment is required for thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≤ 6). Thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily. After initiating the dose of eltrombopag in patients with hepatic impairment wait 2 weeks before increasing the dose. There is an increased risk for adverse events, including thromboembolic events, in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag, either in preparation for invasive procedures or in HCV patients undergoing antiviral therapy. | None                                    |

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The clinical program for eltrombopag was designed to investigate the proportion of thrombocytopenic patients with HCV who could reach a platelet count sufficient to enable initiation of interferon therapy, and then to randomise patients to receive either ongoing treatment with eltrombopag or placebo and to measure the proportion achieving SVR. This endpoint was relevant because the success of interferon/ribavirin therapy may be compromised by thrombocytopenia, in terms of treatment interruptions or dose reductions.

In the ENABLE studies approximately 95% of thrombocytopenic patients achieved the threshold platelet count and were able to start antiviral therapy, mostly within 4 weeks. In the subsequent placebo-controlled phase, the proportion of those treated with eltrombopag achieving SVR was 23% in ENABLE 1 and 19% in ENABLE 2, representing a difference to placebo of 8% and 6%, respectively. This represents a relative increase in response of around 50% in a group of patients who may otherwise be ineligible for antiviral therapy, or who, if treated, may respond poorly.

The other secondary endpoints were supportive of the efficacy of eltrombopag. In the doubleblind treatment phase the rate of antiviral dose reductions in those on eltrombopag was 40% that of placebo-treated subjects. Correspondingly, the average time to requirement for a dose reduction was slightly prolonged in those on eltrombopag, and fewer patients required premature discontinuation of antiviral therapy. Adherence to antiviral therapy was higher in eltrombopagtreated subjects, and was shown to be related to a higher probability of achieving SVR.

During antiviral therapy, those on eltrombopag maintained consistently higher platelet counts than those on placebo, and remained at levels above 50 Gi/L for considerably longer periods.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

The relevance of the study results was questioned given that current clinical practice involves the new treatment options available, including DAA+pegIFN +Ribavirin. The CHMP agreed that the results remain relevant as long as interferon is the backbone of HCV antiviral therapy and preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to investigate the potential for interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir have been presented to support its use in association with HCV triple therapy including direct acting antiviral agents. Preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. Further data will be submitted to further address this issue (see benefit-risk balance).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated with a range of adverse events, but in particular an increase in fatal AEs, and an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD score ≥10 or albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Nowadays the standard of care for HVC patients is triple therapy with new direct antivirals. There is no comprehensive data on the safety profile of eltrombopag added to a triple combination regimen of antivirals. To date only preliminary PK results from a drug-drug interaction study to investigate the potential for interaction between eltrombopag and the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir have been presented to support its use in association with HCV triple therapy including direct acting antiviral agents. Full results are not yet available and are awaited but preliminary results show no significant effect of telaprevir or boceprevir on eltrombopag. Further data will be submitted to further address this issue (see benefit-risk balance)

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment with eltrombopag offers patients with end-stage HCV, and an otherwise poor prognosis, an opportunity to undergo antiviral therapy, increasing their chances of achieving SVR by half. SVR not only represents cure from viral infection, but also provides the prospect of changing the natural history of the disease.

The use of eltrombopag in thrombocytopenic HCV patients in the ENABLE studies was associated with a range of adverse events, including an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Benefit-risk balance

In view of the benefits in terms of SVR that is likely to represent cure from infection, the toxicity was considered acceptable and the benefit-risk balance was considered positive in the following revised indication:

Revolade is indicated in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, where the degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor preventing the initiation or limiting the ability to maintain optimal interferon-based therapy.

The benefit in terms of SVR was slightly lower in patients with MELD score ≥10 and those with baseline albumin levels ≤ 35 g/L who are at an increased risk of a SAE and fatal events. This is not unexpected and it is supported by the data provided, which indicates that patients with a more advance disease are at particular risk for AEs. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of TEE (see Benefit-risk balance and SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Although the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag have not been established in combination with direct acting antiviral agents approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, based on the available pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data, a restriction of the indication to exclude use in combination with direct acting antiviral agents does not seem appropriate as important differences in terms of safety and efficacy are unlikely. The need for additional efficacy and safety data is reflected in the SmPC and will be addressed in a post-authorisation safety study.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

In the ENABLE studies approximately 95% of thrombocytopenic patients achieved the threshold platelet count and were able to start antiviral therapy, mostly within 4 weeks. In the subsequent placebo-controlled phase, the proportion of those treated with eltrombopag achieving SVR was 23% in ENABLE 1 and 19% in ENABLE 2, representing a difference to placebo of 8 and 6 percentage points, respectively. This represents a relative increase in response of around 50% in a group of patients who may otherwise be ineligible for antiviral therapy, or who, if treated, may respond poorly.

The risks are not insignificant, in particular an increased risk of thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and an increased risk of fatal AEs. In subjects with poor prognostic factors (MELD score ≥10 or albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL) the risks were particularly high, however this group of patients represents those most at need of successful antiviral therapy.

Although several AEs may be associated with concomitant antiviral therapy, and may be treatable, the CHMP considered necessary to revise the wording of the indication initially proposed by the MAH to reflect that only patients who otherwise could not initiate or maintain an IFN-based HCV regimen should be candidates to this treatment.

- Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling

## Key elements to be included in the educational material

## Hepatotoxicity

- Educate patients about the potential for hepatic enzyme elevations, importance of monthly laboratory monitoring of ALT and AST, as well as the signs and symptoms associated with liver injury (e.g. jaundice).
- Measure serum ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiation of Revolade, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase and monthly following establishment of a stable dose.
- Discontinue Revolade if ALT levels increase (≥ 3X the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and are:
- progressive, or
- persistent for &gt; 4 weeks, or
- accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or
- accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation.
- Exercise caution when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic disease. Use a lower starting dose of eltrombopag and monitor closely when administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Thromboembolic events ITP patients

- Eltrombopag should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score ≥ 5) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis. If use of eltrombopag is deemed necessary, the starting dose must be 25mg once daily.
- Educate patients about the potential for thromboembolic events (TEE) in patients with chronic ITP and those known risk factors for thromboembolic events (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome).
- Educate patients about chronic liver disease and the risk of thromboembolic events.
- In patients with chronic liver disease treated with eltrombopag there was an association between TEE and platelet counts ≥ 200,000µl.
- A dose reduction is recommended for ITP patients with platelet counts between 150,000250,000/μl.
- Revolade should be interrupted if platelet counts increase to &gt; 250,000/μl. Once the platelet count is &lt; 100,000/μl, reinitiate therapy at a reduced daily dose.

## HCV patients

- Thrombocytopenic patients with HCV should initiate eltrombopag at a dose of 25 mg once daily.
- Educate thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV about the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly the increased incidence of portal vein thrombosis and known risk factors for thromboembolic events (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome).
- In thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV there was no specific temporal relationship between start of treatment and event of TEE. TEEs were more common in patients &gt; 60 years old and in patients with albumin below 35 g/L.
- A dose reduction is recommended for thrombocytopenic chronic HCV patients with platelet counts between 100,000-150,000/μl.
- Revolade should be interrupted if platelet counts increase to &gt; 150,000/μl. Once the platelet count is &lt; 100,000/µl, reinitiate therapy at a reduced daily dose.

## Posology

- Educate patients on the appropriate administration of Revolade (e.g. titration of Revolade, food-drug interaction, dose recommendations for special populations [e.g. East Asians]).
- Awareness to prescribers of the labelled indication and warnings associated with nonindicated populations (e.g. not recommended for use in children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, other off label uses).

## Food Interactions

- Educate patients about the potential food-drug interaction (i.e. chelation with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc). Antacids, dairy products and other products containing polyvalent cations, such as mineral supplements, must be administered at least four hours apart from Revolade dosing to avoid significant reduction in Revolade absorption due to chelation.
- Assist patient in developing a plan to administer Revolade at a time each day that fits into the patient's own daily schedule.

## Reoccurrence of Thrombocytopenia

- Educate patients about the potential risk of bleeding after treatment has stopped (include incidence in clinical trials and likelihood of reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Following discontinuation of Revolade, platelet counts return to baseline levels within 2 weeks in the majority of patients, which increase the bleeding risk and in some cases may lead to bleeding.
- Monitor platelet count weekly for 4 weeks following discontinuation of Revolade.

## Increased Bone Marrow Reticulin Fibres

- Educate patients about the potential for bone marrow reticulin fibre formation.
- Background information on reticulin in the bone marrow (i.e. background rates of reticulin in bone marrow in ITP patients and the observed incidence and potential mechanism of action of reticulin deposition in response to Revolade).
- Prior to initiation of Revolade, examine the peripheral blood smear closely to establish a baseline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities.
- Following identification of a stable dose of Revolade, perform complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell count (WBC) differential monthly.
- If immature or dysplastic cells are observed, examine peripheral blood smears for new or worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g., teardrop and nucleated red blood cells, immature white blood cells) or cytopenia(s).
- If the patient develops new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s), discontinue treatment with Revolade and consider a bone marrow biopsy, including staining for fibrosis.

## Haematological malignancies

- The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by excluding other clinical entities with thrombocytopenia. Consideration should be given to performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy over the course of the disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, those with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs.
- Educate patients about the theoretical risk of haematological malignancies with thrombopoietin receptor agonists.
- Importance of not using Revolade outside the context of its license unless in a clinical trial setting.

## Potential for Off-label Use

- The risk-benefit for the treatment of thrombocytopenia outside of the registered indication has not been established.
- The risk-benefit of Revolade in paediatric ITP and paediatric HCV-associated thrombocytopenia has not been established. The paediatric population is defined as those persons aged between 0 and 18 years.

## Hepatic Decompensation (use with interferon)

- Chronic HCV patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving alfa-interferon therapy
- Educate thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV that safety findings suggestive of hepatic decompensation were reported more frequently in patients treated with eltrombopag/interferon/ribavirin.
- Thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV with low albumin (≤ 35 g/L) or Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥ 10 at baseline had a greater risk of hepatic decompensation when treated with eltrombopag/interferon/ribavirin. Patients with these signs should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation.

## Fatal Adverse Events in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV

- In thrombocytopenic patients with chronic HCV, patients who receive anti viral therapy in combination with eltrombopag may be at greater risk of fatal adverse events, particularly those with the poorest prognosis, i.e.:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o MELD score ≥10,
- o Albumin ≤ 35 g/L
- Educate patients with the poorest prognosis about the increased risk of fatal adverse events, particularly hepatic decompensation (hepatic failure, ascites, encephalopathy and bleeding varices), infective and ischemic complications.
- Treatment with eltrombopag should be stopped if signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events and hepatic decompensation occur (see TEE and hepatic decompensation above).

## Additional Data/Market exclusivity

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers, by consensus that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
