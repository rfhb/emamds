| EMA/REF/0000269473                    | 726/2004, the European Commission requested on 05 May 2025 the opinion of the European Medicines Agency further to the serious adverse events reported with the use of Ixchiq. The CHMP was requested to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Ixchiq and to give its recommendation whether the marketing authorisation of this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. As the request results from the evaluation of data resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the CHMP opinion was adopted on the basis of a recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee.   |            |     | EMA/REF/0000269473                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
