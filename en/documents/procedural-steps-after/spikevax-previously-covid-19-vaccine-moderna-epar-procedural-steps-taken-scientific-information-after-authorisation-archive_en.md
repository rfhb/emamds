1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

A 100 microgram (0.5 mL) dose was administered, which was the dose authorised at the time of study conduct. In Part A, 128 SOT recipients received a third dose of Spikevax (original). In Part B, 159 SOT recipients received a booster dose at least 4 months after the last dose (fourth dose for mRNA vaccines and third dose for non-mRNA vaccines). Reactogenicity was consistent with the known profile of Spikevax (original). There were no unexpected safety findings. For more information, please refer to the Summary of |

The MAH is taking the opportunity to include as editorial updates in sections 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC, Annex II and package leaflet, corrections from procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0075.

The immunogenicity responses against influenza were in general comparable between the concomitant group and the vaccine group that received high-dose influenza alone, with only a minimal, if any, trend towards higher results in the high-dose influenza alone vaccine group. This trend was not considered of clinical relevance. The immunogenicity responses against SARS-CoV-2 were also comparable with a minimal trend towards higher geometric mean titres in the Spikevax alone vaccine group as compared to the concomitant group, which was not deemed of clinical relevance. No evidence of an adverse impact on the safety profile after concomitant administration of high-dose influenza and Spikevax vaccines was observed. The study was carried out with a 100 µg dose of Spikevax, instead of 50 µg as approved. Nevertheless the study design per se was deemed adequate to investigate an impairment of the immune response after co-administration, independent of the dose, while creating a considerable safety margin when following   |

| II/0057             | Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Spikevax SmPC to include a 50 µg booster dose for adolescents 12 to 18 years of age, based on the extrapolation of safety and efficacy data from young adults (18 to 24 years of age). The package leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation | 21/07/2022 | 16/08/2022 | SmPC and PL | A booster dose of Spikevax should be given intramuscularly to individuals 12 years of age and older at least 3 months after completion of the primary series. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed more often after the second dose compared to the first dose, and more often in younger males. The risk profile appears to be similar for the second and the third dose. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics. |

COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19 with a subgroup to investigate detailed immunology. Participants were adults aged 30 years or older, in good physical health (mild to moderate well- controlled co-morbidities were permitted), who had received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford- AstraZeneca (first dose in December 2020, January 2021 or February 2021), and were at least 84 days post second dose by the time of enrolment. Spikevax boosted antibody and neutralising responses and was well tolerated regardless of the prime series. The dose used for boosting in this study was 100 micrograms.

In this study, 198 participants received two doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax vaccine primary series. In an open- label phase of this study, participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited adverse reaction profile for the booster dose was similar to that after the second dose in the primary series. A single booster dose was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 28 days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) when compared 28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose.
