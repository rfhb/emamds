## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterised by an elevation of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), or by the elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and TG, either acquired or familial. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level is often low.

Among the most notable elevated risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease are the elevated levels of LDL-C and the reduced levels of HDL-C.

Overall prevalence of mixed hyperlipidemia varies between 10 and 25% with many cases being the result  of  secondary  causes.  Familial  mixed  hyperlipidaemia  is  one  of  the  most  common  hereditary disorders  predisposing  to  early  coronary  death.  Many  patients  have  polygenic  mixed  hyperlipidemia and/or  insulin  resistance  or  diabetes  mellitus,  while  a  small  fraction  of  patients  (0.2%)  have monogenic hyperlipidemia. Patients with polygenic or monogenic mixed hyperlipidemia form a high risk group for development of atherosclerosis especially coronary heart disease (CHD).

The achievement of lipid control in mixed dyslipidaemia usually requires progressive treatment: diet and  exercise,  followed  by  pharmacological  intervention  with  an  HMG  CoA  reductase  (statins)  in monotherapy, subsequently with statins in combination with niacin or fibrates.

Pravafenix 40/160 mg is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of pravastatin and fenofibrate formulated as hard capsules. Only one fixed dose combination containing 160 mg fenofibrate and 40 mg pravastatin is claimed.

Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative, introduced on the market in 1975. It exerts his effects mainly by  activating  the  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor-alpha  (PPAR-alpha).  It  is  generally authorised in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia.  At the time being, the benefit/risk of fibrates is under review by the CHMP under article 31 of Directive 2001/83 EEC, as amended. Indeed, in 2005, due to the publication of the FIELD study (Effects of long term fenofibrate therapy on cardiovascular events in 9795  people  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus;  a  randomised  controlled  trial.  Lancet  2005,  366,  9500: 1849-62; ERRATUM: Lancet, 2006, Vol 368, October 21, p1419-1420), a risk-benefit assessment on the fibrate class was performed, which concluded that overall, despite the long presence of fibrates on the market, there is only limited evidence of a long term clinical benefit from their use in the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. It was agreed that the use of fibrates at first line therapy in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia is not justified anymore. However, there are  subgroups  of  patients,  who  may  still  benefit  from  this  therapy.  Thus,  it  was  agreed  that  the product information for all fibrates should be updated to indicate that fibrates should be considered as first line treatment in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia with or without low HDL cholesterol. In patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia, fibrates should be given only when statins are contraindicated or not intolerated. Finally, a statement should be included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)  of  all  products  to  indicate  that  treatment  with  fibrates  may  reduce  coronary  heart  disease events  but  no  beneficial  effect  on  all  cause  mortality  in  the  primary  or  secondary  prevention  of cardiovascular  disease  has  been  confirmed.  These  recommendations  were  further  challenged  and  a procedure under Art 31 of directive 2001/83 EEC, as amended was triggered.

Pravastatin sodium (hereinafter referred to as pravastatin) is a hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin), which reduces cholesterol biosynthesis by interfering with the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in  cholesterol  biosynthesis.  Pravastatin  has  been  used  worldwide  for  more  than  10  years  in  the following indications:

Hypercholesterolemia:  Treatment  of  primary  hypercholesterolemia  or  mixed  dyslipidaemia,  as  an adjunct  to  diet,  when  response  to  diet  and  other  non-pharmacological  treatments  (e.g.  exercise, weight reduction) is inadequate.

Primary prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia and at high risk of a first cardiovascular event, as an adjunct to diet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris and with either normal or increased cholesterol levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors.

Post transplantation: Reduction of post transplantation hyperlipidaemia in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy following solid organ transplantation.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Pravafenix (Fenofibrate/Pravastatin sodium) 160/40 mg fixed dose combination is a new combination of  two  well  known  active  substances  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopeia.  The  proposed  drug product is a hard gelatine capsule consisting of (A) a fatty semi-solid composition consisting of 160mg fenofibrate and (B) a coated tablet containing 40mg of pravastatin sodium.

Pravafenix is packaged in HDPE (High density polyethylene coloured white), bottle or Aluminium/Aluminium blisters (OPA - Alu - PVC )

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## Fenofibrate.

Fenofibrate  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder.  It  is  insoluble  in  water  (saturation  solubility 0.8 µg/ml).  As  fenofibrate  has  no  ionizable  group,  its  water  solubility  is  not  influenced  by  the  pH. Fenofibrate is a lipophilic molecule (log P is 4.6), and has the following structure:

<!-- image -->

Chemical names (IUPAC nomenclature): Isopropyl 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy]-2methylpropionate

No polymorphism is known for fenofibrate. The melting point of fenofibrate is between 79°C and 82°C. Fenofibrate is a BCS class II molecule (low solubility, high absorption) and bioavailability is limited by dissolution from drug product.

## Manufacture

The active substance is supplied by two manufacturers. For both of them a Certificate of Suitability (CEP) granted by the EDQM has been presented covering the manufacturing. Both manufacturers have declared  the  absence  of  use  of  material  of  human  or  animal  origin  in  the  manufacture  of  the substance.

## Pravastatin sodium.

Pravastatin sodium is a white or yellowish-white powder or crystalline powder. It is soluble in water (&gt; 300mg/ml). Pravastatin Sodium exists in several polymorphic forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H1, I, J, K and L which are not likely to induce different pharmacokinetic profiles or to influence the shelf life of the  drug  substance/drug  products.  This  fact  is  explained  by  the  high  solubility  of  pravastatin  in aqueous medium and by the water uptake of the powder which is independent on the polymorphic form. Pravastatin has the following structure:

Coating  of  the  tablet  was  found Another main goal during development was to stabilize pravastatin within the drug product matrix, to prevent  any  interaction  between  the  fatty  mass  containing  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  In  order  to achieve this, pravastatin was formulated in a separate tablet for filling into the capsule. Degradation of pravastatin is induced by acidic media and is accelerated by oxidants. To improve pravastatin stability, an alkaline agent and an antioxidant were introduced in the tablet formulation. As the tablet has to fall freely  in  the  capsule,  uncoated  concave  tablets  were  se necessary  to  give  sufficient  hardness  to  the  tablet  for  subsequent  handling  and  encapsulation,  to prevent the formation of dust in the feeding hopper, to make the tablet slippery and to avoid direct contact between pravastatin and the fenofibrate hot blend.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

Pravastatin  is  a  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  inhibitor,  commonly used  in  the  management  of  hypercholesterolemia.  HMG-CoA  reductase  catalyses  the  conversion  of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the liver by pravastatin leads to  transcriptional  up  regulated  production  of  the  cell  surface  LDL  receptor  as  well  as  decreased cholesterol synthesis. The associated reduction in intracellular cholesterol concentration induces LDLreceptor expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which results in increased extraction of LDL-C from the  blood  and  decreased  circulating  LDL-C  concentrations.  Pravastatin  is  a  hydrophilic  statin  and  is taken  up  by  hepatocytes  via  a  carrier-mediated  active  transport  mechanism  utilising  the  anion transport system.

Fenofibrate is a member of the fibrate class of lipid-lowering drugs. Its mechanism of action derives from activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  (PPRAR  )  that  are  expressed  in  the liver.  The  fenofibric  acid,  the  active  metabolite  of  the  fenofibrate,  is  responsible  for  the  primary pharmacodynamics effects of the drug: reductions in total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations and increases in high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins  Apo  AI  and  Apo  AII  concentrations.  These  effects  are mediated  by  activation  of  PPAR  .  Fenofibrate  also  reduces  the  susceptibility  of  Very  Low  Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) and LDL to oxidative modification.

Pravastatin increases ALT and AST levels in humans but normally, these return to the baseline values without  the  need  for  treatment  discontinuation  and  are  not  associated  with  hepatic  symptoms.  The most serious adverse effect associated with statin therapy is myopathy, which may progress to fatal or nonfatal  rhabdomyolysis,  myopathy  and  severe  muscle  problems.  Pravastatin  is  less  myotoxic  than other statins due to the hydrophilic character of pravastatin and its selective affinity for liver cell via sodium-independent bile acid transporter.

However, these influences were caused by doses nd concentrations much higher than those used in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. circulatory, digestive, urinogenital and oth a

## Absorption

Pravastatin is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rats, dogs and monkeys. A study on bile duct cannulated rats showed that pravastatin is almost equally absorbed through a wide area from the stomach to the ileum. The extent of absorption of pravastatin is estimated to be approximately 65% in rats based on biliary excretion and 45% in dogs based on urinary excretion. A high bioavailability was observed in all species except monkeys, where it was only 18%. The drug is absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine, probably via the proton-coupled carrier-mediated transport.

After  absorption,  fenofibrate  is  rapidly  hydrolysed  into  its  major  metabolite,  fenofibric  acid.  The reduction of the carbonyl group of fenofibric acid results in another active but minor metabolite, the duced fenofibric acid. A significant proportion of fenofibrate is, however, not completely absorbed by tinal tract, as suggested by the considerable amounts of intact fenofibrate found in the re the gastrointes faeces.

## Distribution

After  oral  administration  of  500mg/kg  pravastatin  to  rats,  the  time  to  attain  the  maximum  plasma concentration is around 1 hour, and the maximum level is about 1  g/ml. The plasma protein binding of the drug is almost the same in rats and human, i.e. 43% to 60%, which is significantly lower than that of other statins. Pravastatin is distributed mostly into the liver and the gastrointestinal tract after both intravenous and oral dosing in rats and oral dosing in dogs. The concentration in other tissues was  close  to,  or  less  than  that  in  plasma.  Pravastatin  is  subjected  to  a  first-pass.  The  first-pass removal  rate  is  about  0.7.  A  nonlinear  relationship  was  observed  between  the  liver  and  plasma concentrations.  These  results  suggest  that  the  dose  dependency  in  the  distribution  volume  of pravastatin is due to a saturable uptake by the liver.

The tissue radioactivity concentration was measured in radio-labelled fenofibrate in specific intervals after single oral administration to Sprague-Dawley rats. The highest concentration at 30 minutes after dministration was found in the liver, the kidney and the stomach corresponding to 2 to 3 times the tration. The protein binding rate of plasma concentration was about 99% for both male a plasma concen and female rats.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolism

Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by CYP3A4, but is largely excreted as parent compound into the faeces via the bile and into the urine. After single oral administration of radio-labelled pravastatin to  rats  and  monkeys,  unchanged  pravastatin  represented  47%  and  60%  of  the  total  biliary radioactivity,  respectively,  with  small  recoveries  of  metabolites  (less  than  11%).  The  identified metabolites  were  3' α -iso-  and  6'-epi-pravastatin  both  formed  by  isomerisation,  pravastatin  lactone, 3',5'-dihydrodiol-pravastatin  and  pravastatin  4'a α -glutathione  conjugate.  In  plasma,  pravastatin accounted for only 5% and 11% of the total plasma radioactivity in rats and monkeys, respectively, although pravastatin is the major component (70%) in dog plasma. Unchanged pravastatin accounts for approximately 20-30% of the rat liver radioactivity.

After  absorption,  fenofibrate  is  rapidly  and  completely  hydrolysed  to  its  major  metabolite,  fenofibric acid.  The  reduction  of  the  carbonyl  group  of  fenofibric  acid  results  in  another  active  but  minor metabolite,  the  reduced  fenofibric  acid.  Both  metabolites  are  conjugated  with  glucuronic  acid  and excreted  mainly  in  urine.  The  major  urinary  metabolite  is  fenofibric  acid  ester  glucuronide.  Much smaller amounts of fenofibric acid and benzhydrol and his glucuronide are also found. Glucuronidation f fenofibric acid and reduced fenofibric acid is minor in rats and guinea pigs and is not detectable in o dogs. In addition, unknown polar metabolites were detected in rats, dogs and guinea pigs but were not investigated further.

Recovery of the radioactive dose averaged 29% after intravenous injection, and 12% after oral injection. About 18% (after IV) and 6.5% of unchanged pravastatin was recovered from the urine between 0 and 48 hours.

The results indicated that a mixture of 106 mg fenofibric acid and 30 mg pravastatin/kg bodyweight is the maximum tolerated dose in Wistar rats for which no mortality and major toxicity occurred after intravenously administration. The non observed effect level (NOEL) has not been determined, since 3 of  the  4  males  in  106/30  mg/kg  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  group  showed  tail  discolourations. Mortality was observed at the dose of 212 mg/kg of fenofibric acid and 60 mg/kg of pravastatin. The maximum non-lethal dose is 106/30 mg/kg.

## Repeat dose toxicity

No repeat-dose toxicity studies in pravastatin and in fenofibrate separately have been submitted within this dossier, since information about their acute toxicity has been published in the literature. However, two repeat-dose studies with the fixed dose combination of fenofibrate and pravastatin, studies TNOV5245/02  and  TNO-P8003,  have  been  performed.  Both  were  performed  in  Wistar  rats,  with  the duration of 28 days and 13 weeks. A summary of repeated-dose oral studies is tabulated below.

In  the 28-day study ,  liver  was  shown  to  be  the  target  organ.  Centrilobular  hypertrophy  occurred  at 40/10 mg/kg of fenofibrate/pravastatin and at higher doses; at 240/60 mg/kg was detected increased ASAT in females only and increased ALP in both sexes. Muscular effects were observed at 40/10 mg/kg and  higher  doses,  which  was  consisted  with  mononuclear  cell  infiltrate  in  the  skeletal  muscle  and myositis.

In the 13-week study, liver was also the target organ. Centrilobular hypertrophy was noted at 7.2/1.8 mg/kg  of  fenofibrate/pravastatin  and  higher  doses  and  increased  ALP  in  males  at  12/3  mg/kg  of fenofibrate/pravastatin.  Effects  on  pancreas  (chronic  inflammation  and  focal  pancreatitis)  were observed in all dose groups but no statistical difference from controls was achieved. It should be noted that  higher  glucose  levels  were  observed  in  the  28-day  study  but  not  found  in  the  13-week  study. Submitted  toxicity  studies  with  fenofibrate  or  pravastatin  alone  did  not  reveal  such  effects  but pancreatitis  is  mentioned  as  an  adverse  effect  for  both  active  substances  in  the  respective  SmPCs. Therefore, the relation of pancreatic effects with the treatment cannot be excluded. No increase in CK values was reported and no effects on muscles were observed. The safety margin at the NOAEL is &lt;1

based  on  AUC  or  Cmax  for  fenofibrate,  but  cannot  be  calculated  for  pravastatin  because  plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantification.

Initially, the CHMP questioned the selection of the dose in the 13-week study, since this was based on human dose  and  not  on  human  exposure.  As  a  consequence,  tested  animals  might  not  have  been significantly  exposed,  preventing  a  relevant  assessment  of  the  toxicity  of  this  new  combination,  in particular  view  of  the  new  effects  or  effects  resulting  from  potentiation  and  their  reversibility.  The doses  tested  in  the  13-week  study  could  have  been  too  low  based  on  the  28-day  study  where  no toxicity concern appeared. However, since clinicians considered that no concern regarding exposure or interaction between both components arises in humans, this issue was solved.

The CHMP also noted the findings of this study with respect to the pancreatic, muscular, renal and hepatic effects, taking into account their relevance for humans and all available clinical data. Therefore, appropriate information has been captured in the SmPC of Pravafenix: warning regarding pancreatitis, contraindication to severe renal impairment, need of monitoring of myopathy, and other.

## Genotoxicity

No new studies have been performed, which is acceptable according to the current guideline: The NonClinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). There  is  no  concern  with  regard  to  genotoxic  potential  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  in  this  fixed combination based on the provided literature references regarding genotoxicity potential for fenofibrate and pravastatin separately.

## Carcinogenicity

Specific studies have not been conducted, which is acceptable according to the guideline: Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). There is no concern regarding carcinogenicity potential of fenofibrate and pravastatin in humans in this fixed combination.

## Reproduction Toxicity

The  absence  of  new  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  is  acceptable  to  the  CHMP considering  the  well  known  profile  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  Overview  of  reproduction  studies published  in  the  literature  has  been  submitted.  Pravastatin  did  not  induce  adverse  effects  on reproduction. Fenofibrate was embryotoxic (skeletal variations, reduced ossification) at materno-toxic doses.  Neonatal  deaths  were  also  observed  at  materno-toxic  doses.  The  SmPC  of  the  fenofibratecontaining  products  states  that  prolongation  of  the  gestation  period  and  difficulties  during  delivery were observed at high doses.  Adequate information on these effects was also included in the SmPC of Pravafenix. Pravastatin is contraindicated during the pregnancy and thus, the use of Pravafenix during pregnancy is also contraindicated. This information is stated in the SmPC.

## Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic measurements were provided as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies and only at the high dose where adverse effects were observed. Therefore, no safety margin between animal exposure at the NOAEL and human exposure can be calculated.

## Local Tolerance

Based on the literature  review,  no  specific  concerns  for  the  local  tolerance  for  either  fenofibrate  or pravastatin can be identified. During the newly submitted repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with the combination, examination of the digestive tract did not reveal any particularity.

## Other toxicity studies

No other specific toxicity studies have been performed. The submitted literature data on immunogenicity, antigenicity and excipients raised no concern.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The environmental risk assessment (ERA) is based on data from bibliographic references on fenofibrate and pravastatin. The CHMP raised several concerns regarding the submitted data and considered the ERA as not yet acceptable. Determination of the partition coefficient octanol/water for any of the active

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

substances, the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) calculation and lower values of assessment factors should be re-assessed.

The  results  from  the  additional  studies  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) (ca) of Directive 2001/83. Therefore, a specific post-authorisation follow up measure  has been agreed to perform an environmental  risk  assessment  fully  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). The regards amongst others  determination  of  the  adsorption/desorption  behaviour  of  the  substances,  determination  of bioaccumulation,  determination  of  the  ready  biodegradability,  determination  of  the  long-term  fish toxicity, and other tests.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Bibliographical  references  have  been  provided  to  address  the  nonclinical  pharmacodynamics  and pharmacokinetics pattern of fenofibrate and pravastatin. Both, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of these drugs are well known and the extent and scope of the bibliographic documentation provided are considered appropriate. No new pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology or  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  and  this  is  considered  acceptable.  No  new  studies have  been  performed  on  genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and  development  toxicity, antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites  and  impurities  toxicity,  which  is  acceptable according  to  the  Guideline  on  The  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). There are no concerns regarding local tolerance, antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence  and  impurities  of  the  combination  of  fenofibrate  and pravastatin.

The  following  toxicological studies  focusing  on  the  examination  of  toxicity  of  fenofibrate  and pravastatin combination have been conducted: single-dose intravenous toxicity study with Fenofibric acid and Pravastatin in rats (TNO-V5245/01), 28 days repeat-dose oral toxicity study with fenofibrate and pravastatin in rats (TNO-V5245/02) and repeat-dose oral gavage sub-chronic toxicity study with a fixed  combination  of  a  mixture  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  in  rats,  including  a  4-weeks  recovery period  (TNO-8003).  The  toxicity  effects  observed  in  animals  have  been  adequately  reflected  in  the SmPC of the fixed dose combination.

Regarding  the  ecotoxicity  and  environmental  risk  issues,  this  assessment  is  based  on  data  from bibliographic  references  on  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  The  CHMP  requested  the  conduct  of  an additional Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis during the post-authorisation phase.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The  non  clinical  programme  for  Pravafenix  is  considered  appropriate  to  support  the  marketing authorisation application for Pravafenix, including the conduct of three toxicity studies. The submitted environmental risk assessment is not fully acceptable and a new ERA programme will be conducted as agreed in form of a specific follow up measure.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

This is an application for the marketing authorisation of the fixed dose combination medicinal product fenofibrate/pravastatin in the frame of the centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The application is submitted in accordance with Article 3(2)a of the above mentioned regulation and with  Article 10(b) of the Directive 2001/83/EC.

For the assessment of the clinical properties of Pravafenix, a lipid lowering agents, both the Note for Guidance (NfG) on fixed medicinal products (CPMP/EWP/240/95) and the Note for Guidance on clinical investigation of Medicinal Products in the treatment of Lipid disorders (CPMP/EWP/3020/03), apply. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

line  with  the  NfG  on  fixed  dose  combination  medicinal  products  (CPMP/EWP/240/95),  the  proposed clinical development was performed according to the requested indication. The FDC is proposed to be indicated  as  second  line  therapy,  when  monotherapy  with  each  component  has  not  demonstrated beneficial effects on lipid parameters.

Formal scientific advice concerning quality, preclinical and clinical development on the development of Pravafenix was requested from the CHMP in August 2007. An oral explanation was held in front of the Scientific  Advice  Working  group  on  October  2007.  Questions  on  clinical  development  were  mainly related to the mechanism of action of both active substances, the pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies to be performed for the development of a fixed dose combination (including food effect and specific population such as elderly, and patients with hepatic and renal failure). The CHMP recommendations have been only partially followed.

In summary,  the conducted clinical development programme  for Pravafenix focused on the examination of the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties of the combination (eight clinical studies)  as  well  as  on  the  evaluation  of  it  efficacy  and  safety  (four  clinical  studies).  The  overall tabulated summary of the clinical studies is presented below. Results of these studies were supported by the bibliographic data for the individual compounds.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The following biopharmaceutical studies were performed during the development phase of the new fixed dose combination of fenofibrate 160 mg and pravastatin 40 mg:

The  Phase  III  clinical  development  programme  in  support  of  the  claimed  indication  in  patients  with mixed  hyperlipidaemia  included  4  main  studies  (see  table  below),  of  which  two  pivotal  studies performed in Europe:

- SMB-FEBRA-0303, performed in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia and high cardiovascular risk;
- FENOPRA-III-06-01 performed in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.

One  confirmatory  study  was  performed  in  the  United  States:  Sc-PRAVA-06-02.  The  fourth  study performed in Europe (FENOPRA-III-05-1) was mainly a 24-week open-label safety study. All phase III controlled efficacy study were performed using the final formulation.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Information  regarding  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  each  single  substance  by  the  use  of  scientific bibliographic  overview  has  been  provided.  This  is  considered  acceptable  because  the  individual pharmacokinetic profiles of fenofibrate and pravastatin are well established.

Several biopharmaceutical studies were performed with the new fixed dose combination of fenofibrate 160  mg  and  pravastatin  40  mg  (SMB-FENO-SD012,  SMB-FEPRA-SD081,  SMB-FEPRA-SD082,  SMBFEPRA-SD083, SMB-FEPRA-SD084, SMB-FENOPRAVA-SS031, SMB-FEPRA-SS071, SMB-FEPRA-SS072). Six  biopharmaceutical  studies  were  conducted  in  order  to  compare  the  new  fixed  dose  combination with the single  product  or  the  co-administration  of  the  two  reference  drug  products.  Those comparisons were performed at a single dose or at multiple doses and in fasting or fed state. The used dosage is 160 mg of fenofibrate compared to 160 mg fenofibrate of marketed form (LIPANTHYL 160 mg or LIPIDIL-TER 160 mg available on the EU market) and 40 mg pravastatin compared to 40 mg pravastatin of marketed form (PRAVASINE PROTECT, ELISOR or PRAVASINE 40 mg available on the EU market). Investigation of the potential for drug-drug interaction of the active components of Pravafenix was also conducted. Two additional bioavailability studies were also submitted for the following reasons: -SMB-FENO-SD012: The MA for a formulation of Fenofibrate 160 mg (FENOSUP, FENOGAL, CIL 160 mg - a product essentially similar to LIPANTHYL SUPRA/LIPIDIL-TER 160 mg) has been obtained in different European countries. As the composition of the former fenofibrate formulation is quite similar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to the composition of the fenofibrate 160 mg used in the fixed combination, this bioequivalence study is submitted as supportive in the present application.

- -SMB-FEPRA-SD083: A partner company performed a pharmaceutical and clinical development of the  160/40  mg  fenofibrate/pravastatin  formulation  in  the  USA.  In  order  to  bridge  the  clinical  data between the EU and the US formulation, a bioequivalence study between the two formulations has been performed.

From the review of the submitted results of these clinical trials, the CHMP concluded the following:

- Conflicting results were obtained regarding the bioequivalence (BE) of the fixed combination and the free co-administration of Lipanthyl 160 mg and Pravasine 40 mg. The pivotal single-dose study (SMBFEPRA-SS  081),  conducted  under  fed  conditions  showed  BE  of  Pravafenix  and  the  free coadministration  of  Lipanthyl  and  Pravasine.  However,  findings  of  study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  081  were  not confirmed  by  the  repeated-dose  study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  071,  also  performed  under  fed  conditions. Indeed, this study failed to  demonstrate BE with regard to fenofibrate. Lower systemic exposure to fenofibrate  (approximately  20  %)  was  observed.  Study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  0072  performed  at  steadystate  and  under  fasting  conditions  showed  noticeable  differences  between  the  biopharmaceutical performances of the fixed combination drug product (FDC) and the co-administration of Pravasine and Lipanthyl.  Lower  bioavailability  is  observed  with  the  FDC.  The  bioavailability  of  fenofibrate  and pravastatin is decreased by approximately 50% and 20 %, respectively.  Therefore, the CHMP raised a major  objection  and  requested  a  thorough  discussion  on  the  impact  of  these  findings  on  the efficacy/safety of Pravafenix in patients switched from the free co-administration of Pravasine 40 mg and Lipanthyl 160 mg to Pravafenix.

-  The  US  Pravafenix  formulation  investigated  in  one  phase  III  efficacy/safety  clinical  trial  is demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the EU formulation.
-  The  bioavailability  of  both  ingredients  of  Pravafenix  is  markedly  influenced  by  food  intake  in  a symmetrical way: Food intake noticeably enhances the bioavailability of fenofibrate. Higher AUCt (by approximately  +40  %)  and  Cmax  (approximately  +300%)  were  observed  under  fed  conditions. Conversely, systemic exposure to pravastatin is markedly decreased (by approximately -50%) by food intake.  It  is  noteworthy,  that  such  decrease  in  pravastatin  bioavailability  is  also  observed  with Pravasine.
-  The results of the examination of the potential for drug-drug interactions between pravastatin and fenofibrate are presented in a separate chapter.

In response, the impact of the decrease in systemic exposure to pravastatin was thoroughly discussed. It  is  agreed  that  the  differences  in  systemic  exposure  observed  under  fed  conditions  would  not noticeably  impact  the  efficacy  of  the  statin  component.  The  much  more  pronounced  difference  in systemic  exposure  under  fasting  conditions  for  fenofibrate  may  plausibly  impact  the  efficacy  of  the fibrate  component of the FDC, however a clear statement has been introduced in the SmPC on the inter-changeability of the FDC and free co-administration of the monocomponent drug products. The information regarding the intake of the drug with food was also strengthened in the SmPC. Thus, the CHMP considered this issue could be considered resolved. From the initially performed investigations, it would appear that the FDC does not perform similarly as the freely co-administered monocomponent drug products (Pravasin 40 mg + Lipanthyl 160 mg). Under fasting conditions, the systemic exposure to fenofibrate when administered as Pravafenix is significantly lower than that observed with Lipanthyl (50% lower). Such difference could not be considered clinically irrelevant. Nevertheless, the warnings regarding  the  possibility  to  switch  the  FDC  and  the  monocomponent  drug  products  as  well  as  the information  regarding  the  food  intake  introduced  in  the  updated  SmPC  could  be  considered  an acceptable  alternative  to  manage  the  differences  in  the  biopharmaceutical  performances  mentioned above.

## Absorption, Distribution, Elimination

A brief overview of the pharmacokinetic properties of pravastatine and fenofibrate is given below.

Hydrolysis of fenofibrate by tissue and plasma esterases to the active principal metabolite fenofibric acid appears to commence concomitantly with absorption. It was reported that unmodified fenofibrate was not detectable in the plasma of healthy volunteers. The Cmax of fenofibric acid occurs within 6 to 8 hours after fenofibrate administration and the absorption of fenofibrate is increased when administered with  food.  Steady-state  plasma  concentrations  of  fenofibric  acid  are  achieved  after  5  days  and  the agent  does  not  accumulate  over  time  with  repeated  administration.  The  apparent  volume  of distribution of fenofibric acid was 0.89 L/kg in healthy subjects. Fenofibric acid is highly bound (&gt;99%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  plasma  proteins.  Serum  protein  binding  (mainly  to  albumin)  exceeds  99%  and  is  concentrationindependent over the therapeutic dose range. Mean terminal phase elimination half-life values ranging from 19.6 to 26.6 hours have been observed following administration of single doses of fenofibrate 300 mg  to  healthy  volunteers.  The  mean  elimination  half-life  observed  after  repeated  administration  of fenofibrate  300  mg  daily  was  not  significantly  different  from  that  seen  after  single.  Fenofibrate  is metabolised  to  a  number  of  compounds  in  humans.  The  principal  excretion  pathway  for  the metabolites in humans is the urinary tract. Faecal excretion also occurs to a variable extent depending on  the  rate  of  absorption.  Approximately  60%  of  a  dose  of  radiolabelled  fenofibrate  appears  in  the urine, and 25% is excreted in the faeces.

Following  the  oral  administration,  pravastatin  is  rapidly  absorbed,  and  the  time  (t max )  to  attain  the maximum drug serum concentration  is  around  (1  hour).  The  absolute  bioavailability  averages  18% based on AUC and urinary excretion of intact pravastatin. This low systemic absolute bioavailability has been attributed to both, the incomplete absorption (34%) and the hepatic metabolism (first-pass effect with subsequent  biliary excretion), when  pravastatin  is administered  orally. Administration of pravastatin with food decreases the bioavailability of the drug by one-third. However, the food effect does not significantly affect the lipid-lowering activity of the drug. Further discussion on the effect of food  on  pravastatin  is  given  below  in  a  separate  section.  In  healthy  volunteers,  the  volume  of distribution of pravastatin is 0.5L/kg at a steady state and 0.88 L/kg during the elimination phase. The level of protein binding of pravastatin is 43 to 54%. The binding to other cellular elements of blood is negligible. The systemic elimination rate constant of pravastatin is much higher than the absorption rate  constant.  Because  of  the  rapid  elimination,  pravastatin  does  not  accumulate  in  plasma  after repeated administration. It is eliminated through both, the renal and non-renal routes, and 64% of an intravenous  dose  is  excreted  into  the  urine  and  faeces  as  intact  drug.  The  systemic  and  renal clearances are 0.810 and 0.378 L/h/kg, respectively, so that renal and non-renal routes of elimination account for 47% and 53%, respectively.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

This is a MAA for Pravafenix - one strength (160 mg fenofibrate / 40 mg pravastatin) and therefore no dose proportionality is to be evaluated.

## Special populations

No  pharmacokinetic  data  are  provided  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency  receiving  the  fixed combination or fenofibrate and pravastatin concomitantly. The SmPC for fenofibrate (Lipanthyl Micro 200) includes a specific reduction of dose depending on the rate of creatinine clearance. Taking into account the dose for fenofibrate in the FDC (160 mg) and the SmPC for fenofibrate, the Pravafenix SmPC includes a contraindication for moderate to severe renal impairment.

No  new  data  or  bibliographic  review  is  provided  regarding  patients  with  hepatic  impairment. Fenofibrate has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, but is contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease. Pravastatin increase its bioavailability in patients with hepatic disease. The SmPC  for  Pravafenix  therefore  recommends  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment including biliary cirrhosis or active liver disease including unexplained persistent elevations in liver function tests. A special warning on management of patients with hepatobiliary disorders is also included. Please refer to the discussion on clinical efficacy.

Regarding gender, the SmPC for fenofibrate states that no pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate. With respect to pravastatin, new information related to SLCO1B1  polymorphism  and  gender  has  been  published  recently,  but  the  impact  of  these  findings needs further investigations. The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied,  however;  fenofibrate  is  not  metabolised  by  enzymes  known  for  exhibiting  inter-ethnic variability. European-Americans had significantly higher plasma pravastatin AUC and Cmax values than African-Americans even when adjusted for the presence of the SLCO1B1 521C or 388G variant allele. However, this difference did not suggest clinically relevant differences based on ethnicity. Therefore, there  would  not  appear  to  be  a  requirement  to  add  any  particular  advice  in  the  Pravafenix  SmPC. Weight is not expected to have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the FDC.

Concerning the elderly, no specific investigations have been performed in this sub-group for the FDC. Recommendations regarding the use of the fixed combination are inferred from experience with the use of each component separately in the elderly patients. Pravafenix pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated in children or adolescents.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Fenofibrate  has  a  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interaction  since  it  does  not  undergo  a  significant oxidation metabolism by CYP 450 isoenzymes. Pravastatin metabolism is not mediated by the CYP450. Therefore, drug-drug interaction potential of the active ingredients of the FDC under review appears to be limited. Nevertheless, formal testing for such interaction is required. A three- arm cross-over study at steady state under fed conditions, study SMB-FENOPRA-SS31, was performed for this purpose. This was a comparative study on the bioavailability of fenofibrate and pravastatin after multiple oral doses of one formulation of fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg, one formulation of fenofibrate 160 mg and one formulation of pravastatin 40 mg in 36 healthy subjects. In total, 37 subjects were randomised and 34 completed the study.

The main pharmacokinetic findings for the study are summarized in the tables and figures below.

The findings of the study show that the systemic exposure (estimated by AUC and Cmax) to fenofibrate observed  with  Pravafenix  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  Lipanthyl  alone. Significantly higher systemic exposure to pravastatin (30-40%) is observed with the combination when compared  to  the  administration  of  pravastatine  alone.  The  specific  mechanism  for  such  interaction between fenofibrate and pravastatin remains unknown, but it is speculated that competition with or modulation of OATP1B1or P-glycoprotein may play a role. The CHMP expressed their concern regarding the design of study SMB-FENOPRA-SS31 due to the use of Pravafenix as a comparator in the third arm of the study. The differences in the biopharmaceutical performances of the formulations (Pravafenix, Lipanthyl, Pravasine) could introduce a bias in the estimation of the interaction potential. A free coadministration of Lipanthyl 160 mg and Pravasine 40 mg (instead of Prafavenix) in the comparator arm could  have  been  the  appropriate  alternative.  Furthermore,  the  conduct  of  the  study  under  fed conditions might also introduce a bias in the estimation of the drug-drug interaction potential as food intake  does  impact  noticeably  and  differently  the  bioavailability  of  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate. Systemic exposure to fenofibrate is enhanced by food-intake. Conversely, pravastatin bioavailability is noticeably reduced by food-intake. Therefore, the outcome of study SMB FEPRA-SS-031 suggest that co-administration of fenofibrate enhances moderately systemic exposure to pravastatin (30-40%). The CHMP requested further clarification on the results of this study and overall impact on the interactions between the monocomponents of this FDC. In response, further arguments and results of supportive studies SMB-FEPRA-SD081, SMB-FEPRA-SS071, SMB-FEPRA-SS072, although not significantly relevant, have been presented. Considering that the FDC and monocomponent drug products perform differently  and  are  impacted  differently  by  food  intake,  formulation  effect  and  food  effect  are confounding factors precluding any strong statement regarding the interaction potential. However, it is acknowledged  that  the  outcome  of  the  study  SMB-FENOPRAVA-SS031,  even  with  its  limitation, revealed  no  marked  potential  for  interaction  between  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate.  In  addition,  this statement was confirmed by the published literature data.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No  specific  studies  have  been  conducted  examining  pharmacokinetics  of  Pravafenix  using  human biomaterials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Pravastatin.  Pravastatin  sodium  is  a  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase inhibitor (statin), which reduces cholesterol biosynthesis by interfering with the conversion of HMG-CoA to  mevalonate,  an  early  rate-limiting  step  in  cholesterol  biosynthesis.  Pravastatin  reduces  also  the activity of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, a plasma glycoprotein responsible for the transfer of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) esters to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL in the reverse cholesterol transport pathways. It has been suggested that HMG-COA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin inhibit the production of LDL-C directly by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of VLDLcholesterol (VLDL-C), a precursor for LDL-C.

Fibrates  represent  one  of  the  older  classes  of  lipid-lowering  drugs  and  exert  effects  mainly  by activating  the  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor-alpha  (PPAR-alpha).  Through  activation  of PPAR-alpha fenofibrate increases the lipolysis and elimination of atherogenic triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein CIII.

## Primary and secondary pharmacology

No pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with the fenofibrate/pravastatin FDC itself since the properties of the individual compounds are not expected to be different from those observed when both components are given together as a free combination. The individual pharmacodynamic profiles for fenofibrate and pravastatin are well established. The discussion of the pharmacodynamics of both active substances is based on the literature overview.

The pharmacodynamics properties of each component support the interest of combining pravastatin with  fenofibrate.  The  mechanisms  of  action  of  both  drugs  are  expected  to  be,  at  least  partly, complementary. With the FDC, beneficial effects on the 3 biological defects of mixed dyslipidaemia, i.e. increased LDL-C and TG and decreased HDL-C, can be anticipated. Thus, this combination is from a theoretical  point  of  view  of  clinical  interest,  since  an  additional  effect  on  lipid  parameters  could  be expected. Nevertheless, the CHMP noted that such combination using in particular fenofibrate must be devoid  of  potentially  deleterious  interactions  that  could  have  an  impact  on  the  efficacy  and  safety profile  of  the  product.  Fenofibrate  has  a  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interaction  since  it  does  not undergo  a  significant  metabolism  by  cytochrome  P450.  In  addition,  pravastatin  metabolism  is  not mediated by CYP450. Therefore, drug-drug interaction potential of the active ingredients of the FDC under review appears to be limited. A complete pharmacokinetic programme was submitted for this FDC  marketing  authorisation application. For further details please refer to the sections on Pharmacokinetics and Clinical efficacy and safety.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  individual  pharmacokinetics  for  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  are  well  established  and  no  further investigations are considered necessary. Single strength is claimed for Pravafenix (160  mg fenofibrate/40 mg pravastatin). There is a significant reduction in pravastatin pharmacokinetics with food and a significant increase in fenofibrate pharmacokinetics with food. The FDC is recommended to be taken with food because the bioavailability of fenofibrate is increased when administered with food. Although the bioavailability of pravastatin is reduced when taken with food, the lipid-lowering efficacy is not altered, as documented in the published literature. Indeed, the harmonised SmPC of pravastatin allows  administration  with  or  without  food.  Recommendations  regarding  the  use  of  the  fixed combination in  special  population  are  derived  from  the  experience  with  the  use  of  each  component separately. Dose adjustment is not necessary in the elderly patients for the actives substances of the FDC,  but  recommendations  before  the  initiation  of  therapy  are  provided  in  the  Pravafenix  SmPC. Review of the potential new interactions has not been conducted but the already identified interactions mentioned in the SmPCs of pravastatin and fenofibrate are adequately reflected in the SmPC of the FDC. In summary, it can be concluded that the clinical pharmacology of the FDC has been sufficiently documented, and the questions related to the bioequivalence studies have been clarified.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The  individual  pharmacokinetics  for  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  are  well  established  and  no  further comments are necessary. Single strength is claimed for the FDC, Pravafenix (160 mg fenofibrate/40 mg pravastatin). The individual pharmacodynamics for fenofibrate and pravastatin are well established. The  mechanisms  of  action  of  both  drugs  are  expected  to  be,  at  least  partly,  complementary.  The discussion of the clinical pharmacology of both active substances is based on the results of a literature search.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response study(ies)

No dose response study has been performed and this is justified since the efficacy for both substances have been well characterised for numerous years.

## Rational for the choice of pravastatin and fenofibrate dosage

Pravafenix  is  developed  as  an  orally-administered  fixed  combination  of  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate. Single strength combination of 40 mg pravastatin and 160 mg fenofibrate has been developed. The product  is  intended  as  a  second-line  treatment  (in  inadequately  controlled  patients)  and  thus,  the statin dose should be the maximal effective and tolerated dose. It should be also highlighted that the only studied starting and maintenance dose was 40 mg daily for cardiovascular prevention. Thus, the choice  of  a  40  mg  maximal  daily  dose  of  pravastatin  and  a  fenofibrate  (160  mg)  for  the  clinical development is justified, and a single strength for Pravafenix is acceptable.

## 2.5.2. Main study(ies)

The phase III clinical development programme in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia included 4 main studies (see table below), of which two were performed in Europe:

Study SMB-FEBRA-0303 was performed in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia and high cardiovascular risk and study FENOPRA-III-06-01 was performed in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia. One confirmatory study performed in the United States: Sc-PRAVA-06-02. The fourth study performed in Europe, FENOPRA-III-05-1, was a 24-week open-label safety study. All phase III controlled efficacy study were conducted using the final formulation.

SMB-FEPRA-0303: A  PHASE  III,  TWO-ARMED,  RANDOMISED,  DOUBLE-BLIND,  DOUBLE-DUMMY, PARALLEL STUDY TO COMPARE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY ON 12 WEEKS OF ONE COMBINATION (FENOFIBRATE/PRAVASTATIN 160-40 MG) VERSUS PRAVASTATIN 40 MG ALONE, FOLLOWED BY AN OPEN-LABELLED  SAFETY  PHASE  OF  THE  COMBINATION  ALONE,  ON  52  WEEKS,  IN  HIGH  RISK PATIENTS WITH COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA.

This  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  FDC  of  fenofibrate/pravastatin 160mg/40mg in terms of non HDL-C, LDL, TG reduction from baseline and of HDL-C increase.

FENOPRA-III-06-01: A PHASE III, FOUR-ARMED, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND, PARALLEL STUDY TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS WITH COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA  OF  A  12-WEEK  ADMINISTRATION  OF  FENOFIBRATE  160MG/PRAVASTATIN  40MG COMBINATION  VERSUS  SIMVASTATIN  20MG  IN  PATIENTS  WITHOUT  CARDIOVASCULAR  DISEASE (CVD)  (GROUP  1)  AND  OF  FENOFIBRATE  160  MG/PRAVASTATIN  40MG  COMBINATION+EZETIMIBE 10MG  VERSUS  SIMVASTATIN  20MG+EZETIMIBE  10MG  IN  PATIENTS  WITH  CVD  (GROUP  2), FOLLOWED BY A 12-WEEK SAFETY PHASE OF FENOFIBRATE 160MG/PRAVASTATIN 40MG COMBINATION IN GROUP 1 AND FENOFIBRATE 160MG/PRAVASTATIN 40MG COMBINATION+EZETIMIBE 10MG IN GROUP 2.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy in type II diabetes patients with mixed dyslipidaemia of Pravafenix 160/40mg FDC versus simvastatin 20mg in patients without cardiovascular disease (CVD) (stratum 1) and Pravafenix 160mg/40mg FDC + ezetimibe 10mg versus simvastatin 20mg + ezetimibe 10mg in patients with CVD (startum 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sc-PRAVA-06-02 :  A  MULTI-CENTER,  PROSPECTIVE,  LONGITUDINAL,  RANDOMIZED,  DOUBLE-BLIND, PHASE  III  STUDY  TO  EVALUATE  THE  EFFICACY  AND  SAFETY  OF  DAILY  ADMINISTRATION  OF PRAVASTATIN 40MG OR FENOFIBRATE 160MG OR PRAVAFEN (COMBINATION OF PRAVASTATIN AND FENOFIBRATE 40/160MG) FOR 12 WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY A 52-WEEK OPEN-LABEL SAFETY PHASE OF PRAVAFEN ALONE, IN THE TREATMENT OF COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA.

This  study  was  not  performed  in  the  target  population.  Indeed,  recruited  patients  were  not  at  high cardiovascular risk. Thus, the contribution of this study to the current application is limited.

Studies SMB-FEPRA-0303 is considered to be the main trial for this application. Thus, the majority of the clinical chapters below refer to the conduct of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 and data from other studies are quoted when and as appropriate to support the scientific discussion.

The overall summary of these studies is presented in the table below.

## Methods

## Study Participants

Patients enrolled in study SMB-FEPRA-0303 were: i) male and female, aged 18 years or older, ii) high cardiovascular  risk  patients  as  defined  by  the  NCEP  ATP  III  with  documented  mixed  dyslipidaemia (multiple  risk  factors  that  confer  a  10-year  risk  for  CHD  &gt;  20%  (calculated  according  to  the Framingham tables) or coronary heart disease (CHD) or other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease or diabetes.

Inclusion lipid parameters: patients with LDL-C &gt; 100mg/dL AND 150 &lt; TG&gt;400mg/dL at the end of the selection period under pravastatin 40 mg/day.

Main exclusion criteria were: Secondary or iatrogenic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia type I-IIa-IV-V, TG &gt;  400  mg/dl,  abnormal  liver  function  (hepatocellular  insufficiency,  chronic  or  active  liver  disease, sustained  elevation  of  serum  liver  enzymes  &gt;  2  x  UNL),  CPK  &gt;  3  x  UNL,  abnormal  renal  function (clearance  of  creatinine  &lt;  50  ml/mn)  or  any  renal  disease  likely  to  lead  to  renal  dysfunctions, uncontrolled  primary hypothyroidism, acute cardiovascular episode within the 6 months prior to the start of the trial, uncontrolled hypertension, and other criteria.

This study comprised of the following periods:

Selection period : 8 weeks during which the patients were stabilised on PRAVASINE 40 mg/day. Efficacy  phase :  12  weeks  during  which  the  patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  two  possible treatments (fenofibrate/pravastatin 160-40 mg or pravastatin 40 mg). Patients were randomised either to  fenofibrate/pravastatin  160/40mg  per day or pravastatin 40mg per day from the first day of the efficacy phase (from V1 to V4 - 12 weeks).

## Objectives

Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 was designed to demonstrate the superior efficacy of fenofibrate 160 mg and pravastatin  40  mg  FDC  (Pravafenix)  compared  with  Pravastatin  40  mg  monotherapy  in  high cardiovascular risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia, as measured by the mean percent change in nonHDL-C  at  the  end  of  the  12-week  efficacy  period.    In  addition,  the  study  design  allowed  for  a comparison  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  fenofibrate  160  mg  and  pravastatin  40  mg  FDC  with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy. The CHMP acknowledged that the objectives of this clinical study are deemed  appropriate  to  show  the  superiority  of  Pravafenix  over  pravastatin  in  the  claimed  target indication.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary and secondary endpoints of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 can be summarised as follows. Primary  endpoint: Mean  percent  changes  in  plasma  non-HDL  cholesterol  levels  at  the  end  of  the efficacy period compared to the baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary endpoints:

-  Percentage  of  patients  who  achieve  the  therapeutic  goals  concerning  the  non-HDL  and  LDL levels, as defined in the NCEP ATP III
-  Evolution of the LDL levels
-  Evolution of Apo A, Apo B levels
-  Evolution of the following other lipidemic parameters levels: HDL, TG, total cholesterol
-  Evolution of C Reactive Protein (CRP) values
-  Differences in estimated cardiovascular risk for myocardial infarction (PROCAM risk calculator)
-  Evolution of Fibrinogen values

## Sample size

Sample  size  calculation  was  done  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  combination fenofibrate/pravastatin  160/40  mg vs pravastatin  40  mg  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy endpoint. As reference data on non-HDL (LDL + VLDL) cholesterol levels were not available, the worst case was adopted by taking the hypotheses based on the LDL cholesterol levels for the effect of the combination fenofibrate/pravastatin. A difference between treatment groups in mean percent changes in  plasma  LDL  cholesterol level  between  baseline  (after  8  weeks  under  pravastatin  40  mg/day)  and visit V4 (W12) of 6% is considered as clinically meaningful difference. A sample size of 140 patients (70  per  treatment  group)  allowed  for  a  statistical  power  of  at  least  90%  for  the  detection  of  a difference  = 6% between treatment groups in mean percent changes (group 1: µ1 = - 20%, group 2: µ2 = - 26%), considering a standard deviation of 20 mg/dl and using a one-tailed test on the  = 5% significance  level.  Statistical  power  obtained  for  N  =  140  patients  from  calculation  based  on  LDL cholesterol  level  was  a  fortiori  sufficient  considering  the  non-HDL  cholesterol  level  according  to  the previous argument. A calculation of the power a posteriori based on the ApoB parameter was made to confirm this argument. In addition, allowing for a drop-out rate of about 40% of patients before the end of the total safety period (64 weeks), a total of 240 patients were required to be randomised in this trial.

## Randomisation and Blinding (masking)

The  list  of  randomisation  was  issued  using  computer  software.  Treatments  and  the  corresponding decoding envelopes were prepared according to this list.  Treatments  were  randomised  before  being packaged and were assigned by chronological order to the centres. The investigators dispensed the study treatments to patients according to the treatment numbers received at their centre.

Patients  received  a  capsule  of  placebo  of  identical  properties  as  the  active  drug  at  the  same  time (double placebo). Thus, patients took 2 capsules at each evening meal. In order to maintain the blind during  the  treatment  period  for  each  patient,  lipid  parameters  obtained  from  blood  samples  from baseline  to  final  visit  were  kept  in  blinded  condition  until  the  database  was  closed.  Neither  the investigator nor the sponsor of the study was informed during the study. The blinded conditions and the  randomisation  technique  are  considered  appropriate.  Lipid  parameters  were  also  measured  at randomisation in a blinded manner.

## Statistical methods

For  the  assessment  of  the  mean  percent  change vs baseline  for  the  lipid  parameters,  two  different statistical methods were used: i) a mean change calculated and ii) a Least Squares Mean (LS Mean) derived  from  the  ANCOVA  test.  Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population,  which  consisted  of  all  randomised patients  who  had  at  least  one  on-therapy  data  value  for  efficacy  parameters,  was  used  for  efficacy analyses.  Per  Protocol  (PP)  population  was  also  used.  A  two-sided  statistical  test  with  alpha  =5% significance level was used for primary efficacy endpoint. All other statistical tests were two-tailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05. The CHMP considered that the performed statistical analyses are appropriate. It is adequate to report changes in lipids as mean percentage change from baseline.

## Results

## Participant flow

Overall,  480  patients  were  screened  based  on  established  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  in  study SMB-FEPRA-0303. At baseline (Week 0), 248 patients ( safety population) were randomised into one of both  treatment  groups  of  the  efficacy  phase,  i.e.  fixed  dose  combination  fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40  mg  or  reference  (pravastatin  40  mg).  At  the  end  of  the efficacy phase  (Week  12),  all  the

patients  took  fenofibrate/pravastatin  160-40  mg  (patients  who  completed  reference  treatment  were switched to fenofibrate/pravastatin 160-40 mg). The overview of participant flow is given in the table below.

## Recruitment

Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 was conducted in 41 active centers: 26 in France, 10 in Poland and 5 in Belgium from 23 October 2003 (first inclusion) to 27 September 2006 (last follow-up visit).

## Conduct of the study

The first amendment of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 protocol dated August 26, 2003 was approved before the first inclusion of the first patient. This change referred to assuring consistency regarding the date of the first ECG (to be performed at V1 and not at VS). In France, 3 other amendments were written in order to compensate the insufficient recruitment of patients: Amendment No. 2 dated June 14, 2004: update of the investigators participating in the study, new prospective investigators and extension of the  inclusion  period.  Amendment  No.  3  dated  August  23,  2004:  update  of  the  investigators participating in the study. Amendment No. 4 dated January 3, 2005: extension of the inclusion period. In Poland, Amendment No. 2 dated March 19, 2004 concerned the update of contact details for safety reporting.  No  other  amendment  was  required  in  Belgium.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  protocol amendments do not appear to have any influence on the validity of the study data and the provided analysis.

The CHMP noted that the elderly (&gt; 65 years old) represented 26.78% of the included compared to 73.22% for patients &lt; 65 years old). Overall, only 36 patients older than 65 years have been treated with the FDC. No patient older than 75 years has been treated with the FDC. Otherwise, there was no major imbalance between the treatment groups.

## Other lipid parameters

Levels of TC, apoB, apoB/apoA1, fibrinogen and hsCRP were significantly influenced by the Pravafenix therapy compared to pravastatin monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP assessed the above described results in the following manner:

LDL-C. After 12 weeks of treatment with Pravafenix, a significant (p &lt; 0.001) decrease of 6% in LDL-C levels  in  comparison  with  baseline  was  observed  in  pravastatin  treated  patients;  this  decrease  may indicate that patients were probably not pravastatin failures at the time of randomisation. Results were not significant after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment and became significant after 12 weeks of treatment.

HDL-C. The addition of fenofibrate 160mg to pravastatin 40mg resulted in an increase of HDL-C level of  +  6.5%  in  the  FDC  group  compared  to  +2%  in  the  pravastatin  group.  This  is  not  surprising  as pravastatin is not intended to increase HDL-C. The difference between the 2 groups of treatment is significant.

TG. The addition of fenofibrate 160mg to pravastatin 40mg resulted in a reduction of TG of -30% to a clinically relevant extent that was more pronounced after 4 weeks of treatment than after 12 weeks of treatment. In the pravastatin group, the decrease from baseline was only significant after 4 weeks of treatment (-7.6%). As expected, the difference between groups is statistically significant in favour of the FDC.

Apo  A1.  An  increase  in  ApoA1  is  observed  in  each  treatment  group  after  12  weeks.  However,  the difference between groups is not statistically different but is in favour of the FDC (p=0.058).

## Ancillary analyses

The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  post  hoc  pooled  analysis  of  SMB-FEPRA-0303  and  Sc-PRAVA-06-02 studies  (that  used  the  same  comparator  pravastatin  40  mg)  derived  from  Integrated  Summary  of Efficacy  (ISE)  performed  for  the  U.S  submission  have  been  provided.  The  overall  recipient  is  707 patients out of the short term efficacy dataset (n=996, 71%). Subgroup analyses from pooled analyses were performed to look for possible differences in treatment effect across groups.

The following subgroups were analysed:

- -Age group (&lt;65, ≥ 65 and ≤ 75, and &gt; 75 years);
- -Gender (male and female);
- -Race (Black and non-Black);
- -Baseline TG category (&lt;200 mg/dL; ≥ 200 to &lt; 400 mg/dL; and ≥ 400 mg/dL); and
- -Baseline LDL-C category ( ≥ 100 a &lt;130 mg/dL; ≥ 130 to &lt;160 mg/dL, and ≥ 160 mg/dL);
- -Baseline LDL-C and TG category.

Nevertheless, no significantly relevant information is obtained from these groups analysis.

|                      | The safety profile evaluated with respect to the incidence of AEs and laboratory values was acceptable for all treatment groups during any analysis phase. During the 12-week efficacy phase, the incidence of AEs was similar in the Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg group (36.6%) compared to the PRAVASINE 40 mg group (32.0%). Twenty-five patients (10,1%) had AEs related to the study treatment: 13 patients with Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg and 12 patients with PRAVASINE 40 mg. Headache and muscle spasms were the most frequent drug- related AEs. The proportion of patients presenting an abnormal laboratory value at least once during the efficacy phase was significantly greater in the Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg group than in the PRAVASINE 40 mg group for creatinine (p = 0.013), creatinine clearance (p = 0.044) and ASAT (p = 0.047). No patient had an elevation of ASAT and/or ALAT > 3 UNL. Two patients in the PRAVASINE 40 mg group had an elevation of CPK > 3 UNL. Eleven patients (4.0%) were withdrawn from the study during the efficacy phase because of an AE (6 and 5 patients in the Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg and PRAVASINE 40 mg group respectively). Seven patients (2.8%) experienced SAEs: 5 patients (5 SAEs) in the Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg group and 2 patients (3 SAEs) in the PRAVASINE 40 mg group. Only 1 SAE (muscle pain) was considered as possibly related to Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg and led to discontinuation. In the follow-up report, the investigator modified the diagnosis from \"muscle pain\" to 'rheumatic polymyalgia' and declared that the symptoms were probably not related to the study drug. During the 52-week safety phase, 274 AEs have been reported, of which 33 (12.0%) were related to Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg. Back pain and hypertension were the most frequent AEs. Transaminase increased, abdominal upper pain and nausea were the most frequent AEs related to the combination. Three patients had an elevation of ASAT and/or ALAT > 3 UNL. Three patients had an elevation of CPK > 3 UNL. Twelve patients (5.4%) experienced 19 SAEs. None of them were related to the study drug (Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg). Five patients (2.2%) were withdrawn from the study because of an AE. Neither myopathy nor rhabdomyolysis were reported during the study. No death was reported during the study. No clinically relevant differences in the laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination and ECG parameters were found between treatments during this study.

|                      | The combination Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg in high risk patients with combined hyperlipidemia resulted in additional improvements in lipoprotein profile compared with PRAVASINE 40 mg monotherapy. The Fenofibrate/Pravastatin combination (160-40 mg per day) was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to PRAVASINE alone (40 mg per day). One year treatment with Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg did not raise any significant concern about the safety of the combination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Data were pooled from studies SMB-FEPRA-0303 and Sc-PRAVA-06-02. Baseline was defined as the last fasting measurement prior to the first dose of randomized study drug for Sc-PRAVA-06-02 and as the average of the 2 measurements prior to the first dose of randomized study medication for SMB-FEPRA-0303.  Endpoint was defined as the last fasting measurement during the double-blind treatment period.

*p-value was obtained from the ANCOVA model with treatment and study as factors and baseline as a covariate for lipid parameters.

**p-value was obtained from Pearson's chi-square test for the percentage of patients achieving the goal.

The submitted results of the pooled analysis of the efficacy data from the double blind cohort SMBFEPRA-0303 and Sc-PRAVA-06-02 studies are in line with those previously obtained in the individual studies. No significant information is derived from this analysis.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No clinical studies in special populations were provided. Instead of, the applicant performed a post hoc pooled sensitivity analysis of SMB-FEPRA-0303 and Sc-PRAVA-06-02 during double-blind phases (that used the same comparator pravastatin 40mg). Subgroup analyses were performed to look for possible differences in treatment effect across groups. Analysis according to age and gender were performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comparison of efficacy results in function of age: Pooled analyses have been performed on three subpopulations according to the age of patients i.e. &lt; 65 years, 65 to 75 years and &gt; 75 years. There are only 6 patients &gt;75 years of age distributed among the 3 treatment groups in the double-blind cohort. As  a  consequence,  the  small  size  of  this  subgroup  precludes  meaningful  interpretation  of  their  lipid efficacy  data  and  invalidates  comparison  with  the  other  age  subgroups.  Therefore  no  summary  is presented  for  this  category  of  age.  The  efficacy  results  are  presented  in  table  below  as  mean percentage changes from baseline to week 12.

In total, 576 patients (81.5%) were younger than 65 years old, 125 patients (17.7%) were between 65 and 75 years old and only 6 patients (0.8%) were older than 75 years old. The magnitude of the mean percent changes in non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG appeared to be slightly greater in the ≥ 65 to ≤ 75 years of age subgroup than in the &lt;65 years of age subgroup for each treatment group and in the Pravafenix  arm.  For  HDL-C,  the  mean  change  is  similar  between  the  2  subgroups  of  treatments. However,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  limitation  of  such  post-hoc  pooled  analyses,  particularly  in terms of the power, since the number of patients in each subgroup is very limited.

Comparison of efficacy results in function of gender: The study populations were adequately balanced for gender: 386 patients (54.6%) were male and 321 patients (45.4%) were female. Overall, the mean percent  change  in  non-HDL-C  versus  baseline  observed  with  Pravafenix  is  similar  in  men  (-9.3  + 19.1%) and in women (-10.7 + 25.4%). The magnitude and direction of the mean percent changes in TG were also similar for male (-20.8 + 37.19) and female (-18.7 + 51.69) patients in the Pravafenix 160/40 mg treatment group. However, the magnitude of the mean percent changes in LDL-C (-7.9% vs  -3.2%,  respectively)  and  HDL-C  (4.2%  vs  1.5%,  respectively)  appeared  to  be  greater  in  female than male patients in the Pravafenix 160/40 mg treatment group.

## Supportive study(ies)

Sc-PRAVA-06-02: Multi-center, prospective, longitudinal, randomized, double-blind, phase III Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily administration of Pravastatin 40mg or fenofibrate 160mg or Pravafen (the combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate 40/160mg) for 12 weeks, followed by a 52week open-label  safety  phase  of  Pravafen  alone,  in  the  treatment  of  combined  hyperlipidemia.  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of administering either Pravastatin 40mg or Fenofibrate 160mg or Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160mg) daily for 12 weeks,  followed  by  a  Pravafen  open-label  52-week  safety  follow-up,  in  the  treatment  of  combined hyperlipidemia. The secondary objective was a safety comparison over 12 weeks and long-term safety assessment over 52 weeks.

The results of the Efficacy Phase of the present study confirm the findings of these studies describing the synergistic therapeutic benefits of specific statin-fibrate combinations: Non-HDL cholesterol is more effectively reduced by combination Pravafen (-7.0%) than either monotherapy pravastatin (+2.8%) or monotherapy fenofibrate (+10.4%). LDL Cholesterol is reduced by combination therapy with Pravafen (-1.1%) and increased with monotherapy pravastatin (+3.8%) and fenofibrate (19.0%). Triglycerides are more effectively reduced by Pravafen (-19.5%) than either monotherapy pravastatin (+12.8%) or monotherapy fenofibrate (-13.4%).

FENOPRA-III-05-01: This was a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety of Pravafenix 160/40mg administered once daily for 24 weeks in high cardiovascular risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia. More extensive information regarding design, population, outcomes and statistical analysis are provided in the different sections of this report. The primary efficacy parameter was the mean percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline (recorded at the baseline laboratory exam) to Week 24/end  of  study.  Secondary  efficacy  parameters  included  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24/end  of study  in  LDL-C,  HDL-C,  TG,  TC,  Apo  A 1 ,  Apo  B,  Apo  B/Apo  A 1 ,  hsCRP,  and  fibrinogen  values.  The results  are  in  line  with  those  obtained  in  the  main  studies.  Safety  data  from  this  study  have  been included in the safety database for Pravafenix.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

During the first part of the scientific evaluation of the Pravafenix MAA the CHMP considered that the submitted data were not sully supportive to sustain the benefit of this FDC. Despite biological effects observed in the submitted clinical studies, the benefit of Pravafenix assessed on lipid parameters and responder's rate was uncertain. Considering the expected pattern for respective classes of these drugs, results have shown a more potent effect of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C while pravastatin is superior in  reducing  total  cholesterol  and  LDL-C.  In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  mainly showed a decrease in TG with an incremental increase in HDL-C and in some cases further reduction on total cholesterol and LDL-C. If significant, results on LDL-C are very limited.

In  that  context,  publication  of  ACCORD  (Action  to  Control  Cardiovascular  Risk  in  Diabetes)  study results of in March 2010, which studied long term efficacy and safety use of a combination of a statin (simvastatin) and fenofibrate on cardiovascular endpoints, was considered essential to resolve some of these  issues.  Results  of  the  ACCORD  study  were  also  believed  to  be  useful  when  considering  the limited database presented for Pravafenix. Therefore, the CHMP requested an analysis of the results of ACCORD  study  in  order  to  help  solve  the  major  issues  raised  for  the  Pravafenix  dossier  before  a definite assessment of the benefit risk of this new fixed dose combination can be made.

Thus, the following considerations have been evaluated during the assessment:

-  Review of the overall results of ACCORD study focusing on the effects of the addition of fenofibrate in patients inadequately controlled by simvastatin monotherapy as studied in this trial.
-  Analysis of the subgroup of patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (TG&gt;204 mg/dL and HDL&lt;34 mg/dL,  potentially  benefiting  from  a  statin/fenofibrate  combination  according  to  results  of  the ACCORD  study.  Additional  new  subgroup  analysis  of  patients  with  atherogenic  dyslipidemia  in study SMB-FEPRA-0303 and from data published in the literature.
-  Justification  of  the  claimed  of  equipotency  between  statins  (other  statins  doses  equivalent  to pravastatin 40 mg).

## Effect on lipid parameters

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Expected results observed in the initial clinical dossier of Pravafenix have shown a more potent effect of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C, while pravastatin is superior in reducing total cholesterol and LDL-C.

In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  mainly  showed  a  decrease  in  TG  with  an incremental increase in HDL-C and in some cases further reduction on total cholesterol and LDL-C.

These results are in line with results obtained in the ACCORD study, in a selected population of type 2 diabetic patients. In this subgroup, biological effects of the addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin are better  compared  to  other  included  patients.  However,  despite  biological  effects  observed  in  the submitted clinical studies, the benefit of Pravafenix assessed on lipid parameters, especially on LDL-C, and responder's rate is somewhat limited.

## Additional subgroup post hoc analyses from the study SMB-FEPRA-0303.

To further sustain efficacy results of Pravafenix in the originally claimed indication, two additional post hoc  analyses  from  clinical  study  SMB-FEPRA-0303  were  provided.  The  aim  of  both  analysis  was  to compare the effects of Pravafenix on lipid parameters, using the same definitions of lipid abnormalities as  in  the  ACCORD  study:  i)  in  patients  with  only  low  baseline  HDL-C  (&lt;40mg/dL  for  men  and &lt;50mg/dL  for  women);  ii)  and  in  patients  with  both  TG  value  &gt;200mg/dL  and  low  HDL  value (&lt;40mg/dL for men and &lt;50mg/dL for women) at baseline.

From the provided analysis, it was shown that the effect of Pravafenix versus pravastatin on non HDLC and LDL-C appears to be more pronounced in patients with low HDL at baseline than in patients with normal HDL-values. Furthermore, this effect also appears more pronounced in patients with high TG and low HDL at baseline as defined above. However, these subgroups only concern a small number of patients, i.e. 70 patients (29.3%) with only low HDL-C at baseline and 49 patients (25.7%) who met criteria for TG and HDL, and are thus limited to represent the general population. In addition, from a methodological point  of  view,  as  usual  post-hoc  analyses  must  be  taken  with  cautious.  Overall,  the strength of evidence is limited, due to small number of patients to support an indication of Pravafenix in all dyslipidemic patients. Therefore, positive biological effect on  the pravastatin/fenofibrate combination,  sustained  by  sufficient  data,  could  be  endorsed  only  in  patients  with  high  TG  and  low HDL-C.  Lastly,  post-analyses  only  showed  effects  on  lipid  parameters  but  not  on  CV  morbidity  or mortality due to the limited duration of studies. This was considered an importance issue as patients with dyslipidaemia, i.e. mainly diabetics should be long term treated.

In  order  to  identify  which  population  could  benefit  from  a  simvastatin/fenofibrate  combination  in reducing cardiovascular events in the ACCORD study and whether these results can be extrapolated to Pravafenix, the following has been taken into account:

## Main results of the ACCORD study

In this study, 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age : 62.3 years; 30.7% women), who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease (36.5% with prior CV events) received either fenofibrate (160 mg or equivalent dose) or matching placebo in addition to open label simvastatin 20 to 40mg. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of non fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was five years until death or the final visit that took  place  in  early  2009.  Eight  percent  reduction  in  the  primary  endpoint  with  combination  of pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  (p=0.32).  The  combination  of fenofibrate and simvastatin in diabetic patients inadequately controlled by simvastatin alone did not reduce  the  rate  of  fatal  cardiovascular  events,  non  fatal  MI,  or  nonfatal  stroke;  as  compared  to simvastatin  alone.  According  to  the  authors  themselves,  these  results  do  not  support  the  use  of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of high risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the long term benefit on cardiovascular events of the addition of fenofibrate to patients inadequately controlled by a statin (simvastatin) monotherapy is not established  on  the  basis  of  the  ACCORD  study  in  the  overall  type  2  diabetic  patients  presenting dyslipidaemia.

However, a specific sub-groups analysis identified a specific population, i.e. patients with hyperlipidaemia defined by high TG levels &gt;204 mg/dL and low HDH values &lt;34 mg/dL, where benefit on lipid parameters, but also on cardiovascular events, was observed contrary to the overall population. Results on the primary outcome rate were 12.4% in the fenofibrate/simvastatin group versus 7.3% in the simvastatin monotherapy group whereas such rates were 10.1% in both study groups for all other patients.

## Certainties and uncertainties of the ACCORD study and possibility of extrapolation of the results of the this study to Pravafenix

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ACCORD population: Patients included in the ACCORD study were exclusively diabetics, of which the majority did not present mixed dyslipidaemia. Less than 20% of patients had simultaneous high TG and low HDL-C levels. Indeed, no minimal TG value was specified; the mean baseline TG level was 162mg/dL. In addition, almost 40% of the patients included in the study were not receiving statin at baseline  prior  to  enrolment.  Thus,  the  ACCORD  study  population  was  quite  different  from  the population that was studied in the Pravafenix clinical development programme.

Clinical efficacy: Regardless of whether efficacy on lipid parameters is demonstrated in this study in the overall population, as previously stated, it appears evident that ACCORD results on hard endpoints do not support the routine use of the combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin in reducing cardiovascular events in overall high risk patients with type 2 diabetes presenting dyslipidaemia. In addition,  a  pre-specified  subgroup  analysis  based  on  gender  identified  a  statistically  significant treatment-by-gender interaction (p = 0.01). The increased risk for major cardiovascular events (9%) for fenofibrate/simvastatin combination compared to 6% for simvastatin alone for women evaluated in this  study  is  of  concern.  Moreover,  results  on  the  composite  secondary  endpoint,  major  coronary disease event, non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, also showed a tendency to be increased, although not significantly. In that context, uncertainties remain about whether the overall beneficial effect is robust enough  to support an indication of a statin/fenofibrate combination in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia (defined by high TG and low HDL levels) and high CV risk, inadequately controlled by a statin monotherapy, based only on data from the ACCORD publication. This concern could also apply to the  current  Pravafenix  dossier  where,  in  addition  to  the  effects  on  lipid  parameters,  effects  on cardiovascular endpoints in long term use are not entirely demonstrated.

This  concern  has  been  extensively  discussed  during  the  benefit/risks  reassessment  on  fibrates (including fenofibrate) through Art 31 referral procedure.

Overall, the CHMP concluded that Pravafenix would be a beneficial treatment options for a substantial portion of patients at high CV risk, particular those with elevated TG and low HDL-C despite a 40mg pravastatin  therapy.  The  outcome  of  this  referral  evaluation  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  Pravafenix assessment.

## Equipotency of statins

Regarding the original claim on statin equipotency, the CHMP was of the opinion that the presented data  do  not  support  the  use  of  Pravafenix  following  any  type  of  statin;  only  an  indication  following optimal dose of pravastatin could be accepted. This is mainly due to the lower potency of pravastatin as  compared  to  the  more  frequently  used  statins  (i.e.  simvastatin,  atorvastatin  and  rosuvastatin). Moreover, as individual response is not the same as population level response, in real practice there is no reason for switching patients controlled by one statin to Pravafenix.

Moreover, several previously conducted clinical trials have shown that the efficacy of statins is dosedependent.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  in  ACCORD  trial,  simvastatin  might  not  have  used  at  the  most effective dose and the results with an addition of fenofibrate to a full simvastatin dose are therefore unknown. It remains questionable whether the results of ACCORD study in this aspect are transferable to  Pravafenix  and  only  the  second  line  indication  limited  to  the  use  of  pravastatin  40mg  can  be approvable.

The applicant requested an Oral Explanation for the discussion of the indication and the equipotency of statins,  however  in  line  with  the  above  arguments,  clinical  results  and  the  outcome  of  Article  31 referral on fibrates concluded during the assessment of Pravafenix, the following indication has been considered approvable by the CHMP:

'Pravafenix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  high  CHD-risk  adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia characterised by high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol levels whose LDL-C levels are adequately controlled while on a treatment with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.'

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

An Oral Explanation on the discussion of the indication of Pravafenix and the equipotency of statins was conducted, however, in line with the above arguments, clinical results and the outcome of Article 31 referral on fibrates finalised during the assessment of Pravafenix, the following indication has been considered approvable by the CHMP:

'Pravafenix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  high  CHD-risk  adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia characterised by high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol levels whose LDL-C levels are adequately controlled while on a treatment with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Clinical safety

Safety  data  were  derived  from  four  phase  III  clinical  trials.  Three  of  them  were  double-blind randomised studies.

Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 compared the efficacy on 12 weeks of fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC, versus  pravastatin  40  mg  in  high  CHD  risk  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia  (n=248  patients included in the safety analysis). After this 12-week efficacy phase, all patients received FDC during an open safety phase of 52 additional weeks (n=224 patients included in the safety analysis).

Study FENOPRA-III-06-1 compared the efficacy on 12 weeks of FDC versus simvastatin 20 mg (with or without open-label administration of ezetimibe) in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, at  high  CHD  risk  (n=291  patients  included  in  the  safety  analysis)  or  very  high  CHD  risk  (n=272 patients included in the safety analysis ). After this 12-week efficacy phase, all patients received FDC with or without ezetimibe during an open safety phase of 12 additional weeks (n=537 patients included in the safety analysis, of which 281 were in the high CHD risk and 256 in the very high CHD risk).

Study Sc-PRAVA-06-02 compared the efficacy of 12 week treatment with FDC versus pravastatin 40 mg versus fenofibrate 160 mg in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia (n=563 patients included in the safety  analysis;  240  patients  in  FDC,  113  in  pravastatin,  122  in  fenofibrate).  After  this  12  week efficacy phase, all patients received FDC during an open safety phase of 52 additional weeks (n=386).

FENOPRA-III-05-1 was an open label study and focused on safety aspect of FDC in high or very high CHD risk  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia  treated  for  24  weeks  (n=342  patients  included  in  the safety analysis).

## Patient exposure

Patients  analysed  in  the  pooled  analysis  are  patients  from  the  safety  populations  of  each  of  the individual studies; i.e. randomised patients who took at least one dose of the study drug. Data from these patients were pooled in two different analysis cohorts:

- -The  \"double-blind  cohort'  including  all  patients  from  the  12-week  double-blind  phases  of studies  SMB-FEPRA-0303,  Sc-PRAVA-06-02,  FENOPRA-III-06-1  to  compare  the  extent  of safety issues for the combination versus a statin monotherapy (pravastatin 40 mg in the SMBFEPRA-0303  and  Sc-PRAVA-06-02  studies  or  simvastatin  20  mg  in  the  FENOPRA-III-06-1 study) and fenofibrate 160 mg (in the Sc-PRAVA-06-02 study).
- -The \"all studies cohort' combining the data from the 4 phase III trials: SMB-FEPRA-0303, ScPRAVA-06-02, FENOPRA-III-06-1 and FENOPRA III-05-1. This analysis was conducted over the entire study period (from week 0 until the end of the study, when patients are treated with Pravafenix  160/40  mg).  Thus,  this  database  includes  all  patients  having  taken  at  least  one dose  of  Pravafenix  at  any  time  during  any  phase  III  clinical  trial.  This  database  allows  an assessment of the long-term safety profile of Pravafenix.

The summary of patient exposure from these analyses is given in the tables below. A total of 1566 patient were exposed to at least one dose of Pravafenix, 928 patients were exposed for 24 weeks and 395 patients were exposed for 1 year. These patient exposures can be considered acceptable for safety evaluation.

** A patient can be reported once in each intensity category

No  patients  died  during  the  double-blind  period  of  the  3  phase  III  studies.  In  total,  15  (1.17%) patients  had  an  SAE  during  the  double-blind  period:  11  (1.71%)  patients  in  Pravafenix  group,  4 (0.77%) in the statin group and none in the fenofibrate group. Three patients had SAEs that were considered to be related to the study medication, all in the Pravafenix group: polymyalgia rheumatica (SMB-FEPRA-0303),  abdominal  pain  and  cholecystectomy  (Sc-PRAVA-06-02)  and  gastrointestinal haemorrhage and anaemia (FENOPRA-III-06-1).

Discontinuation: In total, 53 (4.12%) patients discontinued the study during the double-blind period due to an AE. The Pravafenix group (33 patients, 5.12%) had a higher percentage of patients who discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  an  adverse  event  compared  to  the  statin  group  (14  patients, 2.70%).  Nineteen  patients  (2.95%)  in  the  Pravafenix  and  9  patients  (1.73%)  in  the  statin  group discontinued the study due to a drug-related AE.

Most frequent AEs: The numbers of patients with for the most frequent TEAEs by system organ class, preferred  term  (  1% in any treatment group) and related to the treatment are summarised in the following  tables.  Overall,  the  most  common  TEAEs  experienced  by  patients  occurred  in  the  system organ classes of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations and investigations. The most frequent AEs observed with Pravafenix were arthralgia, nausea and cough. In the statin group, the most common adverse events were diarrhoea, headache and  back  pain;  and  in  the  fenofibrate  group,  these  were  nasopharyngitis,  pain  in  extremity  and headache. The incidence of those adverse events was generally low and no significant difference in frequency was observed between the fixed dose combination group and the monotherapies. No new adverse events were identified for any of the treatments.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Deaths

Fatal outcome was reported in 3 patients, of which two were in the FDC group (Sc PRAVA 06-02 and FENOPRA  III-05-1)  and  one  in  simvastatin+ezetimibe  group  (FENOPRA  III-06-1).  All  patients  have been diagnosed with a cancer and died after study discontinuation. The cause of death was related to cancer in two cases and to acute coronary syndrome in one case.

## Serious adverse events other than death

Efficacy phase: Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in statins (0.8%) and FDC (1.7%) groups. No SAE was reported in fenofibrate group. Only some SAEs were considered related to the treatment and were reported in the FDC group: polymyalgia rheumatica, abdominal pain and cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage with subsequent anaemia.

Safety  phase:  More  patients  experienced  SAEs  during  the  safety  phase  when  compared  with  the efficacy phase (3.6% vs 1.7%), of which none was related to the treatment.

Observed SAEs were mostly related to cardiac events (myocardial infarction, coronary arterial disease, arrhythmia, cardiac failure), mainly in high CV risk patients, to neoplasms (breast cancer, bronchial carcinoma, lymphoma, lung neoplasm, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma) and to surgical and medical procedures. All these SAEs were unrelated to study drug.

Acute  pancreatitis  was  reported  in  two  patients  and  was  considered  unrelated  to  treatment.  In  one case,  the  event  led  to  patient's  discontinuation.  In  the  other  case,  the  patient  recovered  without discontinuation  of  the  study  drug.  Two  other  cases  of  pancreatitis  have  been  reported  but  were considered as non serious.

Pulmonary  embolism  was  reported  in  two  patients  and  was  considered  unrelated.  In  one  case,  the study  drug  was  temporarily  discontinued  and  the  patient  recovered.  In  the  other  case,  the  patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

presented  a  pulmonary  embolism  secondary  to  deep  venous  thrombosis  after  patella  fracture  and incompletely recovered without modification of the treatment. Two TIA and one stroke were also noted during this period; all were considered unrelated.

## Laboratory findings

## Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)

Efficacy phase: Overall, increase of CPK was reported in all studies and in all treatment groups. This increase  varied  between  22%  and  40%.  The  mean  observed  CPK  increase  was  higher  in  the  statin group  (+26%)  than  in  the  FDC  (+10.6%)  and  fenofibrate  group  (+15%).  The  majority  of  patients experienced  increase  of  CPK  (&lt;5UNL).  Only  few  patients  reported  CPK  between  3-5UNL  in  all treatment groups: 1.6% in FDC, 1% in statins and 0.8% in fenofibrate. Only three patients in statin group (0.6%) and 2 in fenofibrate (1.6%) experienced CPK increase between 5-10 UNL. No muscular symptoms  were  associated  with  the  increase  of  CPK  except  in  one  patient  in  statin  group  who experienced an increase over 10UNL associated with muscular symptom.

Safety phase:  The  increase of CPK  was  more  frequently  reported  during the safety phase, approximately 40% of patients had an increase &lt;5UNL. In one study, the increase of CPK was reported in  additional  20%  of  patients.  As  in  efficacy  phase,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  increased  CPK between 3-5 UNL remains stable. A total of 0.4% of patients experienced increased CPK 5-10 UNL vs none during the efficacy phase.

## Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST)

Efficacy phase: Increase of AST/ALT was reported in all treatment groups and was more frequent in the  FDC  group.  This  increase  varied  between  20%  and  40%.  The  majority  of  patients  experienced moderate  increase  of  AST/ALT  ( ≤ 3UNL).  However  no  separate  data  was  provided  for  ALT  and  AST increase  except  for  one  study,  although  increased  ALT  is  more  indicative  of  hepatic  toxicity  (if  AST increase is noted, data regarding alkaline phosphatase and conjugated bilirubin should be provided in order  to  attribute  the  AST  increase  to  liver  damage).  These  data  were  provided  only  for  one  study (FENOPRA III-06-1).  The  increase  of  ALT  and  AST  between  3-5  UNL  was  similar  in  FDC  and  statin groups and was reported in only one patient each (0.16% and 0.19% respectively) and in two patients in fenofibrate group (1.64%). Two patients experienced both increase of ALT and AST&gt;5 UNL with the FDC and one patient reported increase AST &gt;5 UNL in the statins group.

Safety phase: The increase of AST and ALT was reported for approximately 20 to 40% of patients and the majority of patients experienced moderate increase &lt;3UNL.  The increase of ALT between 3-5UNL was slightly more frequent than in the efficacy phase (0.6% vs 0.16% respectively). Similar finding was  reported  for  increase  ALT  &gt;5UNL  (0.3% vs 0.16%  respectively).  The  increase  of  AST  levels between 3-5 UNL was similar to the efficacy phase as was the increase of AST levels &gt;5UNL.

## Blood Creatinine clearance (CrCl) and creatinine

Efficacy phase: The provided data are to be interpreted with caution since the proposed stratification is not in line with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. The frequency of  patients  with  a  ClCr&lt;60  ml/min  increased  in  FDC  (from  4.5%  at  baseline  to  10.7%)  and  in fenofibrate (from 0.8% to 2.5%) groups. This was not observed in the statin group (4.4% to 3.5%).

Safety  phase:  The  frequency  of  patients  in  FDC  group  with  a  ClCr&lt;60  ml/min  was  similar  to  the frequency observed during the efficacy phase (10% vs 10.7%). The frequency of creatininemia &gt;20 mg/l increased to 1.1% during the safety period versus 0.5% during the efficacy period.

## Homocysteine

Homocysteine  levels  were  only  collected  in  the  four  arm  of  study  FENOPRA-III-06-1.  During  the efficacy period, homocysteine level remained unchanged in simvastatin group, associated or not with ezetimibe, but a statistical  significant  increase  was  reported  in  the  FDC  group.  The  between  groups difference  was  statistically  significant  in  both  strata.  Statistically  significant  increases  were  also reported during the safety period in both strata (25.0±51.2% in the high CV risk and 20.6±41.6% in the very high CV risk).

## Vital signs and ECG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  were  no  clinical  meaningful  changes  in  diastolic,  systolic  blood  pressure  or  heart  rate  in  any group during the whole study. Additionally, no clinical relevant change in body weight was noted in FDC  or  statin  groups  (data  not  available  for  fenofibrate)  during  the  efficacy  phase  and  under  FDC during the safety phase.

## Safety in special populations

Subgroup analysis in the different individual studies was not performed. However, subgroup analyses were  performed  on  pooled  data  of  patients  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  Pravafenix.  Following analyses were conducted:

- -Diabetic patients (55% of the global population),
- -Age: &lt;65 years (77.6%), 65 to 75 years (19.8%) and &gt;75 years (2.6%),
- -Gender: 55.5% male, 44.5% female,
- -BMI: 18-25 kg/m 2  (7.5%), 25-30 kg/m 2  (39.4%) and &gt;30 kg/m 2  (53%),
- -Renal  status:  clearance  &lt;60  ml/min  (6%),  between  60-75  ml/min  (14.4%)  and  &gt;75  ml/min (79.6%).

No specific adverse event appeared to be significantly increased in these different subgroups compared to the global population. Nevertheless, more cases of creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/min were observed in older patients (6.3% in patients &lt;65 years, 36.1% in patients between 65-75 years and 65.9% in patients &gt;75 years) and in female patients compared to male patients (19.7% vs 9.1%). It is to be taken  into  account  that  the  number  of  patients  &gt;75  years  was  limited  (n=41,  2.6%  of  the  global population)  and  in  the  affected  subgroups,  patients  &gt;75  years  and  female  patients,  the  mean creatinine clearance levels for these patients were already lower at inclusion in the study, compared to other subgroups. In addition, more cases of renal insufficiency and decreased CrCl &lt;60 ml/min were reported  as  AEs  in  the  CrCl  subgroup  &lt;60  ml/min  (7.5%  and  5.4%  respectively)  and  in  the  CrCl subgroup between 60-75 ml/min (none and 6.7% respectively) than in the CrCl subgroup &gt;75 ml/min (2.7%) during FDC exposure.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No new  information has been provided. The wording on the interactions for the different monocomponents of the FDC are adequately implemented in the SmPC.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

As previously discussed, 38 AEs led to the withdrawal of 31 patients (9.1%) during the study period. Twenty-six of the 38 AEs, were related to study drug. The most frequent SOCs were: Investigations (2.3%), Gastrointestinal disorders (2.0%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.8%) and Renal and urinary disorders (1.5%).

## Post marketing experience

There is no postmarketing experience with this product since it has not been marketed yet.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Safety  profiles  of  fenofibrate  and  statin  are  well  defined.  The  data  analysed  in  the  marketing authorisation application for Pravafenix were derived from literature research, published clinical trials on statin/fibrate combination use and on the conducted four clinical studies. These take into account more than 1500 patients who received the FDC: a total of 1566 patient were exposed to at least one dose of Pravafenix, 928 patients were exposed for 24 weeks and 395 patients were exposed for 1 year. Patient exposures can be considered as acceptable.

Similar safety profile was observed in both, the statin and FDC group. The most frequently reported AEs were related to muscle and musculoskeletal disorders (muscle and articular pain), gastrointestinal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disorders (abdominal pain and transit abnormalities), and investigations (increased hepatic and muscle enzyme levels).

Increase of CPK and transaminases was reported in all treatment groups during the efficacy and safety phases. The majority of patients experienced an increase &lt;3 UNL.  However the increase of CK was slightly  more  frequent  during  the  safety  phase  with  approximately  40%  of  patients  who  had  an increase ≤ 3  UNL.  Less  than  2%  of  patients  reported  moderate  increase  (&gt;3-5  UNL)  of CK and less than 1% reported severe increase (&gt;5 UNL). Similarly, less than 1% of patients reported increase of ALT &gt;3 UNL. Thorough and regular monitoring of CK levels prior to and during the therapy is therefore advised in the SmPC of Pravafenix.

Homocysteine blood control has been performed in study FENOPRA III-06-1. This showed a statistically significant  increase  in  levels  especially  in  the  FDC  group  in  high  and  very  high  cardiovascular  risk patients.  This  increase  is  correlated  to  the  decrease  of  the  clearance  of  creatinine  and  is  reversible after drug withdrawal. The CHMP considered that the homocysteine increase could be of concern as the proposed indication of the fixed dose combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate is intended to be used in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and at high cardiovascular risk. This finding was observed in the FIELD study and confirmed in the ACCORD study, and could be important in patients with moderate renal  failure  compared  to  those  with  mild  renal  failure  or  normal  renal  function.  However,  no conclusion can be drawn up to now regarding a possible link between increased homocysteine and the cardiovascular  risk.  Additionally,  increased  homocysteine  is  correlated  to  the  decrease  of  creatinine clearance  which  is  also  a  concern  related  to  fenofibrate  use.  This  issue  will  remain  under  close monitoring. Pravafenix is contraindicated in patients with severe and moderate renal impairment and regular monitoring of renal function is recommended, as per the SmPC.

Eight  cases  of neoplasm (breast  cancer,  bronchial  carcinoma,  lymphoma,  2  lung  neoplasm,  ovarian cancer,  prostate  cancer,  and  melanoma)  have  been  reported  during  the  safety  phase  in  patients receiving FDC therapy. All cases were considered unrelated to treatment. Safety review of statins and risk  of  cancer  following  the  publication  of  the  PROSPER  study  in  2002  was  conducted.  Although  it showed  higher  incidence  of  new  cancer  diagnoses  in  patients  on  pravastatin vs placebo,  the assessment of available data does not change the positive benefit-risk profile of a statin. The available clinical  data  are  reassuring  and  provide  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  cancer  in  the  general patient population treated with a statin for up to 5 years, although no conclusive data are available concerning  effect  of  statins  on  cancer  risk  in  the  elderly  ( ≥ 70  years).  However,  monitoring  of neoplasm  cases  in  clinical  trials  and  during  post-marketing  use  in  patients  treated  with  statins  in general is recommended.

The CHMP requested a description of cases of myopathy, myositis and rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis reported in  ACCORD study. It was concluded that based on these results, and the results from the studies conducted with Pravafenix, no safety concern was identified for the muscle or hepatic disorders. This, however, is to be expected especially when considering the low number of patients exposed to FDC in at least one year. No rhabdomyolysis was reported and only one patient experienced increased CPK &gt;10 UNL associated to muscle disorders in pravastatin group. Nevertheless, acknowledging that rhabdomyolysis is an acute and potentially fatal condition of skeletal muscle, which may develop at any time during treatment and that it is known that the risk of muscle toxicity is increased when a fibrate and a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor are administered together, myopathy must be considered in any patient presenting with unexplained muscle symptoms such as pain or tenderness, muscle weakness, or  muscle  cramps.  In  such  cases  CK  levels  should  be  measured.  The  potential  benefit/risk  ratio  of Pravafenix should be closely assessed before treatment initiation and patients should be monitored for any signs of muscle toxicity, as stated in the SmPC for Pravafenix.

Given that only 35% of patients (532) in FDC treatment group were exposed during 52 weeks, and less  than  10%  were  exposed  to  FDC  during  64  weeks  (148),  no  accurate  conclusion  can  be  drawn regarding long term safety data of FDC. No data was also available regarding the elderly, patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Pravafenix is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, as mentioned earlier.

The  combination  of  both  therapies  with  similar  identified  safety  concerns  (i.e.  muscle  disorders, increased  hepatic  and  muscle  enzymes,  pancreatic,  interstitial  fibrosis)  could  probably  lead  to  a demonstration  of  these  adverse  events.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  conduct  of  two  postauthorisation studies that will contribute to a better definition of Pravafenix safety profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing use of fenofibrate with statins have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

As  expected,  some  of  the  AEs  observed  with  Pravafenix  are  more  pronounced  than  those  for  the monotherapies, however, no new or significant safety concern has been identified taking into account the clinical studies conducted with the FDC and the results of the published investigations including the ACCORD  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  related  to  study  drug  were  renal  and  urinary disorders, which included decreased levels of renal creatinine, increases transaminases and musculoskeletal disorders, all of them expected according to the SmPC of both actives substances in monotherapy. The safety profile of Pravafenix is adequately reflected in the SmPC of this medicinal product.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. In addition, the CHMP  considers  that it is  necessary to conduct a pharmacovigilance inspection before end of 2011, in order to verify the accuracy and the successful implementation of the corrective actions following a recent pharmacovigilance inspection performed in 2010.

Pravastatin  is  a  statin  of middle potency that has shown to be effective in cardiovascular prevention in a wide range population. The main mechanism of action of statins in CV prevention is their effect on lipid levels, mainly on LDLcholesterol.

The effect of lipid lowering agents, especially of statins, on LDL-cholesterol is accepted as a validated surrogate for the evaluation of CV prevention. Whether this surrogacy value can be extrapolated to drugs other than statins could be further discussed.

Fibrates have been shown to have a modest effect on LDL, but quite a marked effect on TG and HDLcholesterol. Outcome studies conducted with the different fibrates have shown inconsistent results in terms of outcome, and, in some cases, possibly worrying results in overall mortality.

This issue was extensively discussed during Article 31 Referral on fibrates and the CHMP provided its final  opinion  which  results  in  a  newly  accepted  indication  for  fibrates:  'Mixed  hyperlipidaemia  in patients  at  high  CV  risk  in  addition  to  a  statin  when  TG  and  HDL  cholesterol  are  not  adequately controlled'.

## Beneficial effects

Effects on lipid parameters. As expected, results observed in the initial Pravafenix clinical dossier have shown a more potent effect of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C, while pravastatin is superior in reducing total cholesterol and LDL-C.

Indeed,  the  co-administration  of  statin  and  fibrates  has  a  role  in  patient  treatment  with  insufficient response to statins, and in this particular case, to pravastatin. This is recognised in clinical guidelines and omitting this option would leave a substantial portion of patients at high CV risk, particular those with  elevated  TG  and/or  low  HDL  despite  full-dosed  statin  therapy,  with  a  very  limited  treatment options.

In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  showed  mainly  a  decrease  in  TG  levels  with  an incremental increase in HDL-C levels and in some cases further reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels.  There results are in line with results obtained in the ACCORD study in a selected population of type 2 diabetic patients.

Effects  on  lipid  parameters  in  a  specific  subgroup  of  dyslipidaemic  patients. Only  benefit  on  lipid parameters was effectively demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with mixed dyslipidaemia defined as TG &gt;204mg/dl AND HDL-C &lt;34mg/dL levels.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Uncertainties  of  cardiovascular  events  in  overall  dyslipidaemic  patients  including  women: This  issue was extensively discussed during Article 31 Referral on fibrates and the CHMP provided its final opinion which results in a newly accepted indication for fenofibrate: Mixed hyperlipidaemia in patients at high CV risk in addition to a statin when TG and HDL cholesterol are not adequately.

Uncertainties  on  the  equipotency  of  statins: The  CHMP  does  not  support  the  statin  equipotency  as originally claimed by the applicant. The potency of pravastatin as compared to other statins is lower and  the  individual  response  of  a  patient  cannot  be  generalised  to  the  whole  population.  In  clinical practice, there is no reason for switching patients controlled by one statin to Pravafenix. Therefore, the indication is to be limited to pravastatin 40mg and to patients that are sufficiently controlled for their LDL-C  levels.  Indeed,  this  is  of  particular  importance  because  treatment  with  pravastatin  is  not  as potent as other statins in reducing LDL-C.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The long term safety data regarding the comparison of simvastatine alone to simvastatine/fenofibrate was provided in the ACOORD study. No safety signal regarding cholelithiasis, pancreatic, thromboembolic events was identified during this study. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn regarding the long term use of the fixed dose combination of fenofibrate/statin regarding the increased risk of renal failure, muscle disorders, hepatitis, cholelithiasis and pancreatitis. Furthermore, it should be noted that in 16% of patients in the ACCORD study, the dose of fenofibrate has been reduced due to a decrease of renal glomerular filtration. The increased level of homocysteine as described in the FIELD study has also been confirmed in the ACCORD study.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No  new  safety  profile  can  be  identified  based  on  the  use  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  of fenofibrate/statin as the ACCORD study was insufficiently powered.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  recently published ACCORD  study  does  not  appear  to  support  the extensive use of a fenofibrate/simvastatin  combination  therapy  to  reduce  cardiovascular  events  in  the  majority  of dyslipidaemic  high  CV  risk  patients  with  type  2  diabetic  patients.  Indeed,  only  beneficial  effects  on cardiovascular endpoints were observed in patients with high TG and low HDL-C values. This has also been extensively discussed during Article 31 referral on fenofibrate. Thus, finally, only an indication that will be limited to this specific population subgroup can be granted by the CHMP.

## Benefit-risk balance

Based  on  the  provided  data,  benefits  on  lipid  parameters  (surrogate  endpoints)  were  effectively demonstrated  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia  defined  by  TG  &gt;204mg/dl  and HDL-C &lt;34mg/dL levels. Results are however insufficient to recommend an extensive use in patients with high TG or low HDH-C levels as originally claimed. Nevertheless, the importance whether these biological effects could translate into benefits on cardiovascular endpoints was considered by the CHMP during  the  first  step  of  the  Pravafenix  procedure  in  the  context  of  the  long  term  use  of  the statin/fenofibrate  combination.  After  reviewing  data  from  the  ACCORD  study,  it  would  appear  that there is a detrimental effect of the long term use of a statin/fenofibrate combination on women. This gender issue has been extensively discussed during referral on fibrates. Overall, the biological benefit expressed in the newly worded and approved indication can be recognised for the pravastatin/fenofibrate combination.

## 2.8.1. Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Based on the provided data and the rationale above, Pravafenix is aimed to offer an alternative to a specifically targeted population; i.e. high CHD-risk adult patients with mixed dyslipidaemia characterised by high TG and low HDL-C whose LDL-C are adequately controlled while on a treatment with pravastatin 40mg monotherapy.

Overall, the biological effect expressed in the newly worded and approved indication can be recognised for the pravastatin/fenofibrate combination.

## Risk management plan

## Risk management plan

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.

- No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.9. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Pravafenix in the treatment of high coronary heart disease (CHD) -risk adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia  characterised  by  high  triglycerides  and  low  HDL-cholesterol levels  whose  LDL-C  levels  are  adequately  controlled  while  on  a  treatment  with  pravastatin  40 mg monotherapy was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
