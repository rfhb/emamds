## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information  on  the  development  program  and  the  pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Pegaspargase is a pegylated formulation of native L-asparaginase with polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this document pegaspargase is also called S095014 (Servier code). The use of pegaspargase in the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is very well established in clinical practice and this product is currently approved (under the trade name Oncaspar ® ) in 73 countries.

The initial marketing authorisation approvals were with the liquid presentation ( i.e. USA in 01/02/1994). On  14  January  2016,  pegaspargase  solution  received  approval  as  a  component  of  antineoplastic combination  therapy  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  ALL  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  the European Union (EU).

The  lyophilised  powder  formulation  of  Oncaspar ® ,  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  08 December 2017. Consequently,  the  Applicant  decided  to  discontinue  the  liquid  pegaspargase  presentation;  this pharmaceutical form is no longer marketed, and the deletion was approved on 02 June 2022.  The estimated cumulative exposure to Oncaspar ®  since the first Marketing Authorisation (MA) 01/02/1994 to 14/01/2023 is at 193 544 patients.

The previously reported phase 2 clinical study, CL2-095014-002, compared the PK of the lyophilized formulation of Oncaspar ®  to liquid formulation during the induction phase (approximately 30 days) in newly diagnosed paediatric patients with ALL.

The present study, CL2-095014-003, was designed as a roll-over study to provide continued access to lyophilized formulation of Oncaspar ®  for patients who were clinically benefitting from the study drug without major toxicity and wished to continue this treatment in the following consolidation phase.

The IV infusions of Oncaspar ®  were given in combination with other backbone chemotherapy agents as per the ALL-MB 2015 protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CL2-095014-003 study falls into the scope of article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as this is a  Paediatric  Study  Sponsored  by  Servier.  This  study  was  conducted  in  Russia,  where  lyophilized formulation of Oncaspar ®  was approved on 04 February 2022.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for CL2-095014-003 study. CL2-095014-003 is a multicentre, openlabel, roll-over study from the previously completed CL2-095014-002 study. It was designed to provide continued access to lyophilized formulation of pegaspargase (S095014) during the consolidation phase in  patients who were clinically benefitting from pegaspargase (from the CL2-095014-002 study) and without major toxicity following the induction phase. No efficacy or PK endpoints were assessed.

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

## CL2-095014-003 study

## Description

A multicenter, roll-over study to provide continued treatment with lyophilized pegaspargase (S95014) in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).

## Methods

The safety assessments (laboratory tests, ECG, cardiac imaging) and pregnancy tests performed during the withdrawal visit of the initial CL2-95014-002 study were used to assess the eligibility for this rollover study.

75 informed consents were signed; 74 patients were treated and analyzed.

The  study  planned  to  enroll  75  patients.  Overall  74  patients  were  treated  and  analyzed.  The  study duration was approximately 7 months, including the treatment and follow-up periods.

The study plan is shown in (Figure (3.4.2) 1). The study duration was approximately 7 months, including the  treatment  and  follow-up  periods.  Pegaspargase  was  administered  every  two  weeks  during  the consolidation  phase  for  a  total  of  9  infusions,  at  weeks  7,  9,  11,  15,  17,  19,  23,  25  and  27.  The investigators had the choice of administering a dose of 1000, 2000 or 2500 U/m².Patients also received other  backbone  chemotherapy  agents  as  per  the  ALL-MB  2015  protocol.  After  completing  the consolidation  phase,  patients  were  discontinued  from  the  study  and  treated  as  per  investigator's judgment.

<!-- image -->

The inclusion visit of CL2-095014-003 study corresponded to the withdrawal visit of the initial CL2-095014-002 study.

A withdrawal visit was performed no later than 30 days after the last dose of pegaspargase during the consolidation phase. Patients then continued to receive the backbone chemotherapeutic regimen as per ALL MB 2015 protocol, and according to the physician's judgment. A follow-up visit (either direct contact or by telephone) was carried out not earlier than 30 days after the last infusion of pegaspargase, except in case of consent withdrawal. Any follow-up of adverse events and the patient survival was recorded.

## Objective(s)

The study was initiated on the May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023.

The primary objective of the study was:

To provide continued access to lyophilized pegaspargase during the consolidation phase.

## A secondary objective was:

To assess the safety profile of pegaspargase during the consolidation phase. The study was initiated on the May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023.

## Endpoints

## Efficacy assessment:

None

## Safety assessments:

- Adverse events (AEs), treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs).
- Physical examinations and ECOG PS.
- Laboratory abnormalities assessment including hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation parameters.

## Assessor's comments

This  roll-over  study  design  included  paediatric  population  with  newly  diagnosed,  untreated  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed the CL2-95014-002 study and who were clinically benefitting from S95014 without major toxicity. 74 patients out of 89 patients included in the CL1-95014002 study continued in this roll-over study. The study indication and population are in line with the EU marketing authorisation of oncaspar.

No statistical analysis were performed in this study and the focus was only on safety endpoints. This study design is appropriate.

## Clinical Results

## Disposition of subjects

A total of 74 patients were treated and analysed in the study. Of these, 22 (29.7%) were prematurely withdrawn (Table (3.4.3.1) 1): 18 due to an adverse event and 4 due to the physician's decision. All analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SAS).

In the SAS, the mean age (± SD) at baseline was 6.1 ± 3.8 years (min - max: 2 - 18), with 81.1% aged &lt; 10 years old and 97.3% aged &lt; 16 years old. Male patients represented 51.4% of the SAS. The majority of patients were of Caucasian origin (95.9%). The mean (± SD) BMI was 16.45 ± 3.51 kg/m2 and mean (± SD) BSA was 0.90 ± 0.36 m2. Most patients (62.2%) had an ECOG PS of 1 at baseline.

All of the investigators decided to administer pegaspargase at a dose of 1000 U/m², over a1-hour IV infusion (on weeks 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25 and 27). A single dose was received by 7 patients, 2 doses only were received by 10 patients, and 3 doses only were received by 3 patients. Thus, 20/74 patients (27%) received 3 doses or less. Except for 2 patients who received 8 doses, the remaining patients (52/74 [70%]) received 9 doses, as per protocol.

The reported TEAEs were consistent with the known adverse reactions of S95014 and with the underlying pathology (ALL).

## Assessor's comments

The table 12.1.2 showed that the most frequently reported PTs are: antithrombin III decreased (53 patients, 71.6%) neutropenia/ Neutrophil count decreased (62 patients, 83,7 %) and blood fibrinogen decreased (48 patients, 64.9%). The MAH concluded that the reported TEAEs are in accordance with the known profile of adverse events with S95014.

According to oncaspar' s SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 4.4 of the smpc. In the other hand, neutropenia / Neutrophil count decreased reported in 62 patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(83,7%)is listed with unknown frequency in the section 4.8 of the smpc, only febrile neutropenia is considered as very common in the EU SmPC.

The MAH provided as part of the study annexes the listing of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events in the Safety Analysis Set with details concerning AE's seriousness, outcome and severity. According to this data, none of the AEs in relation with antithrombin III decreased were serious, nevertheless, the MAH is requested  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  AE  and  the  need  to  update  the  product  smpc accordingly. Moreover, the MAH is requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased frequencies reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar's SmPc. This discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of those events. Update of the Smpc should be also discussed accordingly.

We noted ,among the most frequently reported PT, the PT toxic neuropathy which concerned 5 different patients. This AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc, thus, the MAH is requested to provide more details concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events).

## Analysis of TEAEs by intensity

Overall, most TEAEs were rated Grade 2 (37.9%) or Grade 3 (39.0%); 11.9% of TEAEs were Grade 4 and none were fatal. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported for 72 patients (97.3%).

The  most  frequent  Grade  3/4  events  were  neutropenia  and  certain  events  pertaining  to  the  SOC investigations (concerning mainly coagulation parameters and raised liver enzymes).

Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported for 72 patients (97.3%).Grade 3/4 TEAEs reported in at least 3 patients are presented in Table (12.1.3) 2 by SOC and PT.

## Assessor's comments

The analysis of TEAEs by severity regardless of the events seriousness revealed that Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported for 72 (97.3%) patients. No fatal events were reported.

The most frequent Grade 3/4 events were neutropenia (98% of the patients reporting neutropenia AEs), antithrombin  III  decreased  (84%  of  the  patients  reporting  antithrombin  III  AEs)  and  certain  events related to the SOC investigations especially ASAT increase (77% of the patients with ASAT increased), gamma-GT increase (87% of patients with gamma-GT increase) and blood fibrinogen decreased (43.75% of patients with blood fibrinogen decreased).

Those results should be interpreted with caution regarding the number of patients included in this study sample  and  the  underlying  disease.  AEs  related  to  hepatotoxicity  are  in  accordance  to  the  study treatment  known  safety  profile.  Nevertheless  more  clarifications  are  requested  regarding  the  AEs neutropenia and antithrombin III as discussed previously (section Analysis of TEAEs by frequency).

## Analysis of treatment-related emergent adverse events

Relationships of TEAEs were assessed by the investigators as:

- -Not related.
- -Related to the IMP.
- -Related to the backbone therapies.
- -Related to the study protocol (except IMP and backbone therapies).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment-emergent AEs related to pegaspargase were frequent, with all patients reporting at least one event with a total of 546 IMP-related TEAEs.

The most frequent IMP-related TEAEs were PTs related to the SOC investigations (mostly concerning blood coagulation) and PTs related to the SOC blood system disorders (low blood cell counts). These were mostly Grade 2 (43.0%) or Grade 3 (39.7%); 11.0% were of Grade 4.

A total of 68 patients (91.9%) had at least one TEAE related to the IMP that was considered to be of Grade 3 or 4 severity. The most frequently reported events of this type were antithrombin III decreased (59.5%), neutropenia (48.6%), and blood fibrinogen decreased (28.4%).

A  total  of  41  TEAEs  were  reported  for  either  hypersensitivity,  drug  hypersensitivity,  or  anaphylactic reaction (4.3% of all TEAEs) and these affected a total of 28 patients (37.8%). These included 32 events of hypersensitivity in 24 patients (31 events in 23 patients, being related to the IMP), 8 events of drug hypersensitivity in 6 patients (IMP related), and a single event of anaphylactic reaction (IMP related).

Most patients (60, 81.1%) also reported at least one TEAE considered as related to backbone therapies, with a total of 371 events. These also mostly concerned the SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders, and investigations. There were no TEAEs considered as related to the study protocol.

## Assessor's comments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

94,4% (68 out of 72) of patients experienced grade 3/4 TEAEs that were considered as related to the IMP.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  of  this  type  were  antithrombin  III  decreased  (59.5%), neutropenia (48.6%), and blood fibrinogen decreased (28.4%).

29 (39%) of patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions (hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, or anaphylactic reaction) and all TEAEs were related to IMP.

Apart from hypersensitivity reactions and blood fibrinogen decreased that are considered as known risks with oncaspar, antithrombin III decreased (not listed in oncaspar SmPC)and neutropenia (listed with undetermined frequency) appear as the most frequently related grade ¾ TEAEs in this study. Thus, the MAH is requested to further discuss the cases in relation with both risks as specified previously (section Analysis of TEAEs by frequency).

## Emergent serious adverse events

There were 27 patients (36.5%) who reported at least one emergent SAE during the study, with a total of 56 emergent SAEs.

Most frequently, these events concerned the SOC immune system disorders (14 patients, 18.9%), mostly concerning  different  types  of  allergic  reactions.  This  was  followed  by  infections  and  infestations  (11 patients, 14.9%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (10 patients, 13.5%).

For 14 of these events (11 patients) the upgrade to serious was made by the Sponsor:

-Neutropenia- 6 events: 2 events in one patient in a context of laryngitis; one event in a context of sepsis SAE; one in a context of bronchitis SAE; one in a context of COVID-19 infection SAE; and one in a context of upper respiratory tract infection.

-Febrile neutropenia - 2 events: one in a context of device infection; and one without any underlying pathology, signs or symptoms.

- -Ejection fraction decreased 1 event: asymptomatic, but LVEF of 27%.

-Neutrophil count decreased 1 event.

-One event each of sepsis and pneumonia fungal in a patient who had previously reported sepsis.

-One event of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: in the patient with cellulitis gangrenous.

-One event of leukopenia G4.

Hypersensitivity events (including anaphylaxis) affected a total of 28 patients for 41 events. Among them, 15 events were serious (12 events of hypersensitivity, 2 events of drug hypersensitivity, and the event of anaphylactic reaction; 13 patients affected); all considered to be related to the IMP; all were reported as recovered. As indicated above, a total of 17 patients (23.0%) had an allergic reaction TEAE (related to the IMP) that led to IMP discontinuation (8 of the events were serious). The incidence of hypersensitivity  in  affected  individuals  did  not  appear  to  be  influenced  by  the  formulation  of pegaspargase they received in the qualifying study (CL2-95014-002): for 9/28 patients, the induction treatment in the qualifying study was the lyophilized formulation and for 19/28 patients it was the liquid formulation.

Treatment-emergent  SAEs  considered  to  be  related  to  pegaspargase affected  16  patients (21,6%) with   total of 18 events:

Hypersensitivity: 12 events of 11 patients (14.9%). Drug hypersensitivity: 2 events in 1 patient (1.4%). Anaphylactic reaction: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). Oedematous pancreatitis: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). Hepatotoxicity: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). Neutropenia: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For 10 patients, the action taken was ' IMP discontinuation ' ; the 8 patients reporting hypersensitivity, and the patients reporting drug hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction.

No deaths were reported during the study.

## Assessor's comments

Serious adverse events related to IMP concerned 16 patients (21,6%). 15 (83,33%)  out of the 18 total number of serious adverse events related to the IMP reported hypersensitivity reactions (hypersensitivity,  drug  hypersensitivity,  or  anaphylactic  reaction)  in  13  patients.  among  which  10 patients discontinued IMP treatment.

The remaining 3 events reported respectively 1 event of Oedematous pancreatitis, 1 of hepatotoxicity and 1 event of neutropenia in 3 different patients.

Related SAEs reported are in accordance with the known safety profile of oncaspar.

AdverseeventswerecodedusingMedDRAdictionaryversion25.0.

Source:Table14.3.1.51

A total of 67 patients (90.5%) reported a TEAE requiring additional therapy. In addition, 5 patients (6.8%) reported a total of 8 TEAEs requiring a surgical or medical procedure.

In addition, 4 patients were withdrawn from treatment due to the investigator's decision:

Patient 1: had hypersensitivity reactions (3 events), of grade 1 or 2 and was withdrawn on day 64.

- Patient 2: had a drug hypersensitivity reaction and a hypersensitivity reaction (2 separate visits), of grade 2 and was withdrawn on day 56.

Patient 3: had numerous TEAEs (mostly under the SOC investigations) but more importantly neutropenic sepsis (2 events), cellulitis gangrenous and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (all 4 events were SAE); the action taken was 'new treatment or dose modification of ongoing treatment other than IMP and backbone therapies' and the patient was withdrawn on day 246.

Patient  4:  had  several  blood  related  disorders  (grade  2  or  3)  including  neutropenia,anaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, as well as increased liver enzymes. A change of treatment protocol was advised at W11 and the patient was withdrawn.

## Assessor's comments

We noted 18 patients with AEs leading to treatment withdrawal. 17 out of 18 treatment withdrawals were related to hypersensitivity reactions. 10 out of the 17 events /patients were serious adverse events related  to  IMP.  The  risk  of  hypersensitivity  and  anaphylactic  reaction  is  known  with  oncaspar  and considered as a very common risk. Thus, no new signal emerges from the provided data.

##  Clinical laboratory results

Emergent abnormal laboratory values were generally reported as AEs and analyzed as such. There were no unexpected changes observed in the mean values of observed parameters.

The mean values for biochemistry parameters were generally consistent with ALL.

## Clinically significant abnormal values

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values concerned GGT (32 patients overall, 43.2%), ALT (25 patients, 33.8%) and hypertriglyceridemia (14 patients, 18.9%). No emergent Grade ≥  3  values  were  observed  for  bicarbonate,  glucose,  alkalin e  phosphatase,  creatinine  or  lactate dehydrogenase.

The most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values concerned anemia (16 patients, 21.6%; all Grade 3), white blood cells decreased (16 patients overall, 21.6%), hemoglobin increased (10 patients, 13.5%) and low lymphocyte counts (9 patients overall, 12.2%).

The most frequently reported emergent Grade 3 values concerned low fibrinogen levels (16 patients, 21.6%). There were no Grade 4 events.

##  Vital signs and ECOG PS

The assessments of vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, HR and body temperature) indicated no clinically relevant differences over time from baseline. There was no deterioration in ECOG PS over time. The analyses of the change in systolic and diastolic BP, HR and body temperature, from baseline to each visit as well as baseline to withdrawal/end-of-study show no meaningful trends or issues

## Assessor's comments

The most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values are in line with the known safety profile of S95014. No grade 4 values were reported. We noted also no deterioration in ECOG performance status over time. However, the MAH did not mention the antithrombine III decreased among the most frequently reported abnormal values while it was reported as the most frequently Grade 3/4 events. This should be clarified.

## Conclusion on Safety

No new safety concerns for S95014 were detected and it was well tolerated. No fatal events were reported during the study. Hypersensitivity reactions were the main AE leading withdrawal of the study treatment, with a total of 17 patients (23.0%) being withdrawn for these reactions. The safety profile observed in this study is consistent with the known safety profile of pegaspargase.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The CL2-95014-003 study was a 'roll-over' study, designed to provide continued access to S95014 during  the  consolidation  phase  in  patients  who  completed  the  CL2-95014-002  study  and  who  were clinically benefitting from S95014 without major toxicity. The CL2-95014-003 study was initiated on the May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023.

No efficacy or PK endpoints were assessed and the safety endpoints were analysed in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS).

The  study  planned  to  enroll  75  patients.  Overall  74  patients  were  treated  and  analysed.  The  study duration was approximately 7 months, including the treatment and follow-up periods. In the SAS, the mean age (± SD) at baseline was 6.1 ± 3.8 years (min - max: 2 - 18), with 81.1% aged &lt; 10 years old and 97.3% aged &lt; 16 years old. Male patients represented 51.4% of the SAS. The majority of patients were of Caucasian origin (95.9%).

Pegaspargase was administered every two weeks during the consolidation phase for a total of 9 infusions, Patients also received other backbone chemotherapy agents as per the ALL-MB 2015 protocol. 20/74 patients (27%) received 3 doses or less. Except for 2 patients who received 8 doses, the remaining

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients (52/74 [70%]) received 9 doses, as per protocol. After completing the consolidation phase, patients were discontinued from the study and treated as per investigator's judgment.

22 (29.7%) were prematurely withdrawn: 18 due to an adverse event and 4 due to the physician's decision.

Regarding the safety results, all 74 (100%) patients of the SAS had at least one TEAE during the study, for a total of 954 events. There were 56 serious emergent events, none fatal.

The most frequently affected SOCs were Investigations (59 patients, 79.7%) and Blood and lymphatic systemic disorders (55 patients, 74.3%). Overall, most TEAEs were rated Grade 2 (37.9%) or Grade 3 (39.0%);  11.9%  of  TEAEs  were  Grade  4  and  none  was  fatal.  Nevertheless,  Grade  3/4  TEAEs  were reported for 72 patients (97.3%) and 94,4% (68 out of 72) of patients experienced grade 3/4 TEAEs that were considered as related to the IMP. Those results should be interpreted with caution because of the study sample size and the patient's underlying disease.

The most frequently reported PTs are: antithrombin III decreased (53 patients, 71.6%) neutropenia/ Neutrophil count decreased (62 patients, 83,7 %) and blood fibrinogen decreased (48 patients, 64.9%).

According to oncaspar' s SmPC, Only blood fibrinogen decreased is listed with frequency 'very common' in oncaspar Smpc. the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 4.4 of the smpc. In the other hand, neutropenia / Neutrophil count decreased reported in 62 patients, (83,7%)is listed with unknown frequency in the section 4.8 of the smpc and only febrile neutropenia is considered as very common in the EU SmPC.

The MAH is requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product smpc accordingly. Moreover, the MAH is also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased's frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar's SmPc. This discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of those events. Smpc 's update should be also discussed accordingly.

Toxic neuropathy were reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and was reported in 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc,, the MAH is requested to provide more details concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events).

29 out of 74 (39%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions (hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, or anaphylactic reaction) and all TEAEs were related to IMP.

Serious adverse events related to IMP concerned 16 patients (21,6%). 15 (83,33%)  out of the 18 total number of serious adverse events related to the IMP reported hypersensitivity reactions.

We noted 18 patients with AEs leading to treatment withdrawal. 17 out of 18 treatment withdrawals were related to hypersensitivity reactions. 10 out of the 17 events /patients were serious adverse events related to IMP.

Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) concerned 39% of the patients (29 patients) among which 55% reported serious  related  adverse  events.  34.5%  of  the  patients  (10  patients)  with  HSR  reactions  have  been discontinued due to these SAEs. HSR are a known risk of oncaspar and are listed in the SmPC with frequency 'very common'. The results of this study doesn't reveal a new trend concerning this risk.

With regards to lab data, the most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values are in line with the known safety profile of S95014. No grade 4 values were reported. However, the MAH did not mention the antithrombine III decreased among the most frequently reported abnormal values while it was reported as the most frequently Grade 3/4 events. This should be clarified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

We noted also no deterioration in ECOG performance status over time.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

The safety results of lyophilized Oncaspar in the CL2-095014-003 paediatric study should be interpreted with  caution  regarding  the  study  descriptive  design,  the  population  sample  size  and  the  underlying disease. Moreover, more clarifications are needed from the MAH to better conclude about the SmPC amendments required at this stage.

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide clarification for considering the reported TEAEs as consistent with the known adverse reactions of S95014 as part of this procedure. (see section 'Request for supplementary information')

## 4. Request for supplementary information (RSI)

## 4.1. Major objections

NA

## 4.2. Other concerns

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure:

- 1) Low antithrombin activity is considered as the most frequently reported AEs with oncaspar in this  study.  Of  note,  results  of  the  previous  study,  CL2-095014-002  showed  also  a  higher frequency  of  Low  antithrombin  activity  with  lyophilized  formulation  (LYO)  of  Oncaspar® compared to the liquid formulation.

According to oncaspar's SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 4.4 of the smpc. The MAH is requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product smpc accordingly.

- 2) The MAH is also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar's SmPc. This discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of those events. Update of Smpc should be also discussed accordingly.
- 3) Toxic  neuropathy  were  reported  among  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  in  this  study  and concerned 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc, the MAH is requested to provide more details concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events).

## 4.3. MS comment

MS comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

RSI question 1 is supported. Furthermore, in the previously reported phase 2 clinical study, CL2-095014002, where lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar®  was compared against the liquid formulation (LIQ), the frequency of Low antithrombin activity was seen more often in the LYO group than the LIQ group: 35/43 patients (81.4%) versus 27/43 patients (62.8%) at Day 10; 35/41 patients (85.4%) versus 25/43 patients (58.1%) at Day 17; and 26/41 patients (63.4%) versus 17/42 patients (40.5%) at Day 24. The applicant should also discuss the possible reasons for this difference in frequencies between the two formulations and the clinical relevance of this finding.

In addition, the results of the studies CL2-095014-002 and CL2-095014-003 should be discussed within the  next  PSUR,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  detected  inconsistencies'  with  the  current  SmPC  of Oncaspar.

## Rapp comment

Rapp thanks the MS for the raised comment. It's agreed that the results of the study CL2-095014-002 showed higher frequency of Low antithrombin activity with lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar® compared to the liquid formulation. Nevertheless, in the CL2-095014-003 study, the study design and treatment regimen are different (non- comparative study, different study drug dosage), thus we would suggest to keep the question focused on the latter study context and results.

Moreover, as suggested, further discussion is anticipated in the next PSUR.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop

## 4.4. MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question N°1:

Low antithrombin activity is considered as the most frequently reported AEs with oncaspar in this study. Of  note,  results  of  the  previous  study,  CL2-095014-002,showed  also  a  higher  frequency  of  Low antithrombin activity with lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar® compared to the liquid formulation. According to oncaspar's SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 4.4 of the smpc. The MAH is requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product smpc accordingly.

## MAH's response:

In study CL2-95014-003, 74 patients were treated with Oncaspar lyophilized formulation. One hundred and fifty-seven (157) 'antithrombin III decreased' treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to Oncaspar (i.e., related to Oncaspar only or to Oncaspar and backbone therapy) were reported for 53 patients, which represents 71.6% of treated patients. This is indeed the most frequent related TEAEs for this  study.  None  of  these  AEs  were  reported  as  serious.  Among  the  53  patients,  31  had  received corticosteroids  (dexamethasone,  methylprednisolone,  prednisolone)  to  prevent  or  relieve  allergic reactions while under treatment with Oncaspar. This observation is aligned with current EU SmPC Section 4.5: When glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) and pegaspargase are given at the same time, alterations in coagulation parameters (e.g., fall in fibrinogen and antithrombin III deficiency, ATIII) can be more pronounced. For the remaining 22 patients, no glucocorticoid was taken as concomitant medication. Yet, all  patients  were  treated  with  dexamethasone  as  part  of  the  backbone  therapy  of  the  ALL-MB  2015 protocol.

In study CL2-95014-002, 88 patients received one infusion of Oncaspar (43 with lyophilizate formulation and 45 with liquid formulation). Fifty-nine (59) 'antithrombin III decrease' TEAEs related to Oncaspar

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were reported for 59 patients (one event per patient), which represents 67% of treated patients. Among the 59 AE, 31 AEs for 31 patients are reported in the lyophilized arm (72.1% of patients) and 28 AEs for 28 patients (62.2% of patients) are reported in the liquid arm. This AE is the second most frequent related TEAE of this study, whatever the treatment arm. Similarly to study CL2-95014-003, 5 patients among the 59 received corticosteroids while under treatment with Oncaspar (3 from the lyophilized arm, and 2 from the liquid arm) and all patients received dexamethasone as part of ALL-MB 2015 protocol. There were 3 treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) of antithrombin III decreased reported for 3 patients (3.4% of treated patients): they were not reported as serious by investigators, and were upgraded to 'serious' by the sponsor. These three related SAE were of Grade 4 in severity and concerned 2 patients in the lyophilized arm and 1 patient in the liquid arm.

Thus, occurrence of 'Antithrombin III decreased' in both studies is related to Oncaspar but two factors could partly explain the relatively high occurrence in these trials:

- -intake of glucocorticoids as concomitant medication or as part of the backbone chemotherapy agents outlined in the ALL-MB 2015 protocol on top of Oncaspar,
- -ALLMB 2015 protocol requiring a measurement of antithrombin III levels before each infusion (MB-protocol section 29.8 / 29.13), which can lead to a higher AE detection compared to other protocols using asparaginase at same dose of 1000 IU/m2 (e.g. the UKALL and NOPHO protocols require follow-up of thromboembolism AEs but not specifically level in antithrombin III before each infusion).

Currently, risks of 'coagulopathy' and 'blood fibrinogen decreased' associated with Oncaspar are listed in the EU SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8.  It is also mentioned in section 4.4: 'When there is a marked decrease in fibrinogen or antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, consider appropriate replacement therapy'. The risk of antithrombin III decreased is reported when Oncaspar is associated with glucocorticoids in the EU SmPC section 4.5.

Despite these potential reasons, relationship to Oncaspar cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the MAH agrees to add AE 'Antithrombin III decreased' based on frequency observed in the CL2-95014-002 and CL295014-003 studies.  As  the  frequency  of  antithrombin  III  AE  related  to  Oncaspar  is  67%  of  treated patients (59 over 88 treated patients) in the 002 study, and 71.6 % of patients (53 over 74 patients) in the 003 study. Thus, the MAH proposes to add the AE 'antithrombin III decrease' with the frequency 'very comm on' (frequency ≥1/10) in section 4.8 of the EU SmPC.

Proposed Updates of the Product Information:

MAH proposes to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the EU SmPC of Oncaspar as follows:

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

(…)

## Coagulopathy

Serious  thrombotic  events,  including  sagittal  sinus  thrombosis  can  occur  in  patients  receiving pegaspargase (see section 4.8). Oncaspar should be discontinued in patients with serious thrombotic events.

Increased prothrombin time (PT), increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and hypofibrinogenaemia and antithrombin III decrease can occur in patients receiving pegaspargase. Coagulation parameters should be monitored at baseline and periodically during and after treatment, particularly when other medicinal  products  with  anticoagulant  effects  (such  as  acetylsalicylic  acid  and  non-steroidal  antiinflammatory  medicinal  products)  are  used  simultaneously  (see  section  4.5),  or  when  concomitant chemotherapy  regimen  including  methotrexate,  daunorubicin,  corticosteroids  is  administered.  When

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

there is a marked decrease in fibrinogen or antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, consider appropriate replacement therapy.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The adverse reactions described in this section are derived from clinical studies data and post-marketing experience  of  Oncaspar  in  ALL  patients.  The  safety  profile  is  based  on  randomised,  controlled, prospective,  open  label  multicentre  studies  using  Oncaspar  at  a  dose  of  2500 U/m2  administered intravenously as a comparative treatment (studies DFCI 11-001 and AALL07P4). In addition, the safety profile included data from other Oncaspar studies such as the study comparing the pharmacokinetics of the liquid and the lyophilized formulations of pegaspargase (CL2-95014-002), its roll-over study (CL295014-003)  and  studies  using  the  intramuscular  route  of  administration  (studies  CCG-1962  and CCG-1991) (see section 5.1 for CCG-1962 and CCG-1991).

**** See the text in question 2.

The MAH proposes not to update the Patient Leaflet because blood clots are mentioned as 'very common' in section 4 'possible side effects'. In addition, a warning about the risk of coagulopathy is explained in section 2 under paragraph 'Warnings and precautions' as follows:

'This medicine can lead to fluctuations in clotting factors and may increase the risk of bleeding and/or clotting.'

## Assessor's comments

The MAH confirmed that 'antithrombin III decreased' treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are the most frequent related TEAEs with oncaspar in both studies CL2-95014-003 and CL2-95014-002 and proposed consequently an update of the oncaspar smpc in order to include this risk in the section 4.4 as follows:

## Coagulopathy:

Serious  thrombotic  events,  including  sagittal  sinus  thrombosis  can  occur  in  patients  receiving pegaspargase (see section 4.8). Oncaspar should be discontinued in patients with serious thrombotic events.

Increased prothrombin time (PT), increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and hypofibrinogenaemia and antithrombin III decrease can occur in patients receiving pegaspargase. Coagulation parameters should be monitored at baseline and periodically during and after treatment, particularly when other medicinal  products  with  anticoagulant  effects  (such  as  acetylsalicylic  acid  and  non-steroidal  anti-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

inflammatory  medicinal  products)  are  used  simultaneously  (see  section  4.5),  or  when  concomitant chemotherapy regimen including methotrexate, daunorubicin, corticosteroids is administered.

When  there  is  a  marked  decrease  in  fibrinogen  or  antithrombin  III  (ATIII)  deficiency,  consider appropriate replacement therapy.

The MAH proposed also to update the section 4.8 in order to add the risk of 'antithrombin III decreased' among the most commonly reported AEs in the SOC 'investigations' according to the recent clinical studies (CL2-95014-002 and CL2-95014-003) data.

We agree with the MAH's proposal to update both product SmPC's sections 4.4 and 4.8.

The MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly.

## Question N°2:

The MAH is also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar's SmPC. This discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of those events. Update of Smpc should be also discussed accordingly.

## MAH's response:

In  study  CL2-95014-003,  74  patients  were  treated  with  Oncaspar.  Seventy-two  (72)  'neutropenia' TEAEs related to Oncaspar (i.e. related to Oncaspar only or to Oncaspar and backbone therapy) were reported  for  37  patients,  which  represents  50.0%  of  treated  patients.  Seven  (7)  'neutrophil  count decreased' TEAEs related to Oncaspar (i.e., related to Oncaspar only or to Oncaspar and backbone therapy)  were  reported  for  5  patients,  which  represents  6.8%  of  treated  patients.  Thus,  the  total frequency of 'neutropenia' and 'neutrophil count decrease' related to Oncaspar is 56.8% of treated patients (42 patients with these related TEAEs over 74 treated patients).

The 72 related TEAEs with preferred term 'neutropenia' were of grade 2 to 4 and all reported as nonserious except for one patient where event 'neutropenia' of grade 4 seriousness was upgraded by the sponsor to 'serious' as following an event of sepsis. The 7 TEAEs with preferred term 'neutrophil count decreased' were of grade 3 to 4 and all reported as non-serious AEs associated with neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased are reported with no associated symptom. No action taken with study treatment (referred as 'IMP' in the CSR) was reported for these events. Thus, these AEs do not have a significant clinical relevance on patients.

Considering  the  overall  frequency  of  56.8%  for  treatment-related  neutropenia  and  neutrophil  count decreases reported in the CL2-95014-003 study, the MAH agrees to update the frequency of neutrophil count decrease in the Oncaspar SmPC from 'not known' to 'v ery common' (frequency ≥1/10) in section 4.8 of the EU SmPC. As neutropenia is a synonym of neutrophil counts decrease, only neutrophil count decrease terminology is used for update in the Oncaspar EU SmPC.

Proposed Updates of the Product Information:

The MAH proposes to update section 4.8 of the EU SmPC of Oncaspar as follows:

**** Cases of antithrombin III and neutrophil count decreased were observed in CL2-95014002 and CL2-95014-003 studies

In addition, the MAH proposes to update the corresponding section of the patient leaflet of the Product Information in section 4 'possible side effects' - 'Other side effects' as follows:

Other side effects

Talk to your doctor if you get any of the following:

Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

- -Changes in the function of the pancreas;
- -Weight loss;
- -Leg pain (which could be a symptom of thrombosis), chest pain or shortness of breath (which may be a symptom of blood clots in the lungs, called pulmonary embolism);
- -Loss of appetite, general weakness, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea;
- -Increased blood sugar levels;
- -Decreased number of white blood cells.

Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)

- -Decreased number of white blood cells and platelets;

(…)

## Assessor's comments

The MAH confirmed that 50% of the CL2-95014-003 study population experimented neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased related to oncaspar and proposed to amend the frequency of this risk in the section 4.8 from 'not known' to 'very common'. Moreover, the MAH proposed to amend the section 4 of the patient's leaflet accordingly. The MAH's proposals FOR SmPC update are endorsed.

The MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly.

## Question N°3:

Toxic neuropathy were reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and concerned 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc, the MAH is requested to provide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

more details concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events).

## MAH's response:

In the study CL2-95014-003, 5 'toxic neuropathy' TEAE were reported for 5 patients, which represent 6.8% of treated patients.  None of the cases of toxic neuropathy reported were related to Oncaspar. Summary information contained in CSR listing provide the following information: preferred term, grade, start/stop dates, seriousness, causality assessment, outcome, and action taken with study treatment. All AEs were reported as related to the backbone therapies, mostly vincristine, for which neurotoxicity is a known AE. These AE severities varied from grade 1 to 2 and were reported as 'non-serious'. No dose interruption or dose modification of Oncaspar occurred due to these events. All AE are recovered, and no sequelae was reported. No narrative is available for these events as they did not meet criteria for narrative  writing  (criteria  such  as  death,  serious  AE,  event  of  special  interest,  AE  leading  to  study treatment discontinuation).

Oncaspar EU SmPC contains information regarding central nervous system disorders:

-  Section  4.4:  'Oncaspar  may  cause  central  nervous  system  signs  and  symptoms  manifesting  as somnolence, confusion, convulsions. Patients should be closely monitored for such symptoms, especially if Oncaspar is used in association with neurotoxic products (such as vincristine and methotrexate; see section 4.5);

-  section  4.5:  'Immediately  preceding  or  simultaneous  treatment  with  vincristine  can  increase  the toxicity of pegaspargase. Administration of Oncaspar before vincristine may increase the neurotoxicity of vincristine. Therefore, vincristine should be given at least 12 hours prior to administration of Oncaspar in order to minimise toxicity.',

- section 4.8: 'peripheral motor neuropathy' is listed,

In summary, AE of toxic neuropathy are reported by investigators as not related to Oncaspar but rather to concomitant chemotherapy known to induce neurotoxicity. Thus, the MAH proposes not to add the AE \"toxic neuropathy\" to the EU SmPC.

## Assessor's comments

The MAH clarified that the 5 cases of toxic neuropathy were not serious, not related to oncaspar and didn't require oncaspar's interruption or dose modification. The narratives were not provided because the cases did not meet criteria for narrative writing. The MAH added also that neurological disorders are adequately described in oncaspar's SmPC (section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).

The MAH's response is approvable.

## 4.5. Discussion on clinical aspects after first RSI assessment

The MAH was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product smpc accordingly. Moreover, the MAH was also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased's frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar's SmPc. The MAH confirmed as part of the RSI responses that 'antithrombin III decreased' treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are the most frequent related TEAEs with oncaspar in both studies CL2-95014-003 and CL2-95014-002 and proposed consequently an update of the oncaspar smpc in order to include this risk in the section 4.4 and in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. In the other hand, the MAH confirmed that 50% of the CL2-95014-003 study population experimented neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased related to oncaspar and proposed to amend the frequency of this risk in the section 4.8 from 'not known' to 'very common' and to amend the PL accordingly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Toxic neuropathy was reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and was reported in 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar SmPC, the MAH was requested to provide more details concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events). The MAH clarified that  the  5  cases  of  toxic  neuropathy  were  not  serious,  not  related  to  Oncaspar  and  didn't  require oncaspar's interruption or dose modification. The narratives were not provided because the cases did not meet criteria for narrative writing. The MAH added also that neurological disorders are adequately described in oncaspar's SmpC (section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).

The proposed change in the SmPC are agreed and the relevant variation to include them as per general guidance on P46 procedure should be provided in a timely manner.

## 5. Overall conclusion and recommendation after first RSI

The safety results of lyophilized Oncaspar in the CL2-095014-003 paediatric study should be interpreted with  caution  regarding  the  study  descriptive  design,  the  population  sample  size  and  the  underlying disease. SmPc amendments were proposed by the MAH as part of RSI response and are approved. The MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly.
