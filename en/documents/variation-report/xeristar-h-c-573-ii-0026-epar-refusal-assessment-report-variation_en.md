## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1. Introduction

Duloxetine  is  classified  as  a  serotonin  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI).  It  is  a  selective inhibitor of both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) receptors. Both 5-HT and NE have been implicated in the mediation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord.

Duloxetine is currently approved under the trade name Cymbalta/Xeristar for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults and treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and under the trade name Yentreve/Ariclaim for the diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) in adults and the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

- To  stratify  for  presence  or  absence  of  current  major  depressive  disorder  seems  reasonable  to establish  whether  the  effect  of  duloxetine  in  patients  with  fibromyalgia  is  dependent  of  its antidepressant effect.

This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indication for Xeristar to include the treatment of fibromyalgia with or without depression. 2. Non Clinical Aspects Environmental risk assessment (ERA) Based  on  the  updated  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  and  the  study  reports  submitted  by  the Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH),  the  CHMP  asked  the  MAH  to  update  the  Predicted Environmental  Concentration  in  surface  water  (PEC surface  water)  refinement.  Further  to  the  data submitted by the MAH the CHMP considered this concern to have been addressed. 3. Clinical Aspects 3.1 GCP aspects All studies referred to this application are stated to be Good Clinical Practice principles compliant. Statistical analyses and study reporting were conducted in compliance with the principles described in the relevant International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. In addition, the MAH confirmed that the ethical requirements of the clinical trial directive 2001/20/EC were applied for clinical trials conducted outside the European Union (EU). 3.2 Scientific Advice A  CHMP  scientific  advice  was  requested  by  the  MAH,  on  the  clinical  development  program  of duloxetine in fibromyalgia and the response was given on the 21 October 2004. The key aspects of the CHMP recommendations were the following: · Fibromyalgia is an ill defined and extremely heterogeneous condition without universal consensus on its characteristic and diagnostic features and no objective investigations to aid diagnosis, but the use of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria is supported. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- With regard to study duration, for short-term treatment of fibromyalgia at least 12 weeks on stable dose is required but for long-term (maintenance of effect, tolerance), an open label extension of 12 months is required.
- If the co-primary endpoints (pain endpoint and patient global assessment) proposed by the MAH are met, then it is possible that an indication reflecting fibromyalgia syndrome might be granted. If the key secondary endpoints also show positive effects, this would greatly enhance the credibility of the \"syndrome\" indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The full package (5 studies) could be sufficient to grant a marketing authorisation but the exact wording of the indication cannot be determined until the studies have been completed and data assessed.

## 3.3 Clinical pharmacology

No new clinical pharmacology studies have been completed to support the fibromyalgia indication. A population  pharmacokinetic  (Pop  PK)  analysis  that  included  patients  from  a  Phase  3  study  in fibromyalgia (HMEF) is included to support this submission.

Smoking status and sex had an effect on the bioavailability of duloxetine. Dose and age had an effect on CL/F, whereas ethnic origin had an effect on V/F. As disease condition was not identified as a statistically significant covariate, the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine are not dependent on the disease. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine are not dependent on body weight or dosing regimen.

Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data from patients with MDD, SUI, DPNP, or fibromyalgia were analyzed using the nonlinear  mixed-effects  modelling  program  (NONMEM),  Version  5.    A  total  of  2002  duloxetine plasma concentrations from 594 patients enrolled in Phase 2 or 3 clinical studies for MDD (Studies HMAQ and HMAU), SUI (Study SAAW), DNP (Study HMAVa), or fibromyalgia (Study HMEF) were included. Duloxetine pharmacokinetics were adequately described using a one-compartment model, parameterized in terms of absorption rate constant (Ka), oral clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V/F). Five  covariates,  smoking  status,  gender,  dose,  age,  and  ethnic  origin,  were  identified  as  having  a statistically significant influence on duloxetine pharmacokinetics. These covariates were identified in prior  analyses  to  affect  duloxetine's  pharmacokinetics,  except  for  ethnic  origin  (see  Table  2.7.2.1 below). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Women had 64% higher average duloxetine concentrations at steady state (Cav,ss) than males receiving the  same  dose  of  duloxetine.    Similarly,  non-smokers  had  nearly  43%  higher  Cav,ss  than  smokers receiving  the  same  dose  of  duloxetine.    Non-smoking  female  patients  had  a  C av,ss nearly  2.3  times higher  than  smoking  male  patients  receiving  the  same  dose  of  duloxetine.  The  effect  of  sex  and smoking status is likely related to the higher CYP1A2 activity or concentration in men and smokers.

In Study HMEF the relationship between duloxetine exposure and efficacy response was investigated. There is a duloxetine concentration dependent increase in BPI-average pain score reduction such that when duloxetine dose is doubled from 60 mg (typical average drug concentration at steady state [Cav,ss] = 72 ng/mL) to 120 mg (Cav,ss = 189 ng/mL at 120 mg), there is a 49% increase in BPI-average pain score reduction (that is, from -1.08 to -1.62) and a 22% increase in area under the concentration curve to  pain  relief  (AUCpain  relief)  (that  is,  from  224  to  272).  There  did  not  appear  to  be  an  effect  of duloxetine Cav,ss on 30% or 50% reduction in BPI-average pain score.

The effects of age, dose, and ethnic origin on Cav,ss are minor and less than those noted with sex and smoking status.  The effect of doubling the duloxetine dose (30 mg to 60 mg or 60 mg to 120 mg) resulted in 2.3 and 2.6 times the Cav,ss, respectively. Oral clearance (CL/F) decreased 25% in the age range of 29 years (5th percentile) to 69 years (95th percentile of this dataset).  Ethnic origin had an effect  on  V/F,  in  Hispanic  patients  being  2  times  higher  than  the  value  estimated  for  non-Hispanic patients. As ethnic origin did not have an effect on CL/F, the Cav,ss at a dose is the same for all patients irrespective of their ethnic origin. Overall, the combined effects of sex, smoking, age, dose, and ethnic origin explained only about 8% and 27% of the interpatient variability in CL/F and volume of distribution (V/F), respectively.  There remains a high degree of interpatient variability (60 to 100%) unexplained in duloxetine pharmacokinetics. As the magnitude of the effect of these covariates are small relative to the magnitude of interpatient variability, specific dose recommendations for duloxetine based upon sex, smoking status, age, dose, or ethnic origin are not warranted. · Concentration-response relationship Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## CHMP conclusions

A  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  on  patients  with  MDD,  SUI,  DPNP  or  fibromyalgia  (594 patients)  revealed  a  statistically  significant  effect  of  sex,  smoking  status,  age,  and  ethnic  origin  on duloxetine  pharmacokinetics.  These  findings  fall  into  line  with  those  already  provided  by  previous analyses. The clinical impact of them appears to be at present limited. The interpatient variability is much superior to that attributed to those identified factors and makes unnecessary a specific dosage recommendation based on any of them.

## 3.4 Clinical efficacy

The clinical development plan for the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia includes 4 placebo-controlled studies ( Study HMBO, Study HMCA, Study HMCJ, and Study HMEF) with 876 duloxetine-treated patients and 535 placebo-treated patients, and one long-term uncontrolled study (Study  HMEH) with  350  duloxetine-treated  patients  (double-blind  comparison  of  60  mg  and  120 mg). These studies are summarised in the table below, and then dealt with individually further down in this report.

## Methods

## · Population

All studies enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who fulfilled the ACR criteria for fibromyalgia (widespread aching pain in all 4 quadrants of the body and axial skeleton for &gt;3 months duration and ≥ 11 of 18 tender points). A cut-off of ≥ 4 on the Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI) average pain score was required for study entry. Patients were stratified in the randomization based on their major depressive disease status at baseline in all 4 placebo-controlled studies. The MAH stated that entry criteria for these studies were chosen to ensure inclusion of moderately ill fibromyalgia patients with or without MDD but at the same time were broad enough to ensure generalizability for practical clinical  use. Efforts were made to include patients of both genders.

· Key exclusion Criteria ● Any current primary Axis I diagnosis other than MDD (except in Study HMEH). ● Pain  symptoms  related  to  traumatic  injury,  structural  rheumatic  disease,  or  regional  rheumatic disease (such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, and tendonitis). ● Rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or infectious arthritis, or an autoimmune disease (eg. systemic lupus erythematosus). ● Use  of  any  excluded  medications  that  could  not  be  discontinued  at  Visit  1  (e.g.  narcotics,  Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), tramadol, triptans, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants). · Objective The main objective of all four placebo-controlled studies was to assess the efficacy of duloxetine on the reduction of pain severity in patients with fibromyalgia with or without MDD (two of these, HMCJ and HMEF, included a functional measure as a co primary endpoint). Study HMEH, was conducted to assess longer-term safety and tolerability but a secondary objective was to evaluate the persistence of efficacy over 12 month's treatment. · Statistical methods In general, treatment group differences in continuous measures were based on comparisons of LeastSquares Mean (LSMean) change from baseline (or LSMeans at endpoint for the PGI-Improvement) derived from an analysis of covariance model. Mean change analyses were implemented using LastObservation-Carried Forward (LOCF). Mixed-effects repeated measures modelling (MMRM analysis) was also implemented to provide visit wise comparisons between groups, but for the purpose of this overview  the  focus  is  on  the  LOCF  analyses.  Categorical  measures  were  compared  using  Fisher's exact  test  and/or  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  for  general  association  adjusting  for investigative  sites.  Study  HMCJ  and  Study  HMEF  included  gatekeeper  strategies  for  selected secondary  endpoints  to  adjust  for  multiplicity  associated  with  multiple  endpoints,  doses  and  time points. To make side-by-side comparisons of findings from the 4 placebo-controlled studies uniform, the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were standardized to remove any inconsistencies in findings that  may  have  been  attributable  to  the  use  of  slightly  different  analytic  models  between  the  earlier studies  (Study  HMBO  and  Study  HMCA)  and  the  more  recent  studies  (Study  HMCJ  and  Study HMEF). In all cases, the results from the standardized analyses were consistent with those presented in the individual clinical study reports (CSRs). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## · Efficacy Variables

All five studies focused on pain as the primary endpoint measure. The Study HMBO utilized both the Fibromyalgia  Impact  Questionnaire ( FIQ)  total  score  and  the  FIQ  pain  severity  item  score  as  co primary  endpoints.  In  the  four  subsequent  studies,  the  Brief  Pain  Inventory  (BPI)  assessment  scale (using the average pain severity) was employed as primary endpoint. The Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale was selected as a co primary measure in HMCJ and HMEF to deal with additional symptoms, such as tenderness, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety and sleep, mood and cognitive disturbances with a major impact in physical and emotional function of patients and ensure that changes seen in the BPI were clinically meaningful for the patient. The PGI-Improvement scale

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was a secondary measure in HMBO and HMCA. Response rates were compared, defined as either a ≥ 50% or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline at endpoint only in the BPI average pain score. Persistence of effect  was  evaluated in  patients  who remained  on  60  mg  for  52  weeks  after  having  at  least  a  50% reduction on the BPI average pain score during the 8 week open label phase (Study HMEH).

## Primary Endpoint measures

- The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) -Modified Short Form (Severity and Interference scores) is a selfreported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. It was developed as a pain assessment tool for use with cancer patients. The Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing the severity for worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The interference scores (used as secondary outcome measure) range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). The average interference score is the arithmetic mean of the 7 interference questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.
- The Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-Improvement) scale is self-administered scale that measures the degree of overall improvement at the time of assessment with respect to the patient's status at randomization. The score ranges from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). · The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a self-administered specific health questionnaire which evaluates current health status in patients with fibromyalgia. It is one of the most commonly used tool for clinical investigations in this condition. The total FIQ score assess physical function in 11 items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale, two items measure the number of days the patient felt  well  and  the  number  of  days  the  patient  felt  unable  to  work  due  to  his/her  fibromyalgia symptoms, and the seven other components assess in 11-point Likert-type scales (marked in 10mm  increments)  work  difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning  tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 80 with a higher score indicative of more negative impact. Secondary Endpoint measures Besides  the  components  of  the  BPI  and  FIQ  scores  not  used  as  primary  endpoint  measures,  the following variables are analyzed as secondary outcomes. · The patient-rated Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is used to assess the patient's general level of disability. The scale measures a patient's evaluation of the degree to which his or her symptoms have disrupted work, social, and/or home life. The score ranges from 0 to 30 with a lower score indicating a lower level of disability. · The Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-Severity) scale evaluates the severity of illness at the time of assessment from the clinician's perspective. The score ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). It is robust, simple and sensitive to change, reproducing  the  clinical  judgment  in  daily  practice.  However  it  is  subjective  in  its  nature  and requires an in-depth knowledge of patient and patient history. Medicinal Product no longer authorised
- The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item, self-reporting instrument designed to collect  data  on  the  following  5  dimensions:  general  fatigue,  physical  fatigue,  mental  fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Each dimension score is derived by summing the scores of the 4 individual items that pertain to each dimension. Dimensional scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score reflecting greater levels of fatigue.
- Tender  Point  Pain  Thresholds are  assessed  for  all  18  tender  points  by  a  study  physician  or qualified study personnel accordingly with training materials. A dolorimeter (algometer) was used to  exert  the  pressure  at  each  point  and  to  measure  the  threshold  reading;  when  the  patient  first indicates pain, the threshold is recorded in kg/cm 2 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The  self-administered  36-item  Short-Form  Health  Survey (SF-36)  consists  of  36  questions covering  8  health  domains:  physical  functioning,  bodily  pain,  role  limitations  due  to  physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality.
- Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100  scale,  with  higher  scores  indicating  better  health  status  or  functioning.  The  Physical  and Mental Component scores are constructed based on the 8 SF-36 domains.
- The EuroQoL Questionnaire-5Dimension (EQ-5D) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The scale allows patients to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 is generated for each domain. For each patient, the outcomes from the 5 domains are mapped to a single index (score) through an algorithm. The index ranges between -0.59 and 1 with the higher score indicating a better health state as perceived by the patient.

· Repeated  measures  analysis  for  the  FIQ  Total  Score  demonstrated  statistically  significant superiority  of  duloxetine  over  placebo  only  at  4 th and  12 th weeks  (last  visit)  of  treatment.  No statistically significant superiority of duloxetine at the last visit (12 th week) was observed in repeated measures  analysis  for  the  FIQ  Pain  Item  Score  (duloxetine  only  was  statistically  significantly superior to placebo at 1 st , 2 nd and 4 th week).

Results Study HMBO Study  HMBO  was  a  Phase  2,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  fixed-dose,  placebo-controlled  study  in male  and  female  patients,  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  duloxetine  60  mg  BID  (twice  daily) compared with placebo at the end of the 12-week therapy phase in reducing both the pain severity as measured  by  the  FIQ  Pain  Item  and  the  FIQ  Total  Score  in  patients  with  ACR  defined  primary fibromyalgia, with or without MDD. Results No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  age, gender, origin, weight, presence of MDD, or presence of secondary anxiety disorder. A significantly greater percentage of placebo-treated patients took antidepressants before entering the study compared with  duloxetine-treated  patients  [51  (49.51%)  vs.  35  (33.65%),  p=0.024].  Antidepressants  were reported as taken either for mood or pain control. The difference in the percentage of patients who previously  took  antidepressants  was  not  statistically  significantly  different  between  MDD  patients (48.1%)  and  non-MDD  patients  (37.5%).  A  statistically  significant  treatment  group  difference  was observed in patients who received at least one previous medication for insomnia [29 (28.2%) vs. 16 (15.4%)  in  placebo  and  duloxetine  groups,  respectively,  p=0.029].  No  statistically  significant treatment group differences were observed in study drug compliance at any visit or overall. Primary outcome measures · The mean change analysis (from baseline to endpoint) for the FIQ Total Score and FIQ Pain Item Score showed that duloxetine treatment group had numerically greater improvement than the placebo treatment  groups  in  both  endpoint  measures,  but  differences  were  non-statistically  significant  (p= 0.080 for FIQ total and p=0.090 for FIQ Pain).

· After accounting for baseline imbalance in previous antidepressant use, statistically significant treatment superiority of duloxetine over placebo was observed for FIQ Total Score (p=.042) and  a  marginally  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  for  FIQ  Pain  Item Score (p=.053).

Subgroup analysis of primary endpoints Subgroup analyses were performed accounting by demographical, investigator and baseline imbalanced variables. · Gender: Duloxetine-treated female patients showed statistically significant improvement for both primary efficacy measures (FIQ Total Score and FIQ Pain Item Score) compared with the placebo-treated  female  patients.  In  contrast,  in  male  patients,  outcomes  on  these  measures were either marginally statistically significant or statistically significant in favour of placebo (FIQ Total Score, p=.076; FIQ Pain Item Score, p=.037). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

- Baseline  imbalance  on  previous  antidepressant  use  was  also  observed  between  treatment groups for female patients (placebo 51.1% versus duloxetine 34.8%, p=.037). By accounting for this imbalance while evaluating the treatment effect, treatment-group differences observed were  more  significant  than  when  the  analysis  was  performed  without  accounting  for  this baseline  difference.  For  FIQ  Total  and  FIQ  Pain  scores  in  randomized  female  patients, statistically significant superiority of duloxetine over placebo was observed at the significance level of p=.017 and p=.024, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- No statistically significant treatment-by-MDD interaction was observed for either FIQ Total or FIQ Pain Item Score in the whole population studied or the female subgroup. The repeated measures analysis did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of duloxetine over placebo in FIQ Pain Item Score for patients with or without MDD at the last visit of the acute therapy  phase  (Visit  10).  Duloxetine  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  at relieving  pain  severity  in  non-depressed  patients  at  Visits  4,  5,  and  6.  The  results  for  the depressed patients followed this trend, but were not statistically significant.

On  all  secondary  efficacy  measures,  except  for  FIQ  Fatigue  and  Rest  Item  scores  and  BPI relationships  with  people  score,  duloxetine-treated  patients  demonstrated  statistically  significantly greater  improvement  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients  (by  mean  change  analysis  or  repeated measures analysis).

Among the 11 secondary variables analyzed, statistically significant treatment-by-gender interaction was  observed  for  two  variables  (BPI  Average  Pain  and  SDS  total  scores).  Marginally  significant interaction was observed for three variables (FIQ Total, FIQ Pain Item, and BPI Worst Pain scores). All of these scores were patient-rated scores. It is notable that on the physician-rated scores, such as two  variables  from  the  Tender  Point  assessment  and  CGI-Severity,  both  male  and  female  patients responded to study drug in the same direction.

Results for Mood and Anxiety Efficacy Assessments The mean change analysis did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of duloxetine over placebo  in  either  efficacy  assessment.  There  was  no  significant  treatment-by-MDD  interaction observed for either of the variables. Analyses of Response on FIQ Pain Item Score There  was  no  treatment  group  difference  observed  on  response  rates  at  endpoint.  However,  the duloxetine treatment group demonstrated statistically significant superiority on time-to-first response compared with the placebo treatment group. No treatment group difference was observed for in the analysis of FIQ Pain Item Score sustained response. Path Analysis for the Direct Analgesic Effect The path analysis was performed only on the female population, for which the mean change analysis demonstrated a statistically significant treatment difference on FIQ Pain Item Score. The direct effect of duloxetine on the reduction on the FIQ Pain Item Score accounted for 61.1% of the total treatment effect with p= .313. Indirect treatment effect through the improvement of mood symptoms (reflected in  change  in  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II  (BDI-II))  and  anxiety  symptoms  (reflected  in change  in Beck  Anxiety  Inventory  (BAI))  accounted  for  38.5%  and  0.5%,  respectively.  To  confirm  these findings, a similar analysis was conducted for BPI Average Pain Score in randomized female patients. The direct effect of duloxetine on the reduction of BPI Average Pain accounted for 83.3% of the total treatment  effect,  which  was  statistically  significant  (p=  .015).  Indirect  treatment  effect  through  the improvement of mood symptoms (reflected in change in BDI-II) and anxiety symptoms (reflected in change in BAI) accounted for 15.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Health Outcomes Measures The  superiority  of  duloxetine  over  placebo  on  the  improvement  of  health  outcome  status  was demonstrated for all measures obtained from SDS, for the total score of QLDS, and for 6 out of 10 variables obtained from SF-36.

## HMCA Study

Study HMCA was a Phase 3, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in women treated with either duloxetine 60 mg BID or 60 mg QD (once daily).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg BID compared with placebo on the  reduction  of  pain  severity  as  measured  by  the  average  pain  item  of  the  BPI  during  a  12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, therapy phase in women with ACR-defined primary fibromyalgia, with or without MDD.

## Results

This study included only women. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups in age,  gender,  origin,  weight,  presence  of  MDD,  or  presence  of  secondary  anxiety  disorder  were observed. No significant differences were observed for baseline measures of severity of illness, nor for alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, or smoking practices, historical diagnoses, previous pain control  treatments,  previous  treatments  for  depression,  anxiety  disorder,  panic  disorder,  fatigue,  or other. A significant difference among treatment groups was observed with regard to concomitant use of  zolpidem  being  much  more  infrequent  in  the  placebo  group.  A  significant  treatment-group difference  in  study  drug  compliance  was  observed  at  Visit  7.  Fewer  placebo-treated  patients  were compliant with study drug at Visit 7.

- FIQ  total  score :  Both  duloxetine  60  mg  BID  and  duloxetine  60  mg  QD  were  statistically superior to placebo (p&lt; .001) in the repeated measures and mean change analysis of the FIQ total score, with average improvement of 16.5% in placebo and around 32% in both groups of duloxetine.
- Other  Pain  and  General  Illness/Improvement  Efficacy  Assessments:  In  the  mean  change analyses, duloxetine 60 mg QD was statistically superior to placebo on all secondary measures (including BPI Worst Pain Severity, BPI Least Pain Severity, BPI Severity: Pain Right Now, BPI  Interference,  CGI-Severity,  PGI  -Improvement  and  HAMD17), except  for  mean  of  18 tender point thresholds (kg/cm 2 ) and number of tender points with a low threshold.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Duloxetine 60 mg BID was statistically superior to placebo on all secondary measures except for  HAMD17 total  score.  There  were  no  significant  differences  between  duloxetine  60  mg BID and duloxetine 60 mg QD.
- Analyses  of  BPI  Average  Pain  Response  Rates:  Sixty-one  (54%)  patients  treated  with duloxetine 60 mg BID and 64 (55%) patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg QD achieved a response  defined  as  a  30%  reduction  from  baseline  to  endpoint  compared  with  39  (33%) patients treated with placebo.
- Path Analysis for the Direct Analgesic Effect: For duloxetine 60 mg BID, the direct effect of duloxetine on the reduction on the BPI average pain score accounted for 87.5% of the total treatment  effect  with  p=.001.  Indirect  treatment  effect  through  the  improvement  of  mood symptoms (reflected in change in HAMD17) accounted for 12.5%. For duloxetine 60 mg QD, the direct effect of duloxetine on the reduction of the BPI average pain score accounted for 75.7%  of  the  total  treatment  effect  with  p=.006.  Indirect  treatment  effect  through  the improvement of mood symptoms (reflected in change in HAMD17) accounted for 24.4%.

No  statistically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  age,  gender,  origin,  weight, presence of MDD, or presence of secondary anxiety disorder were observed. Significant differences between groups included: a) the average number of beers consumed, with placebo showing the highest mean average number consumed, (b) a significantly higher rate of postmenopause in the duloxetine 20/60 group, (c) some secondary conditions with statistically significant treatment-group differences (although  not  clinically  relevant),  (d)  a  higher  incidence  of  use  for  methylprednisolone  previous therapy for fibromyalgia and/or depression in duloxetine 20/60 mg QD and (e) a higher incidence of use for calcium as concomitant therapy in duloxetine 20/60 mg QD. No significant differences were observed  for  the  BPI  average  pain,  FIQ  total  score,  Mean  Tender  Point  Threshold,  Count  of  Low Threshold,  CGI-Severity  or  PGI-Severity.  No  significant  differences  among  treatment  groups  were observed for baseline HAMD17 scores by MDD status. No significant treatment group differences in overall treatment compliance were observed.

Subgroup Analyses Subgroups were defined by age, origin, diagnosis of MDD, diagnosis of secondary anxiety, and prior antidepressant  medication  use.  No  statistically  significant  therapy-by-subgroup  interactions  were observed. Drug Dose, Drug Concentration, and Relationships to Response Overall,  both  doses  of  duloxetine  were  found  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  women  with fibromyalgia symptoms. On numerous measures, the 60 mg BID dose was found to be numerically superior to the 60 mg QD dose, but these differences tended to not be statistically significant. Drug-Drug and Drug-Disease Interactions There were no significant differences in concomitant acetaminophen use among the treatment groups. However,  duloxetine  60  mg  BID-treated  patients  used  a  significantly  lower  mean  daily  dose  of concomitant acetaminophen compared with duloxetine 60 mg QD-treated and placebo-treated patients. Health Outcomes/Quality of Life Evaluation Both duloxetine  treatment  groups  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  on  a  majority  of  the  SF-36 Items, QLDS index score and on the SDS total score. HMCJ Study Study  HMCJ  was  a  Phase  3,  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  fixed  dose, placebo-controlled study in male and female patients  designed to assess the efficacy of duloxetine 120 mg  QD  compared  with  placebo  on  the  treatment  of  pain  in  patients  with  ACR-defined  primary fibromyalgia, with or without MDD in the 3-month therapy phase of the study.

## HMEF Study

Study HMEF was a Phase 3, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled flexible-dose study in male and female patients designed to assess the efficacy of duloxetine 60/120 mg QD compared with placebo on the treatment of pain in patients with ACR-defined primary fibromyalgia, with or without MDD, during the 6-month therapy phase of the study.

## Results

There were no differences in terms of incidence of historical diagnoses, secondary conditions (except for  a  higher  incidence  of  hyperlipidaemia  in  duloxetine-treated  patients),  previous  therapy  for fibromyalgia and/or depression (except for higher incidence of amitriptyline and citalopram and lower incidence of tramadol in duloxetine-treated patients), and tobacco use and average alcohol consumption.  A  significant  treatment  group  difference  was  observed  for  the  use  of  zolpidem  as concomitant  therapy,  with  the  highest  incidence  of  use  in  duloxetine  patients.  No  significant differences were observed for the BPI average pain, FIQ total score, Mean Tender Point Threshold, Count of Low Threshold, CGI-Severity or PGI-Severity. No significant differences among treatment groups were observed for baseline HAMD17 scores by MDD status. Significantly more duloxetinetreated  patients  were  not  compliant  at  Visit  3  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients.  At  Visit  7 significantly  more  placebo-treated  patients  were  not  compliant  compared  with  duloxetine-treated patients. Primary Efficacy Analysis · BPI average pain score: Duloxetine-treated patients showed greater numerically improvement than did placebo-treated patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=.053). BPI  average  pain  score  mean  change  was  -1.11  (17.2%)  in  placebo  and  -1.66  (25.1%)  in duloxetine  groups.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  treatment-by  investigator  interaction (p=.015). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Health Outcomes/Quality-of-Life Evaluation · 3-Month  Therapy  Phase: No  statistically significant treatment-group differences were observed for all randomized patients or subgroup analysis (minor differences were observed between duloxetine 60 mg QD and duloxetine 60/120 mg QD groups) in SDS. Duloxetinetreated  patients  experienced  a  significant  improvement  for  the  SF-36  mental  component summary and the mental health domain compared with placebo-treated patients on the mean change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for  all  randomized  patients  in  the  acute  therapy  phase. Duloxetine also showed greater improvement compared with placebo on the SF-36 physical component summary, bodily pain, general health, physical functioning, role-emotional, rolephysical, social functioning, and vitality, but these differences were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences among treatment groups in EQ-5D. Subgroup Analyses There was a statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction for previous antidepressant use, for  which  duloxetine  treated  patients  had  statistically  significantly  greater  improvement  compared with placebo-treated patients, but not for patients without previous antidepressant use. A  statistically  significant  treatment-by-investigator  interaction  was  observed  in  the  mean  change analysis of the BPI average pain score. There were 36 investigators that enrolled patients; these were in  Germany,  Spain,  Sweden,  the  United  Kingdom  (UK),  and  the  United  States  (US).  Half  of  these investigators had fewer than 8 patients with baseline and endpoint data for the BPI average pain score and  were  pooled  into  1  investigator,  999,  for  analysis  purposes.  The  pooled  investigator  showed  a better  BPI  average  pain  result  for  duloxetine  than  for  placebo.  There  were  10  of  the  18  unpooled investigators  that  had  better  BPI  results  for  placebo  than  for  duloxetine.  These  were  from  Spain, Germany,  Sweden,  and  the  US  (all  UK  sites  were  pooled).  For  each  country  with  more  than  1 investigator, the results were not consistently better for 1 treatment than the other, suggesting that the treatment-by investigator interaction was not attributable to country-specific factors.

Study HMEH was a 1-year safety study consisting of an 8-week open-label period, followed by a 52week double-blind, randomized period. The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of duloxetine at doses up to 120 mg QD for up to 60 weeks in patients with ACR-defined primary fibromyalgia, with or without MDD. Additionally, Study HMEH contained an assessment of persistence of efficacy of duloxetine on pain based on those patients who, at the completion of the 60 mg QD open-label phase of the study, were randomized to remain on 60 mg QD.

## Results

No significant treatment group differences were observed in the baseline severity of fibromyalgia with a  BPI average pain score of, FIQ Total, CGI-severity score and PGI-severity score. A significantly greater rate of non-compliance for the last study visit (Visit 301) was observed within the duloxetine 120 mg QD treatment group when compared with duloxetine 60 mg QD treatment group. For all other visits  and  overall  compliance,  no  significant  differences  in  treatment  compliance  were  observed between treatment groups.

## Efficacy Analyses for the 8-week open-label study phase

Consistent improvement was noted across all efficacy measures, as denoted by the significant changes in mean score observed from baseline to endpoint for all efficacy measures (BPI Worst Pain, Least Pain,  Average  Pain,  Pain  Right  Now,  and  Average  Interference  scores,  BDI-II  Total,  BDI  Item  9 Score,  FIQ  Total  Score,  FIQ  Tiredness,  FIQ  Restedness  FIQ  Pain,  Mean  Tender  Point  Threshold, Count  of  Low  Threshold,  SDS  Global  Functional  Impairment  Total  Score,  CGI-Severity,  PGIImprovement). A total of 34.8% of patients were BPI responders at Visit 4, the end of the open-label study phase.

For persistence of efficacy analysis, mean change in BPI average pain from baseline to endpoint did  not  reach  significance  in  the  initial  responders  on  duloxetine  60  mg  QD.  However,  initial responders began and ended the double-blind study phase with mean BPI average pain scores in the mild range that were well below the mean baseline pain scores at Visit 2.

In  addition,  decreases  (improvements)  in  mean  average  pain  score  were  observed  for  no responders within both treatment groups. Response rates at endpoint were 40.2% for duloxetine 60QD and 39.11% for duloxetine 120QD.

Subgroups  analysis  by  BPI  response  status  during  the  double-blind  study  phase  showed  a significant difference with initial responders experiencing a lower (improvement) mean score at endpoint when compared with no responders. Within the no responder subgroup, a significantly lower (improvement) mean PGI-Improvement score at endpoint was observed with duloxetine 60 mg QD when compared with duloxetine 120 mg QD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- FIQ: The difference in the FIQ total score between treatment groups was significant where duloxetine  60  mg  QD  experienced  a  decrease  (improvement)  and  duloxetine  120  mg  QD experienced an increase (negative impact). For all other items, no significant differences were observed  with  comparisons  between  treatment  groups.  Subgroup  analysis  does  not  show relevant differences between groups.
- Tender Point Threshold: A significantly greater increase (improvement) in Mean Tender Point Threshold was observed with duloxetine 60 mg QD when compared with duloxetine 120 mg QD. Analysis by BPI response status in the double-blind study phase showed that within the no responder subgroup, a significantly greater increase in Mean Tender Point Threshold was observed  with  duloxetine  60  mg  QD  when  compared  with  duloxetine 120  mg  QD.  Several sub-analyses render no differences or differences favouring those with duloxetine 60 mg QD.

CHMP Assessment of Efficacy data Further  to  the  evaluation  of  the  initially  submitted  data  supporting  this  variation,  the  CHMP considered  that  although  some  degree  of  effect  could  be  observed  across  short-term  studies,  the robustness  of  the  efficacy  database  was  insufficient  to  conclude  a  relevant  effect  of  duloxetine  in patients with fibromyalgia. The MAH was requested to provide additional analyses in order to explore whether the modest effect could be regarded as consistently demonstrated and clinically relevant for the intended target population. In addition, the MAH was requested to demonstrate the persistence of efficacy at one year, since no significant benefit with increasing the duloxetine dose from 60 mg QD to 120 mg was shown. The CHMP major objections dealt with the following key aspects: Short-term efficacy of duloxetine in fibromyalgia Only one study (HMCA) performed entirely in the USA and including only woman had robust results in both primary and secondary variables. This study was designed after the preliminary study HMBO rendered  negative  results  on  primary  outcome  variables  (FIQ  total  and  FIQ  pain)  on  the  whole population and only positive results in the subgroup analysis by gender. Study HMCJ also obtained positive results in primary outcome variables, but again it was only developed in the USA, included male patients, and the results on secondary variables were less predictable than in the HMCA study. The first multinational study (HMEF) failed to show differences between active treatment and placebo due to a significant treatment-by-investigator interaction for primary and secondary efficacy variables. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The CHMP pointed out that a robust and clinically relevant short-term effect in the intended target population has  not  been  convincingly  demonstrated.  Results  from  pivotal  studies  show  inconsistent results regarding primary endpoints with a modest magnitude of effect. Moreover, the impact of the effect  on  primary  endpoints  on  relevant  secondary  effect  has  not  been  consistently  shown  across studies.  The  responder  data  presented  as  an  illustration  of  clinical  relevance  of  the  mean  effects demonstrated  in  the  primary  analyses  are  not  impressive.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  obvious  how discontinuations are treated in the responder analyses.

In  reply  to  CHMP  concerns,  the  MAH  has  submitted  several  3-month  post-hoc  responder  analyses where discontinuing patients, those who did not have a post baseline value or who did not have a final visit  value,  were considered as non-responders (named withdrawal failure approach). The results of these additional analyses can be summarized as follows:

- Responder definition in terms of reduction of pain after 3 month treatment. A lower magnitude of reduction  of  pain  (for  both  placebo  and  active  patients)  is  shown  when  the  withdrawal  failure approach is used.  When  using  the  more  restrictive  approach  of  at  least  50%  improvement  as  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

definition  of  responder,  slightly  above  25%  of  patients  responded  to  duloxetine,  while  slightly above  15%  responded  to  placebo.  This  meaning  that  when  this  more  conservative  handling  of missing data approach is adopted, the results in terms of differences from placebo remain constant (absolute difference between treatment arms of 10.8% in the pooled analysis) as compared to the LOCF approach (absolute difference between treatment arms of 11.4% in the pooled analysis), though the total number of patients responding falls from 35% to 27% among duloxetine treated patients and from 24% to 17% among placebo treated patients. The same trend is observed for sustained response: lower response rate for duloxetine and PBO when the Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) approach is used, though the net difference between treatment arms in the pooled analysis is kept (around 11%). No significant benefit with increasing doses from 60 mg BID or 120 mg QD is observed as compared to 60 mg QD. Remarkably, this flat response curve also involves the 20 mg dose.

· Responder definition in terms of PGI-Improvement: When response was presented according the patient perception of general functioning, 32% duloxetine patients defined their improvement as very  much better or much better at the end of the treatment (3 months therapy) versus 18% of placebo patients. · When  both  criteria  (pain  alleviation  and  personal  improvement)  were  put  together  in  order  to better  define  the  effect  of  duloxetine  in  reliable  terms  14%  patient  reduced  at  least  30%  their initial level of pain, feeling better or much better after placebo treatment. A modest response of 25% (in all studies lower than 30%, whatever dose is considered, except with 60 mg QD in study HMCA where the response rate was 30.5%) was observed after 3 months of duloxetine treatment. The CHMP considered that these additional analyses confirmed its initial opinion: the observed effect is modest and its clinical relevance is questionable. Furthermore, despite the consistent trend, overall only 1 out of 4 studies showed a consistent effect in both primary and secondary endpoints (despite the results  of  the  pooled  analyses).  The  CHMP  pointed  out  that  the  preliminary  study  HMBO  was negative in its primary endpoint (a disease specific instrument), study HMCJ showed a positive results in its primary analysis, but not consistently supported by the results on relevant secondary endpoints, and  finally,  study  HMEF  had  non-significant  results  (negative  study).  This  aspect  should  be considered when putting in perspective the value of the pooled analyses provided by the MAH. The CHMP  concluded  that  the  magnitude  of  the  short-term  effect  is  small  and  not  consistently accompanied  by  a  robust  effect  on  secondary  endpoints,  including  disease  specific  variables  and quality  of  life.  In  addition,  2  out  of  4  clinical  studies  failed  to  reach  statistical  significance  in  their primary endpoints. Representativeness of the studied population The CHMP considered that looking into the characteristics of patients included in pivotal studies, they are thought to represent a population of moderate severity in clinical setting. No special criteria were requested  for  the  selection  of  severe,  resistant  or  non-responder  to  previous  treatment  patients. Moreover, since duloxetine/placebo were not given as add-on therapy to background therapy, but all background treatments were removed before study therapy was initiated, it could be considered that the  enrolled  patient  population  would  in  principle  be  reasonably  likely  to  respond  to  treatment. Therefore the CHMP concluded that his fact adds doubts on the clinical relevance of the modest effect observed in clinical trials, which further question its relevance for real clinical practice. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  claimed  effect  of  duloxetine  has  not  been  replicated  in  all  studies.  Unfortunately  the  more negative trial was the only study in which EU citizens were enrolled. In the MAH's opinion the lack of statistical  differences  between  US  and  EU  patients  guarantees  the  extrapolation  of  results  among different  regions.  The  significant  treatment-by-investigator  interaction  for  primary  and  secondary variables detected in the multinational (EU) study does not support these conclusions. This fact may be  especially  relevant  considering  that  information  on  non-pharmacological  approaches  to  treat patients with fibromyalgia is limited or non-existing. Whether it might have an impact on the finally observed treatment effect and whether the application of these non-drug measures was homogeneous between US and EU remains unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP concluded that effect has not been demonstrated in an EU clinical setting. It is uncertain whether regional differences in medical and social culture (non-pharmacological treatment, diagnosis in clinical practice, etc.) preclude extrapolation from non-EU studies.

## Independence of the observed effect from the known effect of duloxetine on mood disorders

The CHMP observed that the influence of the potential effect of duloxetine on depression in the global response of fibromyalgia was evaluated taking into account the HAMD scores stratification and MDD diagnosis.  When  the  population  was  analyzed  according  the  HAMD  score,  it  can  be  observed  a numerical trend toward a lower placebo response inversely related to HAMD scoring categories. The opposite can be observed with duloxetine effect. This finding result in a consistent higher numerical treatment differences in terms of BPI as with higher HAMD scores, which is not completely consistent with  a  true  independent  effect.  The  same  trend  is  observed  when  patients  with  MDD  diagnosis  at baseline are considered as compared to non-MDD patients (independently from the HAMD scoring). The CHMP concluded that these findings support a strong non-specific component of the treatment effect and partially contradict the path analyses for the direct analgesic effect of duloxetine performed in the clinical studies. In clinical studies, the direct effect of duloxetine on the reduction on the pain appears  to  account  for  the  most  of  the  total  treatment  effect  versus  an  indirect  effect  through  the improvement of mood symptoms.

Long-term efficacy The CHMP pointed out that the complete absence of a dose-response relationship and the lack of a placebo arm in the long-term study preclude drawing conclusions on the maintenance of the effect with duloxetine in the long-term. The additional analysis provided by the MAH does not overcome this essential limitation of the study. The MAH proposed to include in the SPC a statement advising to stop treatment in patients not responding after an initial period of treatment. The CHMP believes that this is a reasonable proposal to be considered on an individual basis, but does not prevent the need for demonstrating that a long-term maintenance effect is present in the whole population. In addition, no data are available for the effect longer than 6-month period time. Only uncontrolled data of treatment up 1 year-treatment period are available. In reply to this concern, the MAH proposed to evaluate the response after 2 months of treatment. The CHMP argued that a modest short-term effect on pain is not deemed enough to get a long-term indication on the whole condition. Therefore, long-term placebocontrolled  data  have  been  requested  from  CHMP  since  the  long-term  maintenance  of  the  effect remains unproven. Conclusions The  concerns  raised  by  CHMP  remain.  The  short-term  effect  has  not  been  robustly  demonstrated. Only a small effect has been shown, which on the other hand has not been consistently demonstrated in all trials. Furthermore it is unlikely to be truly independent from the drug effect on mood disorders, a  frequent co-morbid condition in patients with fibromyalgia. Importantly, there are still caveats on whether  the  observed  results  from  pivotal  studies  are  relevant  and  reasonably  applicable  to  an  EU clinical setting. No demonstration on the long-term maintenance of the effect has been provided. The B/R remains negative. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Overall,  patients  who  experienced  and  reported  the  most  common  adverse  events  tended  to  do  so early, and they reported the events as being generally of mild to moderate severity.  No single event led to the discontinuation of more than 2% of patients in the primary placebo-controlled studies.

Adverse events The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  in  the  primary  placebo-controlled analyses set for events where the incidence in the duloxetine treatment group was ≥ 5.0% and the rate for duloxetine was significantly higher than placebo is summarized in the table below.

With  regard  to  gender,  more  females  than  males  reported  fatigue  (about  twice  as  many)  and somnolence (about 5 times as many).  However, the clinical relevance of the subgroup analyses was limited by the small number of male patients.

With regards to age, the adverse event profile for older patients was similar to that of the younger group.  Decreased appetite was reported approximately 2 times more frequently in the &lt; 55-year-old subgroup compared with the ≥ 55-year-old subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of the most common adverse events was similar in the subgroups of &lt;65 years old and ≥ 65 years old; however, few patients were in the latter subgroup.

For  reasons  that  are  unclear,  non-Caucasian  patients  appeared  to  report  most  adverse  events  more frequently.    This  finding  may  be  related  to  cultural  differences  in  the  way  adverse  events  were perceived and reported.  Somnolence, in particular, was reported more frequently in the non-Caucasian subgroup (21.0%) compared with the Caucasian subgroup (8.0%).

## Serious Adverse Events

Abbreviations:  Cauc = Caucasian; N = number of patients. a Event list comprises those TEAEs in the primary placebo-controlled analyses set for which the rate for duloxetine was ≥ 5.0% and significantly higher than placebo. b Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for general association, controlling for study. Source:  FQAESF81 Serious adverse events and deaths Deaths No deaths were reported in the fibromyalgia studies. In  the  overall  duloxetine  exposures  analyses  set  (all  indications)  consisting  of  more  than  27,000 patients, 30 deaths occurred, of which 6 occurred after discontinuation from study participation, and 1 occurred prior to study drug administration.  In addition, 2 deaths were reported in ongoing studies. A total  of  20  deaths  (14  patients  treated  with  duloxetine  and  6  patients  treated  with  placebo)  were reported in the all placebo-controlled analyses set (all indications). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

A total of 21 (2.4%) duloxetine-treated and 11 (2.1%) placebo-treated patients reported at least 1 SAE in  the  primary  placebo-controlled  analyses  set.    There  were  no  significant  or  clinically  important treatment differences in the incidence of individual SAEs.  No single event was predominant.

A total of 19 (5.4%) duloxetine-treated patients experienced at least 1 SAE in the primary long-term analyses set (Study HMEH). More SAEs were reported in the primary long-term analyses set when compared  with  the  primary  placebo-controlled  analyses  set.    This  result  was  most  likely  due  to  a longer observation of the patients.

A total  of  40  (3.2%)  duloxetine-treated  patients  experienced  at  least  1  SAE  in  the  primary  overall duloxetine analyses set.

A total  of  136  patients  treated  with  duloxetine  (1.4%)  and  83  patients  treated  with  placebo  (1.2%) reported at least 1 SAE in the all placebo-controlled analyses set (all indications) and a total of 947 patients  (3.5%)  reported  at  least  1  SAE  in  the  overall  duloxetine  exposures  analyses  set  (all indications).  In addition, 53 patients reported new SAEs in ongoing studies. The frequency of SAEs observed in duloxetine treated patients in the fibromyalgia population (2.4%) tended  to  be  slightly  higher  than  in  the  all  placebo-controlled  (all  indications)  analyses  set  (1.4%). However, this was also true for patients taking placebo (2.1% versus 1.2%), suggesting that this was a population-specific phenomenon, and not a drug-specific phenomenon. The  discontinuation  rate  for  the  most  common  adverse  events  for  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of fibromyalgia is depicted in the table below. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The overall incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was similar between the primary placebo-controlled  and  the  primary  long-term  analyses  sets,  providing  reassurance  that  long-term exposure to duloxetine did not increase the likelihood of experiencing an adverse event that would lead to discontinuation.

Safety Topics of Special Interest Suicidality A full assessment of suicide-related events in the primary placebo-controlled analyses set and the all placebo-controlled analyses set (all indications) has been conducted. There were 3 cases of suicide ideation (1 on duloxetine, 2 on placebo), but no suicide behaviours were reported during the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia studies .  No statistically significant differences of Mantel-Haenszel incidence differences  and  incidence  ratios  for  suicidal  behaviour  or  ideation  were observed from these analyses. Analyses  of  depression  scale  item  data  from  fibromyalgia  studies  revealed  that  significantly  more placebo-treated patients reported the emergence of any suicidal ideation compared with duloxetinetreated patients.  There was also a significantly higher proportion of worsening of suicidal ideation in placebo-treated patients compared  with  duloxetine-treated patients. There  was  no  statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the frequency of improvement. Among patients with depression at baseline, statistically  significantly  more  placebo-treated  patients reported  the  emergence  of  any  suicidal  ideation  and  worsening  of  suicidal  ideation  compared  with duloxetine-treated patients.  There was a statistically significantly higher proportion of improvement of  suicidal  ideation  in  duloxetine-treated  patients  who  had  depression  at  baseline.    There  were  no statistically  significant  differences  in  the  scale  outcomes  among  patients  without  depression  at baseline. In addition to events found in the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia studies, there were 4 patients from Study HMEH who had suicide-related behaviour (3 suicidal ideation and 1 suicide attempt).

In  the  updated  analysis  of  suicide-related  events  for  the  all placebo-controlled  analyses  set  (all indications ), the meta-analysis of the duloxetine placebo-controlled data did not show evidence of a statistically  significant  increased  risk  of  suicide-related  behaviors  and/or  ideation  in  patients  treated with  duloxetine  compared  with  those  treated  with  placebo.    A  numerically,  but  not  statistically significantly, greater incidence of Suicide Behaviour or Ideation events (Mantel-Haenszel Incidence Difference  [MHID]  =  1.70,  p=.065)  was  observed  in  duloxetine-treated  patients  compared  with placebo-treated patients in the 18 to &lt;25 years of age subgroup.  This finding was primarily driven by suicidal ideation events in MDD patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within  placebo-controlled  studies  (all  indications),  there  were  2  completed  suicides  (1  duloxetinetreated and 1 placebo-treated), both from an MDD study.  There were 9 non-fatal suicide attempts (7 duloxetine-treated, 2 placebo-treated), all from MDD studies.  The majority of events were related to suicidal ideation (37 [0.40%] in duloxetine-treated and 24 [0.36%] in placebo-treated patients), most occurring in psychiatric conditions.  Suicide-related thoughts and behaviours within non-psychiatric conditions were very infrequent, and there were no completed suicides or suicide attempts.

Suicidal ideation was the SAE reported most frequently (4 patients; 0.3%).  Three of these patients were from the open-label long-term Study HMEH, and 1 patient was from Study HMCJ.  In addition, 1 patient from Study HMEH had a suicide attempt.

Overall,  the  results  of  the  meta-analyses  of  all  duloxetine  studies  were  consistent  with  results  of previous meta-analyses.  In the fibromyalgia studies there was no statistical or numerical increased rate  of  suicide-related  events  in  duloxetine  patients  compared  with  the  placebo  patients;  therefore, Lilly does not believe there are any unique risks regarding suicide-related events associated with the use of duloxetine in patients with fibromyalgia.

Hepatic Analyses In  the primary placebo-controlled  analyses  set ,  duloxetine-treated  patients  had  significantly  greater increases from baseline to maximum in mean ALT, aspartate tansaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALKPH), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) values than placebo-treated patients. There were no  differences  from  baseline  to  maximum  between  duloxetine  and  placebo  in  mean  total  bilirubin (TBILI). There were no significant differences in the incidence of hepatic-related treatment-emergent adverse events  and  hepatic-related  serious  adverse  events  in  the  primary  placebo-controlled  analyses  set.  A small  difference  was  observed  in  the  frequency  of  transaminemia  (ALT  &gt;3  times  ULN)  in  the fibromyalgia study population (1.37%) compared with the overall duloxetine population (1.11%).  A higher  difference  was  observed  between  the  corresponding  placebo  treatment  groups  (fibromyalgia patients:  0.44%; all indications:  0.23%), indicating that there was an indication-specific phenomenon occurrence. In the  primary  placebo-controlled  analysis  set,  there  was  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of duloxetine-treated patients (0.57%) who discontinued due to a hepatic-related adverse event compared with placebo-treated patients (none). Severe Cutaneous Reactions A small proportion (1.4% duloxetine-treated patients compared with 0.2% of placebo-treated patients) of  fibromyalgia  patients  experienced  adverse  events  potentially  indicative  of  severe  cutaneous reactions,  although  approximately  half  of  the  events  were  isolated  reports  of  conjunctivitis.    No patients discontinued due to any of these events and no events were serious.  Therefore, the use of duloxetine did not seem to pose a risk of severe cutaneous reactions in fibromyalgia patients. CHMP assessment of Safety Data The  duloxetine  safety  data  were  classified  into  5  different  analyses  sets,  three  from  the  five fibromyalgia studies (primary placebo-controlled (876 patients), primary long-term (350 patients), and primary  overall  duloxetine  sets  (1236  patients)),  and  two  sets  covering  all  indications  (all  placebocontrolled analyses (9 445 patients), and overall duloxetine analyses sets (27 229 patients)). The 'All placebo-controlled  analyses  set'  included  safety  data  from  studies  on  patients  with  fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and lower urinary tract disorder.

Overall, the incidence of TEAEs was fairly consistent in all analyses sets. However, the fibromyalgia patients tended to have higher frequency of AEs, following both duloxetine and placebo administration, than the rest of the patients, suggesting a population-specific rather than drug-specific phenomenon. The CHMP considered that since only 5 % of the fibromyalgia patients were males, a gender-specific phenomenon should be considered and discussed by the MAH. In their response, the MAH  acknowledged  that  there  is  a generally  higher  rate  of  AE  in  the  fibromyalgia  population compared with other indications for duloxetine. In addition, the MAH pointed out that the number of male patients treated in the fibromyalgia indication is low and the CHMP agreed that no alarming data were found and that there is no obvious increase of AE in male.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Duloxetine showed a higher incidence of adverse events with higher doses except for diarrhoea and fatigue. Although these differences were not significant for any of the adverse events when a formal comparison was made, this trend was consistent for most of events.  The MAH requested to provide a more detailed description of the AEs incidence by dose, with aggregated frequency distribution for 60 mg,  120  mg  and  placebo  treated  patients  in  order  to  further  clarify  the  safety  profile  of  intended dosages.  The MAH provided two comparative analyses for the fixed doses studies or the four placebo controlled   studies in order to compare the safety profile of the intended doses (initial duloxetine 60 mg QD dose or optional up titration 120 mg QD dose). A similar pattern was reported for both doses. Nausea,  headache,  dry  mouth,  insomnia,  fatigue,  constipation,  dizziness,  diarrhoea,  somnolence, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis were reported among the common adverse events for duloxetine 60 mg and 120 mg. According to the data provided, patients titrated up to 120 mg are expected to have higher incidence of dry mouth, constipation and sleep disturbances (insomnia/somnolence) than those remained at 60 mg.  No new safety concerns had arisen. The CHMP considered this issue to have been resolved.

a) Suicidality:  A total of seven suicide-related events were reported in fibromyalgia studies, four of them  in  the  open-label  long  term  study.  Six  cases  of  suicide  ideation  (four  on  duloxetine,  two  on placebo)  and  one  suicide  attempt  were  reported.  These  findings  indicate  that  the  concerns  about suicidal behaviour associated with duloxetine remain and stress the need of keeping and reinforcing ongoing initiatives to further assess this aspect.

Increased weight (2.4%) was a significantly increased TEAE in the fibromyalgia patients, but not in the 'all indications' patients. Therefore, the MAH was requested to discuss whether this discrepancy could be due to gender differences, and whether a development of weight increase over time can be observed in the long-term safety data base. The MAH pointed out that weight gain was observed in both genders with a slightly higher percentage of females compared with males. Although a female predisposition  to  gain  weight  could  not  be  excluded,  gender  appears  to  play  a  minor  role  in  the development  of  weight  gain.  In  addition  the  MAH  explained  that  weight  gain  was  observed  as increased in the duloxetine treated group and was more obvious in the long-term treated. Furthermore, it was noted by the MAH that weight gain is already included in the SPC. The CHMP considered this issue to have been resolved. The CHMP mentioned that no deaths were reported in the fibromyalgia studies. More than 40% of patients included in the fibromyalgia studies discontinued due to any reason compared to 28% in other indications studies (all placebo-controlled analyses set). This is true also for placebo treated patients and it  was  explained  as  a  population-specific  phenomenon  more  than  a  duloxetine-specific finding. Discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  duloxetine  group  (19.5%) compared with the placebo group (11.8%) particularly for the AE somnolence. In order to reduce the high initial discontinuation rate, the MAH was requested to discuss the possibility of a lower initial dose and a slower and more prolonged dose escalation in the fibromyalgia patient group. In reply to the CHMP concern, the MAH justified the discontinuation rates in fibromyalgia studies as related to an indication-specific and not a treatment-specific issue. The rate of discontinuation does not seem to differ whether the therapeutic doses are achieved in one or more steps. Admittedly, the impact on the efficacy  of  dosing  without  escalation  appears  to  be  much  lower  than  that  observed  on  the  safety. Therefore it is expectable that in terms of tolerability some patients could benefit from slower titration. The CHMP considered that issue to have been solved provided that the SPC is amended appropriately. According  to  the  findings  identified  during  the  continuous  safety  assessment  of  duloxetine  in  its different indications the following key events were closely monitored: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

b) Hepatic risk: An increased incidence of moderate to severe plasma ALT levels was found in the fibromyalgia  group.  The  MAH  related  these  findings  to  a  specific  indication  cause.  Admittedly,  it could also reflect a potential higher risk for this population. The CHMP requested the MAH to discuss the possibility that this is a gender-related AE. In addition, the MAH has been requested to present the occurrence  of  elevated  ALT  levels  in  males  and  females,  respectively,  in  the  overall  duloxetine population  (all  indications).  In  reply  to  CHMP  concerns,  the  MAH  pointed  out  that  duloxetine treatment  induces  transaminase  increases  in  females,  independently  from  the  indication  considered. However, some indications seem to provide an additional risk. Furthermore, the MAH admitted that the  nature  of  this  issue  deserves  to  be  dealt  with  in  the  RMP  and  it  is  one  of  the  identified  issues continue to be followed-up in it. The CHMP considered that issue to have been solved.

c) Severe cutaneous reactions: Specific risks were not seen in the fibromyalgia study population. With the exception of abnormally high ALT values in the duloxetine-treated patients in the placebocontrolled analyses sets no clinically significant changes were identified in the laboratory evaluations. Hyperglycemia (increase in fasting blood sugar and HbA1c) has been identified in DPNP clinical trials and it has been recently considered in the risk management plan for its monitoring. In principle there appear to be no signal of safety concerns in fibromyalgia population related to duloxetine treatment. However, since only limited data has been obtained in fibromyalgia clinical development this concern cannot be ruled out. The  effect  of  duloxetine  on  blood  pressure,  cardiac  frequency  and  Electrocardiogram ( ECG)  data (including  QT  interval)  has  been  repeatedly  assessed.  The  variations  observed  in  cardiovascular parameters  were  apparently  minimal  and  did  not  derive  in  major  clinical  events.  The  fibromyalgia patients treated with duloxetine showed incidences of increase blood pressure, heart rate and QTcF increases similar to those observed for other indications.  However, the concomitant use of drugs with a potential effect on QT (such as tricyclic antidepressant (TCAs)) could enhance the cardiovascular risk in this population. The MAH was requested to comment on this.  The MAH pointed out that there are  no  specific  results  coming  from  pK/pD  interaction  studies  in  this  population.    The  MAH mentioned that the current SPC wording appropriately advises caution regarding the combination of duloxetine with other centrally acting medicinal products taking into account that limited, available clinical  evidence  has  not  demonstrated  an  increase  in  cardiovascular  risk  associated  with  coadministration of duloxetine and TCAs. The CHMP considered that issue to have been solved. As  expected  in  fibromyalgia  studies,  few  males  (&lt;  6%)  were  included  in  the  study  population.  In addition, the age group 65 years and older was small (&lt;10%) in the fibromyalgia trials. The CHMP asked  the  MAH  to  discuss  in  more  detail  how  safety  issues  in  these  small  subgroups  can  be extrapolated from observations in the total duloxetine safety database. In reply to CHMP concerns, the MAH  explained  that  although  the  numbers  of  males  and  older  patients  ( ≥ 65  years  of  age)  were relatively small, results from the subgroup analyses performed as part of the original submission did not suggest a different safety profile compared with females and younger patients. Given the similarity of the overall safety profiles seen in all approved indications and now also in fibromyalgia and given the similar pattern observed across age groups and gender in the DPNP studies, the MAH mentioned that the results from the subgroups of males and elderly patients in the overall database applies equally to all indications and can be reasonably extrapolated to the fibromyalgia indication. The CHMP agreed that  in  spite  of  the  low  numbers,  there  not  appear  to  be  signal  of  an  increased  risk  in  these  two subgroups of patients associated with duloxetine treatment.

Regarding pregnancies, a total of 77 pregnancies possibly exposed to duloxetine have been reported during all the indications clinical development of the product. Five out of 77 where reported during fibromyalgia studies. At least 27% of the pregnancies with known outcomes resulted in an unexpected or  undesirable  result  (ectopic  pregnancy,  abortion,  preterm  delivery  with  fetal  demise,  congenital abnormalities). The CHMP asked the MAH to further discuss it. The MAH agreed with the CHMP that  a  relationship  between  duloxetine  and  miscarriage  or  abnormalities  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In addition  the  MAH  mentioned  that  the  current  SPC  wording  on  pregnancy  appropriately  warns  the prescribing  physician  of  the  need  to  carefully  balance  the  benefit  versus  the  potential  risk  before exposing a pregnant woman to duloxetine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP concluded that given the low number of reported events and the absence of a specific pattern of the reported miscarriage or abnormalities there seems currently not to be a safety concern. However, fibromyalgia female patients represent a relevant target population at risk of drug exposure during pregnancy.

## Conclusions

The overall safety conclusion is that the size of the safety database is considered adequate, and the exposure  to  duloxetine  has  been  adequately  summarised  by  the  MAH.  Given  the  pharmacological properties  of  duloxetine  there  is  nothing  unexpected  in  the  AE  profile.  Though  no  specific  safety concerns have been detected in fibromyalgia patients, long therapy with duloxetine may be associated with  potentially  long-term  safety  concerns,  mainly  in  relation  to  the  high  prevalence  of  co  morbid depression in this population.  For these reasons only a relevant efficacy assessment could support the potential risks of a non trivial long term treatment.

4. Risk Management Plan The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this time. 5. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment The short-term efficacy of duloxetine in fibromyalgia patients was evaluated in 4 placebo controlled studies in which doses of duloxetine ranging from 20 mg to 120 mg per day were tested. After the evaluation of the initially submitted data, the CHMP considered that although some degree of effect could be observed across short-term studies, the robustness of the efficacy database was insufficient to conclude a relevant effect of duloxetine in patients with fibromyalgia. The  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  additional  analyses  allowing  to  further  exploring  whether  the modest effect could be regarded as consistently demonstrated and clinically relevant for the intended target population. The responses to the CHMP concerns provided by the MAH did not alleviate the CHMP concerns regarding the short-term efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The estimation of the effect size is not reassuring, and as for published data, it is at best rather smaller than the one observed for other therapies. This applies not only to pain, but also to functional evaluations. It  is  accepted that the HAMD might not be an optimal tool to discriminate the differential effect of duloxetine on fibromyalgia,  but  the  fact  is  that  the  data  show  a  clear  link  between  drug  effect  and mood. Whether this is not the case cannot be proven with the submitted data. Finally,  despite  the  fact  that  the  data  does  not  allow  to  conclude  that  there  are  a  differential  effect according  to  patient's  origin,  the  fact  is  that  the  only  study  including  EU  patients  was  negative. Whether  this  might  have  been  influenced  by  different  background  therapy  strategies  need  to  be confirmed. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

All these concerns, reinforces the CHMP view that a clear demonstration of the efficacy of duloxetine in the short-term therapy of fibromyalgia in a patient population that is relevant for the EU setting is still lacking.

Though no specific safety  concerns  have  been  detected in  fibromyalgia  patients,  long  therapy  with duloxetine may be associated with potentially long-term safety concerns, mainly in relation to the high prevalence  of  co  morbid  depression  in  this  population.    For  these  reasons  only  a  relevant  efficacy assessment could support the potential risks of a non trivial long term treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, the B/R on duloxetine for the fibromyalgia indication remains negative.

## 6. Conclusion

On 23 October 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation not to be acceptable .
