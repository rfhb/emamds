One ml provides 50 mg of daptomycin after reconstitution with 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder for solution for injection or infusion A pale yellow to light brown lyophilised cake or powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

- -Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and sof t-tissue infections (cSSTI).
- -Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is recommended that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial susceptibility of  the organism and should be based on expert advice. See sections 4.4 and 5.1.
- -Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). In adults, use in bacteraemia should be associated with RIE or with cSSTI, while in paediatric patients, use in bacteraemia should be associated with cSSTI.

Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where Gram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, Cubicin should be co-administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s).

Consideration should be given to of ficial guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Clinical studies in patients employed infusion of daptomycin over at least 30 minutes. There is no clinical experience in patients with the administration of daptomycin as an injection over 2 minutes. This mode of administration was only studied in healthy subjects. However, when compared with the same doses given as intravenous infusions over 30 minutes there were no clinically important differences in the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of daptomycin (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

## Adults

- -cSSTI without concurrent SAB: Cubicin 4 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours for 7-14 days or until the infection is resolved (see section 5.1).
- -cSSTI with concurrent SAB: Cubicin 6 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours. See below for dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment. The duration of therapy may need to be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient.
- -Known or suspected RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus : Cubicin 6 mg/kg is administered once every 24 hours. See below for dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment. The duration of therapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations.

Cubicin is administered intravenously in 0.9 % sodium chloride (see section 6.6). Cubicin should not be used more frequently than once a day.

Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels must be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least weekly) during treatment (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidney .

Due to limited clinical experience (see table and footnotes below) Cubicin should only be used in adult patients with any degree of renal impairment (CrCl &lt; 80 ml/min) when it is considered that the expected clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. The response to treatment, renal f unction and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels should be closely monitored in all patients with any degree of renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) . The dosage regimen for Cubicin in paediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

Dose adjustments in adult patients with renal impairment by indication and creatinine clearance

| Indication for use               | Creatinine clearance   | Dose recommendation    | Comments        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| cSSTI without SAB                | /uniF0B3 30 ml/min     | 4 mg/kg once daily     | See section 5.1 |
|                                  | < 30 ml/min            | 4 mg/kg every 48 hours | (1, 2)          |
| RIE or cSSTI associated with SAB | /uniF0B3 30 ml/min     | 6 mg/kg once daily     | See section 5.1 |
|                                  | < 30 ml/min            | 6 mg/kg every 48 hours | (1, 2)          |

cSSTI = complicated skin and soft-tissue infections; SAB = S. aureus bacteraemia

(1) The safety and efficacy of the dose interval adjustment have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials and the recommendation is based on pharmacokinetic studies and modelling results (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

(2) The same dose adjustments, which are based on pharmacokinetic data in volunteers including PK modelling results, are recommended for adult patients on haemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Whenever possible, Cubicin should be administered following the completion of dialysis on dialysis days (see section 5.2).

Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Cubicin to patients with mild or moderate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) (see section 5.2). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Therefore caution should be exercised if Cubicin is given to such patients.

## Elderly patients

The recommended doses should be used in elderly patients except those with severe renal impairment (see above and section 4.4).

## Paediatric population (1 to 17 years of age)

The recommended dosage regimens for paediatric patients based on age and indication are shown below.

|                | Indication                                           | Indication          | Indication                                           | Indication                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Age Group      | cSSTI without SAB                                    | cSSTI without SAB   | cSSTI associated with SAB                            | cSSTI associated with SAB |
|                | Dosage Regimen                                       | Duration of Therapy | Dosage Regimen                                       | Duration of Therapy       |
| 12 to 17 years | 5 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 30 minutes  | Up to 14 days       | 7 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 30 minutes  | (1)                       |
| 7 to 11 years  | 7 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 30 minutes  | Up to 14 days       | 9 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 30 minutes  | (1)                       |
| 2 to 6 years   | 9 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 60 minutes  | Up to 14 days       | 12 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 60 minutes | (1)                       |
| 1 to < 2 years | 10 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 60 minutes | Up to 14 days       | 12 mg/kg once every 24 hours infused over 60 minutes | (1)                       |

cSSTI = complicated skin and soft-tissue infections; SAB = S. aureus bacteraemia;

(1) Minimum duration of Cubicin f or paediatric SAB should be in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient. The duration of Cubicin may need to be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient. In the paediatric SAB study, the mean duration of IV Cubicin was 12 days, with a range of 1 to 44 days. The duration of therapy should be in accordance with available official recommendations.

Cubicin is administered intravenously in 0.9 % sodium chloride (see section 6.6). Cubicin should not be used more frequently than once a day.

Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels must be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least weekly) during treatment (see section 4.4).

Paediatric patients below the age of one year should not be given Cubicin due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) that were observed in neonatal dogs (see section 5.3).

## Method of administration

In adults, Cubicin is given by intravenous infusion (see section 6.6) and administered over a 30-minute period or by intravenous injection (see section 6.6) and administered over a 2-minute period.

In paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years, Cubicin is given by intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period (see section 6.6). In paediatric patients aged 1 to 6 years, Cubicin is given by intravenous infusion over a 60-minute period (see section 6.6).

For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

If a f ocus of  inf ection other than cSSTI or RIE is identif ied af ter initiation of  Cubicin therapy consideration should be given to instituting alternative antibacterial therapy that has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of the specific type of infection(s) present.

## Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with Cubicin. If an allergic reaction to Cubicin occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

## Pneumonia

It has been demonstrated in clinical studies that Cubicin is not eff ective in the treatment of  pneumonia. Cubicin is therefore not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia.

## RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus

Clinical data on the use of Cubicin to treat RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus are limited to 19 adult patients (see ' Clinical efficacy in adults ' in section 5.1). The saf ety and ef f icacy of  Cubicin in children and adolescents aged below 18 years with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus have not been established.

The efficacy of Cubicin in patients with prosthetic valve infections or with lef t-sided infective endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus has not been demonstrated.

## Deep-seated infections

Patients with deep-seated infections should receive any required surgical interventions (e.g. debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) without delay.

## Enterococcal infections

There is insuff icient evidence to be able to draw any conclusions regarding the possible clinical efficacy of Cubicin against infections due to enterococci, including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium . In addition, dose regimens of daptomycin that might be appropriate for the treatment of enterococcal infections, with or without bacteraemia, have not been identif ied. Failures with daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal infections that were mostly accompanied by bacteraemia have been reported. In some instances treatment failure has been associated with the selection of organisms with reduced susceptibility or frank resistance to daptomycin (see section 5.1).

## Non-susceptible micro-organisms

The use of antibacterials may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

## Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhoea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with Cubicin (see section 4.8). If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, Cubicin may need to be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as clinically indicated.

## Drug/laboratory test interactions

False prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of international normalised ratio (INR) have been observed when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilised for the assay (see section 4.5).

## Creatine phosphokinase and myopathy

Increases in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK; MM isoenzyme) levels associated with muscular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pains and/or weakness and cases of myositis, myoglobinaemia and rhabdomyolysis have been reported during therapy with Cubicin (see sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.3). In clinical studies, marked increases in plasma CPK to &gt; 5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) without muscle symptoms occurred more commonly in Cubicin-treated patients (1.9 %) than in those that received comparators (0.5 %). Therefore, it is recommended that:

- Plasma CPK should be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least once weekly) during therapy in all patients.
- CPK should be measured more frequently (e.g. every 2-3 days at least during the first two weeks of treatment) in patients who are at higher risk of developing myopathy. For example, patients with any degree of renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 80 ml/min; see section 4.2), including those on haemodialysis or CAPD, and patients taking other medicinal products known to be associated with myopathy (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates and ciclosporin).
- It cannot be ruled out that those patients with CPK greater than 5 times upper limit of normal at baseline may be at increased risk of further increases during daptomycin therapy. This should be taken into account when initiating daptomycin therapy and, if daptomycin is given, these patients should be monitored more frequently than once weekly.
- Cubicin should not be administered to patients who are taking other medicinal products associated with myopathy unless it is considered that the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.
- Patients should be reviewed regularly while on therapy for any signs or symptoms that might represent myopathy.
- Any patient that develops unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps should have CPK levels monitored every 2 days. Cubicin should be discontinued in the presence of unexplained muscle symptoms if the CPK level reaches greater than 5 times upper limit of normal.

## Peripheral neuropathy

Patients who develop signs or symptoms that might represent a peripheral neuropathy during therapy with Cubicin should be investigated and consideration should be given to discontinuation of daptomycin (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).

## Paediatric population

Paediatric patients below the age of one year should not be given Cubicin due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) that were observed in neonatal dogs (see section 5.3).

## Eosinophilic pneumonia

Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving Cubicin (see section 4.8). In most reported cases associated with Cubicin, patients developed fever, dyspnoea with hypoxic respiratory insuff iciency, and dif f use pulmonary infiltrates or organising pneumonia. The majority of cases occurred after more than 2 weeks of treatment with Cubicin and improved when Cubicin was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon reexposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving Cubicin should undergo prompt medical evaluation, including, if appropriate, bronchoalveolar lavage, to exclude other causes (e.g. bacterial infection, fungal inf ection, parasites, other medicinal products). Cubicin should be discontinued immediately and treatment with systemic steroids should be initiated when appropriate.

## Severe cutaneous adverse reactions

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and vesiculobullous rash with or without mucous membrane involvement (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)), which could be lif e-threatening or f atal, have been reported with daptomycin (see section 4.8). At the time of prescription, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Cubicin should be discontinued immediately and an alternative treatment should be considered. If the patient has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

developed a severe cutaneous adverse reaction with the use of daptomycin, treatment with daptomycin must not be restarted in this patient at any time.

## Tubulointerstitial nephritis

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin. Patients who develop fever, rash, eosinophilia and/or new or worsening renal impairment while receiving Cubicin should undergo medical evaluation. If TIN is suspected, Cubicin should be discontinued promptly and appropriate therapy and/or measures should be taken.

## Renal impairment

Renal impairment has been reported during treatment with Cubicin. Severe renal impairment may in itself  also pre-dispose to elevations in daptomycin levels which may increase the risk of development of myopathy (see above).

An adjustment of Cubicin dose interval is needed for adult patients whose creatinine clearance is &lt; 30 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). The safety and eff icacy of the dose interval adjustment have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials and the recommendation is mainly based on pharmacokinetic modelling data. Cubicin should only be used in such patients when it is considered that the expected clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk.

Caution is advised when administering Cubicin to patients who already have some degree of renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 80 ml/min) before commencing therapy with Cubicin. Regular monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 5.2).

In addition, regular monitoring of renal function is advised during concomitant administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents, regardless of  the patient's pre -existing renal function (see section 4.5).

The dosage regimen for Cubicin in paediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

## Obesity

In obese subjects with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m 2 but with creatinine clearance &gt; 70 ml/min, the AUC0-∞ daptomycin was significantly increased (mean 42 % higher) compared with non-obese matched controls. There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of daptomycin in the very obese and so caution is recommended. However, there is currently no evidence that a dose reduction is required (see section 5.2).

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Daptomycin undergoes little to no Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated metabolism. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of medicinal products metabolised by the P450 system.

Interaction studies for Cubicin were perf ormed with aztreonam, tobramycin, warfarin and probenecid. Daptomycin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or probenecid, nor did these medicinal products alter the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were not signif icantly altered by aztreonam.

Although small changes in the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin and tobramycin were observed during co-administration by intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period using a Cubicin dose of 2 mg/kg, the changes were not statistically significant. The interaction between daptomycin and tobramycin with an approved dose of Cubicin is unknown. Caution is warranted when Cubicin is co-administered with tobramycin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Experience with the concomitant administration of Cubicin and warfarin is limited. Studies of Cubicin with anticoagulants other than warfarin have not been conducted. Anticoagulant activity in patients receiving Cubicin and warfarin should be monitored for the first several days af ter therapy with Cubicin is initiated.

There is limited experience regarding concomitant administration of daptomycin with other medicinal products that may trigger myopathy (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). However, some cases of marked rises in CPK levels and cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in adult patients taking one of these medicinal products at the same time as Cubicin. It is recommended that other medicinal products associated with myopathy should if possible be temporarily discontinued during treatment with Cubicin unless the benefits of concomitant administration outweigh the risk. If co-administration cannot be avoided, CPK levels should be measured more frequently than once weekly and patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms that might represent myopathy. See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.3.

Daptomycin is primarily cleared by renal filtration and so plasma levels may be increased during co-administration with medicinal products that reduce renal filtration (e.g. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors). In addition, there is a potential f or a pharmacodynamic interaction to occur during co-administration due to additive renal eff ects. Therefore, caution is advised when daptomycin is co-administered with any other medicinal product known to reduce renal filtration.

During post -marketing surveillance, cases of interference between daptomycin and particular reagents used in some assays of prothrombin time/international normalised ratio (PT/INR) have been reported. This interference led to a f alse prolongation of  PT and elevation of  INR. If unexplained abnormalities of PT/INR are observed in patients taking daptomycin, consideration should be given to a possible in vitro interaction with the laboratory test. The possibility of erroneous results may be minimised by drawing samples for PT or INR testing near the time of trough plasma concentrations of daptomycin (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

No clinical data on pregnancies are available for daptomycin. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful eff ects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).

Cubicin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary i.e., only if the expected benef it outweighs the possible risk.

## Breast-feeding

In a single human case study, Cubicin was intravenously administered daily for 28 days to a nursing mother at a dose of 500 mg/day, and samples of  the patient's breast milk were collect ed over a 24-hour period on day 27. The highest measured concentration of daptomycin in the breast milk was 0.045 µg/ml, which is a low concentration. Therefore, until more experience is gained, breast-f eeding should be discontinued when Cubicin is administered to nursing women.

## Fertility

No clinical data on fertility are available f or daptomycin. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful eff ects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed.

On the basis of reported adverse drug reactions, Cubicin is presumed to be unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machinery.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In clinical studies, 2,011 adult subjects received Cubicin. Within these trials, 1,221 subjects received a daily dose of 4 mg/kg, of whom 1,108 were patients and 113 were healthy volunteers; 460 subjects received a daily dose of 6 mg/kg, of whom 304 were patients and 156 were healthy volunteers. In paediatric studies, 372 patients received Cubicin, of whom 61 received a single dose and 311 received a therapeutic regimen for cSSTI or SAB (daily doses ranged from 4 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg). Adverse reactions (i.e. considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported at similar frequencies for Cubicin and comparator regimens.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (frequency common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10)) are: Fungal infections, urinary tract infection, candida inf ection, anaemia, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, headache, hypertension, hypotension, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating and distension, liver f unction tests abnormal (increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), rash, pruritus, limb pain, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, infusion site reactions, pyrexia, asthenia.

Less frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, eosinophilic pneumonia (occasionally presenting as organising pneumonia), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), angioedema and rhabdomyolysis.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions were reported during therapy and during follow-up with frequencies corresponding to very common ( /uniF0B3 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data):

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

* Based on post-marketing reports. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily f rom a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their f requency which is therefore categorised as not known.

- ** See section 4.4.
- 1 While the exact incidence of eosinophilic pneumonia associated with daptomycin is unknown, to date the reporting rate of spontaneous reports is very low (&lt; 1/10,000).
- 2 In some cases of myopathy involving raised CPK and muscle symptoms, the patients also presented with elevated transaminases. These transaminase increases were likely to be related to the skeletal muscle ef fects. The majority of transaminase elevations were of Grade 1-3 toxicity and resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.
- 3 When clinical information on the patients was available to make a judgement, approximately 50 % of the cases occurred in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, or in those receiving concomitant medicinal products known to cause rhabdomyolysis.

The safety data for the administration of daptomycin via 2-minute intravenous injection are derived from two pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adult volunteers. Based on these study results, both methods of daptomycin administration, the 2-minute intravenous injection and the 30-minute intravenous infusion, had a similar safety and tolerability prof ile. There was no relevant diff erence in local tolerability or in the nature and f requency of  adverse reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of overdose, supportive care is advised. Daptomycin is slowly cleared from the body by haemodialysis (approximately 15 % of the administered dose is removed over 4 hours) or by peritoneal dialysis (approximately 11 % of the administered dose is removed over 48 hours).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, Other antibacterials, ATC code: J01XX09

## Mechanism of action

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide natural product that is active against Gram positive bacteria only.

The mechanism of action involves binding (in the presence of calcium ions) to bacterial membranes of both growing and stationary phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis.

## PK/PD relationship

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration dependent bactericidal activity against Gram positive organisms in vitro and in in vivo animal models. In animal models AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC correlate with efficacy and predicted bacterial kill in vivo at single doses equivalent to human adult doses of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg once daily.

## Mechanisms of resistance

Strains with decreased susceptibility to daptomycin have been reported especially during the treatment of patients with diff icult-to-treat inf ections and/or following administration f or prolonged periods. In particular, there have been reports of treatment failures in patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium, including bacteraemic patients, that have been associated with the selection of organisms with reduced susceptibility or frank resistance to daptomycin during therapy.

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is (are) not fully understood.

## Breakpoints

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for Staphylococci and Streptococci (except S. pneumoniae )  are  Susceptible ≤ 1 mg/l and Resistant &gt; 1 mg/l.

## Susceptibility

The prevalence of resistance may vary geographically and over time for selected species and local information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe inf ections. As necessary, expert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at least some types of infections is questionable.

## Clinical eff icacy in adults

In two adult clinical trials in complicated skin and sof t tissues infections, 36 % of  patients treated with Cubicin met the criteria for systemic inf lammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The most common type of infection treated was wound infection (38 % of patients), while 21 % had major abscesses. These limitations of the patients population treated should be taken into account when deciding to use Cubicin.

In a randomised controlled open-label study in 235 adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (i.e. at least one positive blood culture of Staphylococcus aureus prior to receiving the first dose) 19 of  120 patients treated with Cubicin met the criteria f or RIE. Of these 19 patients 11 were infected with methicillin-susceptible and 8 with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The success rates in RIE patients are shown in the table below.

| Population                          | Daptomycin n/N (%)   | Comparator n/N (%)   | Differences in Success Rates (95 %CI)   |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|

| RIE                                 | 6/12 (50.0 %)        | 4/8 (50.0 %)         | 0.0 %(-44.7, 44.7)                      |

Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing Staphylococcus aureus inf ections was observed in 19/120 (15.8 %) patients treated with Cubicin, 9/53 (16.7 %) patients treated with vancomycin and 2/62 (3.2 %) patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin. Among these failures six patients treated with Cubicin and one patient treated with vancomycin were infected with Staphylococcus aureus that developed increasing MICs of daptomycin on or following therapy (see 'Mechanisms of resistance' above). Most patients who f ailed due to persisting or relapsing Staphylococcus aureus inf ection had deep-seated infection and did not receive necessary surgical intervention.

## Clinical eff icacy in paediatric patients

The safety and efficacy of daptomycin was evaluated in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years (Study DAP-PEDS-07-03) with cSSTI caused by Gram positive pathogens. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into well-defined age groups and given age-dependent doses once daily for up to 14 days, as follows:

- Age group 1 (n=113): 12 to 17 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 5 mg/kg or standard-ofcare comparator (SOC);
- Age group 2 (n=113): 7 to 11 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 7 mg/kg or SOC;
- Age group 3 (n=125): 2 to 6 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 9 mg/kg or SOC;
- Age group 4 (n=45): 1 to &lt; 2 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 10 mg/kg or SOC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 was to assess the safety of treatment. Secondary objectives included an assessment of efficacy of age-dependent doses of intravenous daptomycin in comparison with standard-of-care therapy. The key efficacy endpoint was the sponsor-defined clinical outcome at test-of-cure (TOC), which was defined by a blinded medical director. A total of 389 subjects were treated in the study, including 256 subjects who received daptomycin and 133 subjects who received standard-of-care. In all populations the clinical success rates were comparable between the daptomycin and SOC treatment arms, supporting the primary efficacy analysis in the ITT population.

## Summary of sponsor-defined clinical outcome at TOC:

|                                  | Clinical Success in Paediatric cSSTI   | Clinical Success in Paediatric cSSTI   |             |

The safety and efficacy of daptomycin was evaluated in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years (Study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02) with bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus . Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio into the following age groups and given age-dependent doses once daily for up to 42 days, as follows:

- Age group 1 (n=21): 12 to 17 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 7 mg/kg or SOC comparator;
- Age group 2 (n=28): 7 to 11 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 9 mg/kg or SOC;
- Age group 3 (n=32): 1 to 6 years treated with daptomycin dosed at 12 mg/kg or SOC;

The primary objective of Study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was to assess the safety of intravenous daptomycin versus SOC antibiotics. Secondary objectives included: Clinical outcome based on the blinded Evaluator' s assessment of clinical response (success [cure, improved], failure, or nonevaluable) at the TOC Visit; and Microbiological response (success, failure, or non-evaluable) based on evaluation of Baseline infecting pathogen at TOC.

A total of  81 subjects were treated in the study, including 55 subjects who received daptomycin and 26 subjects who received standard-of-care. No patients 1 to &lt;2 years of age were enrolled in the study. In all populations the clinical success rates were comparable in the daptomycin versus the SOC treatment arm.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Daptomycin pharmacokinetics are generally linear and time-independent at doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg administered as a single daily dose by 30-minute intravenous infusion for up to 14 days in healthy adult volunteers. Steady-state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose.

Daptomycin administered as a 2-minute intravenous injection also exhibited dose proportional pharmacokinetics in the approved therapeutic dose range of 4 to 6 mg/kg. Comparable exposure (AUC and Cmax) was demonstrated in healthy adult subjects following administration of daptomycin as a 30minute intravenous infusion or as a 2-minute intravenous injection.

Animal studies showed that daptomycin is not absorbed to any significant extent after oral administration.

## Distribution

The volume of distribution at steady state of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 l/kg and was independent of dose. Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that daptomycin appears to only minimally penetrate the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier following single and multiple doses.

Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins in a concentration independent manner. In healthy adult volunteers and adult patients treated with daptomycin, protein binding averaged about 90 % including subjects with renal impairment.

## Biotransformation

In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolised by human liver microsomes. In vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that daptomycin does not inhibit or induce the activities of the following human cytochrome P450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. It is unlikely that daptomycin will inhibit or induce the metabolism of medicinal products metabolised by the P450 system.

After infusion of 14C-daptomycin in healthy adults, the plasma radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference in total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma, and minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolism has not been identified.

## Elimination

Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Concomitant administration of probenecid and daptomycin has no effect on daptomycin pharmacokinetics in humans suggesting minimal to no active tubular secretion of daptomycin.

Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of daptomycin is approximately 7 to 9 ml/hr/kg and its renal clearance is 4 to 7 ml/hr/kg.

In a mass balance study using radiolabelled material, 78 % of the administered dose was recovered from the urine based on total radioactivity, whilst urinary recovery of unchanged daptomycin was approximately 50 % of the dose. About 5 % of the administered radiolabel was excreted in the faeces.

## Special populations

## Elderly

Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg intravenous dose of Cubicin over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35 % lower and the mean AUC0-∞ was approximately 58 % higher in elderly subjects (≥ 75 years of age) compared with those in healthy young subjects (18 to 30 years of age). There were no differences in Cmax. The dif ferences noted are most likely due to the normal reduction in renal function observed in the geriatric population.

No dose adjustment is necessary based on age alone. However, renal function should be assessed and the dose should be reduced if there is evidence of severe renal impairment.

## Children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age)

The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in paediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. After a single 4 mg/kg dose of Cubicin, total clearance normalised by weight and elimination half-life of daptomycin in adolescents (12-17 years of age) with Gram-positive infection were similar to adults. Af ter a single 4 mg/kg dose of Cubicin, total clearance of daptomycin in children 7-11 years of age with Gram-positive infection was higher than in adolescents, whereas elimination half-life was shorter. Af ter a single 4, 8, or 10 mg/kg dose of Cubicin, total clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2-6 years of age were similar at diff erent doses; total clearance was higher and elimination half-life was shorter than in adolescents. Af ter a single 6 mg/kg dose of Cubicin, the clearance and elimination half-lif e of daptomycin in children 13-24 months of  age were similar to children 2-6 years of age who received a single 4-10 mg/kg dose. The results of these studies show that exposures (AUC) in paediatric patients across all doses are generally lower than those in adults at comparable doses.

## Paediatric patients with cSSTI

A Phase 4 study (DAP-PEDS-07-03) was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSTI caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin pharmacokinetics in patients in this study are summarised in Table 2. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age. Plasma exposures achieved with these doses were consistent with those achieved in the adult cSSTI study (following 4 mg/kg once daily in adults).

## Paediatric patients with SAB

A Phase 4 study (DAP-PEDBAC-11-02) was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with SAB. Daptomycin pharmacokinetics inpatients in this study are summarised in Table 3. Following administration of multiple doses, daptomycin exposure was similar across different age groups after dose adjustment based on body weight and age. Plasma exposures achieved with these doses were consistent with those achieved in the adult SAB study (following 6 mg/kg once daily in adults).

Table 3 Mean (Standard Deviation) of Daptomycin Pharmacokinetics in Paediatric SAB Patients (1 to 17 Years of Age) in Study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02

| Age Range                     | 12-17 years (N=13)   | 7-11 years (N=19)   | 1 to 6 years (N=19)*   |

Pharmacokinetic parameter values estimated using a model-based approach with sparsely collected pharmacokinetic samples from individual patients in the study.

*Mean (Standard Deviation) calculated for patients 2 to 6 years of age, since no patients 1 to &lt;2 years of age were enrolled in the study. Simulation using a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that the AUCss (area under the concentrationtime curve at steady state) of daptomycin in paediatric patients 1 to &lt;2 years of age receiving 12 mg/kg once daily would be comparable to that in adult patients receiving 6 mg/kg once daily.

## Obesity

Relative to non-obese subjects daptomycin systemic exposure measured by AUC was about 28 % higher in moderately obese subjects (Body Mass Index of 25-40 kg/m 2 ) and 42 % higher in extremely obese subjects (Body Mass Index of &gt; 40 kg/m 2 ). However, no dose adjustment is considered to be necessary based on obesity alone.

## Gender

No clinically signif icant gender-related dif ferences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed.

## Race

No clinically signif icant dif f erences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed in Black or Japanese subjects relative to Caucasian subjects.

## Renal impairment

Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg intravenous dose of daptomycin over a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

30-minute period to adult subjects with various degrees of renal impairment, total daptomycin clearance (CL) decreased and systemic exposure (AUC) increased as renal function (creatinine clearance) decreased.

Based on pharmacokinetic data and modelling, the daptomycin AUC during the first day after administration of a 6 mg/kg dose to adult patients on HD or CAPD was 2-fold higher than that observed in adult patients with normal renal function who received the same dose. On the second day after administration of a 6 mg/kg dose to HD and CAPD adult patients the daptomycin AUC was approximately 1.3-fold higher than that observed after a second 6 mg/kg dose in adult patients with normal renal function. On this basis, it is recommended that adult patients on HD or CAPD receive daptomycin once every 48 hours at the dose recommended for the type of infection being treated (see section 4.2).

The dosage regimen for Cubicin in paediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

## Hepatic impairment

The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin is not altered in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B classification of hepatic impairment) compared with healthy volunteers matched for gender, age and weight following a single 4 mg/kg dose. No dosage adjustment is necessary when administering daptomycin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C classification) have not been evaluated.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Daptomycin administration was associated with minimal to mild degenerative/regenerative changes in skeletal muscle in the rat and dog. Microscopic changes in skeletal muscle were minimal (approximately 0.05 % of myofibres affected) and at the higher doses were accompanied by elevations in CPK. No fibrosis or rhabdomyolysis was observed. Depending on the study duration, all muscle effects, including microscopic changes, were fully reversible within 1-3 months following cessation of dosing. No functional or pathological changes in smooth or cardiac muscle were observed.

The lowest observable effect level (LOEL) for myopathy in rats and dogs occurred at exposure levels of 0.8 to 2.3-fold the human therapeutic levels at 6 mg/kg (30-minute intravenous infusion) f or patients with normal renal f unction. As the pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2) is comparable, the safety margins for both methods of administration are very similar.

A study in dogs demonstrated that skeletal myopathy was reduced upon once daily administration as compared to fractionated dosing at same total daily dose, suggesting that myopathic effects in animals were primarily related to time between doses.

Effects on peripheral nerves were observed at higher doses than those associated with skeletal muscle effects in adult rats and dogs, and were primarily related to plasma Cmax. Peripheral nerve changes were characterised by minimal to slight axonal degeneration and were frequently accompanied by functional changes. Reversal of both the microscopic and functional effects was complete within 6 months post-dose. Safety margins for peripheral nerve effects in rats and dogs are 8- and 6-f old, respectively, based on comparison of Cmax values at the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) with the Cmax achieved on dosing with 30-minute intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg once daily in patients with normal renal function.

The findings of in vitro and some in vivo studies designed to investigate the mechanism of daptomycin myotoxicity indicate that the plasma membrane of differentiated spontaneously contracting muscle cells is the target of toxicity. The specif ic cell surf ace component directly targeted has not been identified. Mitochondrial loss/damage was also observed; however the role and significance of this finding in the overall pathology are unknown. This finding was not associated with an ef f ect on muscle contraction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In contrast to adult dogs, juvenile dogs appeared to be more sensitive to peripheral nerve lesions as compared to skeletal myopathy. Juvenile dogs developed peripheral and spinal nerve lesions at doses lower than those associated with skeletal muscle toxicity.

In neonatal dogs, daptomycin caused marked clinical signs of twitching, muscle rigidity in the limbs, and impaired use of limbs, which resulted in decreases in body weight and overall body condition at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day and necessitated early discontinuation of treatment in these dose groups. At lower dose levels (25 mg/kg/day), mild and reversible clinical signs of twitching and one incidence of muscle rigidity were observed without any effects on body weight. There was no histopathological correlation in the peripheral and central nervous system tissue, or in the skeletal muscle, at any dose level, and the mechanism and clinical relevance for the adverse clinical signs are therefore unknown.

Reproductive toxicity testing showed no evidence of effects on fertility, embryofoetal, or postnatal development. However, daptomycin can cross the placenta in pregnant rats (see section 5.2). Excretion of daptomycin into milk of lactating animals has not been studied.

Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rodents were not conducted. Daptomycin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity tests.

## Cubicin 350 mg powder for solution for injection or infusion

To prepare Cubicin for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions:

Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute or dilute lyophilised Cubicin.

## For Reconstitution:

1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portions of the rubber stopper. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surf ace. Draw 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device, then slowly inject through the centre of the rubber stopper into the vial pointing the needle towards the wall of the vial.
2. The vial should be gently rotated to ensure complete wetting of the product and then allowed to stand for 10 minutes.
3. Finally the vial should be gently rotated/swirled for a few minutes as needed to obtain a clear reconstituted solution. Vigorous shaking/agitation should be avoided to prevent foaming of the product.
4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and visually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in colour from pale yellow to light brown.
5. The reconstituted solution should then be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) (typical volume 50 ml).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To prepare Cubicin for intravenous injection, please adhere to the following instructions: Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Cubicin.

1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portions of the rubber stopper. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surf ace. Draw 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device, then slowly inject through the centre of the rubber stopper into the vial pointing the needle towards the wall of the vial.
2. The vial should be gently rotated to ensure complete wetting of the product and then allowed to stand for 10 minutes.
3. Finally the vial should be gently rotated/swirled for a few minutes as needed to obtain a clear reconstituted solution. Vigorous shaking/agitation should be avoided to prevent foaming of the product.
4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and visually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in colour from pale yellow to light brown.
5. Slowly remove the reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6. Invert the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a new syringe, insert the needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution f rom the inverted vial.
7. Replace needle with a new needle for the intravenous injection.
8. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.
9. The reconstituted solution should then be injected intravenously slowly over 2 minutes as directed in section 4.2.

Cubicin vials are for single-use only.

From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after reconstitution (see section 6.3).

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## daptomycin

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of  illness are the same as yours.
- -If  you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side ef fects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Cubicin is and what it is used for

The active substance in Cubicin powder for solution for injection or infusion is daptomycin. Daptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Cubicin is used in adults and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin inf ection.

Cubicin is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of  the heart (including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also used to treat inf ections in the blood caused by the same type of  bacteria when associated with heart inf ection.

Depending on the type of infection(s) that you have, your doctor may also prescribe other antibacterials while you are receiving treatment with Cubicin.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Cubicin

## You should not be given Cubicin

If  you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If  you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin:

- -If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose of Cubicin (see section 3 of this leaf let).
- -Occasionally, patients receiving Cubicin may develop tender or aching muscles or muscle weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet f or more information). If this happens tell your doctor. Your doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue with Cubicin. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Cubicin.
- -If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or serious kidney problems after taking daptomycin.
- -If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Cubicin could be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring in case of side ef f ects.

If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin.

## Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:

- -Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cubicin. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty breathing, swelling of the f ace, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or f ever.
- -Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms that occur with these skin disorders can include:
- -a new or worsening fever,
- -red raised or f luid-f illed skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or groin areas and which can spread over a large area of your body,
- -blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals.
- -A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms can include fever and rash.
- -Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or diff iculties with movements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the treatment.
- -Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or persistent.
- -New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious lung disorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your lungs and decide whether or not you should continue Cubicin treatment.

Cubicin may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The results can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that your doctor takes into account that you are receiving Cubicin. Please inf orm your doctor that you are on treatment with Cubicin.

Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start treatment and frequently during treatment with Cubicin.

## Children and adolescents

Cubicin should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals have indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.

## Use in elderly

People over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are working well.

## Other medicines and Cubicin

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is particularly important that you mention the following:

- -Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis). It is possible that the risk of  side ef f ects af f ecting the muscles may be higher when any of these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken during treatment with Cubicin. Your doctor may decide not to give you Cubicin or to stop the other medicine for a while.
- -Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the ef fects of  Cubicin in the kidney.
- -Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warf arin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It may be necessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Cubicin is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this medicine.

Do not breast-feed if you are receiving Cubicin, because it may pass into your breast milk and could affect the baby.

## Driving and using machines

Cubicin has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.

## Cubicin contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How Cubicin is given

Cubicin will usually be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.

## Adults (18 years of age and above)

The dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated. The usual dose for adults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin inf ections or 6 mg f or every kg of body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or heart infection. In adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either as an inf usion lasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is recommended in people aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well. If your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Cubicin less often, e.g. once every other day. If  you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Cubicin is due on a dialysis day, you will be usually given Cubicin after the dialysis session.

## Children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age)

The dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the type of infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an infusion lasting about 30-60 minutes.

A course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin inf ections. For blood or heart infections and skin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.

Detailed instructions for use and handling are given at the end of the leaf let.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only

Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing.

## Instructions for use and handling

## 350 mg presentation:

In adults, daptomycin may be administered intravenously as an infusion over 30 minutes or as an injection over 2 minutes. Unlike in adults, daptomycin should not be administered by injection over a 2-minute period in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients 7 to 17 years old should receive daptomycin infused over 30 minutes. In paediatric patients under 7 years old receiving a 9-12 mg/kg dose, daptomycin should be administered over 60 minutes. Preparation of the solution for infusion requires an additional dilution step as detailed below.

## Cubicin given as an intravenous infusion over 30 or 60 minutes

A 50 mg/ml concentration of Cubicin for infusion can be achieved by reconstituting the lyophilised product with 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.

The lyophilised product takes approximately 15 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.

To prepare Cubicin for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions: Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute or dilute lyophilised Cubicin.

## For Reconstitution :

1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portions of the rubber stopper. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surf ace. Draw 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device, then slowly inject through the centre of the rubber stopper into the vial pointing the needle towards the wall of the vial.
2. The vial should be gently rotated to ensure complete wetting of the product and then allowed to stand for 10 minutes.
3. Finally the vial should be gently rotated/swirled for a few minutes as needed to obtain a clear reconstituted solution. Vigorous shaking/agitation should be avoided to prevent foaming of the product.
4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and visually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in colour from pale yellow to light brown.
5. The reconstituted solution should then be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) (typical volume 50 ml).

## For Dilution :

1. Slowly remove the appropriate reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a new sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter by inverting the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a syringe, insert the needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Bef ore removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove the required solution from the inverted vial.
2. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.
3. Transfer the required reconstituted dose into 50 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).
4. The reconstituted and diluted solution should then be infused intravenously over 30 or 60 minutes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cubicin is not physically or chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. The following have been shown to be compatible when added to Cubicin containing infusion solutions: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, dopamine, heparin and lidocaine.

The combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in infusion bag) at 25 °C must not exceed 12 hours (24 hours if refrigerated).

Stability of  the diluted solution in inf usion bags is established as 12 hours at 25 °C or 24 hours if stored under refrigeration at 2 °C -8 °C.

## Cubicin given as 2-minute intravenous injection (adult patients only)

Water should not be used for reconstitution of Cubicin for intravenous injection. Cubicin should only be reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).

A 50 mg/ml concentration of Cubicin for injection is obtained by reconstituting the lyophilised product with 7 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.

The lyophilised product takes approximately 15 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.

To prepare Cubicin for intravenous injection, please adhere to the following instructions: Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute lyophilised Cubicin.

5. Slowly remove the reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter.
6. Invert the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a new syringe, insert the needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution f rom the inverted vial.
7. Replace needle with a new needle for the intravenous injection.
8. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.
9. The reconstituted solution should then be injected intravenously slowly over 2 minutes.

Chemical and physical in-use stability on the reconstituted solution in the vial has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 25 °C and up to 48 hours if stored under refrigeration (2 °C -8 °C).

However, from a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C -8 °C unless reconstitution /dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

## 1. What Cubicin is and what it is used for

The active substance in Cubicin powder for solution for injection or infusion is daptomycin. Daptomycin is an antibacterial that can stop the growth of certain bacteria. Cubicin is used in adults and in children and adolescents (age from 1 to 17 years) to treat infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin. It is also used to treat infections in the blood when associated with skin infection.

Cubicin is also used in adults to treat infections in the tissues that line the inside of  the heart (including heart valves) which are caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. It is also used to treat inf ections in the blood caused by the same type of  bacteria when associated with heart inf ection. Depending on the type of infection(s) that you have, your doctor may also prescribe other antibacterials while you are receiving treatment with Cubicin.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Cubicin

## You should not be given Cubicin

If you are allergic to daptomycin or to sodium hydroxide or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If this applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse. If  you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin:

- -If you have, or have previously had kidney problems. Your doctor may need to change the dose of Cubicin (see section 3 of this leaf let).
- -Occasionally, patients receiving Cubicin may develop tender or aching muscles or muscle weakness (see section 4 of this leaflet f or more information). If this happens tell your doctor. Your doctor will make sure you have a blood test and will advise whether or not to continue with Cubicin. The symptoms generally go away within a few days of stopping Cubicin.
- -If you have ever developed a severe skin rash or skin peeling, blistering and/or mouth sores, or serious kidney problems after taking daptomycin.
- -If you are very overweight. There is a possibility that your blood levels of Cubicin could be higher than those found in persons of average weight and you may need careful monitoring in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

case of side ef f ects.

If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Cubicin.

## Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you develop any of the following symptoms:

- -Serious, acute allergic reactions have been observed in patients treated with nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cubicin. The symptoms can include wheezing, difficulty breathing, swelling of the f ace, neck and throat, rashes and hives, or f ever.
- -Serious skin disorders have been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms that occur with these skin disorders can include:
- -a new or worsening fever,
- -red raised or f luid-f illed skin spots which may start in your armpits or on your chest or groin areas and which can spread over a large area of your body,
- -blisters or sores in your mouth or on your genitals.
- -A serious kidney problem has been reported with the use of Cubicin. The symptoms can include fever and rash.
- -Any unusual tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, loss of feeling or diff iculties with movements. If this happens, tell your doctor who will decide whether you should continue the treatment.
- -Diarrhoea, especially if you notice blood or mucus, or if diarrhoea becomes severe or persistent.
- -New or worsening fever, cough or difficulty breathing. These may be signs of a rare but serious lung disorder called eosinophilic pneumonia. Your doctor will check the condition of your lungs and decide whether or not you should continue Cubicin treatment.

Cubicin may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. The results can suggest poor blood clotting when, in fact, there is no problem. Therefore, it is important that your doctor takes into account that you are receiving Cubicin. Please inf orm your doctor that you are on treatment with Cubicin.

Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor the health of your muscles both before you start treatment and frequently during treatment with Cubicin.

## Children and adolescents

Cubicin should not be administered to children below one year of age as studies in animals have indicated that this age group may experience severe side effects.

## Use in elderly

People over the age of 65 can be given the same dose as other adults, provided their kidneys are working well.

## Other medicines and Cubicin

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is particularly important that you mention the following:

- -Medicines called statins or fibrates (to lower cholesterol) or ciclosporin (a medicinal product used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis). It is possible that the risk of  side ef f ects af f ecting the muscles may be higher when any of these medicines (and some others that can affect muscles) is taken during treatment with Cubicin. Your doctor may decide not to give you Cubicin or to stop the other medicine for a while.
- -Pain killing medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). These could interfere with the ef fects of  Cubicin in the kidney.
- -Oral anti-coagulants (e.g. warf arin), which are medicines that prevent blood from clotting. It may be necessary for your doctor to monitor your blood clotting times.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Cubicin is not usually given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

given this medicine.

Do not breast-feed if you are receiving Cubicin, because it may pass into your breast milk and could affect the baby.

## Driving and using machines

Cubicin has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.

## Cubicin contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How Cubicin is given

Cubicin will usually be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.

## Adults (18 years of age and above)

The dose will depend on how much you weigh and the type of infection being treated. The usual dose for adults is 4 mg for every kilogram (kg) of body weight once daily for skin inf ections or 6 mg f or every kg of body weight once daily for a heart infection or a blood infection associated with skin or heart infection. In adult patients, this dose is given directly into your blood stream (into a vein), either as an inf usion lasting about 30 minutes or as an injection lasting about 2 minutes. The same dose is recommended in people aged over 65 years provided their kidneys are working well. If your kidneys do not work well, you may receive Cubicin less often, e.g. once every other day. If you are receiving dialysis, and your next dose of Cubicin is due on a dialysis day, you will be usually given Cubicin after the dialysis session.

## Children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age)

The dose for children and adolescents (1 to 17 years of age) will depend on the age of patient and the type of infection being treated. This dose is given directly into the blood stream (into a vein), as an infusion lasting about 30-60 minutes.

A course of treatment usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks for skin inf ections. For blood or heart infections and skin infections your doctor will decide how long you should be treated.

Detailed instructions for use and handling are given at the end of the leaf let.

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only

Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing.

## Instructions for use and handling

## 500 mg presentation:

In adults, daptomycin may be administered intravenously as an infusion over 30 minutes or as an injection over 2 minutes. Unlike in adults, daptomycin should not be administered by injection over a 2-minute period in paediatric patients. Paediatric patients 7 to 17 years old should receive daptomycin infused over 30 minutes. In paediatric patients under 7 years old receiving a 9-12 mg/kg dose, daptomycin should be administered over 60 minutes. Preparation of the solution for infusion requires an additional dilution step as detailed below.

## Cubicin given as an intravenous infusion over 30 or 60 minutes

A 50 mg/ml concentration of Cubicin for infusion can be achieved by reconstituting the lyophilised product with 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.

The lyophilised product takes approximately 15 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.

To prepare Cubicin for intravenous infusion, please adhere to the following instructions: Aseptic technique should be used throughout to reconstitute or dilute lyophilised Cubicin.

## For Reconstitution :

1. The polypropylene flip off cap should be removed to expose the central portions of the rubber stopper. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surf ace. Draw 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection into a syringe using a sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device, then slowly inject through the centre of the rubber stopper into the vial pointing the needle towards the wall of the vial.
2. The vial should be gently rotated to ensure complete wetting of the product and then allowed to stand for 10 minutes.
3. Finally the vial should be gently rotated/swirled for a few minutes as needed to obtain a clear reconstituted solution. Vigorous shaking/agitation should be avoided to prevent foaming of the product.
4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and visually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in colour from pale yellow to light brown.
5. The reconstituted solution should then be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) (typical volume 50 ml).

## For Dilution:

1. Slowly remove the appropriate reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a new sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter by inverting the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a syringe, insert the needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Bef ore removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove the required solution from the inverted vial.
2. Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required dose.
3. Transfer the required reconstituted dose into 50 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).
4. The reconstituted and diluted solution should then be infused intravenously over 30 or 60 minutes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cubicin is not physically or chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions. The following have been shown to be compatible when added to Cubicin containing infusion solutions: aztreonam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, fluconazole, levofloxacin, dopamine, heparin and lidocaine.

The combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in infusion bag) at 25 °C must not exceed 12 hours (24 hours if refrigerated).

Stability of  the diluted solution in inf usion bags is established as 12 hours at 25 °C or 24 hours if stored under refrigeration at 2 °C -8 °C.

## Cubicin given as 2 -minute intravenous injection (adult patients only)

Water should not be used for reconstitution of Cubicin for intravenous injection. Cubicin should only be reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %).

A 50 mg/ml concentration of Cubicin for injection is obtained by reconstituting the lyophilised product with 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.

The lyophilised product takes approximately 15 minutes to dissolve. The fully reconstituted product will appear clear and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.

4. The reconstituted solution should be checked carefully to ensure that the product is in solution and visually inspected for the absence of particulates prior to use. Reconstituted solutions of Cubicin range in colour from pale yellow to light brown.
5. Slowly remove the reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/ml) from the vial using a sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter.
6. Invert the vial in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. Using a new syringe, insert the needle into the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted, position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution f rom the inverted vial.
7. Replace needle with a new needle for the intravenous injection.
