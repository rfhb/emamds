## 1. Introduction

On 16 January 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for lenvatinib, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has been provided as synoptic clinical study report.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The reports submitted by the MAH are related to the following PIP studies which were subject of the compliance check procedure with outcome on 26 March 2021:

- Study 5 (Study E7080-G000-207, (hereafter Study 207)) a Phase 1/2 Study of Lenvatinib in Children and Adolescents With Refractory or Relapsed Solid Malignancies and Young Adults with Osteosarcoma

- Study 7 Population PK analysis to establish the dose-response relationship of lenvatinib in paediatric patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and support extrapolation of efficacy from adult patients to paediatric patients with DTC

The MAH stated that Study E7080-G000-207 is part of a clinical development program for lenvatinib and is listed as Study 5 in the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-001119-PIP02-12-M08). The study was completed on 20th July 2022 (last visit of the last subject).

The indications proposed in the PIP are:

-Treatment of paediatric patients with 131I-refractory follicular or papillary thyroid cancer

-Treatment of paediatric patients with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma

The Applicant does not state in the submission cover letter whether extension of indication application is planned for a DTC indication in paediatric patients and no changes to the SmPC are currently proposed. The submitted Study 207 is the only study in which paediatric patients with DTC were eligible, but only 1 patient was enrolled. The majority is represented by osteosarcoma patients.

In osteosarcoma patients, another the Study 8 is ongoing (E7080-G000-230, added in procedure EMEA001119-PIP02-12-M05), a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib as add-on to ifosfamide and etoposide in children from 2 years to less than 18 years (and adults) with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma. It includes subjects with histologically confirmed highgrade  osteosarcoma,  who  have  measurable  or  evaluable  disease  and  who  do  not  have  a  clinically significant ECG abnormality.

The Study 7 (M&amp;S analyses, POPPK) added in procedure EMEA-001119-PIP02-12-M05 in 2018 aimed to remove requirements for including a certain number of DTC patients (12 patients planned) in Study 207. An extrapolation of efficacy from adult patients to paediatric patients with DTC was proposed due to a rarity of paediatric DTC patient population.

Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The marketing authorisations for Lenvima (EMEA/H/C/003727) and Kisplyx (EMEA/H/C/004224) were granted renewal on 20 May 2020 and 17 June 2021, respectively, both for an unlimited period.

The approved indications for Lenvima are:

## Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC)

LENVIMA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  progressive,  locally advanced  or  metastatic,  differentiated  (papillary/follicular/Hürthle  cell)  thyroid  carcinoma  (DTC), refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI).

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

LENVIMA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1).

## Endometrial Carcinoma (EC)

LENVIMA  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.

## The approved indications for Kisplyx are:

Kisplyx is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC):

- in combination with pembrolizumab, as first-line treatment (see section 5.1).
- in combination with everolimus, following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy (see section 5.1).

## Posology for Lenvima in adults for Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)

The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg (two 10-mg capsules and one 4-mg capsule) once daily. The daily dose is to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan.

Dose adjustments and discontinuations for DTC

Management  of  adverse  reactions  may  require  dose  interruption,  adjustment,  or  discontinuation  of lenvatinib therapy (see section 4.4). Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally do not warrant interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management. Severe  (e.g.,  Grade  3)  or  intolerable  adverse  reactions  require  interruption  of  lenvatinib  until improvement of the reaction to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline. For lenvatinib-related toxicities (see Table 4), upon resolution/improvement of an adverse reaction to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose of lenvatinib as suggested in Table 1.

Treatment should be discontinued in case of life-threatening reactions (e.g., Grade 4) with the exception of laboratory abnormalities judged to be non-life-threatening, in which case they should be managed as severe reactions (e.g., Grade 3).

## Method of administration

Lenvatinib is for oral use. The capsules should be taken at about the same time each day, with or without food (see section 5.2). The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. Caregivers should not open the capsule, in order to avoid repeated exposure to the contents of the capsule.

Alternatively, the lenvatinib capsules may be added without breaking or crushing them to a tablespoon of water or apple juice in a small glass to produce a suspension. The capsules must be left in the liquid for at least 10 minutes and stirred for at least 3 minutes to dissolve the capsule shells. The suspension is to be swallowed. After drinking, the same amount of water or apple juice (one tablespoon) must be added to the glass and swirled a few times. The additional liquid must be swallowed.

Limited information on paediatric use is included in the SmPC of Lenvima in

## -Section 4.2:

## Paediatric population

Lenvatinib  should  not  be  used  in  children  younger  than  2  years  of  age  because  of  safety  concerns identified in animal studies (see section 5.3). The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in children aged 2 to &lt;18 years have not yet been established (see section 5.1). No data are available.

## -Section 4.8

## Paediatric population

Clinical data are not available in this population (see section 4.2).

## -Section 5.1

## Paediatric population

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  deferred  the  obligation  to  submit  the  results  of  studies  with lenvatinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and endometrial carcinoma (EC).

## -Section 5.2

## Paediatric Population

Paediatric patients have not been studied.

## -Section 5.3

## Juvenile animal toxicity studies

Mortality was the dose-limiting toxicity in juvenile rats in which dosing was initiated on postnatal day (PND) 7 or PND21 and was observed at exposures that were respectively 125- or 12-fold lower compared with the exposure at which mortality was observed in adult rats, suggesting an increasing sensitivity to toxicity with decreasing age. Therefore, mortality may be attributed to complications related to primary duodenal lesions with possible contribution from additional toxicities in immature target organs.

The toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on PND7) compared with those with dosing initiated on PND21 and mortality and some toxicities were observed earlier in the juvenile  rats  at  10  mg/kg  compared  with  adult  rats  administered  the  same  dose  level.  Growth

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

retardation, secondary delay of physical development, and lesions attributable to pharmacologic effects (incisors, femur [epiphyseal growth plate], kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) were also observed in juvenile rats.

## Background information for paediatric DTC indication (Source: PIP summary, MAH)

## Pathology

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the term used to cover the two most common types of thyroid cancer, namely follicular and papillary thyroid cancer [Steliarova-Foucher et al. 2006; Waguespack et al. 2006]. These are both differentiated thyroid carcinomas arising from the follicular epithelium. The other two main types are medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), which arises from the parafollicular C-cells, and anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid cancer. These different types of thyroid cancer are recognised by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O).

## Aetiology

The best known causal factor for DTC is ionizing radiation [Steliarova-Foucher et al. 2006; Jarzab and Handkiewicz-Junak 2007]. This is particularly notable in children, as demonstrated by the large increase in the incidence of DTC in Eastern European children following the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986 and due to an increased uptake of radioiodine. The increase was in both papillary and follicular carcinomas. Endemic iodine deficiency was thought to contribute to the effect, although the causal role of endemic iodine deficiency or dietary iodine supplementation in the absence of radiation exposure is unclear. Radiotherapy to the head and neck to treat malignancies (and historically for benign conditions) has also been associated with the development of DTC in children and young adults.

Differentiated thyroid cancer becomes more common in females after the age of 10 years and from the age of 13 years it is notably more common in females, suggesting a hormonal influence on its aetiology.

There is also some familial tendency with DTC, although the genetic mutations associated with this are poorly defined.

## Epidemiology

Differentiated  thyroid  cancer  accounts  for  about  90%  of  all  thyroid  cancers  [Pacini  et  al.  2010]  and approximately the same proportion applies to new cases of DTC occurring in European countries [Kilfoy et al. 2009]. The majority of cases of DTC are of the papillary type. Given that there were 32,898 new cases of thyroid cancer reported in the EU in 2008 for all age groups, equivalent to 4.9 cases per 100,000 population [Globocan 2008], this indicates that the annual incidence of DTC in the EU is approximately 29,600, amounting to approximately 44 cases per million population.

The annual incidence of thyroid cancers in paediatric populations in the EU has been calculated from extensive data collected from 61 European cancer registries by Steliarova-Foucher et al. (2006) under the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System project. These data can be used to estimate the annual EU incidence of DTC by paediatric age group.

The study pooled data on 1133 paediatric (≤19 years old) cases of childhood thyroid cancer covering the period 1978-1997 from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and UK. This provides a good representation of EU countries. Data were also collected on 557 cases from Belarus. However, due  to  the  much  higher  incidence  of  DTC  in  Belarus  than  the  other  countries  studied  (due  to  the Chernobyl accident), data from Belarus were not included in the pooled analysis.

Paediatric cancer registries only provided data from paediatric age groups up to 14 years old, while general cancer registries provided data from all age groups, including children up to 19 years old. Data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from both types of registries were used to create a 'combined' data-set for children in the age groups 0 to 4, 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 years old (with the paediatric registry data being used in the case of populations covered by both types of registry). The general registries were used alone to provide data for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years old and to provide alternative data for children up to 14 years (although data from age groups within this range are not provided in the paper).

The study found that the annual incidence of papillary carcinoma across the whole age group of 0 to 14 years, as calculated using the data from the combined data-set, was 0.72 per million, whereas the result calculated from the general registry data was significantly less at 0.44 per million. Similarly, the annual incidence of follicular carcinoma across the whole age group of 0 to 14 years, as calculated using the data from the combined data-set, was 0.10 per million, whereas the result calculated from the general registry  data  was  significantly  less  at  0.06  per  million.  The  reason  for  these  differences  is  unclear. However, as shown in Table 1 presented in the article, in order to provide a liberal estimate of incidence in the three age groups up to 14 years, the results in these groups from the combined data-set have been corrected by the ratio of these different results, i.e., 1.64 and 1.67 for papillary  and follicular cancer, respectively. The incidence for the age group 15 to 19 years has been taken from the general registry data. The results for the analysis are shown in Table 1.

The study also found that the incidence of DTC increased by approximately 3% per annum during the period studied, mostly due to increases in the incidence of papillary carcinoma. This could be due to factors such as greater disease awareness and earlier diagnosis (so moving cases into the paediatric from the adult population). Steliarova-Foucher and colleagues considered that this increase in incidence might continue so bringing the rates more in line with the higher rates found in the United States. These changes in incidence in Europe should be taken in account when estimating the EU incidence of paediatric DTC in 2008, to enable a comparison with rates in the whole EU population in the same year (discussed earlier). Assuming that the average results for the study period occurred approximately half way through this period and assuming a liberal 3% annual growth in incidence over the 20.5 years from then until the end of 2008, this applies a correction factor of 1.0320.5 = 1.83 to all the incidence data.

The annual incidence of DTC in paediatric populations in the EU in 2008 was approximately 542, which is only about 2% of all the estimated 29,600 new cases of DTC presenting in all age groups that year. Therefore, DTC is rare in children, especially in those under the age of 10 years and only isolated cases are reported in children under the age of 5 years.

## Presentation

Differentiated thyroid cancer presents quite differently in the paediatric population compared with adults, which has implications for its management:

The primary tumour is much larger at presentation in the paediatric population (especially in relation to the whole gland) [Jarzab et al. 2005]. For example, amongst 1039 consecutive patients with papillary carcinoma treated at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota in the United States [Zimmermann et al. 1988], newly diagnosed nodules were &gt;4 cm in 36% of children (&lt;17 years old) compared with 15% of adults and &lt;1 cm in 9% of children compared with 22% of adults. In addition, multifocal disease is more common in children (at least a quarter of cases in patients presenting under 21 years of age) [BorsonChazot et al. 2004; Welch Dinauer et al. 1997].

Cervical  lymph  node  and  distant  metastases  are  more  common  at  presentation  in  the  paediatric population  [Jarzab  et  al.  2005].  For  example,  in  the  Mayo  Clinic  series,  cervical  node  and  distal metastases were found, respectively, in 90% and 7% of children (&lt;17 years old), but in only 35% and 2% of adults [Zimmermann et al. 1988]. The lungs are almost always the sole metastatic site in children and adolescents and these metastases are almost always functional (approximately 95%), unlike in adults [Jarzab and Handkiewicz-Junak 2007]. The latter finding appears to be related to a difference in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expression  of  the  sodium  iodide  symporter  (NIS),  which  is  more  common  in  tumours  in  children compared with those in adults [Jarzab et al. 2005].

Recurrence rates are higher in the paediatric population than adults. For example in a US study by Mazzaferri and Kloos (2001) in 1528 patients with DTC with a median follow-up of 16.6 years, recurrence rates reached approximately 50% in children up to 9 years old, compared with rates of approximately 20% to 25% in adults aged 20 to 60 years old; recurrence rates increased again to over 30% in adults over 60 years old.

## Diagnosis

European guidelines recommend that the diagnostic work-up for a patient with a thyroid nodule includes a thyroid ultrasound and measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [Pacini et al. 2010; Pacini et al. 2006]. If the TSH is low, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be performed. Any hyperfunctioning nodules are unlikely to be malignant and so do not require fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The latter investigation should be performed in all other cases with nodules &gt;1 cm in diameter or with nodules &lt;1  cm  in  diameter  when  there  are  other  indicators  of  risk,  namely  a  history  of  head  and  neck radiotherapy, a family history of thyroid cancer, presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, or suspicious features on palpation or on ultrasound. Papillary carcinoma can be diagnosed cytologically, but follicular carcinoma cannot. In the latter case, some surgeons undertake a lobectomy and obtain a histological diagnosis  before  proceeding  to  definitive  surgery,  while  others  undertake  the  definitive  surgery immediately following cytological detection of follicular neoplasia.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Lenvatinib  was  administered  in  the  Study  E7080-G000-207  as  #4  size  (approximately  14.3  mm  in length) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsules in 3 strengths differentiated by color (iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow):

- 1-mg capsule (yellowish red cap and white body, containing 1 mg E7080 anhydrous-free base),
- 4 mg capsule (yellowish-red cap and body, containing 4 mg E7080 anhydrous-free base),
- 10 mg capsule (yellowish-red cap with yellow body, containing 10 mg E7080 anhydrous-free base).

Excipients  of  the  E7080  formulation  will  be  calcium  carbonate,  mannitol,  microcrystalline  cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,  low-substituted  hydroxypropylcellulose,  talc,  hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide, iron oxide yellow, and iron oxide red. Lenvatinib capsules may be suspended in water or apple juice for children  unable  to  swallow  capsules.  Instructions  for  the  preparation  of  the  lenvatinib  suspension: prepare the suspension with water or apple juice. The suspension should be directly injected into the mouth of the subjects and should not be washed down with additional fluid. The suspension is stable for 24 hours after preparation and should be kept at or below 25 °C (77 °F).

As per the section 4.2 of the approved Lenvima and Kisplyx SmPCs, the lenvatinib capsules may be added without breaking or crushing them to a tablespoon of water or apple juice in a small glass to produce a suspension. The capsules must be left in the liquid for at least 10 minutes and stirred for at least 3 minutes to dissolve the capsule shells. The suspension is to be swallowed. After drinking, the same amount of water or apple juice (one tablespoon) must be added to the glass and swirled a few times. The additional liquid must be swallowed. One of the secondary objectives of the Study 207 was to assess the palatability and acceptability of the oral suspension formulation of lenvatinib.

## 2.3.2. Biomarkers analysis

## Description

The submitted Biomarker Analysis Report, TSBM-E7080-207-ANA-1R, for Study E7080-G000-207 (Study 207) provided the results of the exploratory biomarker analyses of serum, tumor gene expression, and tumour gene alteration biomarkers and their correlation with PFS-4 status based on the Biomarker Analysis Plan (BAP), TSBM-E7080-207-ANA-1P-A1.

The biomarker analyses were carried out for the secondary objective listed in study E7080-G000-207 (Study 207) as follows: Examine blood and tumour biomarkers and correlate with clinical response to lenvatinib.

As per the Study 207 protocol, serum samples from study subjects were collected at Baseline, Day 8 of Cycle 1 (Combination-Agent Cohorts 3A and 3B), Day 15 of Cycle 1 (Single-Agent cohorts), Day 1 of all subsequent cycles, and at the Off-Treatment Visit. For subjects 2 to &lt;6 years, blood serum samples were collected in Cohort 1 at Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose). An archival tumour sample from the most recent surgery or biopsy was collected at any time before and during the study, unless no such material was available.

Serum levels of ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, VEGF, and IFNγ and IFN -γ -regulated chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) at baseline and selected post-treatment visits were measured. Using the tumour tissues, gene expression levels and gene alteration status for the selected genes were measured.

In the submitted report, all planned analyses described in BAP except for the baseline tumour gene alteration correlation analysis are reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants and treatments

Please refer to the study E7080-G000-207 below.

## Objective

The objective of the biomarker analysis was to:

- Examine blood and tumour biomarkers and correlate with clinical response to lenvatinib.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The biomarker endpoint was assessment of blood or tumour biomarkers that correlate with clinical response to lenvatinib treatment.

The following categories of biomarkers were explored: 1) Pharmacodynamic, 2) Predictive, and 3) Response. The predictive biomarker analyses included baseline serum biomarker analysis as well as tumour gene alteration biomarker analysis and tumour gene expression biomarker analysis of archival tumour tissue samples from each study cohort. Response biomarkers included post-treatment serum biomarker samples to identify those that could be used to monitor efficacy.

## Statistical Methods

Definitions of Analysis Sets:

- Serum Biomarker Analysis Set: a subset of the Full Analysis Set, including subjects with at least 1 serum biomarker measurement.
- Gene Expression Analysis Set: a subset of the Full Analysis Set, including subjects with a baseline tumour gene expression biomarker measurement.
- Gene Alteration Analysis: a subset of the Full Analysis Set, including subjects with a baseline tumour gene alteration biomarker measurement.

Change-in-level of serum biomarkers (post-treatment versus baseline) were converted into percentage change over baseline for statistical analysis. For the tumour gene expression biomarker analysis, each expression value was converted into log2 scale for statistical analysis.

Baseline characteristics of the Serum Biomarker Analysis Set, Gene Expression Analysis Set, and Gene Alteration Analysis Set, such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity, were summarized by study cohort. The summarized characteristics were selected from the statistical analysis plan for Study E7080-G000-207.

## Pharmacodynamic Biomarker Analysis

Change-in-level of serum biomarker from baseline was summarized per study cohort and analysed using the 1-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The 1-sample t test was also used for the analysis. The time points to be summarized were as follows:

1. Cohort 1: Baseline, C1D1 (for 2 subjects who received run-in treatment only), C2D1, and C3D1
2. Cohorts 2A and 2B: Baseline, C2D1, and C3D1
3. Cohorts 3A and 3B: Baseline, C2D1, and C4D1

As only 2 subjects were evaluated at C1D1, results at this time point were not discussed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analyses were performed for Cohorts 2B and 3B separately. No correlation analyses were performed for the other study cohorts because there were no efficacy-related primary endpoints in Cohorts 1 and 3A, and only 1 subject was enrolled in Cohort 2A.

## Baseline Serum Biomarker Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis of baseline serum biomarker levels with PFS-4 status were performed using the 2sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test between subject group with PFS equal to or longer than 4 months and subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months. The 2-sample t test was also used for the analysis.

## Change-in-level of Serum Biomarker Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis of change-in-level of serum biomarker from baseline to a selected time point with PFS-4 status was performed using the 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test between subject group with PFS equal to or longer than 4 months and subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months. The 2-sample t test was also used for the analysis.

## Baseline Tumor Gene Expression Biomarker Correlation Analysis

Thirty-six genes were defined as genes in the angiogenic and growth factor pathway: ANGPT1, ANGPT2, FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF5, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, FGF9, FGF10, FGF11, FGF12, FGF13, FGF14, FGF16, FGF17, FGF18, FGF19, FGF20, FGF21, FGF22, FGF23, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FIGF, FLT1, FLT4, KDR, PGF, TEK, VEGFA, and VEGFC.

Correlation analysis of baseline gene expression levels with PFS-4 status was performed for each of these genes using the 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test between subject group with PFS equal to or longer than 4 months and subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months. The 2-sample t test was also used for the analysis.

## Baseline Tumor Gene Alteration Biomarker Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis was to be performed on genes with more than 20% or 30% alteration frequency in each study cohort. Correlation analysis of baseline gene alteration status (wild-type group versus gene-alteration group) with PFS-4 status was to be performed using the Fisher's exact test between subject group with PFS equal to or longer than 4 months and subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months. Due to the small sample size (12 subjects in Cohort 2B and 3 subjects in Cohort 3B), biomarker correlative analysis for gene alteration was not performed.

## Clustering analysis

Clustering analyses with baseline tumour gene expression biomarkers were performed for Cohorts 2B and 3B separately. No clustering analyses were performed for the other study cohorts because there were no efficacy-related primary endpoints in Cohorts 1 and 3A, and only 1 subject was enrolled in Cohort 2A.

Subgroups were defined by clustering analysis using the baseline expression levels of 36 genes in the angiogenic and growth factor pathway. The distance matrix was calculated using the Manhattan method, and the dendrogram was generated using the Ward's method. Correlation analysis of PFS-4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

status among defined subgroups was performed using the Fisher's exact test between subject group with PFS equal or longer than 4 months and subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months.

## Biomarker results

## Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers

Median percentage changes in levels of serum biomarkers from baseline to C2D1, C3D1, and C4D1 are summarized by biomarker and cohort in Table 5 and discussed below. Significance was determined by p-values less than 0.05 based on 1-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

- ANG2: ANG2 levels decreased significantly from baseline across all cohorts to all time points.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- FGF21: FGF21 levels in the lenvatinib monotherapy cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2B) increased significantly from baseline to C2D1. FGF21 levels in the lenvatinib combination cohorts (Cohorts 3A and 3B) increased significantly from baseline to C2D1 (Cohort 3A only) and C4D1 (both cohorts).
- FGF19: FGF19 levels increased significantly across all cohorts from baseline to C2D1, and continued to increase in the osteosarcoma expansion cohorts (Cohorts 2B and 3B).
- VEGF: VEGF levels increased significantly across all cohorts from baseline to C2D1, and continued to increase significantly in the combination of lenvatinib with ifosfamide and etoposide cohorts (Cohorts 3A and 3B; ie, to C4D1), remained significantly higher in Cohort 1 (ie, to C3D1), and returned to near baseline levels at C3D1 in Cohort 2B.

- IFNγ: Percentage changes in IFN -γ levels from baseline were not consistent across all cohorts.
- CXCL9: CXCL9 levels in the monotherapy cohort (Cohort 1) increased significantly from baseline to C3D1. Percentage changes in CXCL9 levels were not significant in other cohorts.
- CXCL10: CXCL10 levels increased significantly in the lenvatinib monotherapy cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2B) from baseline to all time points, CXCL10 levels in Cohort 3A increased significantly from baseline to C2D1, and no statistically significant percentage changes were observed in Cohort 3B.
- CXCL11: CXCL11 levels significantly increased from baseline to C2D1 and C4D1 in the combination of lenvatinib with ifosfamide and etoposide cohorts (Cohorts 3A and 3B), respectively. No statistically significant percentage changes were observed in other cohorts.

In the combination arm of lenvatinib with ifosfamide and etoposide expansion cohorts (Cohorts 3A and 3B), in addition to increased percentage changes in levels of VEGF and FGF19 and decreased levels of ANG2, which are similar to those in the lenvatinib monotherapy expansion cohort, levels of CXCL11 increased, which was different from the lenvatinib monotherapy cohorts. In addition, CXCL10 levels increased after treatment in only lenvatinib monotherapy cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2B).

## Correlation Analysis of Baseline Serum Biomarkers With PFS-4 Status

For the baseline level of each serum biomarker, correlation analysis with PFS-4 status (based on RECIST 1.1) was performed separately in Cohorts 2B and 3B. Correlative analyses for only these cohorts were presented, because there are no efficacy-related primary endpoints in Cohorts 1 and 3A.

No statistically significant difference in baseline serum levels of any of the biomarkers evaluated based on PFS-4 status was observed in Cohorts 2B and 3B.

Correlation Analysis of Percentage Changes in Levels of Serum Biomarkers From Baseline With PFS-4 Status

For percentage change in level of each serum biomarker from baseline, correlation analysis with PFS-4 status (based on RECIST 1.1) was performed separately in Cohorts 2B and 3B. Correlative analyses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only for these cohorts were presented because there are no efficacy-related primary endpoints in Cohorts 1 and 3A. The percentage changes in FGF21 levels from baseline to C2D1 in lenvatinib monotherapy osteosarcoma Cohort 2B were significantly different (P=0.04760 from Wilcoxon rank-sum test) between the subjects with PFS ≥ 4 months and those with PFS &lt;4 months, with median percentage changes of -36.4% and 74.2%, respectively, but these associations were not detected at C3D1. No significant difference in percentage change from baseline serum levels based on PFS-4 status for any other biomarkers evaluated was observed.

## Tumour Gene Alteration Profiles

In Cohorts 2B and 3B, tumor gene alteration analysis was performed on tumour tissue samples using the next-generation sequencing platform Ion S5 XL Sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with the Oncomine® Comprehensive Assay v3 (OCA v3). RET was among the OCA v3 targets (161 genes overall) implicated in cancer. No fusions or mutations were observed for RET. Because of the small sample size, the correlation of gene alteration status with PFS-4 status was not conducted.

In Cohort 2B, gene alterations in 12 genes were detected at 8% or greater frequency (which corresponds to gene alterations observed in 1 or more subjects). Notably, gene alterations in ATM (25%), TP53 (25%), CCND3 (17%), KIT (17%), and MYC (17%) were identified in more than 10% of samples.

In Cohort 3B, gene alterations in 8 genes (ATM, ATRX, CCND3, CDK4, MDM2, MYC, MYCL, and NF2) were detected in 1 subject each.

## Correlation Analysis of Tumor Gene Expression Biomarkers With PFS-4 Status

In Cohorts 2B and 3B, the 770 genes of the gene panel and the custom-added additional 29 genes were tested by the nCounter® platform (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) with the PanCancer Pathways Panel in collected tumor tissue samples.

Correlation analyses of baseline gene expression levels with PFS-4 status were performed by 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test in Cohorts 2B and 3B.

Among 36 angiogenic and growth factor pathways genes, no significant difference in baseline gene expression levels was observed based on PFS-4 status when analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in this small sample size.

Although not statistically significant and in this small sample size, baseline expression levels of FGFR4 in Cohort 2B were higher in subjects with PFS ≥ 4 months (n=5; median: 137.3; range: 108.5 to 154.6) compared to those with PFS &lt;4 months (n=12; median: 13.9; range: 8.3 to 97.5)

## Subgroup Identification by Gene Expression Profile

This analysis focused on 36 genes consisting of angiogenic and growth factor pathways from the point of view of the mechanism of action of the lenvatinib (see Section 6.2.4.2 for a complete list of additional genes).

Subjects were classified into 2 major groups (Groups 1 and 2) by clustering analysis based on the expression profile of 36 angiogenic and growth factor pathway genes in Cohorts 2B and 3B.

In Cohort 2B, Group 1 was characterized by relatively high expression levels of FGF ligands and relatively low expression levels of VEGFA, FGFR1, and FGFR3. Group 2 of Cohort 2B was characterized by relatively low expression levels of FGF ligands. In Cohort 3B, Group 1 was characterized by low expression levels of FGF ligands and Group 2 was characterized by high expression levels of FGF ligands.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although not statistically significant in this small sample size, the PFS-4 rate with high FGF in Cohort 2B was 43% (3/7 subjects) compared to 20% (2/10 subjects) with low FGF.

## Discussion on biomarkers analyses

Although conducted in a relatively limited number of patients in the Study 207 (n=97, serum biomarkers investigated in 92 patients, tumour tissue samples in 51 and 31 patients for gene expression and gene alteration analyses of biomarkers, respectively), the obtained biomarker analyses results indicate the expected pharmacodynamic changes due to inhibition of VEGF and FGF signaling pathways, and are consistent with results in adult patients and with non-clinical findings (Ichikawa, et al., 2016; Tohyama, et al., 2014; Yamamoto, et al., 2014).

The limited sample size might have been one of the reasons for difficulties in identifying biomarkers that could be predictive for efficacy, in particular for the chosen primary endpoint for efficacy analyses (PFS-4) in patients with osteosarcoma treated either with lenvatinib monotherapy or its combination with chemotherapy. Baseline levels of CXCL10 tended to be higher for the subject group with PFS shorter than 4 months compared with the other group in Cohort 2B, in line with a suggested prognostic value of this biomarker in osteosarcoma patients (Niu et al, 2020). No association with PFS-4 status was observed for baseline serum levels of FGF21, therefore its prognostic role suggested in hepatocellular carcinoma is not evident for osteosarcoma.

Subgroup identification by gene expression profiles for 36 genes of relevance for angiogenic and growth factor pathways indicated that the high FGF group is associated with higher PFS-4 rates, similarly to results in other tumour types (e.g. renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma).

RET was among the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (OCA v3) targets (161 genes overall) implicated in cancer. No fusions or mutations were observed for RET.

| Studydescription      | PopulationPK analysis to establish the dose-response relationship of lenvatinibin paediatric patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and to support extrapolation of efficacy from adultpatients to paediatric patients with DTC |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Study objectives   | To describe lenvatinib PK in paediatric patients with refractory or relapsed solid malignancies in Study E7080- G000-207 (Study 207) using population PK modelling. To support extrapolation of lenvatinib efficacy from adult patients to paediatric patients with DTC. Lenvatinib systemic exposures (AuC range at steady state) from paediatric patients, who participated in Studies 207 and E7080-A000-216 (Study 216), will be c0mpared to exposures in adults with DTC who received once daily doses of 24 mg lenvatinib in Study E7080-G000-303 (Study 303).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Methodology        | Lenvatinib systemic exposures (AuC range at steady state) from paediatric patients who participated in Studies 207 and 216 will be compared to exposures in adult patients with DTC who received once daily doses of 24 mg lenvatinib in Study 303. Population PK modelling: Paediatric and adult data will be used in building the PK model. Population PK analysis will be performed on data from Study 207, which is pooled with existing data from Phase 1 clinical pharmacology healthy volunteer studies (Studies 001-008), from Phase 1 studies in adult patients (Study E7080-E044- 101, E7080-A001-102, E7080-J081-103 and E7080-J081-105), study in adult patients with thyroid cancer (Study 303) and Phase 1/2 study in paediatric patients with recurrent and refractory solid tumours (Study 216), including central nervous system tumours, who received lenvatinib in combination with everolimus. For the Population PK analysis, a three compartment disposition model will be fitted to the data including that from the paediatric patients in Studies 207 and 216. Covariates to be included in the model: age, body weight on clearances and volume parameters,healthy subjects on CL/F, albumin < 30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, and capsule formulation on relative bioavailability. First Order Conditional Estimation with Interaction (FocEI) in NoNMEM will be used.

The following justification was provided by the MAH at the time of the Study 7 proposal:

'To support identifying a dose which achieves comparable exposures in paediatric and adult subjects, the objectives of this population PK analysis are to describe lenvatinib PK in paediatric subjects and compare it to that in adults.

The additional objective is to extrapolate efficacy from adults to paediatric subjects with DTC, PK comparisons will be made by comparing lenvatinib systemic exposures (AUC range at steady state) in paediatric subjects receiving daily lenvatinib doses based on body surface area in Studies 207 and 216 and adult subjects with DTC who received fixed doses of lenvatinib (24 mg/day) in Study 303.

In Study 303 in adult patients with DTC, a dose of 24 mg lenvatinib once daily significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo (median: 18.3 vs 3.6 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.21; 99% confidence interval, 0.14-0.31; P &lt; 0.001) and was associated with a significantly better response rate (64.8% vs 1.5%, respectively).  Evaluation of the relationship between PFS and lenvatinib exposure (AUC) was performed on the PFS data from the lenvatinib arm of Study 303 (Report CPMS-E7080-007R is provided in this response package).  There was no exposure-response relationship in PFS: Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox regression analysis demonstrates that within the lenvatinib group, over a wide range of AUC (between 1410 to 10,700 ng·h/mL), PFS was similar.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH proposes to highlight the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 recommendation for the use of extrapolation in paediatric drug development.  ICH E11 defines extrapolation as an acceptable approach to providing evidence in support of the effective and safe use of drugs in the paediatric population when it can be assumed that the course of the disease and the expected response to a medicinal product would be sufficiently similar in both the paediatric and the reference (adult or other paediatric) populations.

Consistent with the extrapolation recommendation in E11, the safety and PK data obtained in the Phase 1 part of Study 207 (Draft Population PK analysis report for Study 207 provided in the initial PIP Mod04 submission) showed the following:

- Preliminary results showed that the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 14 mg/m2/day in the paediatric population resulted in comparable exposure at steady-state to that in adults receiving a daily dose of 24 mg
- In the presence of a body weight effect lenvatinib PK was unaffected by age
- Body surface area (BSA)-based dosing in the paediatric population is adequate since exposure to lenvatinib was comparable to that in adults
- The safety profile for the proposed starting dose of 14 mg/m2/day in the paediatric population is similar to that observed in adults starting at 24 mg/day

In addition, although clinical differences in DTC appear in adult and paediatric subjects (with a higher rate of lymph node and distant metastases in paediatric subjects), there is no histological evidence at present to suggest that there would be a difference in the efficacy observed in adults and paediatric subjects with DTC.

Hence, the safety and PK data obtained in paediatric subjects from Study 207 receiving starting doses of 14 mg/m2/day support lenvatinib clinical administration in paediatric subjects with DTC, and a potential extrapolation of efficacy from adult to paediatric subjects could be made.'

Clinical trial E7080-G000-207 (Study 5) and M&amp;S study (Study 7) for paediatric DTC development were checked in procedure EMEA-C3-001119-PIP02-12-M07 and were considered to have been completed in compliance with the agreed PIP.

The compliance check was finalised on the 26th of March 2021.

As the reports of relevance for both PIP studies 5 and 7 have been submitted, the results are assessed from a perspective of a potential extrapolation of efficacy from adult to peadiatric patients with DTC, as was planned by the MAH and supported by the PDCO.

The clinical development in osteosarcoma indication is ongoing and the M&amp;S analyses provided in this procedure are currently not discussed in the context of clinical development in osteosarcoma patients.

The M&amp;S analyses are of descriptive nature for this indication. Clinical efficacy and safety data from an early study 207 (PIP Study 5) that recruited patients with osteosarcoma have been submitted within this procedure (please refer to the Study 207 assessment below). Another Study 8 is ongoing (E7080G000-230, added in procedure EMEA-001119-PIP02-12-M05), a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib as add-on to ifosfamide and etoposide in children from 2 years to less than 18 years (and adults) with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma. It includes subjects with histologically confirmed high-grade osteosarcoma, who have measurable or evaluable disease and who do not have a clinically significant ECG abnormality.

Therefore, M&amp;S analyses are currently planned as descriptive and supportive for the osteosarcoma indication as clinical efficacy and safety data would become available to support benefit-risk.

## Methods

## Data sources and treatments

Study 207 is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study of lenvatinib as a single agent or in combination with etoposide and ifosfamide in paediatric subjects, and consist of 2 phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Both phases of the study include a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment Phase, and an Extension Phase. Please refer to the Study 207 design below.

Study 216 is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus in paediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumours. An overview of the study design is presented below. Interim lenvatinib PK data from Phase 1 component of the study was used in the current PK modeling.

## Objectives of M&amp;S analyses

The objectives of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of lenvatinib on pooled data from several studies, including study 207, are:

- Characterize the PK of lenvatinib in children and adolescents with refractory or relapsed solid malignancies and compare to that in adult subjects with solid tumors.
- Identify intrinsic and extrinsic covariates that explain between-subject variability in lenvatinib PK

The objectives of the PK/PD analysis for efficacy for study 207 are:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Explore the relationship between lenvatinib exposure and tumor response in children and adolescents with osteosarcoma in study 207

The objectives of the PK/PD analysis for safety for study 207 are:

- Explore the relationship between lenvatinib exposure and occurrence of the following treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) in children and adolescents with refractory or relapsed solid malignancies in study 207, which included: hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, vomiting, hypothyroidism, diarrhea.

## Covariate Data Collection

A Population PK model for lenvatinib was previously developed in adult subjects with DTC (CPMSE7080-007R). PK model included the following covariates: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, healthy subjects on CL/F, albumin &lt; 30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, and capsule formulation on relative bioavailability. In the current analysis, these effects were included in the PK model, and only age was tested as an additional covariate effect.

## Pharmacokinetic Assessment

Blood samples (2 mL each) were collected from all subjects in Study 207 at the time points shown below.

Table 4 Lenvatinib Pharmacokinetic Sampling Time Points (Study 207)

| Time Pointa     | Time (h)                         |

| Cycle 1 Day 15c | Predose Postdose: 0.5-4 and 6-10 |
| Cycle 2 Day 1   | Predose Postdose: 2-12           |

Note: PK blood samples should be drawn on day of tumor assessments (predose). If the tumor assessments fall on the same day as study treatment PK samples, they need not be collected again to avoid duplicate samples. h = hour(s).

a. If dose interruption is necessary in these time points, only predose sample should be collected, if possible.

b. Sample to be collected during the Run-in Period (Cohort 1).

c. Samples not required for Cohorts 3A and 3B

For the PK evaluation data were pooled together with PK data from previous lenvatinib Phase 1 clinical pharmacology healthy volunteer studies (001-008), four Phase 1 studies in adult subjects with solid tumors (101,102, 103 and 105) and two Phase 2 (201, 208) and one Phase 3 (303) study in adult subjects with DTC.

Table below lists these 15 studies and shows the PK sampling schedule in these studies.

## Efficacy Assessments

PK/PD analyses for efficacy (tumour response) were based on data from the lenvatinib arm in Study 207. Tumour assessment was performed based on RECIST 1.1. Investigator determined response assessments at each assessment time point were entered onto the appropriate CRF. Subjects must have evaluable disease or measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

## Safety Assessments

PK/PD analyses for safety were based only on data for most frequent adverse event (AE) in Study 207. Other safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 grades (for both increasing and decreasing severity), and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory evaluation of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and 12-lead ECGs; and echocardiograms, Lansky play score or Karnofsky performance status score, physical examinations, and height assessments.

## Population PK model

Population PK analyses were performed using NONMEM software version 7.4 with the Windows front end PDx-Pop version 5.2.2, R version 3.0 or later and/or the SAS System for Windows version 9.3.

A Population PK model for lenvatinib was previously developed using pooled data from 8 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology healthy volunteer studies (001-008), four Phase 1 MTD determination studies in adult subjects with solid tumors (101,102, 103 and 105) and two Phase 2 (201, 208) and one Phase 3 (303) study in adult subjects with DTC (CPMS-E7080-007R).

Lenvatinib PK was best described by a 3-compartment model with simultaneous first and zero order absorption and linear elimination from the central compartment parameterized for apparent plasma clearance of drug after oral administration (CL/F), apparent volume of the central compartment (V1/F), apparent volume of peripheral compartments (V2/F and V3/F), inter-compartmental clearance between V1 and V2 and V1 and V3 (Q2/F and Q3/F), absorption rate constant (Ka), and duration of zero-order absorption (D1).

PK model included the following covariates: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, healthy subjects on CL/F, albumin &lt; 30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, and capsule formulation on relative bioavailability. In the current analysis, these effects were included in the PK model, and only age was tested as an additional covariate effect. As data allow, estimation of model parameters was performed using first order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI).

## PK/PD analyses

Exposure-Response Analysis for Tumour Response (Study 207 Osteosarcoma)

Exposure-response analysis for tumour response was based on data from subjects with osteosarcoma in Study 207. Boxplot of lenvatinib AUC based on starting dose stratified by BOR was constructed.

## Exposure-Response Analysis for Individual AE (Study 207)

Exposure-response analysis for adverse event was based on data from subjects in Study 207. Boxplot of lenvatinib AUC based on starting dose stratified by highest CTCAE grade was constructed. TEAEs explored were: hypertension, proteinuria, decreased appetite, vomiting, hypothyroidism, diarrhoea.

## Results

## Population PK model

PK profiles from the 86 paediatric subjects (59 adolescents and 27 children) from Studies 207 and 216 were pooled with data from 769 adult healthy subjects and patients with cancer from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies.

A 3-compartment model with simultaneous zero and first-order absorption and first-order elimination from the central compartment included the following covariates was fitted to the data using non-linear effect modelling: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, healthy subjects on CL/F, albumin &lt; 30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt; ULN on CL/F, and capsule formulation on relative bioavailability.

Population estimates of Ka, D1 and the effect of capsule formulation on relative bioavailability (F1) were fixed with those in the previous population PK analysis in adult subjects with thyroid cancer because data to estimate them was limited in Studies 207 and 216. The theoretical values of allometric exponents (0.75 for apparent clearance and intercompartment clearances and 1.0 for volumes of distribution) were considered to have physiological basis and used in the model.

The parameter estimates, precision of the estimate and 95% confidence intervals for the lenvatinib PK model are presented in Table below.

Pooled lenvatinib PK data from Studies 207 and 216, and adult healthy subjects and patients with cancer from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies was described by this model (run no.011).

When age was evaluated as a continuous covariate for its effect on clearance of lenvatinib, in the presence of body weight effect, it was not statistically significant.

## Summary of Individual Derived Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Lenvatinib for Children and Adolescents in Study 207

Individual lenvatinib AUC at steady state based on starting dose for subjects in study 207 are summarized by cohort and dose level in Figures below for Lenvatinib monotherapy (Cohort 1/2A/2B) and (Lenvatinib + Ifosfamide + Etoposide: Cohort 3A/3B), and compared with that for adult subjects who received the 24 mg lenvatinib dose (equivalent to 14 mg/m2) in Study 303. Model predicted systemic exposure levels at steady state (AUCss) are almost comparable between pediatic subjects who received the 14 mg/m2 lenvatinib dose in Study 207 and adult subjects who received the 24 mg lenvatinib dose (equivalent to 14 mg/m2) in Study 303.

The PK model for lenvatinib included body-weight effect on both clearance and volume parameters, whereby CL/F increased with increasing body weight. The decrease in CL/F in subjects with low body weight results in an increase in lenvatinib AUC. Lenvatinib CL/F was affected similarly by body weight and body surface area in paediatric subjects. BSA and body weight are highly correlated in paediatric subjects.

## E-R efficacy analysis for Tumour Response (Study 207 Osteosarcoma)

Exposure-response (ER)analysis for tumour response was based on data from subjects with osteosarcoma of Cohort 2B/3A/3B in Study 207. No clear ER relationship could be seen.

## E-R safety analysis for Individual AE (Study 207)

There appear to be some trends that subjects experienced hypertension or hypothyroidism have slightly higher AUC than subjects without them.

## Discussion on modelling and simulation analyses

The MAH characterised the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib in paediatric population using a POPPK model, which was based on data collected in studies 207 and 216 in 86 paediatric patients (59 adolescents and 27 children). The POPPK model in adult patients was developed based on data in healthy volunteers and DTC patients. The choice of this dataset is not clearly justified. A discussion on the impact of disease/indication on the PK is lacking as well as discussion on the representativity of the data in paediatric and adult patients used for the POPPK model for the intended target population in DTC as per PIP Study 7. This is of particular relevance given that the tumour types in the paediatric dataset (mainly osteosarcoma) are different from those in the adult dataset where the initial model was developed. Bodyweight or BSA based dosing appear acceptable as these are highly correlated.

For DTC indication in paediatric patients the MAH should discuss the initial extrapolation strategy, based on PK matching, taking into account that PK data are available only in one paediatric patient with DTC. The objectives of the POPPK analyses do not clearly refer to the agreed objective for the PIP Study 7 to support the extrapolation of lenvatinib efficacy from adult to paediatric patients with DTC. The objectives specified in PIP Study 207 should be considered for the POPPK and PK/PD analyses. discussion on the representativity of the data in paediatric and adult patients used for the POPPK model for the intended target population in DTC as per PIP Study 7. (OC)

The MAH should discuss more in detail the rationale and the choice of the dataset for the adult POPPK model (DTC, monotherapy) and whether indication effects on PK are expected or known. The covariates chosen for the POPPK model are the same as for the model developed for adult patients, therefore assuming that that same covariate effect would be expected in the paediatric population with DTC as in adult population in DTC or in other indications. The choice of covariates should be justified specifically for paediatric patients with DTC. The choice of individual AEs for PK/PD analyses of exposure-safety in paediatric vs adult patients should be discussed based on the observed safety profiles. (OC)

The conclusions of the MAH from the currently available POPPK analysis are generally agreed on:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Lenvatinib oral clearance (CL/F) was affected by body weight. The decrease in CL/F in subjects with low body weight results in an increase in lenvatinib AUC. Lenvatinib CL/F was affected by body surface area with the same trend as with body weight in pediatric subjects. Thus, dosing lenvatinib by body surface area are supported by these results.
- -In the presence of body weight effect, lenvatinib CL/F was not affected by age. Thus, no agebased dose adjustment is required.
- -Predicted exposure levels (AUCss) in the 14 mg/m2 group in Study 207 are comparable to those in adult subjects from Study 303 receiving a fixed dose of 24 mg. Dosing lenvatinib per BSA in children and adolescents resulted in a similar exposure to that in adults dosed at a fixed dose of 24 mg and hence the results support the current dosing scheme in study 207 based on BSA.
- -No graphical relationship was observed in the inter-individual variability of CL/F between Cohort 3A/3B versus Cohort 1/2B/2B, therefore concomitant ifosfamide plus etoposide did not affect lenvatinib CL/F.
- -No clear relationship could be seen in exposure-response analyses for tumour response.
- -For exposure-response analyses for safety, there appear to be some trends that subjects experienced hypertension or hypothyroidism have slightly higher AUC than subjects without them.

## Treatments

## Lenvatinib

Lenvatinib hard capsules containing 1, 4, or 10 mg lenvatinib, administered orally QD. The maximum dose administered during the study should not exceed 24 mg QD in any of the cohorts. An extemporaneous suspension of lenvatinib capsules should be used for children unable to swallow capsules.

Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding)

Lenvatinib administered orally QD on Days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects 6 to &lt;18 years: Lenvatinib will be administered orally QD. Study drug doses for Cohort 1 are displayed in the table below. The starting dose is 11 mg/m2 QD, which is 80% of the adult RD of 24 mg QD. The 80% starting dose is based on consensus reached for paediatric Phase 1 trials (Smith, et al., 1998; Lee, et al., 2005). If the dose of 11 mg/m2 (Dose Level 1) is not safe and tolerable, subjects will receive lenvatinib at the lower de-escalation dose of 9 mg/m2 (Dose Level -1).

Table 8. Lenvatinib Doses for Single-Agent Dose-Finding (Cohort 1)

| DoseLevel         | Lenvatinib Once-Daily   |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| -1                | 9 mg/m²                 |
| 1 (starting dose) | 11 mg/m²                |
| 2                 | 14 mg/m²                |
| 3                 | 17 mg/m²                |

Before dose administration on Day 1 of each cycle and prior to a change in dose due to dose reduction, the subject's dose of lenvatinib was calculated based on BSA, based on the subject's current height and body weight, as follows:

Scheduled dose (mg/m2) × BSA (m2) = lenvatinib dose (mg)

Body surface area was calculated using the method that was accepted and customarily used by the clinical site. Body surface area had to be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle based on the subject's current height and body weight and was not corrected for limb amputation. The dose was rounded to the nearest integer. After adjustment for BSA, the subject's daily dose of lenvatinib could not exceed 24 mg daily.

Subjects 2 to &lt;6 years: Subjects will receive 5 mg/m2 during the 21-day Run-In Period. If these subjects do not experience any DLT, they will enter Cohort 1 Cycle 1 Day 1 and intrasubject dose escalation will take place as detailed in the Study Design section (Treatment Phase: Cohort 1).

Cohorts 2A and 2B (Single-Agent Expansion)

Lenvatinib administered orally QD at the single-agent RD (identified in Cohort 1) on Days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle to subjects with RR-DTC (Cohort 2A) or osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B).

The RD of Single-Agent lenvatinib determined in Cohort 1 was 14 mg/m2 as recommended by TiTECRM and confirmed by PSC.

Subjects in Cohorts 2A and 2B received 14 mg/m2 lenvatinib (equivalent to 24 mg QD, adult daily dose). After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose should not exceed 24 mg QD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cohort 3A (Combination Dose Finding)

Lenvatinib will be administered orally QD in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide from Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of 5 cycles to subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma as described below. Lower doses may be administered depending on the safety information.

RD = recommended dose, *each De-escalation dose level is 20% lower than the Starting Dose.

The chemotherapy cycles will be repeated every 21 days.

Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

Subjects will receive lenvatinib at the RD determined to be safe and tolerable in Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding) in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide. The chemotherapy cycles in Cohorts 3A and 3B will be repeated every 21 days.

Subjects in Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive ifosfamide and etoposide for a maximum of 5 cycles. Subjects who discontinue ifosfamide and etoposide in Cohorts 3A and 3B (e.g., due to toxicity) prior to completing 5 cycles may continue on single-agent lenvatinib if they are benefiting from the treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects who discontinue lenvatinib prior to completing 5 cycles may continue on ifosfamide and etoposide at the investigator's discretion for 5 cycles.

The RD of the combination with ifosfamide and etoposide determined in Cohort 3A is lenvatinib 14 mg/m2/day + ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day as recommended by the above rules and confirmed by the PSC.

Cohort 3B will receive lenvatinib 14 mg/m2/day + ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day

Lenvatinib Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions

Dose interruptions, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuation were allowed for subjects who experienced lenvatinib-related toxicity. Once the dose was reduced, it could not be increased at a later date. Doses in the Dose Adjustment column in the Table below are based on a presumed starting dose of 11 mg/m2. Dose reductions occur in succession based on the previous dose level. Each dose level reduction is a 20% reduction from the previous dose. Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot be increased at a later date.

Management of Ifosfamide- and Etoposide-Associated Toxicity

All sites participating in this study had considerable experience with administering chemotherapy. Blood counts were closely monitored during and prior to the next cycle of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-associated myelosuppression was managed by administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Pegylated G-CSF or G-CSF was to be administered at least 24 to 72 hours after completion of ifosfamide-etoposide chemotherapy; G-CSF was used until the subject ' s white blood cell (WBC) count was ≥ 1 × 109/L. Guidelines for dose modification for ifosfamide- and etoposide-associated toxicities are provided in Table 4 in the protocol.

Details of ifosfamide and etoposide dose interruptions and reductions as well as management of toxicity can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for each agent, and were

## Objectives

## Primary objectives

## Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding)

- Identify the recommended dose (RD) of lenvatinib as a single agent in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumours

## Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion)

- Evaluate the activity of lenvatinib in 2 separate malignancy groups:

o Cohort 2A: 131I-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer: by objective response rate (ORR) for subjects with measurable disease and by best overall response (BOR) for all subjects.

o Cohort 2B: Relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma: by progression-free survival at 4 months (PFS-4)

Note: The tumour types under study in the Single-Agent Expansion portion of the study may be modified based on preliminary efficacy and safety signals observed in Cohort 1 of the study.

## Cohort 3 (Combination Dose-Finding and Expansion)

- Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding)

To identify the RD of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in osteosarcoma subjects

- Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

Evaluate the activity of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in osteosarcoma subjects by PFS-4

## Secondary Objectives

## Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding)

- Assess the safety and toxicity profile of lenvatinib in children and adolescents
- Evaluate the activity of lenvatinib as assessed by best overall response (BOR), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), based on RECIST 1.1, disease control rate (DCR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR)
- Examine blood and tumour biomarkers and correlate with clinical response to lenvatinib
- Determine population-based pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lenvatinib
- Assess the palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib

## Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion)

- Assess the safety and toxicity profile of lenvatinib in children and adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma
- Evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib as assessed by BOR(osteosarcoma only), ORR (osteosarcoma only), DOR (measurable DTC and osteosarcoma only), PFS, TTP, DCR and CBR
- Examine blood and tumour biomarkers and correlate with clinical response to lenvatinib
- Determine population-based PK parameters of lenvatinib
- Assess the palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib Cohort 3 (Combination Dose-Finding and Expansion)

Exploratory Endpoints o Time to OS

## Sample size

Approximately 69 to 108 subjects were planned for this study.

## Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding)

Approximately 12 to 24 subjects based on TiTE-CRM algorithm (Cheung and Chappell, 2000).

Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion)

Approximately 27 to 42 subjects: DTC group (12 subjects) and osteosarcoma group (15 to 30 subjects).

## Cohort 2A : DTC Group

Approximately 12 subjects with evaluable or measurable disease were planned to be enrolled in Cohort 2A due to limited number of pediatric patients with DTC.

## Cohort 2B : Osteosarcoma Group

A minimum of 15 PFS-4 evaluable subjects will be assessed in cohort 2B. The sample size estimates were based on Simon's Optimal Two-Stage Design (Simon, 1989). If fewer than 5 subjects who are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

alive and free of disease progression at 4 months after first dose date are observed among the 15 evaluable subjects in Stage I, accrual in the cohort will be suspended.

Otherwise, if at any time during Stage I of the cohort, at least 5 subjects who are alive and free of disease progression at 4 months after first dose date are recorded among the 15 evaluable subjects, enrollment in the cohort will continue seamlessly for a total of approximately 27 evaluable subjects. If, at the end of the second stage for the cohort, at least 10 subjects who are alive and free of disease progression at 4 months are recorded among the 27 subjects in the cohort, study drug will be considered active in the population.

The above sample size estimates are based on the following assumptions: the null hypothesis PFS-4 (H0) is ≤ 25%, and the alternative hypothesis PFS-4 (H1) is ≥ 45%. One-sided Type I error (α) = 0.1, and power = 80%. To account for nonevaluable subjects, a total of 15-30 osteosarcoma subjects will be enrolled for Cohort 2B.

Cohort 3 (Combination Dose-Finding and Expansion)

## Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding)

Approximately 12 to 24 osteosarcoma subjects for whom ifosfamide and etoposide are considered a treatment option

## Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

With the following assumptions: p0=25%, p1=50%, 1sided α=10%, β=20%, where p0 is an unacceptable rate of PFS, p1 is the target rate of PFS, α is the probability of declaring lenvatinib effective when the true rate is p0, and β is the probability of declar ing lenvatinib not effective if the true rate is p1, a sample size of 15 subjects will provide a statistical power of 80%. To account for nonevaluable subjects, a total of 18 lenvatinib-naïve subjects will be enrolled for Cohort 3B, along with some subjects enrolled from Cohorts 1 and 2B.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The study is open-label.

## Statistical Methods

Efficacy will be evaluated based on the as-treated population (Safety Analysis Set).

The Safety Analysis Set is defined as subjects who receive any study drug.

The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is defined as subjects in Safety Analysis Set who have at least 1 measurable postdose plasma concentration with an adequately documented dosing history. Pharmacokinetic data will be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (% CV), geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum. Survival data (PFS and OS) will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Each cohort will have its own cutoff date for the final analysis for CSR reporting purposes.

For Cohorts 1 and 3A, the data cutoff will occur when the RD is determined and the last enrolled subject completes 6 cycles of treatment or discontinues before the end of Cycle 6, whichever occurs first or pending discussion with the PSC.

For DTC and osteosarcoma subjects in Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 3B, the cutoff will be after all subjects enrolled have either completed 6 cycles or have discontinued treatment before the end of Cycle 6, whichever occurs first.

No subjects in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2B had received prior radioiodine treatment.

## Prior Radiation Therapy

In Cohort 1, 19 (82.6%) of the 23 subjects received prior radiation therapy. The median time since last radiotherapy regimen to the first dose of study drug was 7.3, 11.7, and 16.6 months for the 11 mg/m2, 14 mg/m2, and 17 mg/m2 dose levels, respectively. The most frequent site of radiation was the bone (n=8), followed by the brain (n=5). A total of 13 subjects (56.5%) had disease progression at the tumor site following radiotherapy.

In Cohort 2B, 10 (32.3%) of the 31 subjects received prior radiation therapy. The median time since last radiotherapy regimen to the first dose of study drug was 3.9 months. Five subjects received radiation to the bone, and 5 to the viscera, including the lung. The same proportion of subjects had or did not have PD at the tumor site following prior radiotherapy (n=5, 16.1%).

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B).

Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes.

All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m² and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m² IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle.

Percentages are based on the number of subjects assigned and treated in the relevant cohorts.

IV = intravenous(ly), LENV = lenvatinib, max = maximum, min = minimum.

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle. Percentages are based on the number of subjects assigned and treated in the relevant cohorts. DLT = dose-limiting toxicity, IV = intravenous, PFS-4 = progression-free survival at Month 4. a: Full Analysis Set included all subjects who enrolled in the study. b: Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and was based on actual dose received. Because lenvatinib dose was capped at 24 mg/day, in Cohort 3A, 3 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were assigned to a lower dose level than that in the Full Analysis Set for the purpose of analysis. c: Subjects who were evaluable for PFS-4 either were treated for at least 18 weeks, had radiological PD, died, or received new anticancer treatment within 18 weeks after first dose, and includes those who discontinued study treatment for an AE or reason other than PD, death, or starting a new anticancer medication. d: Per Protocol Analysis Set included those subjects (1) who received at least 1 dose of assigned study drug, (2) who had no major protocol deviations, or (3) who had both baseline and at least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment. e: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of any study drug and had evaluable lenvatinib concentration data. f: DLT Analysis Set included all subjects who either (a) experienced DLT during Cycle 1 or (b) received all scheduled doses of study drug during Cycle 1 and completed Cycle 1 without having DLT. g: Subjects who received oral suspension of lenvatinib and completed at least 1 question on the Palatability Questionnaire.

Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses

The original protocol was approved on 08 May 2014. There were 4 protocol amendments.

Changes After Database Lock

The SAP was not updated to reflect the following changes to the analysis Plan

OS was changed from an exploratory to a secondary objective in Protocol Amendment 04, after the data cutoff date for this CSR, in order to align the protocol with the EU pediatric investigational plan. However, the analysis approach for overall survival remained unchanged. The analysis approach for OS remains unchanged. Protocol Amendment 04 was finalized after the data cut off for CSR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For Cohorts 3A and 3B, graphical displays of maximum tumor shrinkage in target lesions, defined as the maximum percentage change in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions at data cutoff, were prepared. Tumor resection during and posttreatment is presented in data listings.

Data for the 14 mg/m2 dose level for Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B were combined to perform exploratory pooled analyses of selected exposure and efficacy parameters.

The following were included as exploratory endpoints after finalization of the SAP:

- PFS-4 rate, PFS and OS for the pooled 14 mg/m2 lenvatinib dose level groups in Cohorts 3A and 3B
- Tumor shrinkage of target lesions in Cohorts 3A and 3B
- Tumor resection in Cohorts 3A and 3B

Cohort 1 (solid malignancies; N=23):

Primary Endpoint:

- The RD of lenvatinib was determined to be 14 mg/m2 QD , based on TiTE-CRM design.

Per the protocol definition, the recommended dose level was the one with the DLT rate closest to the targeted 20%. Based on the following assumptions:

(a) a power model for the probability of DLT:

F(d, α)=(pd)exp(α)

where F(d,α) is the estimated probability of DLT at dose -level d and pd is the probability of DLT at dose d

- (b) prior DLT probabilities of 0.03, 0.10, 0.20, 0.33 at the 9 mg/m2, 11 mg/m2, 14 mg/m2, and 17 mg/m2 dose levels, respectively, the final posterior probabilities of DLT derived from the TiTE-CRM model based on 20 evaluable subjects were 0.015, 0.064, 0.147, and 0.267 for the 4 dose levels, respectively.

The posterior DLT probability of the 14 mg/m2 dose level of 0.147 was the closest to the target 20% rate and 14 mg/m2 was determined to be the RD.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during Cycle 1 in subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (DoseEscalation) using the TiTE-CRM schema.

Enrollment started with 2 subjects at the 11 mg/m2 dose level (Dose 1). These 2 subjects did not experience DLT; therefore, the dose level was escalated to 14 mg/m2 and an additional 4 subjects were treated with lenvatinib at this dose level without DLT.

Subsequently, the dose level was escalated to 17 mg/m2. Eleven subjects were assigned to the 17 mg/m2 dose level. Two subjects at the assigned 17 mg/m2 dose level (the 8th and 11th subjects treated at that dose level) had DLTs in Cycle 1. However, these 2 subjects received an actual lenvatinib dose of 14 mg/m2, either because of dose capping at 24 mg for high BSA or dosing error.

Concurrently, a third subject, who was younger than 6 years of age, had DLT at the 14 mg/m2 dose level. The dose level was de-escalated to 14 mg/m2, and an additional 4 subjects were assigned to this dose level. Overall, 3 subjects, all at an actual dose of 14 mg/m2, experienced DLT.

Cohort 3A (n=22) (Full Analysis Set)

Primary Endpoint

The RD of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy, was determined to be 14 mg/m2 QD. The RDs of ifosfamide and etoposide were 3000 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2, respectively.

The RD was defined as the dose of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide that resulted in no more than 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) per 6 subjects, or hematologic DLT in 1 subject and nonhematologic DLT in another subject, per 6 subjects, upon repeating the same dose level. DLTs were assessed only in Cycle 1. The determination of DLTs was made jointly by the sponsor and the protocol steering committee after safety data were evaluated; subsequent decisions were made based

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on the number of DLTs that occurred in the 6 evaluable subjects enrolled at the prior dose level, in accordance with the rules for dose escalation and de-escalation.

The RD was investigated using a dose-finding strategy that initiated lenvatinib at a starting dose 20% lower than the single-agent RD (14 mg/m2) as determined in Cohort 1. Each subject's BSA-adjusted lenvatinib dosage could not exceed 24 mg once daily (QD). Subjects whose daily dose of lenvatinib was capped at 24 mg because of a high BSA, and who did not experience DLT, were to be replaced for the purpose of determining the RD. The starting dosages of ifosfamide and etoposide were in line with the standard of care in Europe and could not be escalated.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during Cycle 1 in subjects enrolled in Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding). One subject had a DLT at the 11 mg/m2 dose level and 2 subjects had DLTs at the 14 mg/m2 dose level. Two of the 3 subjects had DLTs of thrombocytopenia. Consequently, the RD of single-agent lenvatinib was determined to be 14 mg/m2 and was used as the RD in Cohort 3B.

- c: P value based on 1-sided exact test of a single proportion using the null hypothesis that PFS-4 was ≤25%.
- The improvement in PFS-4 rate (binomial estimate) was statistically significant for both populations compared with the prespecified PFS-4 rate of 25% in the null hypothesis, and was clinically meaningful.

- -PFS-4 rate (KM estimate): 77.4% (95% CI: 50.3, 90.9) based on all 20 subjects
- Based on PFS-4, results indicate that lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy has antitumor activity in pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

- PFS and TTP: median (95% CI), 6.9 months (4.2, NE)
- Median (95% CI) follow-up time for PFS was 5.8 months (5.3, 8.8)
- -ORR : n=3 PRs, 16.7% (95% CI: 3.6, 41.4), based on 18 subjects with measurable disease
- Duration of Response: 1.5, 4.6, and 6.2 months, respectively, in the 3 responders (DOR censored for all 3 subjects at data cutoff date)

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints

## -Overall Survival :

Median OS was not estimable (95% CI: 7.3 mo, NE). As of the data cutoff date of 18 Jul 2019 for Cohort 3B, 3 (15%) of the 20 subjects had died

- Median follow-up time was 8.1 months (95% CI: 5.2, 9.5)
- Tumour Resection: 2 subjects had tumour resection during or after study treatment; both were partial resections of a lung lesion Ad Hoc Analyses of Subjects who Received Lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 in Cohorts 3A and 3B Combined (N=35)

## Exploratory pooled analyses for 14 mg/m2 dose level (Cohorts 3A and 3B)

Exploratory pooled analyses were performed for the 14 mg/m2 dose level group across both cohorts combined (hereafter referred to as the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level) for PFS-4 rate, PFS, ORR, and OS.

Progression-Free Survival Rate at 4 Months

- -PFS-4 rate (binomial estimate): 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0, 83.5) based on 27 evaluable subjects .

## Safety results

Safety Results (Safety Analysis Set)

All events described herein were treatment-emergent.

## Cohort 1 (solid malignancies; N=23)

- DLTs (Cycle 1) occurred in 3 of 11 subjects at the RD of 14 mg/m2 dose level: hypertension (n=2) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (n=1)
- Median duration of lenvatinib was 4.6, 1.8, and 1.8 months for the 11, 14, and 17 mg/m2 groups, respectively
- AEs occurred in all 23 subjects; the most frequently reported ( ≥ 50%) AEs were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, and vomiting. One subject had Grade 1 pneumothorax.
- -Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in 20 subjects (87.0%); the most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) were hypertension, alanine aminotransferase increased, and proteinuria
- Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related AEs were reported for 14 subjects (60.9%); events that occurred in &gt;1 subject were hypertension (n=5), proteinuria (2), and weight decreased (2)
- Five subjects (21.7%) had Grade 5 AEs: cardiac arrest, cardio-respiratory arrest, depressed level of consciousness, pleural effusion, and respiratory distress. All were considered by the investigator to be secondary to PD and not related to study drug.
- Nonfatal SAEs were reported for 14 subjects (60.9%); the following occurred in &gt;1 subject each were cancer pain (n=3) and hypertension, pain in extremity, pneumonia, and pyrexia (n=2 each)
- AEs led to discontinuation of lenvatinib in 4 subjects (17.4%); no individual AE led to discontinuation in &gt;1 subject
- AEs led to lenvatinib dose reduction or interruption in 18 subjects (78.3%); the most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) were decreased appetite and weight decreased
- Clinically significant events (CSEs) associated with lenvatinib occurred in 22 subjects (95.7%); the following occurred in ≥ 20% of subjects: hypothyroidism, haemorrhage, hypertension, weight loss, hepatotoxicity, and proteinuria
- Grade ≥ 3 CSEs occurred in 12 subjects (52.2%). The following occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects: hepatotoxicity (n=6), hypertension (6), and proteinuria (3)
- Haematology laboratory values were Grade 3 or Grade 4 during study treatment for platelet count decreased (n=3), lymphocyte count decreased (2), and haemoglobin decreased (2). Neutropenia and platelet count decreased were reported as SAEs in 1 subject each. One subject discontinued lenvatinib treatment because of platelet count decreased.
- Clinical chemistry laboratory values were Grade 3 or Grade 4 for ALT (n=3), aspartate aminotransferase (2), amylase (2) and sodium (1) increased and potassium (1) and sodium (3) decreased during study treatment. Amylase increased and lipase increased were reported as SAEs in 1 subject each. No subject discontinued lenvatinib treatment because of a clinical chemistry abnormality.
- Increased blood pressure (BP) and weight loss occurred early during treatment; both are known side effects of lenvatinib.
- There were no remarkable changes in mean or median values for any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters over time, including calculated QTc values.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohort 2A (RR-DTC; N=1):

- As of the cutoff date (31 May 2019), the subject had received 185 days (7 cycles) of study drug
- The subject experienced the following TEAEs: abdominal, back and neck pain, acne, diarrhea, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, insomnia, pyrexia, and thyroglobulin increased.

Diarrhea was reported as Grade 3. None were serious.

Cohort 2B (relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma; N=31):

- AEs occurred in 29 subjects (93.5%); the most frequently reported ( ≥ 40%) were decreased appetite, headache, vomiting, hypothyroidism, and proteinuria
- Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 20 subjects (64.5%); events in &gt;2 subjects were back pain and tumor pain
- 28 subjects (90.3%) had TEAEs reported by the investigator to be treatment-related, which were Grade ≥ 3 in 7 subjects (22.6%). The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs, occurring in 30% or more of subjects were decreased appetite, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

- Nonfatal SAEs occurred in 20 subjects (64.5%). Events that occurred in &gt;1 subject each were back pain (n=4), pneumothorax (4), dyspnea (3), tumour pain (3), and platelet count decreased (2).
- AEs led to discontinuation of lenvatinib in 4 subjects (12.9%); no individual TEAE led to discontinuation in &gt;1 subject
- AEs led to lenvatinib dose reduction or interruption in 20 subjects (64.5%); the most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) were nausea and vomiting

Clinical cutoff dates: 31 Mar 2017 (Cohort 1) and 02 Aug 2018 (Cohort 2B). Data for Cohorts 1 and 2B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. For each row category, a subject with 2 or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.03. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 5 subjects in Cohort 1 received a lower dose than planned dose level and were assigned to either the 11 mg/m2 or the 14 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Eight subjects  in Cohort 2B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. AE = adverse event, BSA = body surface area, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, NA = not applicable, SAE = serious AE, TEAE = treatment-emergent AE. a: Treatment-related TEAEs include AEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug or that had a missing causality on the case report form. b: AEs that met the criteria defined in the protocol as a dose-limiting toxicity. c: Fatal TEAEs for any cause. Fatal SAEs were also reported in total SAEs. d: Incidence determined using the data listings.

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. For each row category, a subject with 2 or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 3 subjects in Cohort 3A received a lower dose than planned, and were assigned to the 11 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Five subjects in Cohort 3B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. BSA = body surface area, IV = intravenous(ly), LENV = lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SAE = serious adverse event, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. a: Treatment-related TEAEs include AEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug or that had a missing causality on the case report form. b: Adverse events that met criteria defined per protocol as dose-limiting toxicity. c: Subjects with fatal SAEs may also be reported in the category of nonfatal SAEs. Subjects may be in multiple categories for nonfatal SAEs (data not shown). d: Drug discontinuation, reduction or interruption for lenvatinib, regardless of action taken for chemo agents. e: Drug discontinuation, reduction or interruption for chemotherapy agents, regardless of action taken for lenvatinib.

## Results by age category

Adverse events were analysed by age category (2 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;18 years, and ≥ 18 years) for both Cohorts 3A and 3B. Few subjects were enrolled in each age category.

## Cohort 1 (Dose-Finding)

In Cohort 1, 2 subjects were 2 to &lt;6 years of age and 21 subjects were 6 to &lt;18 years of age. All 23 subjects experienced TEAEs.

## Age Category: 2 to &lt;6 Years

Both subjects 2 to &lt;6 years of age experienced hypothyroidism and hypertension, among other TEAEs (eg, diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia). One of the 2 subjects had 3 SAEs: hypertension, pneumonia, and cancer pain; all were Grade 3. The hypertension was considered by the investigator to be related to lenvatinib.

## Age Category: 6 to &lt;18 Years

The most frequently reported TEAEs in subjects 6 to &lt;18 years of age, occurring in 40% or more of subjects, in descending order of frequency were decreased appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, weight decreased, headache, and pyrexia. Eight of the 21 subjects (38.1%) had hypertension. Thirteen subjects (61.9%) aged 6 to &lt;18 years had 1 or more SAEs. All were reported by 1 subject each, with the exception of cancer pain (n=2, 20.0%).

## Cohort 2B (Expansion)

In Cohort 2B, 24 subjects were aged 6 to &lt;18 years and 7 were 18 years or older. All 24 subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years and 5 subjects (71.4%) ≥ 18 years experienced TEAEs.

## Age Category: 6 to &lt;18 Years

The most frequently reported TEAEs in subjects 6 to &lt;18 years of age, occurring in 40% or more of subjects, were proteinuria, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, and hypothyroidism.

A total of 18 subjects (75.0%) in this age category had a treatment-emergent SAE. Pneumothorax was reported as serious in 4 subjects. Other SAEs reported by more than 2 subjects each were back pain (n=3) and tumor pain (n=3).

## Age Category: ≥ 18 Years

The most frequently reported TEAEs in subjects ≥ 18 years of age, occurring in 50% or more of subjects, in descending order of frequency, were headache, pyrexia, asthenia, constipation, cough, decreased appetite, dysphonia, and diarrhea. Three of the 7 subjects (42.9%) aged ≥ 18 years had a treatment-emergent SAE. No SAEs were reported by more than 1 subject each in this age category. None of the subjects had serious pneumothorax.

## Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding)

In Cohort 3A, 1 subject was 2 to &lt;6 , 16 subjects were 6 to &lt;18 , and 5 subjects were ≥ 18 years of age. All 22 subjects experienced TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs in subjects 6 to &lt;18 years of age (&gt;60% of subjects in that age group), in descending order of frequency, were: anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neutropenia.

The single subject in the 2 to &lt;6 years age category, who received lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 in combination with chemotherapy, experienced multiple TEAEs, most notably Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 5 subjects aged ≥ 18 years had TEAEs, and all 5 had at least one Grade ≥ 3 TEAE. The most frequently reported TEAEs (any grade), occurring in 80% of subjects in that age group, were: constipation, hypothyroidism, lymphocyte count decreased, stomatitis, vomiting, and WBC count decreased.

Sixteen subjects (72.7%) in Cohort 3A had at least 1 SAE as follows: 1 (100%) aged 2 to &lt;6 years, 10 (62.5%) aged 6 to &lt;18 years, and 5 (100%) aged ≥ 18 years.

## Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

In Cohort 3B, no subjects were 2 to &lt;6 , 15 subjects were 6 to &lt;18 , and 5 subjects were ≥ 18 years of age. All 20 subjects experienced TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs (any grade) in subjects 6 to &lt;18 years of age, occurring in &gt;50% of subjects (in descending order of frequency) were: anemia, WBC count decreased, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and proteinuria. All 15 subjects experienced a Grade ≥ 3 TEAE.

In the 5 subjects aged ≥ 18 years, 4 subjects each had asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, and platelet count decreased. All 5 subjects had 1 or more Grade 3/4 TEAEs. Fifteen subjects (75.0%) in Cohort 3B had at least 1 SAE as follows: 12 (80.0%) aged 6 to &lt;18 years and 3 (60.0%) aged ≥ 18 years. The most frequently reported SAEs in both age groups were neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, and WBC count decreased.

## Deaths

## Cohort 1 (Dose-Finding)

As of the clinical cutoff date of 31 Mar 2017, 15 deaths occurred in Cohort 1, 5 of which were treatment-emergent and 10 of which occurred &gt;30 days posttreatment.

All 5 treatment-emergent deaths were assessed by the investigator as secondary to disease progression and not related to study drug. The TEAEs leading to death, reported for 1 subject each, were cardiac arrest, cardiorespiratory arrest, depressed level of consciousness, pleural effusion, and respiratory distress.

## Cohort 2B (Expansion)

As of the clinical cutoff date of 02 Aug 2018, 20 deaths occurred in Cohort 2B, 4 of which were treatment-emergent and 16 of which occurred &gt;30 days posttreatment. All 4 treatment-emergent deaths were assessed by the investigator as secondary to disease progression and not related to study drug. The TEAEs leading to death were cardiorespiratory arrest (n=2), respiratory failure (n=1), and respiratory distress (n=1).

## Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding)

As of the data cutoff date of 03 Jun 2019, 12 deaths occurred in Cohort 3A, 2 of which were treatmentemergent (Table 37). Both treatment-emergent deaths were considered by the investigator to be AEs associated with PD; neither were reported by the investigator as related to study treatment. The 2 TEAEs leading to death, reported for 1 subject each, were brain injury and dyspnea.

## Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

As of the data cutoff date of 18 Jul 2019, 3 deaths occurred in Cohort 3B, 2 of which were treatmentemergent (Table 37). Both treatment-emergent deaths were considered by the investigator to be AEs associated with PD; neither were reported by the investigator as related to study treatment. The TEAEs leading to death were dyspnea and malignant neoplasm progression.

Clinical cutoff dates: 31 Mar 2017 (Cohort 1) and 02 Aug 2018 (Cohort 2B). Cutoff based on preferred term for subjects overall in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2B. Incidence for SOCs is based on all subjects. Data for Cohorts 1 and 2B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 5 subjects in Cohort 1 received a lower dose than planned dose level, and were assigned to either the 11 mg/m2 or the 14 mg/m2 dose level  for the purpose of analysis. Eight subjects  in Cohort 2B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Subjects with 2 or more AEs of the same preferred term were counted only once at the highest grade. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events graded using (CTCAE) version 4.03. AE = adverse event, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, BSA = body surface area, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, GGT = gamma-glutamyl transferase, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SOC = system organ class, TEAE = treatment-emergent AE.

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). * Cutoff based on incidence of individual PTs in ≥ 10% of total subjects in either Cohort 3A or 3B. Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Percentages based on total number of subjects within relevant treatment group for Safety Analysis Set. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 3 subjects in Cohort 3A received a lower dose than planned, and were assigned to the 11 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Five subjects  in Cohort 3B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Subjects with 2 or more AEs of the same preferred term were counted only once at the highest grade. AE = adverse event, BSA = body surface area, IV = intravenous(ly), LENV = lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, PT = preferred term, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. a: One subject (15031002) in Cohort 3B had a serious pneumothorax event; however, it was Grade 2. See Sections 12.3.1.2 and 12.4.1.3.7 for details. Source: Table 14.3.1.2.1.5.1.3A (Cohort 3A) and Table 14.3.1.2.1.5.2.3B (Cohort 3B)

Clinical cutoff dates: 31 Mar 2017 (Cohort 1) and 02 Aug 2018 (Cohort 2B).

Data for Cohorts 1 and 2B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 5 subjects in Cohort 1 received a lower dose than planned dose level, and were assigned to either the 11 mg/m2 or the 14 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Eight subjects in Cohort 2B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. BSA = body surface area, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SAE = serious adverse event. Source: Table 14.3.2.2.4 (Cohort 1) and Table 14.3.2.2.4B (Cohort 2B).

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. Subjects with multiple AEs in the same CSE category were counted once for that CSE category. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 3 subjects in Cohort 3A received a lower dose than planned, and were assigned to the 11 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Five subjects in Cohort 3B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. a: CSE categories are based on either standard or customized MedDRA queries.

Clinical cutoff dates: 31 Mar 2017 (Cohort 1) and 02 Aug 2018 (Cohort 2B). Data for Cohorts 1 and 2B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. Dose reductions and interruptions are based on dose administration data on the case report form. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to this dose capping, 5 subjects in Cohort 1 received a lower dose than their planned dose level, and were assigned to either the 11 mg/m2 or the 14 mg/m2 dose level  for the purpose of analysis. Eight subjects in Cohort 2B also received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. BSA = body surface area, Max = maximum, Min = minimum. Source: Table 14.3.1.1.3 (Cohort 1) and Table 14.3.1.1.3B (Cohort 2B).

Clinical cutoff dates: 31 Mar 2017 (Cohort 1) and 02 Aug 2018 (Cohort 2B). Data for Cohorts 1 and 2B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Table sorted in descending frequency for Cohort 2B. Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. Subjects having the same AE multiple times are counted only once. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 5 subjects in Cohort 1 received a lower dose than planned dose level, and were assigned to either the 11 mg/m2  or the 14 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Eight subjects in Cohort 2B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1.Adverse events graded using CTCAE version 4.03. BSA = body surface area, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

Data cutoff dates: 03 Jun 2019 (Cohort 3A) and 18 Jul 2019 (Cohort 3B). Data for Cohorts 3A and 3B are presented in the same table for convenience and not for comparison purposes. Table sorted in descending frequency in total column for Cohort 3B. Subject with 2 or more AEs in the same system organ class (or having the same preferred term) is counted only once for that system organ class (or preferred term). Percentages based on total number of subjects within the relevant treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set. All subjects received ifosfamide (IFOS) 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide (ETOP) 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle for 5 cycles in addition to lenvatinib once daily on all days of each cycle. The dose of lenvatinib was based on BSA and capped at 24 mg/day. Due to the dose capping, 3 subjects in Cohort 3A received a lower dose than planned, and were assigned to the 11 mg/m2 dose level for the purpose of analysis. Five subjects in Cohort 3B received a lower dose than the planned dose level of 14 mg/m2 due to dose capping, but were included in the 14 mg/m2 dose level for analysis purposes. Adverse events coded using MedDRA version 21.1. Adverse events graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. BSA = body surface area, IV = intravenous(ly), LENV = lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, TEAE = treatmentemergent adverse event.

## Adverse Events that Resulted in Discontinuation of Study Drug

Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding)

Discontinuation of All 3 Study Drugs

In Cohort 3A, 3 subjects (13.6%) discontinued all 3 study drugs (13.6%): 1 (9.1%) at the 11 mg/m2 dose level and 2 (18.2%) at the 14 mg/m2 dose level. The TEAEs that resulted in treatment discontinuation in the 3 subjects were 1) malignant pleural effusion ('worsening of pleural effusion due to progressive disease' per the investigator), 2) pneumothorax, and 3) blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased and hypothyroidism. One TEAE, malignant pleural effusion, was Grade 4 and 1 TEAE, pneumothorax, was Grade 3; the remaining 2 were Grade 1 or Grade 2.

Discontinuation of Lenvatinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Cohort 3A, TEAEs led to discontinuation of lenvatinib in 5 subjects (22.7%): 3 (27.3%) at the 11 mg/m2 dose level and 2 (18.2%) at the 14 mg/m2 dose level. For 3 subjects, the TEAE that led to discontinuation was Grade ≥ 3. No TEAE led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject each.

## Discontinuation of Ifosfamide

In Cohort 3A, TEAEs led to discontinuation of ifosfamide in 4 subjects (18.2%): 1 (9.1%) at the 11 mg/m2 dose level and 3 (27.3%) at the 14 mg/m2 dose level. For 2 subjects, the TEAE that led to discontinuation was Grade ≥ 3. No TEAE led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject each.

## Discontinuation of Etoposide

In Cohort 3A, TEAEs led to discontinuation of etoposide in 3 subjects (13.6%): 1 (9.1%) at the 11 mg/m2 dose level and 2 (18.2%) at the 14 mg/m2 dose level (Table 49). For 1 subject, the TEAE that led to discontinuation was Grade 4. No TEAE led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject each.

Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion)

## Discontinuation of Any Study Drug

In Cohort 3B, 1 subject (5.0%) discontinued ifosfamide and etoposide for Grade 3 venoocclusive disease. This event resulted in a dose reduction of lenvatinib. No other subjects in Cohort 3B discontinued study treatment because of a TEAE.

## Radiographic Findings of Proximal Tibial Growth Plates

In Cohort 1, 12 subjects had an open proximal tibial growth plate at Baseline. One subject, assigned to the 14 mg/m2 dose level, had an abnormality at Baseline. At the Off-treatment visit, 1 subject's tibial growth plate had closed and 1 remained open without abnormality. The remaining 10 subjects did not have a follow-up radiograph at the end of the study, including the subject who had an abnormality at Baseline.

In Cohort 2B, 11 subjects had an open proximal tibial growth plate at Baseline, all without abnormality. At  the  Off-treatment  visit,  5  subjects'  tibial  growth  plate  remained  open  without  abnormality  and  6 subjects did not have a follow-up radiograph.

In Cohort 3A, 20 of the 22 subjects had a radiographic scan of the proximal tibial growth plates. Eight subjects had an open proximal tibial growth plate at Baseline. Two of the 8 subjects, one each assigned to the 11 and 14 mg/m2 dose levels, had an abnormality at Baseline. Neither subject had a follow-up assessment at the Off-treatment visit. The 6 remaining subjects with open growth plates at Baseline either had an open growth plate at the Off-treatment visit (n=2), or a follow-up scan was not performed (n=4).

In  Cohort 3B, 11 of the 20 subjects had a radiographic scan of the proximal tibial growth plates at Baseline. Five subjects had an open proximal tibial growth plate at Baseline, all without abnormality. Of the 5 subjects with open growth plates at Baseline, 3 subjects were not assessed at the Off-treatment visit, 1 subject's tibial growth plate remained open without abnormality, and 1 subject's growth plate had closed.

## Palatability questionnaire

One of the secondary objectives of the Study 207 was to assess the palatability and acceptability of the oral suspension formulation of lenvatinib.

The palatability and acceptability of the oral suspension formulation of lenvatinib was assessed using the Palatability Questionnaire. Measurement of palatability was assessed using the Hedonic scale,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which is a visual analog scale (Guinard, 2001). All subjects who received the suspension formulation completed the questionnaire according to the Schedule of Assessments in the protocol. If a subject was unable to complete the questionnaire, the questionnaire was completed by a parent or legal guardian.

Three subjects in Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 2B took the suspension. Ratings for overall acceptability were really bad, super bad, and good for the 3 subjects in Cohort 1, respectively. The subject in Cohort 2B rated the overall acceptability of the suspension as good. Two subjects in Cohort 3A and 5 subjects in Cohort 3B took lenvatinib as an oral suspension.

Five subjects (1 in Cohort 3A, 4 in Cohort 3B) completed the palatability questionnaire. Overall acceptability of the lenvatinib suspension was rated as good by the subject in Cohort 3A. In Cohort 3B, the 4 subjects rated the overall acceptability of the lenvatinib suspension as follows: good (n=1), may be good or may be bad (n=1), bad (n=1), and really bad (n=1), respectively.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The  Study  207  (Study  E7080-G000-207)  was  the  first  study  in  paediatric  patients  with  lenvatinib monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. This Phase 1/2 open-label study of lenvatinib in children  and  adolescents  with  refractory  or  relapsed  solid  malignancies  and  young  adults  with osteosarcoma was conducted in 5 cohorts:

· Cohort 1, a single-agent dose-finding study of lenvatinib in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors to determine the RD

- Cohort 2, an assessment of the efficacy of single-agent lenvatinib at the RD in subjects with either
- 131I-refractory DTC (Cohort 2A) or
- relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B)

· Cohort 3A, combination dose-finding study of lenvatinib plus chemotherapy (ifosfamide and etoposide) in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma to determine the RD of the combination as well as the safety and tolerability of the combination

· Cohort 3B, combination expansion study with lenvatinib, at the RD, plus chemotherapy (ifosfamide and etoposide) in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma who either were lenvatinib-naïve or had disease progression after treatment with single-agent lenvatinib in Cohorts 1 or 2B

The primary objectives were to identify the RD and to evaluate the activity of lenvatinib as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy (ifosfamide and etoposide). Dose-limiting toxicities were defined based on known lenvatinib and chemotherapy drug toxicities, but also included any unexpected toxicities. As regards combination with chemotherapy, the MAH hypothesized that vascular normalization would allow increased uptake of drugs into tumour tissue. Ifosfamide-based chemotherapy, with or without etoposide, has been used as part of standard therapy options for the treatment of relapsed osteosarcoma since  the  early  1980s  (Fan,  et  al.,  2015).  Thus,  ifosfamide  and  etoposide  were  selected  as  the chemotherapy agents for combination with lenvatinib based on their use in the relapsed setting.

Lenvatinib was provided as 1-, 4-, and 10-mg capsules. Each subject's dose was based on their body surface area (BSA), according to his/her assigned dose level (11 or 14 mg/m2 in Cohort 3A or 14 mg/m2 in Cohort 3B). After dose adjustment for BSA, the maximum lenvatinib dose could not exceed 24 mg/day. Lenvatinib was self-administered orally once daily, at the same time each day (either with or without

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

food)  in  continuous  21-day  cycles.  Subjects  who  could  not  swallow  capsules  whole  could  receive lenvatinib as an extemporaneous suspension.

The palatability and acceptability of the oral suspension formulation of lenvatinib was also assessed.

After determination of the recommended dose in Cohort 1, an expansion phase was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent lenvatinib in subjects with RR-DTC  (Cohort 2A) or relapsed/refractory  osteosarcoma  (Cohort  2B).  Subjects  received  ifosfamide+etoposide  according  to approved dosing  regimens for a maximum of 5 cycles. Subjects received lenvatinib once daily, which could be continued as a single agent after the completion / discontinuation of ifosfamide+etoposide until disease progression (PD), development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, investigator or subject request, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor's termination of the study Assessments (Cohort 3).

Due to the bone-producing nature of osteosarcoma, radiographic objective responses are rare.

For the Cohorts 2B and 3B, the primary endpoint chosen was PFS-4 as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. PFS rate at a fixed time point was chosen as measure of activity of anticancer drugs for osteosarcoma because of the limitations of ORR in osteosarcoma (Omer, et al., 2017; Lagmay, et al., 2016; Grignani, et al., 2012). Although there is no consensus on time point, due to the role of surgery in the management of disease, the selected time point must not delay surgery. At the time Study 207 was planned, single-agent sorafenib demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed disease based on a PFS-4 rate of 46% (Grignani, et al., 2012), leading to its inclusion in the NCCN and ESMO treatment  guidelines  for  osteosarcoma  (NCCN,  2019;  ESMO,  2018).  Subsequent  studies  of  novel therapies have also used PFS-4 as the primary endpoint. The use of a 4-month time point also coincides with  the  completion  of  chemotherapy.  Accordingly,  Study  207  used  PFS-4  as  the  primary  efficacy outcome measure and permitted surgery of pre-existing lesions after completion of 4 months of therapy, although the study was not designed to determine eligibility for subsequent surgery.

Therefore,  Study  207  used  PFS-4  as  the  primary  outcome  measure  of  activity  in  osteosarcoma  and permitted  surgery  of  pre-existing  lesions  after  completion  of  4  months  of  therapy.  The  investigator performed tumor assessments using RECIST 1.1 during the Pretreatment Phase, every 6 weeks during the Treatment Phase, and in the posttreatment period until the subject had PD or until another anticancer therapy was initiated,  whichever  occurred  first.  Investigator-determined  response  assessments  were performed at each assessment time point.

Secondary  objectives  of  the  study  were  standard  assessments  in  cancer  trials  and  included  safety, toxicity,  tumour  response  (PFS,  BOR,  DOR,  TTP,  ORR,  DCR  and  CBR),  and  determination  of  PK parameters. Overall survival was also updated from an exploratory objective to a secondary objective (Protocol Amendment 04).

The ultimate goal of treatment in osteosarcoma is surgical resection, which is prognostic for treatment outcomes (Leary, et al., 2013; Bacci, et al., 2005; Chou, et al., 2005; Kempf-Bielack, et al., 2005; Hawkins and Arndt, 2003). For patients who are unable to achieve complete resection, the disease is almost universally fatal (ESMO, 2018).

Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed ( ≥ 1 relapse) or refractory osteosarcoma were eligible for inclusion in Cohorts 3A and 3B. Subjects had to have evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, adequate organ (eg, bone marrow, renal, hepatic, cardiac) function, life expectancy of at least 3 months, Lansky play score or Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of ≥ 50%, appropriate washout periods following prior therapy, no more than 1 prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy for their cancer,  and  no  clinically  significant  abnormalities  that  could  have  interfered  with  the  subjects' participation in the study or analysis of their data as outlined in the protocol.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose  interruptions,  dose  reductions,  or  treatment  discontinuation  were  allowed  for  subjects  who experienced lenvatinib-related toxicity. Once the dose was reduced, it could not be increased at a later date.

The original protocol was approved on 08 May 2014. There were 4 protocol amendments. Major changes, focusing on those that affected Cohort 3. Protocol Amendment 04 was finalized after the data cut off for this CSR; therefore, the resulting changes are not reflected in the body of this CSR. However, the changes are  included  in  Table  4  for  completeness.  In  Amendment  04,  overall  survival  was  changed  from  an exploratory to a secondary objective in order to align the protocol with the EU paediatric investigational plan. However, the analysis approach for overall survival remained unchanged.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Results  of  treatment  with  single-agent  lenvatinib  in  solid  tumours  (Cohort  1),  relapsed/refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (Cohort 2A), and osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B), were reported separately in a dedicated CSR distinct from the CSR for Cohorts 3A and 3B with combination therapy.

## Selection of the starting dose for monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy

The RD of lenvatinib was determined to be 14 mg/m2 QD in Cohort 1 and this was the dosage used in Cohort 2. For dose-finding, the starting dosage of lenvatinib, 11 mg/m2/day, was 80% of the adult dosage of 24 mg QD in RR-DTC. The maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of singleagent lenvatinib of 14 mg/m2 QD provides comparable exposure to the recommended daily dose of single-agent lenvatinib (24 mg QD) in adults with RR-DTC. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 3 subjects, all at the 14 mg/m2 dose level, and included hypertension (n=2) and ALT increased (n=1).

In  Cohort  3A,  escalating  doses  of  single-agent  lenvatinib  were  administered  orally  once  daily  in combination with ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide 100 mg/m2, administered IV on Days 1 to 3 of each  21-day  cycle.  The  starting  dosage  of  lenvatinib,  11  mg/m2/day,  was  20%  lower  than  the  RD determined  in  Cohort  1  (14  mg/m2  lenvatinib).  Dose-limiting  toxicities  occurred  in  3  subjects,  and included thrombocytopenia in 2 subjects, 1 subject each at the 11 and 14 mg/m2 dose levels. A third subject, at the 14 mg/m2 dose level, had DLTs of oral dysesthesia, back pain, and muscle spasms. The 14 mg/m2 lenvatinib dose level (with daily dose capped at 24 mg QD) was identified as the recommended dose  (RD)  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  This  dose  is  the  same  as  the  RD  determined  in  the monotherapy Phase 1 dose-finding Cohort 1, and is equivalent to the RD of lenvatinib in adults with DTC (24 mg QD).

Due to the rarity of RR-DTC in paediatric patients, only 1 subject with this disease was enrolled in Cohort 2A, despite implementing measures to improve enrolment. Data for this patient are not included in the main analysis, but are descriptively summarized in Section 14.3.3 of the CSR.

This patient had a BOR of confirmed PR. This patient was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in 2017, was enrolled at lenvatinib 14 mg/m2. On 2018 (Day 1), lenvatinib was initiated at an actual dose of 24 mg QD. During the study, he experienced the following nonserious adverse events: abdominal, back  and  neck  pain,  acne,  diarrhoea,  hypertension,  hypertriglyceridemia,  hyperuricemia,  insomnia, pyrexia, and thyroglobulin increased. All TEAEs were Grade 1 or  2, except for Grade 3 diarrhoea, which started on Day 35. On Day 45, the treatment with lenvatinib was interrupted for Grade 3 diarrhoea; treatment was restarted on Day 48 at a reduced dose of 11 mg/m2. As of the cutoff date of 2019, the subject has received lenvatinib for 185 days and treatment was ongoing. At that time, the subject had achieved a best overall response of confirmed partial response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to support the extrapolation of the efficacy of lenvatinib from adult patients to pediatric patients with RR-DTC, a population PK analysis was performed (please refer to M&amp;S section above). The data show that predicted exposure levels for 14 mg/m2 QD lenvatinib are comparable to adults with RR-DTC who received lenvatinib at a fixed dose of 24 mg QD. Moreover, data from the PK analysis support BSAbased dosing.

Although the presentation of DTC in adult and paediatric patients differs, there is no evidence to suggest that  RR-DTC  in  the  adult  and  paediatric  population  represent  a  different  disease.  Furthermore,  the treatment strategy for both populations is the same. Thus, given the comparable exposure observed and the similarity in the biological course of disease, the expected response to lenvatinib can be considered similar in both the pediatric and adult populations, with RR-DTC. However, the extrapolation strategy should be justified by the MAH (please refer to the related OCs).

## Osteosarcoma

Paediatric  osteosarcoma  represents  an  area  of  high  unmet  need.    Patients  with  osteosarcoma  were enrolled  in  Cohorts  2A  (lenvatinib  monotherapy),  3A  and  3B  (combination  of  lenvatinib  with chemotherapy).

A total of 31 subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma enrolled in Cohort 2B. Inconsistent with the prevalence of osteosarcoma, the majority of subjects were female. Osteosarcoma also has a slightly higher incidence in black and Hispanic ethnic groups compared with whites (Mirabello, et al., 2009; Bleyer, et al., 2006). However, all but 1 investigational site in this study were in Europe, and 20 of the 31 subjects were white, 2 were of another racial background and, for 9 subjects, race was not collected on the CRF. Only 4 subjects were reported as Hispanic.

In Cohort B, a total of 42 subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma (22 and 20 in Cohort 3A and Cohort  3B,  respectively)  were  treated.  Consistent  with  the  known  prevalence  of  osteosarcoma,  the majority of subjects were male. All but 1 investigational site in this study were located in Europe, and 33 of the 42 subjects were white, 3 were of another racial background, and, for 9 subjects, race was not collected on the CRF. Only 8 subjects were reported as Hispanic.

Thus, subject demographics in this study appear to reflect those of the European countries involved and not necessarily the epidemiology of the disease. Nonetheless, no racial differences are expected based on  previous  results  observed  throughout  the  lenvatinib  development  program  and  the  biology  of osteosarcoma.

As  regards  prior  anticancer  treatment,  in  Cohort  3A,  9  subjects  (40.9%)  received  at  least  2  prior anticancer regimens, and 3 subjects (13.6%) received 3 or more prior regimens. The most frequently used prior anticancer medications were cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. All 22 subjects had received  a  prior  anthracycline.  Ten  subjects  (45.5%)  had  received  prior  ifosfamide,  6  of  them  in combination with etoposide. No subjects in Cohort 3A had received prior anti-VEGF therapy. Overall, response to the subjects' most recent prior therapy was low. Four (18.2%) of the 22 subjects had a PR; 1 additional subject (4.5%) had a CR. The median duration of the most recent prior anticancer therapy was 2.1 and 8.2 months for subjects in the 11 and 14 mg/m2 dose level groups, respectively.

In Cohort 3A, 21 of 22 subjects (95.5%) of subjects underwent a prior anticancer procedure. Seven of the  subjects  (31.8%)  underwent  a  prior  lung  resection.  Refer  to  Section  11.1.2.2  for  subjects  who received prior radiation therapy to the lung.

The majority (80%) of subjects in Cohort 3B had received 2 or more prior anticancer regimens; 40% had received 3 or more prior regimens. Prior anticancer medications used by &gt;50% of subjects (in descending  frequency)  were  cisplatin,  doxorubicin,  methotrexate,  and  ifosfamide.  Nineteen  subjects (95%) had received a prior anthracycline. Fourteen subjects (70%) had received prior ifosfamide, 8 of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

them  in  combination  with  etoposide.  One  subject  (5%)  received  prior  anti-VEGF  therapy,  namely bevacizumab. All 20 subjects (100.0%) underwent a prior anticancer procedure. Eleven (55.0%) of the subjects underwent a prior lung resection. Response to the subjects' most Response to the subjects' most recent prior therapy was low. Two (10%) of the 20 subjects had a PR; no subject had a CR.

The median duration of the most recent prior anticancer therapy was 3.6 months. As regards prior radiation therapy, in Cohort 3A, 2 subjects (9.1%), both in the 14 mg/m2 dose level group, received prior radiation therapy to miscellaneous sites or  to skull/spine/thorax/pelvic bones.

The median time since last radiotherapy regimen to the first dose of study drug was 12.8 months overall. Both subjects had disease progression at the tumor site following radiotherapy.

In Cohort 3B, 1 subject (5.0%) received prior radiation therapy to the brain, which ended 1.4 months before entering Study 207. The subject did not have disease progression at the tumour site following radiotherapy.

## Efficacy

Results for study treatment in subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma are based on PFS-4 rate, a benchmark for activity in clinical trials in this disease.

## Cohort 2B - monotherapy with lenvatinib is osteosarcoma patients

In Cohort 2B, the binomial estimate (Evaluable Set) and KM estimate of PFS-4 rate were 32.1% and 37.8%, respectively, and were close to the prespecified PFS-4 rate (37%) at the end of the second stage of  Simon's  optimal  2-stage  design,  suggesting  a  signal  of  activity  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  in osteosarcoma. PFS-4 rate based on all 31 subjects in the FAS was 29% (95% CI: 14.2, 48.0). Median overall PFS was 3.0 months. Median TTP was 3.0 months. ORR was 6.7%, 2 subjects achieved a partial response; median duration of response was 4.6 months. Thirteen subjects (43.3%) with measurable disease attained a BOR of SD. Median OS was 10.0 months

Efficacy  results,  based  on  PFS-4  rate,  supported  by  PFS,  BOR  and  ORR,  suggest  that  single-agent lenvatinib may have antitumor activity in osteosarcoma. However, the null hypothesis cannot be ruled out because the study did not meet the prespecified boundary, possibly because of sampling variability and the small number of subjects.

The ultimate goal of treatment in osteosarcoma is surgical resection; overall, 5 subjects in Cohort 2B had pre-existent metastatic pulmonary lesion(s) and 4 of these subjects achieved complete surgical resection following study treatment.

## Cohort 3A and 3B- combination of lenvatinib with chemotherapy is osteosarcoma patients

Cohort 3A was the dose-finding phase for combination therapy. This study met its primary endpoints for dose-finding  in  Cohort  3A  and  assessment  of  activity  in  Cohort  3B.  After  determination  of  the recommended dose in Cohort 3A, an expansion phase was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  osteosarcoma (Cohort 3B).

In Cohort 3, results for study treatment in subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma are also based on PFS-4 rate, a benchmark for efficacy in clinical trials in this disease.

In this heavily pretreated population, the PFS-4 rate (binomial estimate) based on all subjects (n=20) in Cohort 3B was 50% (95% CI: 27.2, 72.8). The binomial estimate of the PFS-4 rate based on the Evaluable  Set  (n=15)  was  66.7%.  These  estimates  were  statistically  significant  (P=0.0139  and P=0.0008, respectively) compared with the prespecified PFS-4 rate of 25% for the null hypothesis. The KM estimate for PFS-4 was 77.4% (all subjects). In addition, the PFS-4 rate (binomial estimate) was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

66.7% (95% CI: 60.5, 90.5) for the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level groups in Cohorts 3A and 3B (evaluable subjects n=27; P&lt;0.0001).

Median PFS across all time points was 12.0 months in Cohort 3A and 6.9 months in Cohort 3B. Median PFS for the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level groups for Cohorts 3A and 3B combined was 8.7 months (95% CI: 4.5,12.0). PFS further supports as a key secondary endpoint assessed by investigators using RECIST 1.1 supports findings for the PFS-4.

Two subjects in Cohort 3A had an objective response (both confirmed PRs). In Cohort 3B, 3 subjects had a confirmed PR (ORR = 16.7%) based on investigator assessments using RECIST 1.1.

The ORR for the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose levels was 9.4% (95% CI: 2.0, 25.0).

Clinical benefit rate was 40.9% (95% CI: 20.7, 63.6) in Cohort 3A: 57.1% (95% CI: 18.4, 90.1) and 33.3% (95% CI: 11.8, 61.6) for the 11 and 14 mg/m2 dose level groups, respectively.

In Cohort 3B, CBR was 40.0% (95% CI: 19.1, 63.9). Median OS was 16.3 months in Cohort 3A and not estimable in Cohort 3B (95% CI: 7.3, NE).

Median OS for the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose levels for Cohorts 3A and 3B combined was 16.3 months (95% CI: 12.6, NE).

In Cohorts 3A and 3B, 13 subjects overall underwent tumor resection, 10 of whom achieved complete resection. In Cohort 3A, 10 subjects (55%) had resection of lung lesions (n=9) and/or bone (n=2) during study  treatment  or  within  30  days  posttreatment.  All  10  subjects  had  a  complete  resection.  One additional  subject  had  a  partial  resection  of  a  lung  lesion  122  days  posttreatment.  In  Cohort  3B,  2 subjects (10%) had tumour resections during treatment or within 30 days posttreatment. Both were partial resections of a lung lesion.

Although the pattern of relapse (lung only, bone only, lung and bone) was similar across the 2 cohorts, a higher proportion of subjects in Cohort 3B had received 3 or more prior anticancer medications (40% vs 14%) and had PD as best response to their last chemotherapy regimen (55% vs 27%) compared with subjects in Cohort 3A.

Overall, these data suggest that lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide has activity in relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma.

## Safety in monotherapy

Lenvatinib appears to have, based on limited data, an acceptable safety profile in cancer patients aged 2 to 25 years when treatment is initiated at 14 mg/m2 QD (based on BSA; maximum dose of 24 mg QD) and adjusted by a dose-titration algorithm to manage toxicity.

The adverse events reported in this study were manageable and, overall, are consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent lenvatinib in adult cancer populations.

However the incidence of pneumothorax of 11% (6/54) was higher than that observed previously with single-agent lenvatinib in adults (DTC lenvatinib monotherapy, 1.1%; non-DTC lenvatinib monotherapy, 0.5%).

Five of the 6 subjects with pneumothorax, all in Cohort 2B, had lung masses at Baseline, and 4 of the 5 subjects had radiotherapy prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. None of the 6 subjects who experienced pneumothorax had undergone resection of a lung lesion prior to study entry; however, 1 subject had lung resection during study treatment and had a subsequent event of pneumothorax. The incidence of pneumothorax observed in Study 207 is most likely associated with the subjects' underlying osteosarcoma and presence of lung metastases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pneumothorax is recognized as a complication in osteosarcoma (Grosu, et al., 2019; Tariq, et al., 2018; Gan, et al., 2015; Fayda, et al., 2012). It is more common in patients with pulmonary metastasis from sarcomas than those with primary pulmonary neoplasms; the incidence is also increased after prior chemotherapy (Fiorelli, et al., 2011). Pneumothorax has been reported as an adverse event in other clinical trials of TKIs, with rates of Grade 3/ 4 events ranging from 3% to 16% in adult and pediatric patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma or osteosarcoma (Fayda, et al., 2012; Grignani, et al., 2012; Italiano,  et  al.,  2018;  Verschoor  and  Gelderblom,  2014;  Xie,  et  al.,  2019).  In  a  Phase  1  trial  of bevacizumab plus sorafenib combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide in 44 patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors, the incidence of pneumothorax was 25%; all 11 subjects had pulmonary lesions at study entry (Interiano, et al., 2015). Therefore, the incidence of pneumothorax in this study is similar to  that  for  other  TKIs  and  is  consistent  with  the  incidence  in  patients  with  relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma.

Overall, 14 and 21 subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2B, respectively, had a treatment-emergent SAE, including fatal and nonfatal events. For 6 subjects in Cohort 1 and 9 subjects in Cohort 2B, the SAE was considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  treatment-related.  Serious  AEs  appeared  to  be  mainly  due  to comorbidities or the subjects' underlying cancer. The most frequently reported nonfatal SAEs were cancer pain (13.0%) in Cohort 1 and (approximately 10% or more of subjects, in descending frequency) back pain, pneumothorax, dyspnea, and tumor pain in Cohort 2B.

As required per protocol, the management of lenvatinib toxicities (Grade 3 or 4 and intolerable Grade 2) required an interruption until resolution of event, followed by restarting treatment at a lower dose of lenvatinib (dose reduction) once the toxicity returned to baseline level or improved to Grade 0 or 1. For 9 subjects each in Cohort 1 (39.1%) and Cohort 2B (29.0%), a TEAE led to lenvatinib dose reduction.

Discontinuations of treatment for a TEAE were reported in 17.4% of subjects in Cohort 1 and 16.1% of patients in Cohort 2B. No TEAE led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject each.

Clinically significant events occurred frequently (95.7% of subjects in Cohort 1 and 93.5% of subjects in Cohort 2B); however, few led to treatment discontinuation.

At the time of data cutoff, deaths had been reported for 65.2% of subjects in Cohort 1 and 64.5% of subjects in Cohort 2B. Five deaths in Cohort 1 and 3 deaths in Cohort 2B were attributed primarily to a TEAE, most frequently cardiac arrest or cardiorespiratory arrest. All of these deaths due to AEs were determined by the investigator to be associated with PD and to be unrelated to lenvatinib.

## Safety in combination

The  RD  for  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in  this  paediatric  cancer  population  was determined to be 14 mg/m2 once daily in combination with ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 administered IV on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle.

Overall, the safety profile of lenvatinib plus chemotherapy in this study is consistent with the known toxicity profiles of the individual agents in adults. The AE profile for lenvatinib was as expected for this class of compound and consistent with the lenvatinib label and the clinical program as a whole. Similarly, the AE profiles of ifosfamide and etoposide were consistent with their known safety profile.

Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in all 22 subjects (100%) in Cohort 3A; the nature of these TEAEs was similar across the 2 dose levels. The most frequently reported TEAEs in Cohort 3A overall, occurring in 50% or more of subjects (in descending order of frequency), were vomiting, anemia, nausea, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, abdominal pain, arthralgia, epistaxis, neutropenia, constipation, headache, and pain in extremity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Anemia,  neutropenia,  and/or  thrombocytopenia  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  overall  for lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy (&gt;50% of subjects in Cohort 3A, and &gt;75% of subjects in Cohort 3B). Other common AEs ( ≥ 50% of subjects in either Cohort 3A or Cohort 3B) with the combination included  gastrointestinal  AEs  (abdominal  pain,  constipation,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting),  arthralgia, epistaxis, headache, hypothyroidism, and pain in extremity. These events were consistent with the safety profile of the chemotherapy agents and lenvatinib as a single agent.

Treatment-emergent nonfatal SAEs occurred in 72.7% and 75.0% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  nonfatal  SAEs  (&gt;20%  of  subjects)  with  combination therapy  in  either  Cohort  3A  or  Cohort  3B  were  hematologic  in  nature  (ie,  neutrophil  count decreased/neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, platelet count decreased/ thrombocytopenia, WBC count decreased).

Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred in 95.5% and 100% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively The most frequently reported Grade 3/4 TEAEs (occurring in&gt;75% of subjects overall in Cohort 3A or Cohort 3B)  were  hematologic  in  nature,  based  on  grouped  terms  (ie,  anemia/decreased  hemoglobin, neutropenia/decreased neutrophil count, and/or thrombocytopenia/decreased platelet count); however, no hematologic AEs were Grade 5 or led to treatment discontinuation.

Clinically significant events (CSEs) occurred in 95.5% and 95.0% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively; these were Grade ≥ 3 in 45.5% and 15.0% of subjects, respectively. The most frequently reported  CSEs  (&gt;40%  of  subjects,  in  descending  frequency)  were  hemorrhage,  hypothyroidism, proteinuria, and weight loss. The majority of these frequently occurring CSEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 and seldom led to treatment discontinuation.

A total of 7 (16.7%) of the 42 subjects in Cohort 3A (n=6) and Cohort 3B (n=1) developed pneumothorax during  treatment.  Five  subjects  had  relevant  medical  history  for  developing  pneumothorax  (surgical resection of pulmonary lesions (n=3), thoracotomy (n=1), or thoracic radiotherapy (but not resection; n=1)  prior  to  study  entry).  Six  of  the  7  subjects  had  preexisting  lung  metastases  at  Baseline. Pneumothorax was reported as serious Grade 2 or Grade 3 events in 5 of the 7 subjects, which resulted in  dose  modification  (n=4) or treatment discontinuation (n=1). Three of these subjects experienced pneumothorax during study treatment. The incidence of pneumothorax observed in Study 207 is most likely associated with the subjects' underlying osteosarcoma and presence of lung metastases.

Clinical laboratory data, vital sign and ECG data, physical examination findings, and other observations related  to  safety  did  not  reveal  any  new  safety  signals.  One  subject,  in  Cohort  3A,  had  Grade  3 hypertension. Hypertension was not reported as an SAE in any subject.

Myelosuppressive  TEAEs  occurred  frequently  with  combination  treatment  than  with  single-agent lenvatinib.  Anaemia,  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  and/or  thrombocytopenia  were  reported  in  95.5% (n=21/22) of subjects in Cohort 3A and 95% (n=19/20) of subjects in Cohort 3B. This is in contrast to 39.1% (9/23) of subjects in Cohort 1 and 58.1% (18/31) of subjects in Cohort 2B, who received singleagent  lenvatinib.  Moreover  in  Cohorts  1  and  2B,  only  2  subjects  (8.7%)  and  7  subjects  (22.6%), respectively, were considered by the investigator to have a treatment-related hematologic TEAE.

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia are well-known effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, including ifosfamide and etoposide (see ifosfamide and etoposide package inserts). Eighteen subjects (81.8%) in Cohort 3A and 16 subjects (80.0%) in Cohort 3B received immunostimulants for neutropenia, including filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, and G-CSF, among others. Four subjects in Cohort 3A had a dose modification of both ifosfamide and etoposide for febrile neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. In Cohort 3B, 1 subject each had dose reductions of ifosfamide and etoposide for thrombocytopenia and WBC count decreased. Furthermore, no subject discontinued any of the 3 study drugs because of myelosuppressive effects. Thus, these AEs were well managed during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These results are consistent with results observed with single-agent lenvatinib in Cohorts 1 and 2B, in which 6 (11.1%) of the 54 subjects developed pneumothorax during treatment.

## Dose adjustments

Adverse events led to dose reduction of lenvatinib in 72.7% and 55.0% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively. Events that most frequently (total n=5 or 6 subjects in Cohorts 3A and 3B combined)  led  to  lenvatinib  dose  modification  (reduction/interruption)  overall  were  abdominal  pain, diarrhea,  febrile  neutropenia,  nausea,  platelet  count  decreased,  and  thrombocytopenia.  Most  of  the remaining TEAEs that led to dose reduction occurred in 3 or fewer subjects each.

Adverse events led to dose reduction of ifosfamide and/or etoposide in 18.2% and 25.0% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively. Events that each led to dose reduction of chemotherapy in 2 subjects overall were pyrexia and thrombocytopenia. The remaining AEs that led to dose reduction of one or both chemotherapy agents occurred in 1 subject each.

Based on the AE CRF, 27.3% and 5.0% of subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively, discontinued treatment for an AE. No individual TEAE led to discontinuation of any study drug in more than 1 subject each.

Treatment-emergent AEs led to dose reduction of lenvatinib in 11 subjects (55.0%). The TEAEs that led most frequently to dose reduction of lenvatinib (&gt;2 subjects in order of decreasing frequency) were platelet count decreased, diarrhea, and WBC count decreased. All other TEAEs leading to dose reduction of lenvatinib were each reported by 1 or 2 subjects.

As required per protocol, the management of lenvatinib toxicities (Grades 3 or 4 and intolerable Grade 2)  required  an  interruption  until  resolution  of  event,  followed  by  a  dose  reduction  once  the  toxicity returned to baseline level or improved to Grade 0 or 1. A TEAE led to lenvatinib dose modifications in 18 subjects (81.8%) in Cohort 3A and 14 subjects (70.0%) in Cohort 3B. Within the 2 cohorts, nearly all TEAEs that led to dose modification occurred in 3 or fewer subjects each. In Cohort 3B, however, platelet count decreased and diarrhea led to dose modification in 5 and 4 subjects, respectively.

Dose reductions of ifosfamide or etoposide each occurred in 22.7% of subjects in Cohort 3A and in 25% of subjects in Cohort 3B. The only TEAEs that led to dose modification of chemotherapy in more than 1 subject was pyrexia (n=2 in Cohort 3A) and thrombocytopenia (n=3, 2 in Cohort 3A, 1 in Cohort 3B). For 1 event of thrombocytopenia, only the dose of etoposide was reduced. For all other events leading to dose reduction, the investigator reduced the dose of both chemotherapy agents.

Discontinuation of at least 1 study drug was reported for 6 subjects (27.3%) in Cohort 3A and 1 subject (5.0%) in Cohort 3B. Based on disposition data, AEs were cited by the investigators as the primary reason for ending treatment in 2 subjects (9.1%) in Cohort 3A and no subjects in Cohort 3B. In Cohort 3A, pleural effusion led to the discontinuation of all 3 study drugs in 1 subject and only lenvatinib in 1 subject.  All  other  TEAEs  led  to  discontinuation  in  1  subject  each.  In  Cohort  3B,  1  subject  (5.0%) discontinued both ifosfamide and etoposide for Grade 3 veno-occlusive disease. This event resulted in a dose reduction of lenvatinib.

## Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Significant Adverse Events

Overall in Cohort 3A, all 22 subjects (100%) had TEAEs reported by the investigator to be treatmentrelated. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs, occurring in 40% or more of subjects (in  decreasing  frequency)  were:  anemia,  nausea,  neutropenia,  abdominal  pain,  hypothyroidism, vomiting, diarrhea, epistaxis, and thrombocytopenia. The majority of remaining treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 1 or 2 subjects each.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nineteen subjects (86.4%) had a treatment-related TEAE that was Grade 3 or higher. However, no treatment-related Grade 5 TEAEs were reported. The most frequently reported treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs, occurring in 30% or more of subjects (in descending frequency) were anemia, neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  and  WBC  count  decreased.  The  majority  of remaining treatment-related Grade 3 and 4 TEAEs occurred in 1 or 2 subjects each.

Overall in Cohort 3B, 19 subjects (75.0%) had TEAEs reported by the investigator to be treatmentrelated. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs, occurring in 40% or more of subjects (in decreasing frequency) were: anaemia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, WBC count decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, and proteinuria. The majority of remaining treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 1 or 2 subjects each. See Section 12.4.1.3 for further details about CSEs.

Nineteen subjects (75.0%) had a severe (Grade ≥ 3) treatment-related TEAE. However, no treatmentrelated Grade 5 TEAEs were reported. The most frequently reported treatment-related Grade 3/4 TEAEs, occurring in ≥ 25% of subjects (in descending order of frequency), were anemia, WBC count decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The majority of remaining treatment-related Grade 3/4 TEAEs occurred in 1 or 2 subjects each. Of note, most of the haematological TEAEs reported were reported by the investigator to be both treatment-related and Grade 3/4.

Overall, the AE profile of study treatment in this pediatric study is consistent with the known profiles of the individual agents in adults. The nature of the fatal and nonfatal SAEs and TEAEs leading to dose modification or discontinuation of study drug in this study are not unexpected for a population with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma and the known toxicity profiles of the individual agents. The AEs were expected, well tolerated, and manageable. Overall, more than 90% of subjects in Cohort 3A (n=20/22) and Cohort 3B (n=18/20) had 1 or more hematologic TEAEs (eg, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia. A total of 16 subjects (5 in Cohort 3A and 11 in Cohort 3B) had a dose modification of lenvatinib (interruption and/or reduction), but none discontinued treatment for or died of a hematologic event. In Cohort 3A, 3 subjects also had a dose reduction of ifosfamide and/or etoposide for febrile neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

In Cohort 3A, subjects who received 11 mg/m2 had a longer median duration of treatment than those in  the  14  mg/m2 dose level group: 54.0 and 20.0 weeks, respectively. Median number of cycles of treatment received was 17 and 6 for the 11 and 14 mg/m2 dose levels, respectively. However, the rate of TEAEs (including Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs and SAEs) was similar across the 2 dose levels. All results must be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of subjects within each dose level (n=11 subjects each) in Cohort 3A, as well as the nonrandomized study design.

At the time of data cutoff, 15 subjects (12 in Cohort 3A and 3 in Cohort 3B) had died. Four of the deaths (2 in Cohort 3A and 2 in Cohort 3B) occurred during the treatment period. These 4 deaths were each attributed to a TEAE associated with progressive disease; none were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment.

Overall, 16 (72.7%) and 15 (75.0%) subjects in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, respectively, had a treatmentemergent SAE, including fatal and nonfatal events. In Cohort 3A, the most frequently occurring SAEs were febrile neutropenia (n=8) and pneumothorax (n=4). In Cohort 3B, the most frequently reported SAEs were all hematologic in nature (ie, decreases in neutrophil count, platelet count, red blood cell count). For 12 subjects each in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B, the SAE was considered by the investigator to be treatment-related. Overall, the predominant SAEs appeared to be mainly due to the known toxicities of the chemotherapeutic agents, followed by comorbidities or complications of the subjects' underlying cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinically significant events occurred frequently (95.5% of subjects in Cohort 3A and 95.0% of subjects in Cohort 3B); however, only 2 led to treatment discontinuation. One subject discontinued treatment for hypothyroidism, and 1 subject discontinued treatment for pneumothorax. These results suggest that the dose modification algorithm was successful in allowing subjects to remain on treatment rather than discontinue treatment for toxicity.

Overall,  the  nature  of  the  fatal  and  nonfatal  SAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  modification  or discontinuation of study drug in this study are not unexpected for a population with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma and the toxicity profile of lenvatinib and the chemotherapy agents. The results indicate that  lenvatinib  plus  chemotherapy  was  tolerable  and  generally  safe  when  TEAEs  were  managed appropriately.

## Conclusions

Results for study treatment in subjects with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma are based on PFS-4 rate, a benchmark for efficacy in clinical trials in this disease. In Cohort 3B, the binomial estimates of 50% (n=10/20)  and  66.7%  (n=10/15)  for  the  FAS  and  Evaluable  Sets,  respectively,  were  statistically significant (P=0.0139 and P=0.0008, respectively) compared with the prespecified PFS-4 rate of 25% in the null hypothesis, indicating activity of the triple combination in osteosarcoma. Median PFS was 6.9 months, which further supports this finding, also supported by other secondary endpoints.

Overall, 13 subjects (31.0%) in Cohorts 3A and 3B underwent surgical resection of pre-existing tumor lesion(s) and 10 subjects achieved complete resection, an goal in osteosarcoma treatment.

Lenvatinib appears to have an acceptable safety profile at 14 mg/m2 QD (based on BSA; maximum dose of 24 mg QD) in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide. When adjusted by a dose-titration algorithm to manage toxicity, the rate of dose modifications is relatively high (dose reduction of lenvatinib occurred in 72.7% and 55.0% of patients in Cohort 3A and Cohort 3B). The adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent lenvatinib in adult cancer populations as well as the known AEs for ifosfamide and etoposide, such as myelosuppression.

Overall, further development of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients is  supported by currently available data and the ongoing Study 8 will provide further results in this indication. Pneumothorax is noticeable as AE and has been reported for other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and in patients receiving chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, and appears to be mainly associated with pulmonary metastases and underlying osteosarcoma.

Other concerns to be addressed by the MAH:

Exploratory pooled analyses were performed for the 14 mg/m2 dose level group across both cohorts combined (the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level) for PFS-4 rate, PFS, ORR, and OS. Analysis for ProgressionFree Survival Rate at 4 Months (binomial estimate) based on data in 35 patients (according to the ITT principle) should be provided. Integrated summary of safety with the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level of lenvatinib in monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients (including by age groups, e.g. adolescents vs younger paediatric patients) should be provided, as well as discussion on tolerability (e.g. dose reductions, interruptions, discontinuation due to AE, in comparison with data in adult patients). (OC)

Palatability  and  acceptability  of  the  suspension  formulation  of  lenvatinib  is  one  of  the  secondary endpoints of the Study 207. The aggregated results from different cohorts and their applicability should be discussed. (OC)

The MAH did not suggest an extension of indication to paediatric patients with DTC and/or any changes to  the  SmPC.  The  MAH  should  discuss  the  current  claim  and  a  text  proposal  to  include  relevant

information obtained from Study 207 in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, and PK data in section 5.2 should be submitted. (OC)

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Fulfilled:

## Not fulfilled:

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional analyses of data as part of this procedure. (see section 'Request for supplementary information')

## 4. Request for supplementary information

## Other concerns

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions (other concerns) as part of this procedure:

- 1) For DTC indication in paediatric patients the MAH should discuss the initial extrapolation strategy, based on PK matching, taking into account that PK data are available only in one paediatric patient with DTC. The objectives of the POPPK analyses do not clearly refer to the agreed objective for the PIP Study 7 to support the extrapolation of lenvatinib efficacy from adult to paediatric patients with DTC. The objectives specified in PIP Study 207 should be considered for the POPPK and PK/PD analyses. discussion on the representativity of the data in paediatric and adult patients used for the POPPK model for the intended target population in DTC as per PIP Study 7.
- 2) The MAH should discuss more in detail the rationale and the choice of the dataset for the adult POPPK model (DTC, monotherapy) and whether indication effects on PK are expected or known. The covariates chosen for the POPPK model are the same as for the model developed for adult patients, therefore assuming that that same covariate effect would be expected in the paediatric population with DTC as in adult population in DTC or in other indications. The choice of covariates should be justified specifically for paediatric patients with DTC. The choice of individual AEs for PK/PD analyses of exposure-safety in paediatric vs adult patients should be discussed based on the observed safety profiles.
- 3) Exploratory pooled analyses were performed for the 14 mg/m2 dose level group across both cohorts combined (the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level) for PFS-4 rate, PFS, ORR, and OS. Analysis for Progression-Free Survival Rate at 4 Months (binomial estimate) based on data in 35 patients (according to the ITT principle) should be provided. Integrated summary of safety with the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level of lenvatinib in monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients (including by age groups, e.g. adolescents vs younger paediatric patients) should be provided, as well as discussion on tolerability (e.g. dose reductions, interruptions, discontinuation due to AE, in comparison with data in adult patients).
- 4) Palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib is one of the secondary endpoint of the Study 207. The aggregated results from different cohorts and their applicability should be discussed.

## 5. Responses to the request for supplementary information

## Question 1

For DTC indication in paediatric patients the MAH should discuss the initial extrapolation strategy, based on PK matching, taking into account that PK data are available only in one paediatric patient with DTC. The objectives of the POPPK analyses do not clearly refer to the agreed objective for the PIP Study 7 to support the extrapolation of lenvatinib efficacy from adult to paediatric patients with DTC. The objectives specified in PIP Study 207 should be considered for the POPPK and PK/PD analyses. discussion on the representativity of the data in paediatric and adult patients used for the POPPK model for the intended target population in DTC as per PIP Study 7.

## Summary of the MAH's response

Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) would like to clarify that there is no plan to seek a paediatric indication for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or any other type of cancer, based on the results of Study E7080-G000-207 (hereafter, Study 207) or Study E7080-G000-230 (hereafter Study 230), which is the other paediatric clinical study in the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMEA-001119PIP02-12-M08), and as such there is no further need to perform any extrapolation of adult data to the paediatric population. Therefore, based on this strategy the MAH believes that the Agency's question is no longer applicable.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

There is no plan to submit a paediatric indication for DTC or any other type of cancer by the MAH, and thus extrapolation of adult data to the paediatric population is not proposed.

## Conclusion

## Issue not pursued.

## Question 2

The MAH should discuss more in detail the rationale and the choice of the dataset for the adult POPPK model (DTC, monotherapy) and whether indication effects on PK are expected or known. The covariates chosen for the POPPK model are the same as for the model developed for adult patients, therefore assuming that that same covariate effect would be expected in the paediatric population with DTC as in adult population in DTC or in other indications. The choice of covariates should be justified specifically for paediatric patients with DTC. The choice of individual AEs for PK/PD analyses of exposure-safety in paediatric vs adult patients should be discussed based on the observed safety profiles.

## Summary of the MAH's response

During the clinical development of lenvatinib for use in adults, the MAH has performed several population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) analyses on pooled data to support the currently approved indications and all relevant PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) reports have been submitted to the Agency. In the most recent report submitted in support of the advanced endometrial carcinoma indication (CPMSE7080-015R-v1 submitted under Lenvima electronic Common Technical Document seq. no. 0112) the effect of indication (ie, tumor type) on PK was assessed and was shown to be minimal and of no clinical relevance, as agreed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The effect of other covariates was consistent in all POPPK analysis, regardless of indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regards to adverse events (AEs), based on several exposure-response analyses for most frequent treatment-emergent AEs, including hypothyroidism, hypertension, weight decrease, vomiting, and proteinuria, data has shown that the observed safety profile of lenvatinib is similar across studies with different indications, regardless of body weight or age. Again this data has previously been submitted in support of the approved indications (DTC, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], renal cell carcinoma [RCC], and advanced endometrial cancer).

As mentioned above, the MAH does not plan to seek a paediatric indication for DTC or any other type of cancer, based on the results of Study 207 or Study 230, and as such, there is no further need to perform any additional exposure-response analysis for most frequent AEs. In both paediatric studies, the safety profile in paediatric patients is consistent with the known safety profile of lenvatinib in adults.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH considered that the currently available PK-PD data and results from POPPK analyses can be applicable regardless of age and indication. No further exposure-response analyses on safety in the paediatric patients are proposed.

## Conclusion

## Issue not pursued.

## Question 3

Exploratory pooled analyses were performed for the 14 mg/m2 dose level group across both cohorts combined (the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level) for PFS-4 rate, PFS, ORR, and OS. Analysis for Progression-Free Survival Rate at 4 Months (binomial estimate) based on data in 35 patients (according to the ITT principle) should be provided. Integrated summary of safety with the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level of lenvatinib in monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients (including by age groups, e.g. adolescents vs younger paediatric patients) should be provided, as well as discussion on tolerability (e.g. dose reductions, interruptions, discontinuation due to AE, in comparison with data in adult patients).

## Summary of the MAH's response

Analysis for progression-free survival rate at 4 months (binomial estimate) based on data in 35 patients (according to the intention to treat [ITT] principle) has been presented in the published article, \"Lenvatinib with etoposide plus ifosfamide in patients with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma (ITCC-050): A multicentre, open-label, multicohort, phase 1/2 study\", Gaspar, et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00387-9). The source table is Supplemental Table 3 on page 6 of the supplement to the published article. The published article and its supplement are enclosed in the Appendix of this response document.

The MAH does not plan to seek a paediatric indication based on Study 207 as such, the MAH believes that neither an integrated summary of safety with the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level of lenvatinib in monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients, nor an additional discussion on tolerability from this study are warranted

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant submitted the published article to present the efficacy analysis (including progressionfree survival rate) at 4 months (binomial estimate) based on data in 35 patients across both cohorts combined (the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neither further integrated summary of safety with the pooled 14 mg/m2 dose level of lenvatinib in monotherapy and combination with chemotherapy, nor an additional discussion on tolerability from this study are submitted.

## Conclusion

## Issue not pursued.

## Question 4

Palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib is one of the secondary endpoint of the Study 207. The aggregated results from different cohorts and their applicability should be discussed.

## Summary of the MAH's response

As highlighted by the agency, a secondary endpoint of Study 207 was to assess the palatability and acceptability of the oral suspension formulation of lenvatinib using the Palatability Questionnaire. All subjects who received the suspension formulation and completed at least 1 question on the Palatability Questionnaire were included in the Palatability Analysis Set. Three subjects in Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 2B received the suspension. Ratings for overall acceptability were really bad, super bad, and good for the 3 subjects in Cohort 1, respectively. The subject in Cohort 2B rated the overall acceptability of the suspension as good. Two subjects in Cohort 3A and 5 subjects in Cohort 3B took lenvatinib as an oral suspension. Five subjects (1 in Cohort 3A, 4 in Cohort 3B) completed the palatability questionnaire. Overall acceptability of the lenvatinib suspension was rated as good by the subject in Cohort 3A, and good, may be good or may be bad; bad and really bad (n=1 subject for each rating) for the subjects in Cohort 3B.

The MAH does not plan to seek a paediatric indication, based on Study 207 or Study 230, for either DTC or any other type of cancer; therefore, the MAH believes further discussion regarding the palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib is not warranted.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The applicant provided the results on palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib in the Study 207 as per request.

No further discussion regarding the palatability and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib is considered warranted by the MAH.

## Conclusion

## Issue not pursued.

## Question 5

The MAH did not suggest an extension of indication to paediatric patients with DTC and/or any changes to the SmPC. The MAH should discuss the current claim and a text proposal to include relevant information obtained from Study 207 in sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, and PK data in section 5.2 should be submitted.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The MAH does not plan to seek a paediatric indication based on Studies 207 or 230 from the PIP.

A Type 2 variation to update the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) with the outcome of both of these studies is planned in 2023, and upon completion of the ongoing Full Compliance Check.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Updates to SmPC sections: 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 will be proposed. As the proposed text will be based on both studies, the MAH plans to provide the text at the time of the variation submission.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

No SmPC changes are proposed in this variation. The update of SmPC (sections: 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2) with the complete outcome of two studies will be submitted as a Type 2 variation in 2023.

## Conclusion

## Issue resolved with recommendation.

The MAH is recommended to submit as committed the update of the relevant SmPC sections to propose inclusion additional information in paediatric patients.

## 6. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH is recommended to submit as committed the update of the relevant SmPC sections to propose inclusion additional information in paediatric patients.
