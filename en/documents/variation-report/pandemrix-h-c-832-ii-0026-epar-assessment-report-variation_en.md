## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisation in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  phase  6  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update section 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix  H1N1  to  reflect  newly  available  results  from  post  authorisation  spontaneous  reporting following  initiation  of  the  vaccination  campaigns  in  Sweden  and  the  UK  in  view  of  allergic  and anaphylactic reactions. 1.2 Clinical aspects At the time of submission, the only information available other than adverse event data submitted in the UK is a summary of the safety experience produced by Sweden. This was posted on the Swedish MPA website on 29 October. Given  that  the  current  product  information  for  Pandemrix  reflects  only  the  safety  experience  from H5N1 or H1N1 clinical trials, as well as post-marketing experience with seasonal influenza vaccines, this assessment report considers an amendment to the product information to include Swedish and UK data on suspected ADRs. Data from Sweden The  latest  information  available  from  Sweden  indicates  that  up  to  2  million  doses  have  now  been administered. This includes use in pregnant women and children. In  total,  about  600  ADR  reports  have  been  received  by  the  Swedish  MPA  from  Health  Care Professionals  and  almost  900  reports  from  consumers.  The  general  safety  experience  in  Sweden broadly reflects the known ADRs identified in the clinical trials, however, serious allergic reactions have also now been reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised

According  to  MPA,  the  majority  of  the  adverse  events  are  expected  and  known  reactions  such  as soreness, redness and pain at the injection site and in the arm, and flu-like symptoms such as fever, shivering, fatigue, moderate/severe headaches, body aches and malaise. Such events are established adverse effects of the mock-up vaccines (and many vaccines) and as there is presently no suggestion of a change in frequency or severity of such events. As these are already listed in the Pandemrix SPC, the cases reported so far do not warrant any regulatory action.

Eight events with a fatal outcome have so far been reported in Sweden. These patients had previously known  chronic  diseases  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes,  renal  failure,  dystrophic  muscle disease  and  senile  dementia.  All  patients  were  on  chronic  medical  treatment.  At  least  three  of  the patients were aged &gt;74 years. A Post mortem report is available for four of the cases and in all these cases a relation between the vaccination and the death is considered unlikely. For the other cases there

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is insufficient information and autopsy protocols are lacking which limits the assessment.  According to the MPA, there is currently no basis to support a causal association between vaccination and the deaths.

The MPA has also received almost 900 consumer reports. About 90% of reports describe non-severe, expected and known reactions. Despite the fact that many of these adverse effects are known and listed, some patients have apparently reported that the reactions to Pandemrix vaccine differ from their experience with previous seasonal flu vaccinations, such as more pronounced pain in the injection arm and stronger flu-like symptoms. At present, this information does not warrant any regulatory action.

The key issue emerging from the Swedish data so far is the nature of reported allergic reactions. The following table summarises the cases reported:

Table 1: Allergic reactions Reaction Known allergy (no of patients) Allergic reaction 12 Anaphylactic reaction 6 Anaphylactic shock 2 Angioedema 1 Oedema in mouth and throat 1 Urticaria 1 Exanthema Flush 2 Itching 4 Asthma worsened 1 Dyspnoea 2 Total 32 According  to  the  MPA,  several  of  the  patients  with  a  severe  hypersensitivity  reaction  had  known allergies to pollen, grass, medicines, certain foods such as eggs, nuts, fruit, peanuts, fish, etc. In most of  the  cases  deemed  serious,  the  patients  needed  treatment  with  antihistamines,  adrenaline  and cortisone and supervision in hospital. In all cases, the hypersensitivity reactions have resolved rapidly and completely. Two cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. In one case the patient had a known egg allergy; the other patient was allergic to several foods, including nuts, but not to eggs. The reports on allergic reactions shows that not only allergy to substances in the vaccine such as egg gives rise to reactions, but also other forms of allergic tendency seems to be able to contribute to an allergic reaction. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Assessment  of  the  individual  case  narratives  suggests  that  whilst  some  of  the  cases  of  reported anaphylaxis  may  include  the  symptoms  suggestive  of  a  serious  anaphylactic-type  reaction  (i.e.  in accordance with the Brighton Collaboration definition), at least half of these cases could also be either a mild allergic reaction or possible a psychogenic reaction. However, it is known that any vaccine can cause anaphylaxis and, despite no cases being observed in the Pandemrix clinical trials, it is entirely plausible that Pandemrix may rarely cause anaphylaxis and angioedema. In the absence of any other obvious trigger, such events occurring in very close temporal association with vaccination are most likely to be causally associated with vaccination. Indeed, only a single reported case with reasonable diagnostic certainty and possible causality would warrant inclusion in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fourteen possible case reports of anaphylaxis in the context of around 2 million doses administered would be in line with the broadly accepted frequency estimates of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis (i.e. between 1 and 10 cases per million individuals immunised), albeit at the upper end of this estimated range Although this is only an estimated reporting rate, and not a robust incidence rate, there is still no apparent excess risk of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions at present, particularly as some of the reported cases may actually be only mild allergic reactions or possible psychogenic reactions. Given the high profile  nature  of  swine  flu  immunisation  campaigns  at  present,  under-reporting  of  suspected  ADRs may well be less at present than with most well-established vaccine programmes. However, it must still be acknowledged that under-reporting is a factor and therefore reporting rates must be considered with this in mind. Reporting rates of allergic reactions must be kept under close review as exposure data become available in other countries.

Anaphylaxis is the medical term reported in these case reports and, although such cases could possibly be anaphylactoid and not truly allergic in nature, there is insufficient laboratory or clinical details to distinguish  anaphylaxis  from  an  anaphylactoid  reaction.  The  SPC  term  'Anaphylaxis'  adequately covers the clinical manifestation of such reactions. Although the Swedish report also states that some of the patients who experienced anaphylaxis had had  a  known  allergy  to  certain  foods  or  medicines,  there  is  no  further  information  to  assess  any specific sensitizing risk factor. Section 4.3 of the SPC currently lists as contraindications 'History of an  anaphylactic  (i.e.  life-threatening)  reaction  to  any  of  the  constituents  or  trace  residues  (egg  and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate)'. Section 4.4  also  states  that  'Caution  is  needed  when  administering  this  vaccine  to  persons  with  a  known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate)' and 'As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision  should  always  be  readily  available  in  case  of  a  rare  anaphylactic  event  following  the administration  of  the  vaccine'.  There  is  currently  no  evidence  to  support  any  strengthening  or amendment to sections 4.3 and 4.4 in this respect. Data from UK At present the number of doses administered in the UK (as well as other EU Member States) is not available. In the UK, we have received 645 reports of suspected ADRs as of 16 November. The most frequently reported suspected adverse reactions have been injection site reactions (e.g. pain, swelling, redness, bruising) or general minor adverse effects already listed based on the experience in the clinical trials (mainly nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, fever, fatigue, headache, lymphadenopathy). Two cases of anaphylaxis have been reported, although the available clinical details do not suggest that these were truly anaphylaxis. Several case reports of generalised skin reactions have also been reported. The SPC currently states that 'generalised skin reactions' have been reported with seasonal flu vaccines. Other than moving 'generalised skin reactions' to the Pandemrix H1N1 section of the SPC, the UK ADR data, at present, do not warrant any other amendments to the SPC. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment Medicinal product no longer authorised

The post-marketing experience was considered to be in line with the known, and listed, adverse effects of the mock-up vaccines. However, the emerging data on serious allergic reactions in association with Pandemrix warranted amendments to the SPC and PIL. .As the PI has been updated the balance of risks and benefits is not affected by these data at present.

## 1.3 Changes to the Product Information

The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report. Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SPC section 4.8 - Undesirable effects

The first paragraph in the sub-section on Pandemrix H1N1v was updated to reflect that in addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials (both H5N1 and H1N1), the reactions in this section have been reported during post-marketing experience with Pandemrix H1N1v.

In addition the adverse events 'generalised skin reactions' and 'allergic reactions' have been moved to this section from the section on interpandemic trivalent vaccines, in line with the post-marketing experience data.
