## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem statement

## 2.1.1. Disease or condition

This  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  concerns  the  use  of  Masitinib  Mesilate  in  combination  with riluzole  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  probable  or  definitive  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis (ALS).

Amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS)  is  a  fatal  motor  neuron  disorder  that  is  characterized  by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons (LMNs) at the spinal or bulbar level [Rowland LP  and  Shneider  NA,  2001].  The  disease  belongs  to  a  group  of  disorders  known  as  motor  neuron diseases,  which  are  characterized  by  the  gradual  degeneration  and  death  of  motor  neurons.  Motor neurons are nerve cells located in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord that serve as controlling units and vital  communication links between the nervous system and the voluntary muscles of the body. Messages  from  motor  neurons  in  the  brain  (called  upper  motor  neurons)  are  transmitted  to  motor neurons in the spinal cord (called lower motor neurons) and from them to particular muscles. In ALS, both  the  upper  motor  neurons  and  the  lower  motor  neurons  degenerate  or  die,  and  stop  sending messages to muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, waste away (atrophy), and have very fine twitches (called fasciculations). Eventually, the ability of the brain to start and control voluntary movement is lost.

## 2.1.2. Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention

Population-based studies have established that the incidence of ALS in Europe is fairly uniform at 2·16 per 100 000 person-years. Although ALS affects people worldwide, an exact incidence of this disease is not yet known. Men have a higher incidence of disease (3·0 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 2·83·3) than do women (2·4 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI 2·2-2·6), although the incidence between men and women is about the same in familial disease. The overall population-based lifetime risk of ALS is 1:400 for women and 1:350 for men. Peak age at onset is 58-63 years for sporadic disease and 4752 years for familial disease. Incidence decreases rapidly after 80 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ALS is categorized in two forms: familial and sporadic, with the latter being the most common (9095%)  which  has  no  obvious  genetically  inherited  component.  In  general  about  5-10%  of  ALS  is familial,  with  a  Mendelian  dominant  inheritance  pattern,  although  regional  variations  have  been observed underscoring the complicated epidemiology of ALS. Numerous genes and loci of major effect have  been  identified.  The  remaining  90%  of  people  diagnosed  with  ALS  are  classified  as  having sporadic disease. For these patients, results from family aggregation studies have identified an overlap between  ALS  and  common  neurodegenerative  disorders,  suggesting  the  existence  of  susceptibility genes  that  might  increase  the  overall  risk  of  neurodegeneration  among  relatives.  Results  from candidate gene studies have identified several susceptibility genes, although the relative contribution of every identified 'at risk' gene rarely exceeds an odds ratio of 2.0, and the mechanism by which risk is conferred is not known

The first onset of symptoms is usually between the ages of 50 and 65. The most common symptoms that appear in both types of ALS are muscle weakness, twitching, and cramping, which eventually can lead to the impairment of muscles. In the most advanced stages, ALS patients will develop symptoms of dyspnea and dysphagia. When muscles in the diaphragm and chest wall fail, people lose the ability to breathe without ventilator support. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. However, about 10% of those with ALS survive for 10 or more years.

Although the disease usually does not impair a person's mind or intelligence, it has been suggested that  some  persons  with  ALS  may  have  depression  or  alterations  in  cognitive  functions  involving decision-making and memory [NINDS, 2013].

## 2.1.3. Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis

Motor neurons are nerve cells located in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord that serve as controlling units  and  vital  communication  links  between  the  nervous  system  and  the  voluntary  muscles  of  the body.  Messages  from  motor  neurons  in  the  brain  (called  upper  motor  neurons)  are  transmitted  to motor neurons in the spinal cord (called lower motor neurons) and from them to particular muscles. In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die, and stop sending messages to muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, waste away (atrophy), and have very fine twitches (called fasciculations). Eventually, the ability of the central nervous system to initiate and control voluntary movement is lost.

The exact molecular pathway causing motor neuron degeneration in ALS is unknown, but as with other neurodegenerative  diseases,  it  is  likely  to  involve  a  complex  interplay  between  multiple  pathogenic cellular  mechanisms  that  may  not  be  mutually  exclusive.  These  may  include:  genetic  factors, excitotoxicity,  oxidative  stress,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  impaired  axonal  transport,  neurofilament aggregation, protein aggregation, inflammatory dysfunction and contribution of non-neuronal cells.

The  scientific  rationale  for  the  use  of  masitinib  in  the  treatment  of  ALS  is  based  on  the  following features:

As a proposed primary mechanism of action, masitinib acts on neuroglia through the inhibition of a receptor found on glial cells called CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor). There exists robust evidence in the scientific literature to link neuronal damage in ALS with microgliosis, in particular the emergence of aberrant glial cells; a process regulated by the CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway. Through targeting this pathway, masitinib is able to inhibit glial cell proliferation, including aberrant microglial cells  that  are  strongly  associated  with  motor  neuron  degeneration,  and  also  retard  microglia  cell migration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a secondary mechanism of action downregulating deleterious inflammation in glial cells, masitinib appears  to  act  on  mast  cells  through  inhibition  of  the  c-Kit/SCF  and  LYN/FYN  signaling  pathways. Consequently, masitinib is capable of regulating mast cell activity including mast cell-microglia crosstalk, leading to a reduction in the release of inflammatory mediators. There is putative evidence in the literature  to  suggest  that  inhibition  of  mast  cell  activity,  and  thus  a  reduction  in  the  release  of proinflammatory and vasoactive mediators may contribute to masitinib's overall therapeutic effect in ALS  by  regulating  the  neuroinflammatory  network  and  modulating  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB)  and blood-spinal cord barrier permeability.

## 2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis

ALS causes weakness with a wide range of disabilities. Eventually, all muscles under voluntary control are affected, and individuals lose their strength and the ability to move their arms, legs, and body. When muscles in the diaphragm and chest wall fail, people lose the ability to breathe without ventilator support. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. However, about 10% of those with ALS survive for 10 or more years.

Although the disease usually does not impair a person's mind or intelligence, it has been suggested that  some  persons  with  ALS  may  have  depression  or  alterations  in  cognitive  functions  involving decision-making (frontal executive functions) and memory.

## ALS Symptoms

Many individuals first see the effects of the disease in a hand or arm as they experience difficulty with simple tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. In other  cases,  symptoms  initially  affect  one  of  the  legs,  and  people  experience  awkwardness  when walking  or  running  or  they  notice  that  they  are  tripping  or  stumbling  more  often.  When  symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as 'limb onset' ALS. Other individuals first notice speech problems, termed 'bulbar onset' ALS. Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disease, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals may  develop  problems  with  moving,  swallowing  (dysphagia),  and  speaking  or  forming  words (dysarthria).  Symptoms  of  upper  motor  neuron  involvement  include  spasticity  and  exaggerated reflexes  (hyperreflexia)  including  an  overactive  gag  reflex.  An  abnormal  reflex  commonly  called Babinski's sign (the large toe extends upward as the sole of the foot is stimulated in a certain way) also  indicates  upper  motor  neuron  damage.  Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fasciculations.

To  be  diagnosed  with  ALS,  people  must  have  signs  and  symptoms  of  both  upper  and  lower  motor neuron  damage  that  cannot  be  attributed  to  other  causes.  Although  the  sequence  of  emerging symptoms and the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. Difficulty swallowing and chewing impair the person's ability to eat normally and increase the risk of choking. Maintaining weight will then become a problem. Because cognitive abilities are relatively intact, some people are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and depressed. In later stages of the disease, individuals have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken.  They  eventually  lose  the  ability  to  breathe  on  their  own  and  must  depend  on  ventilator support for survival. Affected individuals also face an increased risk of pneumonia during later stages of ALS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.1.5. Management

No  cure  has  yet  been  found  for  ALS.  However,  the  first  drug  treatment  for  the  disease,  riluzole (Rilutek),  was  approved  in  1995.  Riluzole  is  believed  to  reduce  damage  to  motor  neurons  by decreasing  the  release  of  glutamate.  Clinical  trials  with  ALS  patients  showed  that  riluzole  modestly prolongs survival  and  also  extends  the  time  before  an  individual  needs  ventilation  support.  Riluzole does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons, and persons taking the drug must be monitored for liver damage and other possible side effects. However, this first disease-specific therapy offers hope that the progression of ALS may one day be slowed by new medications or combinations of drugs.

Other  treatments  for  ALS  are  designed  to  relieve  symptoms  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  for individuals with the disorder. This supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care  professionals  such  as  physicians;  pharmacists;  physical,  occupational,  and  speech  therapists; nutritionists;  and  social  workers  and  home  care  and  hospice  nurses.  Working  with  patients  and caregivers, these teams can design an individualized plan of medical and physical therapy and provide special equipment aimed at keeping patients as mobile and comfortable as possible. Physicians can prescribe  medications  to  help  reduce  fatigue,  ease  muscle  cramps,  control  spasticity,  and  reduce excess  saliva  and  phlegm.  Drugs  also  are  available  to  help  patients  with  pain,  depression,  sleep disturbances,  and  constipation.  Physical  therapy  and  special  equipment  can  enhance  an  individual's independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. People may begin using suction devices to remove  excess  fluids  or  saliva  and  prevent  choking.  When  individuals  can  no  longer  get  enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach.

When the muscles that assist in breathing weaken, use of nocturnal ventilatory assistance (intermittent positive pressure ventilation [IPPV] or bilevel positive airway pressure [BIPAP]) may be used to aid breathing during sleep. Individuals may  eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. To be effective, this may require a tube  that  passes  from  the  nose  or  mouth  to  the  windpipe  (trachea)  and  for  long-term  use,  an operation such as a tracheostomy, in which a plastic breathing tube is inserted directly in the patient's windpipe  through  an  opening  in  the  neck.  Although  ventilation  support  can  ease  problems  with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS.

The cause of death in ALS is normally of a respiratory nature. Approximately 60 % of patients have a predictable decline in function while the remainders die suddenly, sometimes from other causes.

The only registered treatment option is riluzole [Miller, 2012]. However, clinical improvement is very modest with deterioration slowed by approximately 2 months with respect to placebo.

According to the EMA website listing of European public assessment reports there are two medications specifically authorised in Europe for the treatment of ALS (see Table 1).

Many symptomatic treatments, which do not slow disease progression but affect quality of life, appear helpful to individuals in clinic (Table 2 lists the various symptomatic treatments commonly used for management of ALS [Jenkins 2014]). However, evidence of significant benefit is generally weak and further randomized clinical trials are required to provide a more robust evidence base. This opinion is reflected in a Cochrane systematic review of treatments for spasticity in ALS by Ashworth and colleagues (published in 2006 with update in 2011) [Ashworth 2006]. The authors identified only one randomized controlled trial in the scientific literature pertaining to interventions for treating spasticity in ALS that met their inclusion criteria. That trail was on the use of individualized moderate intensity endurance type exercise; no other medical or surgical alternative treatment had been evaluated in randomized trials. The authors concluded that this trial was too small to determine benefit and recommended that further research was needed to test whether anti-spasticity medication (for example baclofen or dantrolene) is beneficial or causes harm by worsening muscle weakness and function.

One exception to this lack of supporting evidence for symptomatic treatment in ALS is the use of noninvasive ventilation at the time of respiratory failure. A single randomized trial of non-invasive ventilation suggests that it significantly prolongs survival and improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS and without severe bulbar symptoms [Radunovic 2013]. The Sponsor notes however that since this is not a drug intervention then there is no reason why it should not be concomitantly administered. A patient would therefore be expected to still receive the benefits associated with noninvasive ventilation for the symptom of respiratory failure in addition to additional functional and survival benefits offered by masitinib.

Hence, ALS is a debilitating and life-threatening disease that leads to a progressive inability to move, respiratory function insufficiency, and poor prospects of long-term survival.

## 2.1.6. Pharmacologic properties

Masitinib  is  a  small  molecule  drug  that  selectively  inhibits  specific  tyrosine  kinases  such  as  colonystimulating  factor  1  receptor  (CSF1R),  c-Kit,  LYN,  FYN,  and  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor (PDGFR) α and β,  in  the  submicromolar  range  [Dubreuil,  2009;  Davis,  2011].  At  the  cellular  level, masitinib is a potent inhibitor of CSF1R-dependent cell proliferation (IC50 90 nM), of wild-type (WT) cKit-dependent cell proliferation (IC50  100-300 nM), of LYN- and FYN-dependent cell proliferation (IC50 225-240  nM),  and  of  PDGFR-dependent  cell  proliferation  (IC50  0.25-20  nM).  Two  large-scale independent studies have shown masitinib to have the highest selectivity from a wide range of protein kinase inhibitors, including all those approved or under clinical development at the time of publication [Anastassiadis, 2011; Davis, 2011]. In particular, it was shown that from a panel of 178 compounds, masitinib  was  the  most  selective  protein  kinase  inhibitor  tested  [Anastassiadis,  2011].  Selectivity generally  indicates  how  safe  a  given  targeted  treatment  will  be,  the  greater  the  number  of  kinases inhibited (i.e. lower selectivity) the greater the potential for off-target effects and toxicity.

## 2.1.7. Mode of action

The exact molecular pathway causing motor neuron degeneration in ALS is unknown, but as with other neurodegenerative  diseases,  it  is  likely  to  involve  a  complex  interplay  between  multiple  pathogenic cellular mechanisms that may not be mutually exclusive. These include: genetic factors, excitotoxicity, oxidative  stress,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  impaired  axonal  transport,  neurofilament  aggregation, protein  aggregation,  inflammatory  dysfunction  and  contribution  of  non-neuronal  cells.  The  scientific rationale for the use of masitinib in the treatment of ALS is based on the following features.

As a primary mechanism of action, masitinib is proposed to act on neuroglia through the inhibition of a receptor  found  on  glial  cells  called  CSF1R  (colony-stimulating  factor  1  receptor).  There  exists  some evidence in the scientific literature to link neuronal damage in ALS with microgliosis, in particular the emergence of aberrant glial cells; a process regulated by the CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway. Through targeting this pathway, masitinib is able to inhibit glial cell proliferation, including aberrant microglial cells  that  are  strongly  associated  with  motor  neuron  degeneration,  and  also  retard  microglia  cell migration. Most of the relevant evidence on the pathogenesis has been provided by the Applicant and has not been considered so far a major pathophysiology path to clinical ALS progression.

The applicant claimed as a secondary mechanism of action downregulating deleterious inflammation in glial cells, masitinib acts on mast cells through inhibition of the c-Kit/SCF and LYN/FYN signaling

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pathways. Consequently, masitinib is capable of regulating mast cell activity including mast cellmicroglia cross-talk, leading to a reduction in the release of inflammatory mediators. There is putative evidence in the literature to suggest that inhibition of mast cell activity, and thus a reduction in the release of proinflammatory and vasoactive mediators, is likely to contribute to masitinib's overall therapeutic effect in ALS by regulating the neuroinflammatory network and modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal cord barrier permeability.

The development of masitinib in ALS is therefore primarily based on its pharmacological action in microglia cells and mast cells, including a population of glial cells displaying aberrant phenotypes and increased proliferation. This dual therapeutic approach in potently targeting both microglia and mast cell activity, thereby modulating neuroinflammation and slowing microglial-related disease progression, provides a strong medical plausibility for the use of masitinib in ALS. It is through this multifaceted mechanism of action that masitinib appears capable of generating the beneficial treatment effects observed in relevant preclinical animal studies (SOD1G93A rats 7 days after paralysis onset, i.e. in the therapeutic setting) and in ALS clinical trials (as evidenced from interim analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study AB10015).

## Type of Application and aspects on development

The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The CHMP did not agree to the applicant's request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not considered to be of major public health interest, for the reasons detailed below.

Indeed, the request would have been justified with regards to the target population for the indication and the relevance of the disease. Although a very rare disease, ALS impacts on general public health as most patients belong to late adulthood, with family and professional responsibilities, and the speed of progression is widely feared among the general population. A new truly effective agent will be of major interest.

However, the CHMP concluded that the strength of evidence presented in the request for accelerated assessment prevented the granting of a positive decision from the Committee. The presented interim analysis data were not considered sufficiently compelling to justify this approach, and in addition it was considered unlikely that the applicant could have their database cleared and locked at the time of planned CHMP assessment.

Based on the assessment of the request provided by the applicant, the draft CHMP guideline on the procedure for accelerated assessment pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) no 726/2004, the CHMP did not accept the accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Masitinib mesilate.

The applicant also requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(7) of the above mentioned Regulation. The applicant requested a conditional marketing authorisation based on the following claims:

- Masitinib aims at the treatment of seriously debilitating diseases and life-threatening disease (ALS).

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, incurable and fatal neurodegenerative disease. ALS is a serious neurological disease that causes muscle weakness, disability and eventually death. Median survival for ALS is 2 to 4 years from onset; only 5-10% of patients survive beyond 10 years [Chio, 2013]. The disease is heterogeneous, but most patients die less than 3 years from symptomonset [Gordon, 2013].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The cause of death in ALS is normally of a respiratory nature. Approximately 60 % of patients have a predictable decline in function while the remainders die suddenly, sometimes from other causes.

The only registered treatment option is riluzole [Miller, 2012]. However, clinical improvement is very modest with deterioration slowed by approximately 2 months with respect to placebo.

- Masitinib satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006.

The position of the CHMP on the above claims is expressed in the sections of the report below, but a key aspect of this position is that the Committee did not consider the presented data sufficient to conclude on the positive B/R ration of Alsitek in the intended indication.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product was proposed as film-coated tablets containing 100 mg and 200 mg of masitinib (as mesilate) as active substance.

Other ingredients were: microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc and sunset yellow lake (E110). The proposed packaging was high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child resistance closures.

## 2.2.2. Active  substance

An ASMF for masitinib mesilate was submitted. A letter of access to the ASMF in relation to the application for the proposed 100 mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets was provided. The discussion below refers to this source alone, as it is the only proposed for marketing. Masitinib mesilate is considered by the Applicant to be a new active substance.

## General information

The chemical name of masitinib mesilate is 4-[(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)methyl]-N-(4-methyl-3-{[4(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino}-phenyl)benzamide, methane sulphonic acid salt and has the following structure:

Figure 1 Structure of masitinib mesilate

<!-- image -->

The molecular structure of masitinib mesilate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy,  1 H-NMR,  13 C-NMR, and LC-MS using a reference batch of active substance.

Masitinib mesilate is a white to pale yellow powder, slightly hygroscopic, practically insoluble in acetone, slightly soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol. It exhibits pH-dependent aqueous solubility.The molecular structure does not contain asymmetric carbon atoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three polymorphic forms of masitinib mesilate were identified by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray spectrometry. It has been demonstrated that masitinib mesilate consistently manufactured by the proposed manufacturer is the polymorphic Form DRX1, anhydrous which is the most stable form. The polymorphic forms can be differentiated by melting point/range. Melting point is included in the active substance specification.

During the procedure it was noted that the correct spelling of the salt is 'mesilate' rather than 'mesilate'. The applicant should correct this in throughout the CTD and application documents.

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The active substance is synthesised in a convergent synthesis consisting of several chemical steps, purification, salt formation followed by drying and sieving.

The synthesis is comprised of 6 steps (with step 4 being divided into 3 sub-steps). Steps 1 to 4.1 are synthetic steps (bond breaking/formation), steps 4.2 to 6 comprise purification and salt formation.

The proposed starting materials comply with the general principles for selection of the starting materials as outlined in ICH Q11 and the EMA reflection paper and were found to be acceptable. The information provided on the route of synthesis of the starting materials allows for an adequate assessment of the impurities arising from their synthesis.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.

Comprehensive details and discussion are provided on impurities. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin. Specified impurities are controlled in compliance to the ICH Q3A guideline. Several mutagenic impurities were identified and control strategies in accordance with ICH M7 guideline have been proposed for these impurities.The active substance is packed in double LDPE bags which comply with EC 10/2011 and with the Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.4.

## Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (colour), identity masitinib (IR, UPLC/UV) identity mesilate ion ( 1 H-NMR), melting point (DSC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), related substances (UPLC/UV), residual solvents (GC), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), assay masitinib (UPLC/UV) and assay mesilate ion (titration).

In addition, tests for the metal impurities and tests for a number of potential mutagenic impurities (GC - UPLC/MS) are included.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and the non-compendial methods appropriately mostly validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Some additional validation and system suitability data is required.

The specifications and their limits are considered to be acceptable and have been appropriately justified. The potential formation of impurities has been investigated and appropriate specifications have been set, however the specification limits for some impurities need to be updated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The batches were all analysed according to the analytical methods presented in the dossier. The results were within the proposed specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

## Stability

Stability data on three production scale batches of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer) stored for 12 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH were provided. These batches were tested according to the specifications and with the analytical methods. No trend was observed and no significant differences between room temperature and accelerated conditions occurred.

A forced degradation study was conducted on one batch of masitinib mesilate in solid state (at high temperature) and in aqueous solution (at high temperature, UV, acidic, alkaline and oxidative conditions). The impurity test method used for release testing was used. In oxidative conditions masitinib showed nearly complete degradation. Some degradation was observed at aqueous high temperature (80 °C) UV and acidic conditions. There was no significant degradation in solid state at high temperature (120°C) or in aqueous alkaline conditions.

Two batches of masitinib mesilate were exposed to light for about 24 h (1.2 MioLux/h), according to ICH guideline Q1B. This photostability study revealed no significant changes due to the UV-light exposure; masitinib mesilate appears not to be photosensitive.

Additional stability data on six batches of the active substance manufactured before certain changes to the manufacturing process of the active substance were implemented were also provided. These batches were tested according to the specifications and using the analytical methods in force at the time of the studies (). The results from long-term stability studies at 25 ºC / 60% RH (3 batches x 60 months and 3 batches x 48 months) as well as from the accelerated stability studies at 40 ºC / 75% RH (6 batches x 6 months) show that the active substance is stable, all parameters comply with the established specification limits; no trend is observed and no significant differences between room temperature and accelerated conditions occurred.

Overall the batch data provided justify the retest period of 48 months for the masitinib mesilate active substance.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

The finished product was proposed as light-orange, capsule-shape, film-coated tablets containing 100 mg or 200 mg of masitinib (as mesilate) as active substance.

The excipients are microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel pH101 and pH200), povidone, crospovidone type A and magnesium stearate. The film coat contains polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol, talc and sunset yellow lake (E110). The two strengths of the formulation are manufactured from one common blend.

The proposed container closure system was an HDPE bottles, 30 tablets per bottle, closed with a childproof closure system.

The pharmaceutical development for masitinib 100 mg and 200 mg film-coated tablets has been adequately described. The aim was to develop an immediate release dosage form of masitinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Masitinib mesilate exists in three polymorphic forms. Polymorphic form DRX 1, the most stable form, is used to manufacture the finished product. This form exhibits a pH-dependant solubility profile across the physiological pH range with highest solubility at low pH (34 g/l at pH 1.3). The particle size of the drug substance is reduced by impact milling and is controlled in the active substance specification.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The compatibility of the active substance and excipients was investigated. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

In early clinical development masitinib 50 mg capsules were used. Later on, an immediate release tablet was developed as the commercial formulation. Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the phase 1 capsule formulation (2 x 50 mg) and the tablet formulation (1 x 100 mg). The applicant provided detailed information on the selection of dissolution method to bridge between the clinical tablet formulation and the proposed commercial tablet formulation. Since the tablets used during phase 2 and phase 3 studies have the same composition and are manufactured by a simple manufacturing process, the bridging between clinical formulations and the proposed commercial formulation, supported by relevant dissolution data, was considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A major objection was initially raised relating to the discriminatory power of the dissolution method proposed for quality control testing. The applicant subsequently submitted additional experimental data justifying the selection of the dissolution test conditions (i.e. paddle speed, medium, pH) and demonstrating the discriminatory power of the dissolution test and proposed specification limits (by testing batches of uncoated tablets formulated without disintegrant and testing batches manufactured with variable granulation parameters (equipment, granulation times, blade speed, water content and subsequent hardness). The major objection was considered to be resolved.

The primary packaging is HDPE bottles closed with a polypropylene child-resistant closure with an induction sealed aluminium/polyethylene liner. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. During storage the tablets are in contact with the protective polyethylene liner, however after opening, the polyethylene liner is removed and the tablets are in contact with a waxed white pulp board attached to the polypropylene closure. A specification for the waxed white pulp board liner has not been provided by the applicant at the time of opinion.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: weighing, preparation of binder solution, granulation, drying, milling, compression, tablet coating and packaging. The manufacturing process is considered a standard manufacturing process.

Based on the submitted batch data the batch size ranges are considered approvable.

The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Process validation for three production scale batches has been carried out on some steps only.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Pharmacology

The exact molecular pathway causing motor neuron degeneration in ALS is unknown, but as with other neurodegenerative diseases, it is likely to involve a complex interplay between multiple pathogenic cellular mechanisms that may not be mutually exclusive.

As a primary mechanism of action, masitinib acts on neuroglia through the inhibition of a receptor found on glial cells called CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor). There exists robust evidence in the scientific literature to link neuronal damage in ALS with microgliosis, the emergence of aberrant glial cells; a process regulated by the CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway. Through targeting this pathway both in vitro and in vivo, masitinib was shown to be able to inhibit glial cell proliferation, including aberrant microglial cells that are strongly associated with motor neuron degeneration, and retard microglia cell migration.

Excessive inhibition of CSF1 has been shown to result in complete microglia ablation, which might be deleterious by compromising otherwise normal microglia brain function. On the other hand, Trais and colleagues showed that prolonged dosing of masitinib did not inhibit microglial survival [Trias, 2016]. The rationale for such specific beneficial effect of masitinib, in contrast to other studies showing microglia ablation with CSF1, has high clinical relevance and was further discussed and clarified by the applicant. The applicant claims to have demonstrated that masitinib inhibits excessive microglial proliferation and emergence of aberrant glial cells without resulting in depletion of all microglia cells.

Secondary pharmacodynamics studies have shown that masitinib has a potential modulatory role on proinflammatory and vasoactive mediators released by mast cells, by sustaining the neuroinflammatory network and modulating BBB permeability, as well as mast cell-microglia crosstalk, inhibition of mast cell activity via targeting of c-Kit/SCF and Lyn/Fyn signaling pathways. These effects are likely to contribute to masitinib's overall therapeutic effect in ALS.

Safety pharmacology studies in rats revealed no treatment-related effect on the central nervous system or respiratory system at single oral doses up to 150 mg/kg. Masitinib induced a concentrationdependent reduction in hERG tail current over the concentration range 0.1 to 30 µM. The lowest concentration tested (0.1 µM) gave rise to a hERG current inhibition of 8% while the IC50 value was 8.3 µM. This effect was only partially reversed after the washout period and was significant compared to the spontaneous run-down observed in the control group. No effect was observed on electrocardiogram parameters in telemetered dogs (n=3) receiving 50 mg/kg and clinical studies do not suggest risk of QT prolongation with masitinib (Only one QTc elevation was observed among the 53

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ECG performed after a period of treatment of patients with masitinib of at least 3 months, and the increased QTc was less than 480 msec). The free plasma Cmax of masitinib which is about 0.08µmol/L, for a single dose of 400mg (for 800mg, the free plasma Cmax is about 0.13µM), is far lower than the IC50 measured in the hERG channel inhibition test. It is agreed that, at therapeutic doses in humans, masitinib is unable to inhibit hERG channel. No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed for masitinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.1. Pharmacokinetics

Preclinical  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  investigations  have  been  conducted  in  mice,  rats  and dogs in order to characterize the pharmacokinetic behaviour of masitinib mesilate.

## Absorption

In vitro studies in Caco-2 cells, indicate that masitinib may be a substrate of P-gp mediated transport at concentrations &lt;10 μM. At higher concentrations (≥10 μM), masitinib appears to be an inhibitor of P-gp mediated transport which is likely to be due to saturation of P-gp-mediated efflux. It was  not possible to establish an exact IC50, however approximated IC50 values were calculated, and in the range of 63.24 to 154.22 µM. The free concentration of masitinib in plasma is well below this range, hence inhibition of systemic P-gp is considered unlikely, whereas the concentration of masitinib in the gut is much higher than the approximated IC50 values, and inhibition of P-gp in the gut is a potential risk.

The absorption of masitinib was studied after single i.v. (5 mg/kg) and p.o (10 mg/kg) administration of 14C-masitinib to Beagle dogs and Sprague-Dawley rats. No gender differences were observed. Tmax following  p.o.  dosing  was  2.2  h  in  dogs  and  4  h  in  rats.  Elimination  half-life  (T½)  following  oral administration was 4.6 h and 10.4 h in rats and dogs, respectively. The bioavailability was relatively high with a mean value of 83% in dogs and 72% in rats. Masitinib had a relatively large volume of distribution  (Vd)  with  values  of  10.2  and  6.38  L/kg  for  male  and  female  Sprague-Dawley  rats, respectively.  The  plasma  clearance  for  male  and  female  rats  was  19.8  and  14.8  mL/min/kg, respectively.

In male Swiss mice after oral administration of AB1010 at four doses: 30, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, the  tmax  was  reached  0.5  or  1  hour  after  oral  (gavage)  administration.  Systemic  exposure  (as measured by the Cmax and AUC0-24h) increased with dose-level. Repeated dosing to rats revealed higher exposure in females. However, exposure to the major metabolite AB3280 was approximately two times higher in male rats. AB3280 Tmax was in the range from 3-4 h while the elimination half-life varied from 3.55 to 4.23 h. No gender differences were observed with respect to masitinib absorption in dogs following repeated oral administration. Results from TK analysis in rats revealed a supra-linear increase in exposure at lower dose levels (between 10 and 30 mg/kg).

## Distribution

The binding of  14 C-Masitinib mesilate was determined on human blood cells, human plasma proteins and isolated human plasma proteins as well as on rat, mouse, dog and rabbit blood cells and plasma. The  results  indicate  that  for  the 14 C-Masitinib  mesilate  concentration  used,  100-3000  ng/mL  the binding to human, rat, mouse, dog and rabbit plasma proteins was high 93.93%, 92.15%, 86.12%, 93.33% and 97.50%, respectively and constant within the tested concentration range.

Following intravenous injection and oral gavage, the test item distributed throughout the body. Higher concentration was observed in the adrenals, kidneys, spleen and intestines . However, rapid elimination was  observed  from  all  tissues  as  only  trace  amount  was  observed  after  24  hours  and  7  days respectively.  A  new  in  vivo  study  in  rats  has  been  performed  to  further  investigate  the  passage  of masitinib to the brain. It was shown that masitinib indeed crosses the blood brain barrier in rats and Cmax levels appear to be sufficiently high to inhibit c-Kit kinase directly in the brain tissues. Albeit, no appreciable treatment-related CNS adverse events were observed in in vivo preclinical models and in human patients in the non-oncology clinical development program of masitinib. These results suggest that masitinib is unlikely to elicit CNS toxicity in humans despite its ability to cross the blood brain barrier.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Metabolism

The  Phase  I  metabolism  of  masitinib  was  investigated  in  hepatic  microsomes  from  CD-1  mice, Sprague-Dawley rats,  New  Zealand  White  rabbits,  Beagle  dogs,  Cynomolgus  monkeys  and  humans. While the identical five metabolites were detected in mice and rabbits (AB3280, MET1, MET2, MET3 and  AB1187.3),  four  metabolites  were  seen  in  rats,  monkeys  and  humans  (AB3280,  MET1,  MET2, MET3).  While  AB3280  was  the  major  metabolite  in  hepatic  microsomes  derived  from  mice,  rats, monkeys and humans (≥18%), AB3280 was not formed in dog hepatocytes in vitro. Hence, the dog microsomes formed MET1, MET2 and MET3. No human specific metabolites were detected.

In addition, the Phase I and II metabolism of masitinib was studied in hepatocytes from CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and humans. While AB3280 was the major metabolite in hepatocytes from rats and humans AB2436 was the major metabolite in mice hepatocytes in vitro (&gt;47%). AB2436 was less abundant in rats (16%) and it was not found in human hepatocytes. Moreover, MET1/AB5235, which is genotoxic in the presence of S9 fraction in vitro, was only detected in mouse hepatocytes. Again, no human specific metabolites were observed.

In  initial  in  vivo  i.v.  and  p.o.  metabolite  studies  conducted  in  rats  and  dogs,  no  masitinib  plasma metabolites were detected. With a more sensitive method, it was shown that the aniline metabolite AB2436 is present in plasma in mice and rats. In mice, it is present at high levels (AUC for AB2436 is 4x AUC for AB1010) while in rats the levels are low (AUC for AB2436 is 0.005x AUC for AB1010). In humans the AUC for AB2436 at steady state is &lt;3% of the AUC for AB1010.

The major metabolite AB3280 was quantified during the course of repeat-dose studies in mice, rats and dogs.  Based  on  the  sum  of  in  vitro  data,  plasma,  urinary  and  faecal  data,  an  overview  of  the expected metabolism of masitinib in mice, rats, dogs and humans has been gathered. N-demethylation of masitinib to AB3280 takes place in mice, rats, dogs as well as humans and AB3280 represents the major masitinib metabolite in plasma. Based on the presence of AB3280 and/or AB1187.3 in urine, the cleavage of the amide bond leading to the formation of AB1187.3 and the aniline AB2436 occurs in all species  tested.  N-oxidation  and  hydroxylation  appear  to  be  minor  metabolic  pathways.  N-oxides  of either masitinib or AB3280 or both, were found as minor metabolites in urine and faeces of rats and dogs  and  were  not  specifically  searched  for  in  plasma  of  any  species.  Hydroxylated  derivatives  of masitinib were identified as minor metabolites in urine and faeces of rats and dogs. To conclude, the major metabolites detected in humans are also formed in animals and as such the species used for toxicity testing are considered valid animal models.

## Excretion

Masitinib was predominantly excreted via the faeces ( around 90% of the administered dose ) following p.o. and i.v. administration to rats and dogs.

## Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions

In  line  with  the  recommendations  in  the  draft  guideline  on  the  investigation  of  drug  interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95  Rev  1),  the  CYP450  inhibitory  properties  of  masitinib  and  AB3280  towards CYP1A2,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1  and  3A4/5  were  investigated  in  human  liver  microsomes.  The results revealed:

1) AB1010 was a weak to moderate inhibitor of the CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9, as well as CYP2D6 with IC50 values of 14 μM, 20 μM and &gt; 30 μM, respectively. This inhibition is partly reversible.

2) AB1010 does not increase the activity of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9 and 2C19 but slightly increase CYP1A2 activity. AB1010 does not affect the mRNA of CYPs 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3) At lower concentrations (&lt;10 μM), AB1010 appears to be a substrate of P -gp mediated transport while  at  higher  concentrations  (≥10  µM),  AB1010  appears  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp  mediated transport which is likely to be due to competitive inhibition of P-gp-mediated efflux.

4) AB1010 is not an inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC50 not reached) and a weak inhibitor of OATP1B3 (IC50 of 130μM).

5) It is agreed that the human potential impact of AB2436 on DDI is negligible.

## 2.3.2. Toxicology

Single-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rats  showed  that  the  approximately  lethal  dose  in  rats  is 2000 mg/kg following p.o. administration and higher than 100 mg/kg following i.v. dosing.

Repeat dose toxicity studies have been conducted of 4, 13 and 26 weeks duration in the rat and 4, 13 and 39 weeks duration in the dog. Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in the mouse up to 3 months duration.

In  these  studies  the  principal  target  organ  toxicity  findings  attributed  to  treatment  with  masitinib concerned  the  bone  marrow,  the  liver  and  the  kidney  in  dogs  and  rats,  gastrointestinal  tract intolerance in dogs, the heart, the female genital tract in rats and the male genital tract in dogs. At higher dose-levels these findings were accompanied by bodyweight changes and mortality.

Bone marrow toxicity observed in mice, rats and dogs was characterized by a reduction in red blood cell  parameters (reductions in red blood cells, haemoglobin and packed cell volume), a reduction in white blood cells (leucocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils), bone marrow hypocellularity in rats and dogs as well as clinical signs in the form of pallor and abnormal breathing in the dog. Haematological effects were observed at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs. Considering the important role of cKit during haematopoiesis, the bone marrow toxicity represents an expected finding. Hence, anaemia, lymphopenia,  leucopenia  and  neutropenia  are  either  common  or  very  common  findings  in  patients treated with masitinib.

Liver weight increase and hepatocellular hypertrophy was noted in mice, rats and dogs. This finding was accompanied by a moderate (≥ 2-fold) increase in liver enzymes (ALT/AST) at doses ≥100 and ≥ 150 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively. Moreover, reversible bile canalicular plugs were noted in dogs treated with 50 mg/kg masitinib for 4 weeks. Since masitinib appears to be primarily eliminated via biliary excretion, this finding is considered treatment-related.

Renal toxicity was observed in rats (protein in the urine, increased urine volume and pH, increased kidney  weight,  increases  in  plasma  creatinine  and  urea  as  well  as  degenerative/necrotic  tubular nephropathy) and in dogs (blood, bilirubin, proteins in urine) at the highest dose in the 4-week study. In  the  mouse  there  was  urinary  bladder  urothelial  hyperplasia  in  male  mice  which  was  not  fully reversible during a recovery period. Similar results were found in a 13-week follow-up study in male mice to further investigate the neoplastic findings in bladders of mice in the carcinogenicity study. The applicant  hypothesized  that  the  renal  disorders  may  be  explained  by  the  mechanism  of  action  of masitinib which induces some permeability dysfunctions through inhibition of PDGFR or other kinases involved in podocyte function and renal leakage.

Masitinib  exerted  gastrointestinal  toxicity  in  the  dog  in  the  form  of  vomiting,  regurgitation  and soft/liquid faeces. In addition, reddish or greenish coloured faeces was observed in dogs administered 150 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In all toxicity studies in rats, female genital organs showed morphological changes indicative of estrous cycle disturbance from 100 mg/kg/day. The ovaries had moderate to large number of luteal and/or follicular hematocysts, no or few corpora lutea, and very few or few follicular developments. Depending on  the  ovarian  stage,  this  was  associated  with  endometrial  epithelial  cell  atrophy  or  hypertrophy together with hyaline droplet deposit in the endometrial stroma, and vaginal epithelial cell atrophy, hyperplasia or mucification. Partial reversibility was noted in the 4-week toxicity in rats, although not confirmed  in  the  13-week  toxicity  in  rats.  The  mechanism  of  action  and  clinical  significance  has subsequently been sufficiently discussed by the Applicant.

Most  male  Beagle  dogs  are  sexually  mature  by  eight  to  nine  months  of  age  and  since  the  animals applied in the 39-week dog study were 6 to 7 months at study initiation the majority were sexually mature  at  sacrifice  (1  male  out  of  4  was  pubertal).  In  the  male  reproductive  tract  there  was vacuolation of the seminiferous epithelium and oligospermia in the epididymides in 2/4 dogs at the top dose of the 39 week study.

Slight to moderate hyperostosis were observed in the bones of rats administered 100 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The related tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and sunitinib have been associated with a low and moderate risk for cardiotoxicity in the clinical setting, respectively.

One of the factors reported to lead to cardiotoxicity is the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Abl which serves a maintenance function in cardiac-muscle cells. The Applicant points to that masitinib displays a lower affinity towards c-Abl than imatinib and sunitinib, however based on the publication from Davis et  al  (2011),  the  affinity  of  masitinib  and  imatinib  was  similar  towards  nonphosphorylated  and phosphorylated c-Abl, while sunitinib displayed no significant affinity towards either nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated c-Abl.

The repeated dose toxicity studies revealed myocardial degeneration and fibrosis in the rat 26 week study and pericardial oedema in 1/4 female dogs at the top dose in the 39 week study. In the 2 year rat carcinogenicity study cardiomyopathy/atrial fibrosis occurred in both sexes at the mid-and top-dose levels and was considered to be a contributing factor to death in 5/50 males and 2/50 females at the top  dose  level.  The  severity  of  the  cardiomyopathy  appeared  to  be  dose  dependent,  however,  the frequency  was  not  increased  compared  to  the  control  group.  Masitinib  treatment  in  this  study increased  the  severity  of  the  underlying  cardiomyopathy.  Preclinical  cardiac  findings  are  stated  in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Warnings regarding patients presenting with long QT interval or with cardiac failure  is  included  in  section  5.2,  and  lastly,  cardiac  toxicity,  hypertension  and  hypotension  are identified  as  potential  important  risks  in  the  RMP.  Since  the  bioanalysis  conducted  in  the  26-week study  in  rats  and  the  39-week  study  in  dogs  were  not  performed  under  GLP  conditions,  the toxicokinetic data from these studies are only considered indicative.

No  safety  margins  were  presented  in  the  initial  non-clinical  dossier  that  compares  the  exposure  in animals (based on NOAEL values) to exposure in humans, i.e. to establish safety margins to observed toxicities. During the procedure the Applicant provided a comprehensive and elaborated discussion on the non-clinical data concerning the observed renal, reproductive organs- and cardiovascular toxicities. It appears that the toxicities observed in animals may be considered to be species specific, and this is supported by clinical data where lack of signals in these target organs prevails. The risk minimization measures suggested by the Applicant are therefore endorsed.

No treatment-related effect on mating parameters, the reproductive organs or seminology was noted at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated p.o. from 29 days prior to mating.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated p.o. with 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day masitinib from 29 days prior  to  mating  until  day  7  post-coitum.  There  were  no  effects  on  mating  behaviour,  whereas  the fertility  of  females  given  100  mg/kg/day  was affected, as indicated by the number of non-pregnant females (3/24, compared to 0/24 in the vehicle), the low number of corpora lutea and implantation sites and the high pre-implantation loss. At 100 mg/kg/day, the increased number of early resorptions in addition to the increased number of dead concepti resulted in a low number of live concepti. The microscopic examination of the ovaries showed haemocysts in many corpora lutea in all the females given 100 mg/kg/day. Cystic degeneration of corpora lutea (with accumulation of fibroblasts and a few erythrocytes) was seen at 100 and 30 mg/kg/day (respectively, 17/24 and 6/24 females).

The adverse effects on female fertility appeared reversible hence acyclic oestrous cycle was the only finding  in  female  Sprague-Dawley  rats  were given p.o.  15  and 50  mg/kg/day  masitinib  for  28  days followed by a recovery period of two weeks before mating.

Overall,  the  NOAEL  for  male  and  female  fertility  is  considered  100  mg/kg/day  and  10  mg/kg/day, respectively.

The potential effects of masitinib on embryo-fetal development were evaluated in rats and rabbits. In the  rat  study,  a  lower  (-10%)  mean  fetal  body  weight  was  observed  in  the  high-dose  group  (100 mg/kg/day).  While  visceral  or  skeletal  malformations  were  not  observed,  masitinib-treatment  was associated  with  variations  in  the  form  of  unossified  or  incompletely  ossified  bones  of  the  head, sternebrae and ribs. The incomplete ossifications were observed at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity  was  observed in  the  form  of  a  significant  reduction  in  body  weight  gain  at  100  mg/kg/day. Moreover, maternal macroscopic findings were made in all masitinib-treated groups.

Cases  of  unossified  fetal  bone  (5th  and  6th  sternebra)  were  observed  in  the  rabbit  embryo-fetal development study at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity was observed at 100 mg/kg/day in the form of a 74% reduction in overall body weight gain relative to control animals. Moreover, all pregnant females  experienced  a  mean  net  body  weight  loss  (body  weight  change  adjusted  for  gravid  uterus weight) from day 6 post-coitum, but this was markedly greater than control at 100 mg/kg/day.

Since the skeletal variation observed (cases of unossified bone) are reversible and as such not adverse to the animal, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is considered 30 mg/kg/day based on the reduced fetal  weight  observed  in  rats.  The  NOAEL  for  maternal  toxicity  (reduced  body  weight/macroscopic findings) is considered &lt; 10 mg/kg/day.

No study on pre- and postnatal toxicity has been performed. A study on pre- and postnatal toxicity is expected to accompany an MAA unless there is a strong justification for omitting such data. Cautious recommendations in the SmPC are not a sufficient argument for waiving studies on developmental and reproductive toxicity. These studies are needed to make well-educated decisions in those rare cases where exposure occurs during early or late pregnancy. A decision to waive or postpone a study on preand postnatal toxicity must be justified by that fertile women are rare in the patient population or that data  from  the  embryo-fetal  toxicity  study  suggest  such  pronounced  embryotoxicity  that  a  pre-  and postnatal toxicity study is unlikely to provide data of additional value. In absence of such justification, a  decision  to  allow  for  a  post-approval  commitment  must  be  based  on  the  demonstration  of  an important clinical benefit and an agreement that the access to patients should not be delayed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According  to  the  Non-Clinical  review  of  the  Applicant  for  masitinib 'There  was  no  evidence  of teratogenicity in the rat or the rabbit, over a range of dose-levels that included doses causing maternal toxicity' . The Applicant having performed a reproductive toxicity study in rats observed toxicity in the female reproductive system, which consisted of haematocysts and corpus luteum cysts in the ovaries only. According to the Applicant's view 'the hormone-dependent toxicity observed in female rats with masitinib is unlikely to occur in humans' . However, this is not considered an accurate conclusion. It is considered that a sufficient number of well-designed studies, that would further investigate detrimental teratogenic effects of masitinib, have not been performed with masitinib.

Masitinib induced delayed contact hypersensitivity in the murine Local Lymph Node Assay. Moreover, masitinib was  identified as slightly irritating and  severely  irritating to rabbit skin  and  eyes, respectively.

Masitinib  was  non-genotoxic  in  a  test  battery  comprising  the  following  assays:  Ames  test,  human lymphocytes, L5178Y TK +/-  mouse lymphoma cells, in vivo mouse micronuclei test and Comet assays of mouse and rat liver and bladder tissues.

The Applicant has submitted long-term carcinogenicity studies conducted with mastinib in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Masitinib-treatment was associated with mortality in the mice. Hence, the overall  survival  rates  ranged  from  26-38% in the treated animals versus 40% in the control group. Due to high  mortality  rates,  the  study  treatment  period  and  the  administered  doses  were  reduced. Urinary  bladder  transitional  carcinomas  and  papillomas  were  seen  in  5/52  male  CD-1  administered 500/300/80  mg/kg/day  masitinib  for  80  weeks,  while  transitional  papillomas  were  observed  in  the intermediate  dose  group  (150/100/40  mg/kg/day).  Urinary  bladder  transitional  cell  hyperplasia  was also seen in 150/100/40 and 500/300/80 mg/kg/day males and females with a greater incidence than in controls and 30/20 mg/kg/day mice. As the tumours were seen only in treated animals, with a clear dose-relationship,  in  association  with  pre-neoplastic  finding  in  males  and  females,  in  incidences  far outside  from  historical  control  data  and  with  statistically  positive  trend,  they  were  attributed  to treatment with masitinib. A NOAEL for the urinary bladder transitional carcinomas was established at 30/20 mg/kg/day.

The  applicant  hypothesized  that  the  increase  in  urinary  bladder  carcinomas  and  papillomas  and urothelial papillomas were mouse-specific findings based on the production of two aniline metabolites in  mouse  hepatocytes in  vitro and  not  in  hepatocytes  from  other  species  including  humans.  This hypothesis  appears  incorrect  since  the  genotoxic  metabolite  AB2436  was  also  formed  in  rat hepatocytes in  vitro and  urinary  bladder  carcinomas  and  papillomas  were  not  observed  in  the  rat carcinogenicity study.

While  masitinib treatment  was  not  associated  with  significant mortality in the long-term  rat carcinogenicity  study,  it  induced  uterine  adenocarcinomas  and  atypical  uterine  hyperplasia  with  a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day. Thyroid follicular cell adenomas were observed in 1/50 and 5/50 female rats administered 30 and 75/60 mg/kg/day, respectively. These findings were accompanied by follicular cell hyperplasia  hence  the  overall  NOAEL  is  considered  10  mg/kg/day.  Pulmonary  cystic  keratinizing epithelioma was found in 4/50 high-dose females whereas it was not recorded in the CIT control data or  in  the  compilation  of  spontaneous  neoplasms  of  control  Sprague-Dawley  rats  from  Charles  River Laboratories (2004) and therefore was considered to be induced by masitinib.

The  Applicant  was  asked  to  determine  whether  there  is  a  carcinogenic  risk  for  patients  under  the presumption  that  bladder  tumours  in  mice  are  caused  by  the  aniline  metabolites  and  taking  into consideration the ADME data on differences in exposure to aniline metabolites in mice versus humans.

The way the Applicant has taken to apply the principles of ICH M7 for this case is agreed. However, there is some uncertainty about parameters taken into the calculation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  principle  for  deriving  at  a  dose  resulting  in  a  less  than  1/105  cancer  risk  is  to  take  the  dose resulting in a 50% tumour incidence (TD50) and divide by 50000. As an alternative one may use the benchmark dose lower confidence limit 10% (BMDL10, an estimate of the lowest dose which is 95% certain  to  cause  no  more  than  a  10%  cancer  incidence  in  rodent).  The  company  has  chosen  this approach which is understandable, since tumour incidence was clearly below 50%. While the data do not allow a clear calculation of BMDL10, the applicant has presented an interval which is agreed. It is however not agreed to make the calculation separately for the transitional carcinomas and papillomas. These tumours are likely to be related in terms of mechanism. It would be most appropriate to make the calculation on the sum. This would however not change the conclusion that BMDL10 would fall in the interval between the mid dose and high dose.

The  dose  was  lowered  at  two  occasions  during  the  mouse  carcinogenicity  due  to  toxicity  and  high levels  of  mortality.  The  Applicant  has  made  a  calculation  of  an  average  lifetime  daily  dose.  This  is considered acceptable as a conservative dose estimate. It is concluded that the BDML10 value falls between 80 mg/kg and 140 mg/kg. This conclusion is endorsed.

To make a risk estimate based on exposure to the aniline metabolites, the Applicant refers to data showing  about  500  times  higher  exposure  in  mice  versus  humans  when  comparing  at  a  human equivalent dose. This factor is based on PK data submitted earlier and is agreed.

The inclusion of this factor in the ICH M7 formula results in an acceptable daily intake (AI) of masitinib between 4 - 12 mg/kg/day. The applicant argues that no transitional cell carcinomas were seen at the mid dose, and proposes 8 mg/kg to be the AI. However, the papillomas should be considered why a higher AI than 4 mg/kg is not agreed. This is just below the maximum daily dose. However, given the conservative nature of the AI calculation it is concluded that the presence of aniline metabolites is not considered a carcinogenic threat in patients.

However, based on uncertainties related to the performance of the carcinogenicity study and the lack of a full characterisation of metabolic pattern in humans, a carcinogenic risk of masitinib for patients, based on the bladder tumour findings in mice cannot be fully excluded. It is not anticipated that further nonclinical  evaluation  will  clarify  this  risk.  These  findings  should  be  mentioned  in  the  product information and be taken care of in the risk management program (as proposed by the applicant).

The masitinib metabolite AB3280 was devoid of a genotoxic potential in tests for gene mutations in bacteria  (Ames  test)  and  in  mammalian  cells  (cultured  human  lymphocytes).  Moreover,  AB3280  at doses up to 600 mg/kg only gave rise to minor findings in a 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats.

However, the metabolite AB2436 gave rise to gene mutations in both bacteria and human lymphocytes in the presence of S9. The metabolites AB5235 and AB6465 also showed mutagenic activity with a rat liver metabolic activation system

## 2.3.3. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The legal basis for  the  current  submission  (Masitinib  100  mg  film-coated  tablets) is  Article  3  (1)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, an orphan medicinal product status. It contains a new developed active substance masitinib, which will be used for the treatment of adult patients with probable or definitive amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS).  The  recommended  dose  is  4.5  mg/Kg/day  taken  orally  in  the morning  and  evening.  Masitinib  may  be  administered  until  patients  are  no  longer  benefiting  from treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  performed  an  ERA  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

A PEC surface water (0.00824 mg/L) based on a DOSEAI of 329.76 mg/inhabitant/day and a fraction market penetration of 5x10-5 (orphan drug designation for ALS), resulted very low and did not trigger the  action  limit  calculation.  The  log  Kow  has  been  performed  for  masitinib  according  to  the  OECD guideline No. 117, the resulted value of 1.44±0.003 demonstrated to be below 4.5 (action limit for PBT screening). However, taking into account that masitinib is an ionisable substance (pKa =7.5 - quality dossier - 3.2.S.1.3), for which the solubility is pH dependent, an ion-corrected log Dow was performed, covering the environmentally relevant pH-range.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The exact molecular pathway causing motor neuron degeneration in ALS is unknown, but as with other neurodegenerative diseases, it is likely to involve a complex interplay between multiple pathogenic cellular mechanisms that may not be mutually exclusive.

As a primary mechanism of action, masitinib possibly acts on neuroglia through the inhibition of a receptor found on glial cells called CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor). The applicant claims to have demonstrated that masitinib inhibits excessive microglial proliferation and emergence of aberrant glial cells without resulting in depletion of all microglia cells.

Secondary pharmacodynamics studies have shown that masitinib has a potential modulatory role on proinflammatory and vasoactive mediators released by mast cells, by sustaining the neuroinflammatory network and modulating BBB permeability, as well as mast cell-microglia crosstalk, inhibition of mast cell activity via targeting of c-Kit/SCF and Lyn/Fyn signaling pathways. These effects may also contribute to masitinib's overall therapeutic effect in ALS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The major human metabolite, AB3280 was present in animals to an extent allowing toxicological qualification. The mutagenic aniline metabolite AB2436 was shown to be a minor circulating metabolite in humans (&lt;3% if the AUC for masitinib) but was present in high levels in mouse (4x AUC for AB2436). As discussed below, the genotoxic metabolite may be associated with a carcinogenic risk.

In a long-term carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice after repeated administration of masitinib for 2 years, urinary bladder transitional carcinomas and papillomas were seen in five high-dose males, while transitional papillomas were observed in the intermediate dose group. Urinary bladder transitional cell hyperplasia was also seen in group 3 and 4 males and females with a greater incidence than in controls and low-dose mice.

In the long-term carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats the incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas seen at the high-dose was higher than that observed in CIT control data or in the literature, therefore this neoplasm was considered to be related to the administration of the test item at 75/60 mg/kg/day. The increased incidence observed in the current study may be related to the increased incidence of ovarian follicular cysts as this lesion is reported to be associated with such cysts and is thought to be the result of prolonged oestrogen stimulation (Boorman et al., 1990). Pulmonary cystic keratinizing epithelioma was found in 4/50 high-dose females whereas it was not recorded in the CIT control data or in the compilation of spontaneous neoplasms of control Sprague-Dawley rats and therefore was considered to be induced by masitinib. The cystic keratinizing epithelioma appears to be a proliferative lesion limited to the rat and is rarely seen in other species (Boorman et al., 1996). In the current study, it was thought to be secondary to the irritation elicited in the alveoli by the presence of foamy macrophages induced by the test item administration. Bronchoalveolar hyperplasia in the lungs and squamous metaplasia in the lungs, trachea and larynx were considered to be regenerative and secondary to the injury elicited by the presence of foamy alveolar macrophages.

Studies on developmental and reproductive toxicity are needed to make well-educated decisions in those rare cases where exposure occurs during early or late pregnancy. A decision to waive or postpone a study on pre- and postnatal toxicity must be justified by the fact that fertile women are rare in the patient population, or that data from the embryo-foetal toxicity study suggest such pronounced embryotoxicity that a pre- and postnatal toxicity study is unlikely to provide data of additional value. In absence of a valid justification, only in the case of a major clinical benefit it would be acceptable for such data to be provided as a post-approval commitment.

There were tumour findings in both the mouse and the rat carcinogenicity study. Based on the findings of the carcinogenicity study in mice, uncertainties and the lack of a full characterisation of metabolic pattern in humans, a carcinogenic risk of masitinib for patients, based on the bladder tumour findings in mice, cannot be fully excluded. However, it is anticipated that further nonclinical evaluation will not clarify this risk. Should the product be found to be of important clinical benefit in the target population, these findings would be described in the product information and proposed to be managed in the context of the risk management program (See discussion on benefit- risk).

## 2.3.5. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Uncertainties in the non-clinical information submitted in support of the application of Alsitek are related to the lack of developmental and reproductive toxicity studies and carcinogenic findings in rats. Should a significant clinical benefit be proven (see discussion on Clinical efficacy, Clinical Safety and Benefit / Risk) it can be concluded that such uncertainties could be managed with appropriate warnings in the PI and measures in the RMP.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

A triggered GCP inspection was requested by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, on the conduct of the clinical study AB10015, in accordance with Article 57 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and article 15 of Directive 2001/20/EC. Specific concerns have been identified by the assessors during the assessment of the data submitted. Inspectors confirmed these concerns during the inspection. The two centres inspected accounted for more than 40% of the overall study population. Several findings were detected. Four (4) critical, seven (7) major and two (2) minor findings have been observed. Critical findings were related to inadequate conduct of the trial, management of the trial by sponsor/CRO, failing to communicate protocol deviations to the Spanish Medicines or Medical Devices Agency and clinical monitoring. Major findings were observed at qualification and training, TMF, clinical conduct of the trial, safety reporting, IMP, source data verification and Clinical Study Report. Minor findings were addressed to archiving and equipment used in the trial.

The nature and of the findings, the systematic deficiencies observed, the massive number of protocol deviations which translated into a general lack of adherence to the protocol, the lack of global investigator meetings to harmonise procedures, and the suboptimal quality of management by the sponsor and CROs involved, all have a negative impact on data reliability. Inspectors are of the opinion that the data obtained at the sites inspected and represented in the CSR, are not trustworthy enough to support the application authorisation submitted to the Agency for Alsitek.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics of masitinib  has  been  investigated  in  three  studies,  including  a  mass-balance study, in healthy subjects. Additionally, three studies have been conducted to bridge PK data from the early formulation used (capsules) to the to-be-marketed formulation (tablets), to investigate the effect of  food  on  masitinib  PK  and  to  evaluate the  effect of  CYP3A4/P-gp inhibition on masitinib PK (using itraconazole), respectively. The PK in the target group has also been investigated in 18 patients with ALS. 17 in vitro studies using human biomaterial have been performed.

The absorption profile of masitinib demonstrates a relatively slow absorption with tmax median values between 1.5 to 5.0 hours at the proposed clinical doses. No data on absolute bioavailability in healthy subjects or the target population has been presented.

Bioequivalence have been adequately demonstrated in vivo for the tablet formulation intended for the market versus the formulation used in phase I. Following a high fat meal, masitinib Cmax and AUC0-∞ increased by 19% and 23%, respectively.

Masitinib is extensively bound to plasma proteins; the major binding protein appears to be albumin. No information  is  provided  on  protein  binding  ex/in  vivo.  The  blood:plasma  ratio  is  around  1.  The distribution kinetics of masitinib in healthy subjects is non-linear. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) is high, indicating an extensive tissue distribution and perhaps a low bioavailability.

Steady  state  apparent  total  clearance  and  renal  clearance  were  0.7-1.4  L/min  and  9-18  ml/min, respectively.  Apparent  clearance  CL/F  decreased  with  increasing  dose  indicating  a  saturation  of enzymes responsible for metabolism and/or increased bioavailability (potentially due to inhibition of intestinal P-pg). Elimination half-life after single-dose and repeated dose masitinib were approximately 13 h and 17 h, respectively. Urinary recovery rates were low with less than 2% recovery for masitinib and  metabolite  AB3280.  A  mass-balance  study  has  additionally  been  conducted.  A  mean  of  69% (range 55% to 83%) of radioactivity administered was recovered by the end of the sampling period (168 h) and the majority of radioactivity was recovered in faeces, up to 59% of the administered dose. The  urinary  recovery  was  low,  approximately  10%  of  the  dose.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  main excretion pathway for AB1010 and its related metabolites is the faeces.

CYP3A4 catalyses the metabolism of masitinib and the formation of metabolites in human liver, with a minor  contribution  by  CYP2C8  in  the  formation  of  AB3280,  which  is  considered  to  be  the  primary metabolite.  The  PK  profile  for  the  metabolite  AB3280  is  similar  to  its  parent  compound  masitinib. AB3280 steady state plasma concentration in healthy subjects corresponded to roughly 20-30% of the steady state masitinib plasma concentration. The transformation of masitinib to AB3280 appears to be rapid, indicating that masitinib undergoes  first-pass conversion to AB3280.  Several  masitinib metabolites  have  been  identified.  It  is  unclear  in  which  extent  metabolites  have  been  identified  in humans. In addition to this, under the mass-balance study, the plasma PK for parent, AB1010, known metabolites i.e AB3280, AB2436, AB5235 and AB6465 and total radioactivity were also determined. Overall geometric mean exposure (AUC0-last) of parent AB1010, AB3280 and AB2436, accounted for approximately  12%,  3.1%  and  0.05%  of  the  total  circulating  radioactivity  measured  in  plasma, respectively. The geometric mean apparent terminal half-life for total radioactivity was 94.7 h which was  longer  than  that  observed  in  parent  AB1010  or  quantifiable  metabolites  AB3280  and  AB2436. These  are  strong  indications  that  there  are  yet  to  be  identified  major  metabolites  involved  in  the masitinib elimination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PK of plasma masitinib was described by a two-compartment open model with linear elimination. The main covariate effects were related to body weight, which influenced all PK parameters, and to albumin. The model showed that CL was not affected by dose, and that AUC thus behaves in a doseproportional manner. AUC-based accumulation ratios for masitinib in healthy subjects was 1.8-2.3 at therapeutic doses.

PK  in  adult  patients  with  probable  or  definitive  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  was  similar  to  healthy subjects.  However,  Masitinib  is  administered  concomitantly  with  Riluzole  and  no  DDI  study  was presented.

The PK of masitinib in special populations has not been satisfactorily investigated. A product specific waiver for a paediatric investigational plan (PIP) in accordance with the paediatric regulation has been granted.  No  information  is  available  on  how  race  may  affect  the  PK  of  masitinib.  Gender  does  not appear  to  influence  PK  of  masitinib.  There  are  no  data  on  renal  impairment,  but  the  applicant  has commited to performe such a study as a PAM. Hepatic impairment may affect the masitinib PK and the Applicant also considered to perform a clinical study of masitinib PK in patients with impaired hepatic function as PAM. At the time, no recommendations on the use of masitinib in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function can be made.

The potential for drug interaction has mainly been investigated in vitro. The Applicant has provided several CYPP450 metabolism and transporter studies that suggest that there may be several clinically relevant  DDI  interactions.  A  number  of  questions  are  raised  that  require  further  discussion  and additional studies. Studies investigating masitinib as a substrate of OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 are lacking, and the potential for inhibition of the transporter bile salt export pump (BSEP) have not been investigated as recommended in the DDI guideline CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1 Corr.**. The clinical relevance of the in  vitro  findings  needs to be further investigated. The Applicant has conducted a study investigating the  effect  of  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  and  has  committed  to  conduct  a  study  investigating  the  effect  of induction  of  CYP3A4  on  masitinib  PK.  The  need  to  conduct  other  in  vivo  studies  investigating  the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions should be further discussed. Since the solubility of  masitinib  mesilate  is  pH  dependent  in  the  physiological  pH  range,  there  is  a  potential  for  an interaction with medicinal products that moderate pH in the gut which needs to be further investigated. Masitinib is proposed to be contraindicated to pregnant women and women of child bearing potential are proposed to take effective contraception. This is in contradiction with the absence of a DDI study with oral contraceptives and a DDI study with an oral contraceptive is requested as a PAM. Overall, at the current time, a total of 9 additional in vitro and in vivo studies are requested for elucidating the PK of masitinib in special populations and its DDI potential.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Pre-clinical evidence obtained in SOD1G93A rat models showed a therapeutic benefit of masitinib at the dose of 30 mg/kg/day, which is close to a Human Equivalent Dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day.

The  applicant  stated  that:  'No  studies  having  a  primary  objective  of  determining  PD  effects  of masitinib  have  been  performed  during  the  clinical  development  of  masitinib.'  The  Sponsor  notes, however, that auxiliary PK/PD studies have been included as sub-studies in several clinical trials for masitinib.

Healthy Subject PD: PK studies have been carried out in healthy volunteers but no PD data have been collected  in  these  subjects.  Therefore,  study  reports  related  to  PD  and  PK/PD  analyses  in  healthy subjects were not provided in this dossier.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oral administration of masitinib to SOD1G93A rats starting after paralysis onset showed that masitinib decreased the emergence/expansion of aberrant glial cells thereby controlling microgliosis and motor neuron pathology in the degenerating spinal cord, when compared with vehicle-treated rats. Masitinib treatment initiated 7 days after paralysis onset prolonged post-paralysis survival by 40%.

The pre-clinical evidence in SOD1G93A rat model thus indicated that the administration of masitinib at 30 mg/kg/day provided therapeutic benefit in an advanced therapeutic setting.

The dose used in rats corresponds to the Human Equivalent Dose (HED) of 4.8 mg/kg/day (factor of 6.2), which is close to the dose-level of 4.5 mg/kg/day.

The relevance of the animal model and relation to MoA of masitinib in ALS has been discussed as a concern. The SOD1G93A rat model was considered the most relevant model. Unfortunately, neither SOD(H46R) transgenic rat model nor the sporadic ALS Wobbler mouse model, which have been used to identify MoA targeting proof of concept by the recent concurrent agents used in clinical trials for ALS have been discussed. As for the newly identified action of masitinib in mast cell involvement in NMJ pathology,  which  is  claimed  by  the  applicant  as  a  complementary  mechanism  of  action,  there  are comments to be expressed. If indeed masitinib would significantly act on NMJ, then endpoints directly related  to  this  action  should  have  been  better  studied  or  registered.  In  fact,  this  MoA  should  be reflected in muscle strength or muscular respiratory stability or improvement, and should have shown clear  results  in  forced  vital  capacity,  fatigue  and  HHD.  HHD  has  not  been  studied,  but  the  other strength / respiratory endpoints did not show clear results.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The data provided for pharmacodynamics only marginally addresses the potential effect of masitinib on the underlying mechanisms of disease in ALS. Only one classical model has been used, and it appears that the data was produced a posteriori once the trial was already ongoing.

As expressed in the ALS guideline (EMA/CHMP/40105/2013 Page 10/21), section 7.2. Pharmacodynamics:  At  present  the  best  studied  animal  model  to  evaluate  Guideline  on  clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) candidate drugs  is  transgenic  rodents  overexpressing  the  gene  encoding  superoxide  dismutase  1  (SOD-1) (Gurney 1994; Robertson 2002; Danzeisen 2006; van den Bosch 2011). However, as SOD-1 mutations account only for the hereditary type of ALS this animal model might have little relevance to human sporadic ALS. For this reason, consideration should be also given to the applicability of other animal models of ALS, which have been recently developed (examples include but are not limited to models with mutations in TDP-43, FUS/TLS, C90RF72, EPhA4 etc.; Wegorzewska 2009; De Jesus-Hernandez 2011; Renton 2011; Van Hoecke 2012). Animal data and the appropriateness of the model should be evaluated carefully (Ludolph 2010). The mechanism of action and PD effect could also be supported by in vitro data in human cells (Dimos 2008; Coatti 2015).

The use of a single model, using the specified doses in the symptomatic period 1-7 days, is far from sufficient  to  demonstrate  the  MoA,  especially  when  the  proposed  MoA  does  not  act  directly  on  the apoptotic motor neuron cells, but through an indirect glia-based action.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary PD issues have also not been adequately responded to. The MAA did not specifically address how  the  action  of  masitinib  on  other  system  organs  like  bone  marrow,  calcium  /  phosphorus metabolism would impact on the progression of the disease on the preclinical models. The explanation focused on the CNS effects - which are the ones for whom animal models are less sensitive. In fact, nausea was frequent or very frequent in the highest 4.5 mg/Kg dose, and was not identified in the animal model. It would have been interesting to provide data on weight loss / anaemia / bone lesions of animals and how it impacted survival or paralysis.

Unlike the Applicant's claim that in a classical SOD1 rat model masitinib exerts several mechanisms of action and that this aspect is remarkable, it is argued that all strategies based in the SOD1 rat model response in the past 20 years have failed in humans, and this is the reason why masitinib results with this model must be interpreted cautiously, independently of the number of potential mode of action on a single classical model. Should a single MoA be present in three animal models, and the likelihood that this MoA would be present in humans would be higher, and the robustness of data would be increased.

The Applicant has failed to respond in any of the requests for information, on the issues concerning the secondary pharmacodynamics and several off target effects. Given the fact that masitinib has been studied in several pathologies and animal models, this also creates concerns on the reasoning which led to the clinical program on ALS.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The mode of action of the compound has not been convincingly demonstrated, and the fact that the preclinical studies which are presented to support the MoA in ALS have been published after the start of the trial is of concern.

The only preclinical model that was presented has been the SOD1G93A rat model, which as stated in the  ALS  guideline  is  supportive  for  congenital  SOD1  related  ALS,  and  for  sporadic  ALS  this  model should be supplemented and confirmed with other published models. Moreover the best target dose in ALS has also not been addressed a priori.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Main study(ies)

The development program of masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was based on the following pivotal phase 2/3 study:

## A Phase 2/3 study AB10015: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel groups, phase 2/3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib versus placebo in the treatment of patients suffering from ALS.

The applicant initially submitted the results from an interim analysis, and later in the procedure these were supplemented by the results of the final analysis.

Study AB10015 is a prospective, placebo controlled study that followed the recommendations set in the EMA guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of ALS (EMA/531686/2015, Corr.1) and in the draft Guidance for Industry Drug Development for ALS.

Patients were randomly allocated to one of the three following groups:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Group 1: masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole Group 2: masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day + riluzole Group 3: placebo of masitinib + riluzole

Patients received treatment for 48 week, with possible extension.

The design of study AB10015 effectively compares masitinib plus riluzole in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments against placebo plus riluzole in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments. The study protocol states that: 'All medications taken by the patients at the onset of study and all medication given in addition to the Investigational Medicinal Product during the study are regarded as concomitant medications', and 'All concomitant medications and/or therapies should be documented in the patient file and reported in the electronic Case Report Form'. Hence, there was no restriction placed on the investigator's choice of standard of care symptomatic treatments (for example, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and alternative therapies).

Four amendments were implemented while the study remained blinded, and the primary analysis hypothesis on the treatment effect (Δ3.3 points) never changed.

- The study was initiated as a phase 2 study in April 2013. However, considering that patient recruitment was extremely fast, it was decided to transform the phase 2 directly into a phase 3, without reviewing the phase 2 data. Protocol Version 1.0 (including amendment No. 1, dated 02 July 2013) incorporated the modification of the sample size (passage from phase 2 to phase 2/3 study with 210 patients).
- Protocol Version 2.0 (including amendment No. 2, dated 21 March 2014) primarily incorporated the split of the two masitinib treatment-arms and the planning for a futility test and an interim analysis. The sample size was modified as a result of the changes in the study design (change from 210 patients to 300 patients).
- Protocol Version 3.0 (including amendment No. 3, dated 08 October 2014) introduced a distinction between 'Normal Progressor' patients and 'Fast Progressor' patients. This amendment was indicated to be not data driven and was mandatory to avoid the risk of bias. A switch from repeated measures to absolute change from baseline to week 48 was also introduced in the primary analysis, with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) as primary method for missing data handling at week 48. The sample size was modified taking into consideration the change from repeated measure to LOCF method (change from 300 patients to 381 patients).
- Protocol Version 4.0 (including amendment No. 4, dated 16 March 2015) introduced minor changes, including modification in the LOCF method.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most relevant protocol amendment was No. 3 when the distinction between patient populations of 'Normal Progressor' and 'Fast Progressor' was made. This was justified by the Applicant by the fact that it has been observed in clinical practice that ALS patients experience different rates of disease progression. It is hypothesized by the Applicant that different rates of disease progression reflect differing pathogenesis of ALS, with ramifications as to the efficacy of therapies directed towards any specific mechanism of disease. That is to say, heterogeneity within the overall ALS population in terms of disease progression can be explained by distinct subpopulations of ALS patients. The applicant states that there are at least two highly distinct populations of ALS patient within the overall ALS population, which can be distinguished from one another in terms of 'Fast Progressor' patients who progress at a relatively fast rate as measured via progression of a suitable clinical marker of disease burden (such as ALSFRS-R), and 'Normal Progressor' patients who progress at a relatively slower rate. The former population represents a more aggressive and heterogeneous form of disease with patients at higher risk of death (significantly shorter median survival time) or tracheostomy [Kimura, 2006].

Kimura and colleagues have proposed that progression of the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score (i.e. the rate of change in ALSFRS-R score prior to treatment initiation expressed in points per unit of time) provides a prognostic measure of ALS [Kimura, 2006]. ALSFRS-R is a clinical marker of disease burden with a score of zero representing the worst outcome and a score of 48 the least serious outcome. Briefly, ALSFRS-R is a score from 0-48 assessing disability. The ALSFRS-R includes 12 questions, each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = cannot do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 48=best. ALSFRS-R scores correlate significantly with quality of life as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile, indicating that the quality of function is a strong determinant of quality of life in ALS [Cedarbaum, 1999].

In order to determine at diagnosis slowest and fastest progressors, Kimura [2006] suggests the use of progression rate (ΔFS) calculated as: ΔFS =[48-score ALSFRS-R at diagnosis] / [date of onset- date of diagnosis].

Because at time of diagnosis the ALSFRS-R score was not available, the Applicant convened experts to propose a method to estimate progression, which has been to distinguish at randomization 'Normal Progressors' and 'Fast Progressors' relating 'Progression of ALSFRS-R score before randomization (point/month)' (thereafter called ΔFS 𝑟𝑟 ) calculated in the following way: ΔFS 𝑟𝑟 =[48 (ALSFRS-R score at date of first symptom supposed to be 48) - score ALSFRS-R at baseline] / [date of randomization date of first symptom]. This best estimator of progression, supposed to be similar to the published estimator ΔFS, would be a strong predictor of 'Normal Progressor' and 'Fast Progressor' patient status at the time of randomization. To differentiate 'Fast Progressors' and 'Normal Progressors', a cut for ΔFS 𝑟𝑟 between 1.0 (as for ΔFS) and 1.2 was suggested. Consequently, 'Fast Progressors' were defined as ALS patients whose ΔFS 𝑟𝑟 is more than or equal to 1.1 points per month.

Hence, for study AB10015 two distinct ALS patient populations have been defined. The population of 'Normal Progressors' is defined as ALS patients whose progression of ALSFRS-R score before randomization is less than 1.1 points per month. The population of 'Fast Progressors' is defined as ALS patients whose progression of ALSFRS-R score before randomization is more than or equal to 1.1 points per month.

## 2.5.1.1. Methods

## · Study participants

At the time of the interim analysis a total of 192 patients diagnosed with a laboratory supported, clinically \"probable\" or \"definite\" ALS according to the El Escorial criteria were randomized. The 'Normal Progressor' population included 161 randomized patients: 53 patients in the 4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib treatment-arm, 54 patients in the 3 mg/kg/day masitinib treatment-arm and 54 patients in the placebo arm. The 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population included 192 randomized patients: 64 patients in the 4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib treatment-arm, 63 patients in the 3 mg/kg/day masitinib treatment-arm and 65 patients in the placebo arm.

At the time of the final analysis with a cut-off date 05 December 2016 a total of 394 patients were randomized in one of the three treatment groups:

- 133 patients received placebo + riluzole, including 114 Normal Progressors
- 130 patients received masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole, including 106 Normal Progressors
- 131 patients received masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day + riluzole, including 110 Normal Progressors

## · Treatments

Patients were to be enrolled into one of three groups as per study synopsis:

- Group 1: patients on masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day and riluzole
- Group 2: patients on masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day and riluzole
- Group 3: patients on placebo and riluzole

Subjects enrolled were to receive a total daily dose of 4.5 or 3 mg/kg masitinib, or a matching placebo, to be taken during meals.

Masitinib or placebo were administered orally in two daily doses over 48 weeks with a possibility of doubleblind extension period.

The randomization procedures included a minimization process aimed at reducing any difference in the distribution of these stratification factors:

- ALS patient populations ('Normal Progressor' (progression before randomization&lt;1.1) versus 'Fast Progressor' (progression before randomization≥1.1).
- Progression of ALS functional rating scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) score (point/month) from date of first symptom to baseline (ALSFRS-R score at date of first symptom supposed to be 48), Balanced between treatment groups in each of ALS patient populations 'Normal Progressor' and 'Fast Progressor'.
- Site of onset (bulbar versus other).
- ALSFRS-R score at baseline.
- Age at baseline.
- Region (North America and West Europe versus Eastern Europe versus Other Countries).

An interim analysis was pre-planned in AB10015 study protocol, with 50% of randomized patients potentially having reached the 48-week time point.

## · Sample size

The objective of the study was to compare each 'masitinib + riluzole' group (ie. 3 mg/kg/day masitinib + riluzole and 4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib + riluzole) to 'placebo + riluzole' group. Therefore sample size was calculated in a 1:1 randomisation ratio for the comparison of each masitinib group to the placebo group making the same hypothesis for each masitinib group.

Sample size calculation is based on absolute change from baseline to Week 48 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis functional rating scale Revised (ALSFRS-R).

## Primary analysis:

ALSFRS-R change from baseline to W48 is supposed to be higher in 'Normal progressors + faster progressors' population (with a standard deviation equal to 9) than in 'Normal progressors' population (with a standard deviation equal to 7.5) notably because patients have more tracheotomy and death in 'Normal progressors + faster progressors' than in 'Normal progressors' population.

Primary analysis was to be performed using an ANCOVA model.

## 'Normal progressors' population

An ancova model on the ALSFRS-R change from baseline to week 48 is used with the following hypotheses:

- Alpha set to 5% 2-sided test
- Power set to 80%
- Difference in mean change of ALSFRS-R between placebo group and masitinib group equal to 3.3
- Standard deviation of the change from baseline to W48 from all groups equal to 7.5
- Effect size = 0.44
- Allocation ratio : 1:1
- One interim analysis planned at around 50% of information fraction
- Pocock alpha spending method approximated with Hwang, Shih and DeCani class alpha spendingfunction.

## Comparison of the '4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib + riluzole' group to the 'placebo + riluzole' group:

With the hypotheses described above, 186 evaluable patients (93 patients treated in 4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib group/ 93 patients treated with placebo) are necessary to detect a 3.3(+/-7.5) point difference between 4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib group and placebo group with a power of 80% and a type-I error of 5%.

## Comparison of the '3 mg/kg/day masitinib + riluzole' group to the 'placebo + riluzole' group:

Same calculation as for the comparison of the '4.5 mg/kg/day masitinib + riluzole' group to the 'placebo + riluzole' group.

Taking into account around 5% of non evaluable patients, 300 patients defined as 'normal progressors' (100 in each masitinib group and 100 treated in placebo group) are enough to detect a 3.3(+/-7.5) point difference between groups (each of the masitinib groups vs placebo group) in order to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level for a two-sided test of 5% in 'normal progressor' population.

## 'Normal progressors + faster progressors' population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An ancova model on the ALSFRS-R change from baseline to week 48 is used with the following hypotheses:

- Alpha set to 5% 2-sided test
- Power set to 80%
- Mean change from baseline for placebo group equal to -11(from 38 to 27)
- Mean change from baseline for masitinib groups equal to -7.7(from 38 to 30.3)
- Difference in mean change of ALSFRS-R between placebo group and masitinib group equal to 3.3
- Standard deviation of the change from baseline to W48 from all groups equal to 9
- Effect size = 0.36
- Allocation ratio : 1:1

354 patients (118 in each masitinib group and 118 in placebo group) should be included to detect a 3.3(+/9) point difference between groups (each of the masitinib groups vs placebo group) in order to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level for a two-sided test of 5%.

Taking into account around 5% of non evaluable patient, 381 patients (127 in each masitinib group and 127 in placebo group) should be included to detect a 3.3(+/-9) point difference between groups (each of the masitinib groups vs placebo group) in order to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level for a twosided test of 5%.

## · Randomisation

Randomisation was performed with a minimization algorithm on:

- ALS patients population ('Normal progressors'(progression before randomization&lt;1.1) VS 'Faster progressors' (progression before randomization&gt;=1.1))
- Progression of ALSFRS-R score (point/month) from date of first symptom to baseline (ALSFRSRscore at date of first symptom supposed to be 48) , Balanced between treatment groups in each of ALS patients population 'Normal progressors' and 'Faster progressors'
- Site of onset (Bulbar vs Others)
- ALSFRS-R score at baseline
- Age at baseline
- Region (North America and West Europe versus Est Europe versus Other Countries)
- Blinding (masking)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This study was a double-blind study.

The investigator was provided with technical options and password information to selectively break the code for an individual patient by telephone, facsimile transmission, or through electronic message transfers.

The premature breaking of the code had to be confined to emergency cases in which knowledge of the administered drug is necessary for adequate treatment. Whenever possible, the sponsor should be contacted before breaking the blinded emergency code. Should any code be broken, the respective patient was withdrawn from further participation in the study and a written explanation had to be given by the investigator; the sponsor must be notified immediately.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Statistical methods

## Primary analysis:

Primary analysis was to be performed in mITT 'Normal progressors' population.

This analysis was to be done on patients randomized at an initial masitinib dose of 4.5mg/kg/day (Group 1) versus placebo patients (Group 3) at a 5% alpha-level. Missing values of ALSFRS-R at study visit were to be replaced based on the Modified Last Observation Carried Forward (mLOCF) method.

mLOCF is defined as follows :

- Case 1: discontinuation before week 48 for toxicity, lack of efficacy, or unknown reason

In this case, missing data will be imputed with the LOCF method.

- Case 2: discontinuation before week 48 for a documented reason excluding toxicity or lack of efficacy

In this case, non observed values can be considered as Missing At Random (MAR), and no imputationwill be done (Observed Cases).

- Case 3: death for related disease progression before W48:

If patient was treated when he died, score ALSFRS-R is replaced by 0

Absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R will be estimated using a model of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted on following factors: treatment (masitinib/placebo), and stratification criteria:

- ALS patients population ('Normal progressors'(progression before randomization&lt;1.1) VS

'Faster progressors' (progression before randomization&gt;=1.1)) *

*only for analysis in 'Normal progressors + faster progressors' population

- Progression of ALSFRS-R score (point/month) from date of first symptom to baseline (ALSFRSRscore at date of first symptom supposed to be 48)
- ALS patients population ('Normal progressors'(progression before randomization&lt;1.1) VS
- 'Faster progressors' (progression before randomization&gt;=1.1))
- ALSFRS-R score at baseline
- Site of onset (Bulbar vs Others)
- Age at baseline
- Region (North America and West Europe versus Est Europe versus Other Countries)

Two sided 95% confidence interval of the difference of mean change from baseline to week 48 between groups will be provided.

Of note, the mLOCF is not considered a conservative analysis in ALS, where patients usually progress quickly, even the nominated normal progressors.

One of the remarked issues in GCP inspection was the fact that similar reasons for withdrawal were registered differently, thus leading to different imputations in the final analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary analysis uses a rerandomization test.

Re-randomization test, also called randomization test involves the reshuffling of observed data and computing the test statistic (in this case test associated with the treatment effect estimate in analysis of covariance model), with the following conditions:

- Re-running of the minimization algorithm in order to assign a treatment group for each randomized patient

- Maintenance of the real order (=observed) of arrival of the patients (e.g. patient 00101 randomized in first)

- Maintenance of the hazard set for minimization algorithm (20% in hazard in study AB10015)
- Maintenance of the ALSFRS-R score at each visit for the statistical analysis

Step 1: Model of analysis of covariance described above will be performed on observed data, and test statistic will be provided along with p-value.

Step 2: The minimization algorithm will be run to obtain a new 'randomization list' (assignment of each patient to a treatment group) for the population of randomized patients (ITT). For the population of interest (mITT), the analysis of covariance model will be computed at each rerandomization.

This step (rerandomization and computation of the test statistic) will be performed 10,000 times, to obtain 10, 000 replicate datasets.

Step 3: The proportion of replicates for which the p-value of treatment factor is at least as small as the pvalue of treatment factor from the original data will be calculated. In this proportion the observed p-value of treatment factor will be also accounted for one replicate in numerator and denominator.

That proportion is the p-value for the randomization test.

The hypothesis of no treatment difference will be rejected at the 5% level of significance if the observed test statistic falls outside the middle 95% of the observed distribution of the resampled statistic. This step determines how often the resampled statistic of interest is as extreme as the observed value of the same statistic.

## Sensitivity Analysis

1. Absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R will be estimated using a model of analysis ofcovariance (ANCOVA) adjusted on following factors: treatment (masitinib/placebo) and stratificationcriteria (no re-randomization test).

2.Multivariate sensitivity analysis:

## Futility analysis

For each dose group (3mg /kg/day and 4.5mg/kg/day) and each population ('Normal progressors' and 'Normal progressors + faster progressors'), the IDMC will review the different efficacy criteria about 48 weeks after the [60th - 75th] patient randomized.

In case of lack of efficacy, the IDMC will recommend the discontinuation of the dose group for futility reason. The futility boundary will be based on conditional power.

Study could be considered as non futile for a dose group (3mg /kg/day or 4.5mg/kg/day) if:

- Conditional power is less than a prespecified threshold for 'Normal progressors' population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OR

- Conditional power is less than a prespecified threshold for 'Normal progressors + faster progressors'population

Full details will be prespecified in the interim statistical analysis plan (iSAP).

## Interim analysis

One interim analysis was planned for this study with around 50% of patients randomized.

Interim analysis performed in 'Normal progressors' population.

The efficacy criteria will be tested at a significance level determined with the Pocock alpha spending method, approximated by the following Hwang-Shi-Decani function:

with a global alpha level set to 5%, a gamma parameter equal to +1, and the information fraction t defined as the proportion of evaluable patients at the time of analysis.

For each of the two planned analysis (interim and final), the significance levels to be used for rejecting the null hypotheses will be directly derived from the above cumulative alpha spending function so that the type I error would be controlled at the level.

The interim analyses was to be performed without any unblinding for the sponsor. An independent CRO was mandated by AB Science to perform the analysis. The results were sent directly to the IDMC members. The IDMC had to recommend to stop or continue the study. If the size of treatment effect seems lower than expected but still clinically relevant, the IDMC were able to recommend a Sample Size Reestimation (SSR), respecting an upper limit for the increase of 100% of the initial sample size, and will communicate it directly to the CRO in charge of Interactive Randomization System.

## Control of overall familly-wise type I error at the study level

To control overall family-wise type I error rate at the study level, analyses of efficacy will be conducted in a stepwise manner (fixed sequence method) to control the global family-wise error rate at the level.

## Safety Analysis

Based on the occurrence of AEs in each group of masitinib (3mg or 4.5mg) or other clinically significant safety evaluations, it was to be decided which dose of masitinib had the best risk/benefit ratio to conclude for further studies.

## Prior medical history

Prior medical history of ALS patients included in study AB10015 was comparable between the 2 populations. The percentage of patients with at least one medical history was 91.9% in the 'Normal Progressor' population, versus 92.1% in the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population.

## Exposure.

In the 'Normal Progressor' population 105 patients received masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, 110 patients received masitinib at a dose of 3  mg/kg/day, and 114 patients received placebo. The mean treatment duration was 9.5 months (ranging from

0.3 to 11.7 months) in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm, 9.1 months (ranging from 0.7 to 12.8 months) in  the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, and 9.8 months (ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 months) in the placebo arm.

In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population 129 patients received masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, 131 patients received masitinib at a dose of 3  mg/kg/day, and 133 patients received placebo. The mean treatment duration was 9.1 months (ranging from 0.3 to 11.7 months) in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm, 9.0 months (ranging from 0.7 to 12.8 months) in  the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, and 9.6 months (ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 months) in the placebo arm.

## · Numbers analysed

## ANALYSIS DATASETS

## Intention-To-Treat (ITT) dataset

The ITT population was defined as all randomised patients with probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, whether they have received the study treatment or not. Patients were classified according to the treatment arm to which they have been randomised, irrespective of the actual treatment received.

The actual number of patients in the final analysis ITT population was 394 patients, including 330 'Normal Progressor' patients and 290 'modified Normal Progressor' patients.

## Modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) dataset

The mITT (modified Intent-To-Treat) population included all ITT patients with at least  one  post  baseline efficacy  assessment  who  took  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  (masitinib/placebo).  The  actual number  of  patients  in  the  final  analysis  mITT  population  was  391  patients,  including  328 'Normal Progressor' patients and 288 'modified Normal Progressor' patients.

## Per Protocol (PP) dataset

The PP population consisted of all patients of the mITT population without any major protocol  deviation. This was the set of patients who participated in the study as intended. Patients terminating the  study prematurely were included  in the  PP  population  provided that  there  was  no  protocol  deviation.  Before locking  the  data  base,  the  precise  reasons  for  excluding  patients  from  the  PP  population  were fully defined  and  documented  by  Data  Review  Committee.  This  population  was  used  for  certain  sensitivity analyses.

Protocol deviations are defined as:

- inclusion and non-inclusion criteria were not met
- intake of forbidden medication
- non-respect of visit dates
- missing value for main criterion without premature termination
- non-respect of protocol design
- any other deviations during the course of the study

## Safety population

The safety population consists of all patients randomized and who took at least one dose of study medication (masitinib or placebo).

## PRIMARY EFFICACY EVALUATION ON (ALSFRS-R)

The primary analysis was to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment-arms of masitinib + riluzole and placebo + riluzole on the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In accordance with the fixed sequence method to control the global family-wise error rate, the first step was to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole versus placebo + riluzole on ALSFRS-R after a 48 week treatment period in the Normal Progressor population.

Missing values of ALSFRS-R were replaced based on the mLOCF method. Sensitivity analyses were carried out based on the reasons for discontinuation and on multiple imputation.

## · Outcomes and estimation

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  modified  Intention-to-Treat  (mITT)  population, which included all randomised patients with at least one post baseline efficacy assessment who took at  least one dose of study treatment (masitinib/placebo). The  actual  number  of  patients  in  the  final analysis  mITT  population  was  391  patients,  including  328 'Normal  Progressor'  patients  and  288 'modified Normal Progressor' patients.

Efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  in  a  stepwise  manner  (fixed  sequence  method)  to  control  the  global family-wise error rate at the 0.05 level for the primary analysis.

The  primary  analysis was  performed  first in  the  'Normal  Progressor' population, testing patients randomized at an initial masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day (Group 1) versus placebo patients (Group 3).

If  the  analysis is conclusive  at  a  0.05  significance  level, then the  primary analysis  was performed in the 'Normal  Progressor'  population,  testing  patients  randomized  at  an  initial  masitinib  dose  of  3  mg/kg/day (Group 2) versus placebo patients (Group 3).

If  this  analysis  was  conclusive,  then  the  same  sequence  was  repeated,  but  in  the  'Normal  +  Fast Progressor' population.

The cut-off date for the efficacy analysis is 15 December 2016.

Demographics of patients in the Normal + Fast Progressor population are displayed in the Table 18 below.

## Results for masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day - Normal Progressor

## PRIMARY EFFICACY EVALUATION ON (ALSFRS-R)

The primary analysis was to test a statistically significant difference between the treatment-arms of masitinib + riluzole and placebo + riluzole on the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R).  In accordance with the fixed sequence method to control the global family-wise error rate, the first step was  to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole  versus  placebo  +  riluzole  on  ALSFRS-R  after  a  48  week  treatment  period  in the  Normal  Progressor  population. Missing  values  of  ALSFRS-R  were  replaced  based  on  the  mLOCF method.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  carried out based on the reasons for discontinuation and on single imputation. The Table 19 below summarizes  the datasets for the primary and sensitivity analyses on ALSFRS-R absolute change from baseline to week  48.

- -The first  sensitivity  analysis  (  Rule  2)  was  based  on  the  mLOCF  method  for  imputation  of  missing data in case of premature discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, toxicity, and withdrawal of consentrelated  to  study  procedures.  No  imputation  (Observed  Cases) was  done  for  other  causes  of discontinuation.  A  statistically  significant  difference  in  terms  of  ALSFRS-R  was  observed  between masitinib and placebo treatment-arms (Difference of means = 3.28, p-value=0.0190).
- -The second sensitivity analysis (Rule 3) was based on the mLOCF method for imputation of missing data in case of premature discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, toxicity, and withdrawal of consentrelated to any  travel issue.  No  imputation  (Observed  Cases) was  done  for  other causes  of discontinuation.  A  statistically  significant  difference  in  terms  of  ALSFRS-R  was  observed  between masitinib and placebo treatment-arms (Difference of means = 3.06, p-value=0.0248).

## SENSITIVITY    ANALYSES    BASED    ON    SINGLE    IMPUTATION    FOR    MASITINIB 4.5MG/KG/DAY IN THE NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION

Another sensitivity analysis was used to calculate differently the ALSFRS-R. Absolute change  from  baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R was estimated using two different single imputation analyses to deal  with missing data.

- -Imputation was done by clustering of 'similar patients' by Site of Onset at baseline, Region and treatment group and then using the average increment within group.
- -Imputation was done by clustering of 'similar patients' by Site of Onset at baseline, Region and treatment group and imputation using mean increment within group + penalty of 50% to those patients who discontinued early due to lack of efficacy.

The result of these sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint is presented in the Table 22 below.

Overall, the benefit remained significant when using the single imputation model (p-value ranging from 0.0176 to 0.0182).

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS BASED ON TIPPING ANALYSIS FOR MASITINIB 4.5 MG/KG/DAY IN NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION (POST-HOC ANALYSIS NOT DETAILED IN THE SAP)

Since it is difficult to check the validity of the assumption of missing at random (MAR), some sensitivity analyses need to be performed assuming some missing data is NMAR. The tipping point analysis is introduced to assess how severe departures from MAR must be in order to overturn conclusions from the primary analysis.

The following methods were used as tipping point analyses:

It is assumed that the patients who discontinue in the treatment arm (Masitinib 4.5) perform worse than those in the Placebo arm. So the imputed values will be shifted by a certain additive shift.

The formula is:   P-&gt; P

M-&gt;  P+ (M-P) x (1-penalty)

So, if penalty is 100% i.e. 1 then M = P and if penalty is 0% then M = M

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSES FOR MASITINIB 4.5 MG/KG/DAY IN THE MODIFIED NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION

The sensitivity analyses were reproduced on the modified Normal progressor population (progression of &lt; 0.8 points per month) to account for the uncertainty in the date of presentation of the first symptoms.  The result of these sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint is presented in the table below.

Overall, the benefit was increased when considering patient with lower disease progression at baseline. A statistically  significant  difference  in  terms  of  ALSFRS-R  was  observed  between  masitinib  and  placebo treatment-arms (Difference of means ranging from 3.07 to 3.50).

In the Normal progressor population, median PFS was increased by 4 months with masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day)  as  compared  with  placebo  treatment-arms,  and  this  improvement  was  significant  (pvalue=0.0159), corresponding to a 25% increase. Of note, the number of patients that have withdrawn from masitinib 4.5 mg arm was higher, and many in the beginning of the study. With the loss to follow up, the patients likely to remain in study were the more resistant.

## QUALITY OF LIFE

Results of secondary analysis based on ALSAQ-40 are presented in the Table 24 below.

A statistically significant  difference  was  observed between masitinib  (P=0.0078) and placebo treatmentarms in the Quality of life for the Normal Progressor population  (improvement between 42% and 46%). Of note, the number of patients that have withdrawn from masitinib 4.5 mg arm was higher, and many in the beginning of the study. With the mLOCF imputation, the patients which were withdrawn from the study were assigned a better ALSAQ40 score than the ones who complete the study.

## FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) FOR MASITINIB 4.5 MG/KG/DAY IN THE NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION

Absolute  change  from  baseline  to  week  48  in  FVC  between  masitinib  4.5  mg/kg/day  and  placebo  in Normal Progressors is presented in the Table 25 below.

A statistically significant difference was observed between masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day) and placebo treatment-arms  in  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  to  week  48  in  FVC  for  the  Normal  Progressor population (improvement between 25% and 29%).

## COMBINED ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTION AND SURVIVAL (CAFS) FOR MASITINIB 4.5 MG/KG/DAY IN THE NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION

Results of secondary analysis based on CAFS is presented in the Table 26 below.

A  non-statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  between  masitinib  (4.5  mg/kg/day)  and  placebo treatment-arms  in  the  CAFS  score  for  the  Normal  Progressor  population  (difference  =  8.91,  pvalue=0.2626). The CAFS, which translates withdrawing patients into severed patients, and thus more conservative than mLOCF, did not reach statistical difference.

## OVERALL SURVIVAL FOR MASITINIB 4.5 MG/KG/DAY IN THE NORMAL PROGRESSOR POPULATION

There was no benefit on survival with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo in the Normal progressor population.

## RESULTS FOR MASITINIB 3 MG/KG/DAY - 'NORMAL PROGRESSOR' POPULATION

## PRIMARY EFFICACY EVALUATION ON (ALSFRS-R)

Because analysis was conclusive at a 0.05 significance level for the first step of the fixed sequence method, it was permissible to move onto the next, second step of the sequence. Hence, the primary analysis was performed in the 'Normal Progressor' population, to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between masitinib at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day + riluzole versus placebo + riluzole on ALSFRS-R after a 48 week treatment period.

The Table 28 below summarizes the datasets for the primary and sensitivity analyses on ALSFRS-R absolute change from baseline to week 48.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The development program of masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was based on the pivotal phase 2/3 study (Study AB10015): A prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups, phase 2/3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib versus placebo in the treatment of patients suffering from ALS.

In the pivotal trial patients were randomly allocated to one of the three following groups: Group 1: masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole; Group 2: masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day + riluzole; Group 3: placebo of masitinib + riluzole. Patients received treatment for 48 weeks, with possible extension.

The design of study AB10015 compares masitinib in combination with riluzole and in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments against placebo in combination with riluzole and in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments. There was no restriction placed on the investigator's choice of standard of care symptomatic treatments (e.g., physical therapy, surgical interventions, and alternative therapies). The patient population included mild to moderate ALS patients, with few co-morbidities and comedications, and excluded patients on gastrostomy.

The primary analysis was performed on the subset of 'normal progressor' patients randomized at an initial masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day versus placebo patients. The decision to target 'normal progressors' for the primary analysis and the choice of mLOCF as the imputation method of choice was made in the third protocol amendment after the study had started. The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R. The results of the primary analysis (as per Clinical Study Report AB10015 v 1.0 dated 11AUG2017) are reported below:

Progression free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS), ALSAQ-40, Forced vital capacity (FVC) and Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) were pre-specified secondary endpoints. Results are presented below (as per Clinical Study Report AB10015 v 1.0 dated 11 AUG 2017).

Of note, as per definition criteria of PFS, patients who have withdrawn and not reached progression (death or increase of 10 points or more in ALSFRS-R) are not included in the analysis. Patients withdrawing due to adverse events in the first 6 to 9 months favour PFS results in the arm.

The CHMP expressed serious concerns about the conduct of the trial, the applied methodology and the robustness of the data used to support the claim for efficacy for masitinib in ALS. As discussed, the mLOCF approach to missing data handling tends to favour the active treatment arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first major concern on the conduct is related to the fact that the findings of the triggered inspection of two sites that were major enrollers, contributing to over 40% of the recruitment in the study, posed strong doubts on the data integrity.  The inspection findings were considered to have a negative impact on data reliability. Inspectors presented to the CHMP their opinion that the data obtained at the sites inspected and represented in the CSR were not trustworthy enough to support the application authorisation submitted to the Agency for masitinib.

The trial went through a number of significant protocol amendments, and for the CHMP the reasoning and drivers for some of those remain unclear. A significant change was that the target population for the primary analysis of the trial was changed from the wider ALS population initially included, to a restricted 'normal progressor' population. Others amendments included multiple changes to the planned statistical analysis and the sequence of testing to handle the multiple dose groups.  The presence of multiple major amendments made after the start of the study in a single pivotal trial is of concern

Apart from the concerns about the trial conduct, there were also issues related to the methodology for data acquisition. Although it is recognized that ALS represents an area with a severe unmet medical need, where in principle a single pivotal trial could be sufficient for a marketing authorization application following  the requirements of the EMA guideline

(http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en\\_GB/document\\_library/Scientific\\_guideline/2009/09/WC500003657.pdf ), and applying appropriate scientifically justified methodology, , the presented development programme suffers from significant deficiencies. The population in a confirmatory trial should represent the population indicated for treatment. In a confirmatory trial, and especially in a scenario with a single pivotal trial, surrogate endpoints could be accepted if they have been validated, and when their translation into clinical endpoints is undisputable.

The most relevant concern raised by the CHMP in relation to the analytical approach was the methodology used for dealing with missing data. It was noted that there were a significant number of dropouts in the trial, and the reasons for dropping out differedt significantly between patients on active treatment and placebo, with more patients discontinuing due to lack of efficacy / adverse events on the active treatment arms. The primary and most of the so-called sensitivity analyses excluded some patients and employed LOCF to impute endpoint values for others.  Exclusion of patients from analysis in a progressive disease like ALS, with the use of LOCF as imputation method introduces significant bias that may seriously overestimate the effects of the active treatment vs placebo.  Other sensitivity analyses include all patients but impute within treatment-group based on observed responses.  This is also a potential source of bias since patients remaining in the study are a selected subgroup of those initially randomised. The use of patients remaining on treatment to impute values for those who have discontinued treatment is also questionable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The definition of the term 'normal progressor' is subject of discussion in the ALS field: being a retrospective concept requiring long previous follow-up, does not represent clinical practice and would affect negatively the possibility to extrapolate the observed findings on the broad ALS population. Although this retrospective version of ALSFRS-R has been published, it should rely on previous top quality clinical records. The quality of past clinical records could not be confirmed on the inspected study centres. The modification of the primary endpoint with the trial ongoing raised additional concerns related to the validity of approach to prove efficacy of the compound in this condition. There was no scientific justification based on the suspected mechanism of action for masitinib that would justify such a dichotomisation of the ALS population. This becomes even more relevant as the primary endpoint on the 'normal progressor' population is not followed by clinically significant results in the secondary endpoints, particularly those more robust such as overall survival, ALSAQ40, CAFS or FVC. Of note, for the \"normal + fast progressor\" population the absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R between masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and placebo is 2.09 [-0.55;4.73], not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.1202). In addition, the lack of specific criteria to classify withdrawing patients led to similar reasons for discontinuation being classed and analysed differently.

Unfortunately, muscle strength has not been studied to potentially corroborate masitinib's effect on muscle power. The lack of data on muscle strength combined with the fact that OS and time to tracheostomy have not shown benefits, increases the level of uncertainty about the claimed efficacy of masitinib. In spite of the claim being disease modification rather than symptomatic effect, a slowness of muscle strength decrease would be present under an efficacious disease modifying agent, and therefore a difference between active treatment and placebo should be apparent by week 48.

Additionally, some further limitations remain:

- Three study centres from two countries have enrolled 48% of the trial sample, thus making study external validity lower; The Applicant considered that the EU countries which refused the trial forced the sponsor strategy to restrict centres and involved countries, but this does not increase study validity and reinforces the concerns.

- ALSFRS R score at baseline and at wk48 varied significantly from study centre to study centre. The Applicant justified the asymmetries of enrolment in centres with the number of citizens per country. This cannot be acceptable since these centres are not unique in the country and are not the single ALS specialized centres in the country. Final data analysis showed less variability among recruiting centres - as far as study population baseline characteristics are concerned, than what was observed in the interim analysis where the initial and fast study centres enrolled a more heterogeneous population.

- The efficacy results of the patients allocated to 3mg/kg/day of masitinib were not initially analysed. Upon request the MAA performed a partial analysis. The 3mg/kg/day arm data show that there is a smaller trend of effect in 'normal progressors' than the 4.5 mg dose. Like the 4.5 mg dose, most endpoints did not reach statistical significance and even less clinical significance. Similar to the 4.5 mg dose, the 3.0 mg dose did not show a difference from placebo on the QoL parameter. There is a reference that the safety profile was similar to the placebo arm, but no further data were explored.

In summary, a clear chain of evidence has not been created, providing supportive data in a logical stepwise manner, starting with a clear pre-clinical proof-of-principle, moving into a justified dose- selection strategy and proof-of-concept, before finally generating sufficient confirmatory data from a properly designed clinical programme. The efficacy data provided are insufficient to justify a positive benefit/risk profile of masitinib in ALS.

## Additional discussion in the context of a conditional MA

The Applicant applied for conditional Marketing authorisation (CMA), basing the claim for positive B/R balance on the results from the interim analysis. As described above, these were not considered comprehensive and compelling. As a condition of the CMA the Applicant initially proposed the final results from the pivotal study to be presented, and claimed that should CHMP be requesting a second study as a condition, the granting of a conditional marketing authorization would not affect the ability to complete this second study in a timely manner. The CHMP disagreed with the proposed strategy despite agreeing with the claim for an unmet medical need in ALS. For the Committee, the available data, from both interim and final analyses were not sufficient to establish a positive B/R for Alsitek in ALS, thus failing to fulfil condition 1 of Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, and not allowing a CMA to be granted.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

While CPMP/EWP/2330/99 indicates that a single pivotal study can be an acceptable basis for licensing where certain prerequisites are met, data from the single pivotal trial of Alsitek are not adequate to establish efficacy.  Study AB10015 does not meet the criteria concerning data quality and absence of indications of potential bias. Multiple crucial protocol amendments have been implemented during the course of the study. Thus, a reliable estimate of efficacy has not been presented.

129 patients received masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, 131 patients received masitinib at a dose of 3  mg/kg/day, and 133 patients received placebo. The mean treatment duration was 9.1 months (ranging from

0.3 to 11.7 months) in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm, 9.0 months (ranging from 0.7 to 12.8 months) in  the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, and 9.6 months (ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 months) in the placebo arm.

## Adverse events

During the protocol period, the frequency of AEs was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was comparable with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as  compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs was 87.6% and 84.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as  compared with 78.1% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +9.5% and +6.5%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs was 88.4% and 84.7% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively,  as compared with 78.9% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +9.4% and +5.8%, respectively).

The frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was increased with masitinib 4.5 and 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was higher with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day than with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was 63.8% and 45.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0  mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 28.1% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +35.7% and +17.4%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was 60.5% and 45.0% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 27.1% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +33.4% and +18.0%, respectively).

The acquisition of data related to adverse events and adequate narratives was not of very good quality. This has impaired the discrimination between disease and masitinib related AEs. This is also relevant in 'AEs leading to death', where no audit on these cases has been performed shortly after the event, to obtain data that otherwise has been lost henceforth.

During the extension period, the frequency of AEs was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was comparable with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs was 65.2% and 54.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as  compared with 55.4% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +9.7% and -0.5%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs was 63.0% and 52.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively,  as compared with 51.3% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +11.8% and +1.3%, respectively).

The frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was 10.6% and 8.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0  mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 1.4% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +9.3% and +7.1%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable AEs was 11% and 7.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0  mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 1.3% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +9.7% and +6.3%, respectively).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Adverse events were recorded until 28 days after treatment interruption, and adverse events not resolved at the death of the patients were recorded as adverse events leading to death. Given the severity of the condition, several AEs in each treatment-arm were therefore recorded as adverse events leading to death. However, none of these adverse events were considered to be related to either masitinib or Riluzole as per MAH conclusions.

Considering that ALS is a rapidly progressing disease with fatal outcome, where each patient can suffer from very diiferent progression, the analysis of AEs leading to death during the first 48 weeks will provide a more homogeneous pool and is therefore more instructive to analyse the mortality.

During the first 48 week period, the frequency of adverse events leading to death was slightly lower with masitinib 4.5 as compared with masitinib 3.0 mg/Kg/day or placebo, regardless of the population, and the difference was not statistically significant.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs leading to death was 2.9% and 7.3% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day,  respectively, as compared with 7.0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = -4.2%% and +0.3%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of SAEs was 7.8% and 8.4% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively,  as compared with 9.0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = -1.3% and -0.6%, respectively).

During the protocol period, the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) (any causality) was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of SAEs was 27.6% and 20.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as  compared with 16.7% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +11.0% and +4.2%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of SAEs was 31% and 22.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively,  as compared with 18% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +13% and +4.9%, respectively).

Likewise, the frequency of suspected or not assessable SAEs was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable SAEs was 6.7% and 3.6% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0  mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0.9% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +5.8% and +2.8%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable SAEs was 7.0% and 3.8% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0.8% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +6.2% and +3.1%, respectively).

During the extension period, the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) (any causality) was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of SAEs was 21.2% and 14.1% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as  compared with 13.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +7.7% and +0.6%, respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of SAEs was 20.5 % and 13.8% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day,  respectively, as compared with 12.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +8.0% and +1.3%, respectively).

## SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS

The frequency of suspected or not assessable SAEs was similar with masitinib as compared with placebo, regardless of the dose and the population.

During the protocol period, the frequency of severe adverse events was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3  mg/kg/day as compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of severe AEs was 24.8% and 19.1% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively,  as compared with 14.0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +10.7% and +5.1%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of severe AEs was 29.5% and 22.1% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day,  respectively, as compared with 16.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +12.9% and +5.6%, respectively).

However, when considering the causality of severe AEs, the frequency of suspected or not assessable severe adverse events was only slightly increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable severe AEs was 4.8% and 0.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0  mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0.9% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +3.9% and +0%, respectively).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of suspected or not assessable severe AEs was 5.4% and 1.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5  and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0.8% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +4.7% and +0.8%, respectively).

It is not common to have not assessable causality in severe adverse events, when strong efforts should be made to impute causality.

## ADVERSE EVENTS MOST INCREASED WITH MASITINIB

The AEs most increased during the protocol period for masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day were rash maculo-papular, nausea, respiratory failure, oedema peripheral, iron deficiency anaemia, dyspnoea and anxiety. For masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day, oedema peripheral, diarrhoea, respiratory failure, and rash maculo-papular, albeit to a lesser extent. There was no increase in iron deficiency anaemia, dyspnoea and nausea at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Except for respiratory failure with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day, these AEs were not increased during the extension period.

## DEATHS

At the cut-off of 15 December 2016, there were 71 adverse events with fatal outcome reported in  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (ALS - study AB10015).

In ALS study (randomisation ratio 2:1), there were 54 fatal SAEs in masitinib arm and 17 fatal SAEs in  placebo arm, all of them considered as not related to study medication (masitinib/placebo) by both  investigator and sponsor. Seventeen (17) cases were reported with placebo arm and did not involve masitinib. Although acquired data possibly do not allow further causality conclusions, it is important to notice the asymmetry of deaths between masitinib treated patients (54 / 260 = 20.8%) and placebo patients (17/133 = 12.8%).

## Events of special interest

Upon CHMP request, the MAA has performed a specific analysis of events of special concern, namely fractures / osteoporosis / hypophosphatemia, anaemia, weight loss and nausea.

Bone fractures / osteoporosis / hypophosphatemia

## Frequency of bone fracture

The occurrence of bone fracture was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of bone fracture was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day but not with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of bone fracture was 6.7% and 3.6% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 3.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +3.2% and +0.1%, respectively). When considering the causality, none of the cases of bone fracture were considered as suspected or not assessable bone fracture. There were two cases of severe bone fracture with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day, both considered as suspected or not assessable. There were four cases of serious bone fracture with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day, and one with placebo, none considered as suspected or not assessable.

- Extension period (&gt;W48): During the extension period, the frequency of bone fracture was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of bone fracture was 7.0% and 3.8% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 3.8% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +3.2% and +0.0%, respectively). None of the cases were suspected or not assessable.

## Frequency of osteoporosis

The occurrence of osteoporosis was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of osteoporosis was not increased with masitinib. The frequency of osteoporosis was 0.0% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, as compared with 0.0% for placebo.

- Extension period (&gt;W48):During the extension period, there was one case of osteoporosis reported with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day. The frequency of osteoporosis was 0.0% and 1.3% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +0.0% and +1.3%, respectively). None of the cases were suspected or not assessable. When considering the causality, no case of osteoporosis was considered as suspected or not assessable osteoporosis.

## Frequency of hypophosphataemia

The occurrence of hypophosphataemia was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of hypophosphataemia was comparable between the treatment arms. The frequency of hypophosphataemia was 0.8% and 0.0% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 0% for placebo. The case of hypophosphataemia reported with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day was severe and was considered as suspected or not assessable. There was no case of serious hypophosphataemia.

- Extension period (&gt;W48): During the extension period, there was no case of hypophosphataemia.

## Impact of bone fracture on efficacy

There were very few patients with bone fracture, which make the interpretation difficult, especially given the variability in ALSFRS-S score. In patients with bone fracture, the deterioration in ALSFRS-R score was greater than in patients without bone fracture, suggesting a negative impact of this AE on functional score. In patients with bone fracture, there was a numerical disadvantage for masitinib in terms of change in ALSFRS-R score, except in the normal + faster progressor with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day where there was an advantage. This situation is however difficult to interpret due to the limited number of patients with bone fracture

## Anaemia

The occurrence of anemia was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of anemia was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and moderately increased with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of anemia was 15.5% and 6.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 3.0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +12.5% and +3.9%, respectively). Increase in anemia with masitinib as compared with placebo was primarily due to iron deficiency. When considering the causality, the frequency of anemia was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day, but not with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of suspected or not assessable anemia was 10.1% and 1.5% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 1.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +8.6% and +0.0%, respectively). There were two cases of severe anemia with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and two cases of severe anemia with 3.0 mg/kg/day. For one patient, the hemoglobin (Hb) count did not confirm Hb results&lt;8g/dL justifying grade severe. There were also two cases of anemia reported as SAEs, one with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and one with masitinib 3.0 mg/kg/day. In both case, the causality of masitinib was considered as not related or not assessable by the investigator. Two patients (1.6%) receiving masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day discontinued treatment due to severe anemia. The median time of occurrence of anemia ranged between 27 and 40 days in the masitinib treatment-arms, versus 37 days in the placebo arm.

- Extension period (&gt;W48): During the extension period, there was no increase in anemia with masitinib. The frequency of anemia was 3.0% and 2.8% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 2.7% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +0.3% and +0.1%, respectively). None of the cases were suspected or not assessable.

## Impact of anaemia on efficacy

In patients with aneamia, the deterioration in ALSFRS-R score was greater than in patients without aneamia, suggesting a negative impact of this AE on functional score.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight loss

The occurrence of weight loss was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of weight loss was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 and 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of weight loss was 10.9% and 9.9% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 6.8% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +4.1% and +3.1%, respectively). When considering the causality, the frequency of suspected or not assessable weight loss similar between the treatment arms. It was 0% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day as compared with 0.0% for placebo. There was no one case of severe weight loss with masitinib of 4.5 mg/kg/day and one with masitinib of 3 mg/kg/day, versus none with placebo. There were also two cases (1.6%) of weight loss reported as a SAE with masitinib of 4.5 mg/kg/day and 3 cases (2.3%) with masitinib of 3 mg/kg/day, versus one case (0.8%) with placebo. None of these SAEs were considered as suspected or not assessable. The cases of weight loss severe and serious reported in patients treated with masitinib (and placebo) were related to difficulty in eating due to disease progression. In almost all cases, the weight decrease was associated with a gastrostomy for nutritional support.

- Extension period (&gt;W48): During the extension period, the frequency of weight loss was 4.1% and 8.8%% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 5.0% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = -0.9% and +3.3%, respectively). One case with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day was severe. None of these cases were reported as serious AEs.

## Impact of weight loss on efficacy

In patients with weight loss, the deterioration in ALSFRS-R score was greater than in patients without weight loss, suggesting a negative impact of this AE on functional score.

## Nausea

The occurrence of nausea was comparable between the 'Normal Progressor' and 'Normal + Fast Progressor' populations. As such, analysis below is only provided for the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, which incorporates the greater number of patients.

- Protocol period (W0-W48 period): During the protocol period, the frequency of nausea was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and not with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of nausea was 11.6% and 6.1% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 4.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +7.1% and +1.6%, respectively). When considering the causality, the frequency of suspected or not assessable nausea was 8.5% and 4.6% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 2.3% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +6.2% and +2.3%, respectively). There was no case of severe nausea. There was also no case of nausea reported as a SAE. One patient receiving masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day discontinued treatment due to a moderate nausea.

- Extension period (&gt;W48): During the extension period, there was one case of nausea with masitinib 3.0 mg/kg/day.

Of all the events of special interest, nausea is highlighted among other factors affecting masitinib safety. Bone fractures, anaemia and weight loss apparently have an impact on efficacy as measured by ALSFRS-R.

- Biochemistry parameters not impacted with masitinib

Masitinib had no effect on albumin level, alkaline phosphatase level, calcium level, cholesterol level, creatinine level, Gamma GT level, glucose level, potassium level, sodium level, and triglycerides level.

## Abnormal blood cell counts

There were abnormal blood cell counts in Masitinib in ALS:

- Hemoglobin

Masitinib had a slight effect on hemoglobin count.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' patients tested for high abnormal hemoglobin level and with a normal level of hemoglobin at baseline, 50.0% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 30.0% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 26.6% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 1 as worst grade, and 3.2% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 3.3% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 3.1% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 2.

Among the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' patients tested for high abnormal leucocytes level and with a normal level of leucocytes at baseline, 26.6% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 15.9% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 10.8% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 1 as worst grade, and none in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm or 3.3% masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 1.5% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 2.

Among the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' patients tested for low abnormal leucocytes level and with a normal level of leucocytes at baseline, 27.0% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 16.4% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 11.3% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 1 as worst grade, and none in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm or 3.3% masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 1.6% in the placebo arm presented with a low level of grade 2.

## - Lymphocytes

Masitinib had a slight effect on lymphocytes count.

Among the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' patients tested for high abnormal lymphocytes level and with a normal level of lymphocytes at baseline, 17.5% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 22.6% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 7.7% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 1 as worst grade, and 14.3% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 8.1% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 6.2% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 2.

## - Neutrophils

Masitinib had a slight effect on neutrophil count.

Among the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' patients tested for low abnormal neutrophil level and with a normal level of neutrophil at baseline, 14.1% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 6.5% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 3.1% in the placebo arm presented with a high level of grade 1 as worst grade, and 1.6% in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm and 3.2% in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm versus 1.6% in the placebo arm presented with a low level of grade 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One grade 4 neutropenia was reported in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, but the case was however doubtful. The patient continued treatment and the AE was resolved under treatment.

As for platelets, masitinib had no effect on platelets count.

## Vital signs, Physical Findings and Other Observations Related to Safety

For vital signs analysis, only patients with normal values at baseline and having at least one value available post baseline  were  considered  as  patients  with  vital  sign  e.g.  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures  'normal  at baseline'. Patients with normal vital signs at baseline but without any value after baseline were excluded from the analysis.

## Analysis of systolic, diastolic blood pressure change and heart rate

Masitinib had no effect on systolic, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.

There was no assessment on weight loss or weight change during the trial, and how this might correlate with patient adverse events and response.

## Pregnant and breast-feeding women

There were no pregnant patients enrolled in any study across the clinical development of masitinib. However, 2 female patients became pregnant during treatment: One female patient in study AB06006 (Mastocytosis, patient 16202) discovered that she was pregnant about 1 month after the last intake of study treatment, however this patient was found to be administered the placebo. One female patient in study AB04010 (Mastocytosis, patient 1211)  became  pregnant  in  September  6,  2006  despite  hormonal  contraception.  On  September  24,  2006  an abortion  was  performed  and  study  drug  was  maintained.  It  is  not  well  established  whether  the  pregnancy  is related to the failure of the contraception methods used.

There were no reported cases of women breast-feeding in any masitinib-tested clinical trial.

## Renal impaired patient

In all masitinib-tested clinical trials, patients were considered to have renal impairment if the blood creatinine level was &gt; 120 μmol/L at baseline.

In  the  clinical  development  of  masitinib,  there  were  2  patient  exposed  to  masitinib  treatment  with  renal impairment. There were no renal impaired patients enrolled in the ALS phase 2/3 study.

There were no ALS patients exposed to masitinib with renal impairment. In non-oncology studies, there were 2 patients with renal impairment exposed to masitinib. Patients were considered to have renal impairment if their baseline blood creatinine was &gt; 120 μmol/L. Considering the small sample size, no relevant analysis of the data could be performed.

No independent study was conducted specifically in patients with renal disorders with masitinib.

## Hepatic impaired patient

No study was conducted specifically in patient with hepatic disorders with masitinib. However, the safety profile of masitinib was assessed in patients with and without hepatic disorders.

Patient was considered hepatic impaired if he has a baseline blood Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)&gt;126 IU/L, or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&gt;180 IU/L or Bilirubin&gt;25.65 μmol/L or Gamma-Glutamyl transferase (GGT&gt;) 150 IU/L.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were 7 'Normal + Fast Progressor' ALS patients (6 patients at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day and 1 patient at 3.0  mg/kg/day)  and  9  non-oncology  patients  (6  patients  at  a  dose  of  4.5  mg/kg/day  and  3  patient  at  3.0 mg/kg/day) exposed to masitinib with hepatic impairment. A comparative analysis on this patient population is provided hereafter. However, this analysis should be regarded as preliminary to identify possible trends in the data but not conclusive due to the small sample size.

In ALS patients, at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, a higher frequency of all AEs (100% vs 82.5%), SAEs (33.3% vs 21.1%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (33.3% vs 14.0%) were reported in patients with hepatic impairment compared  to  without  hepatic  impairment.  A  frequency  of  severe  AEs  was  higher  in  patients  without  hepatic impairment (16.7% vs 28.1%).

## Immunological events

The applicant has not performed a detailed analysis on immunological events.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No cases of drug-drug interactions were reported by investigators in study AB10015. Similarly, there were no cases of drug-drug interactions in all non-oncological studies.

To identify any risk related to drug interactions, several in vitro studies were conducted with masitinib mesilate (AB1010) in order to evaluate protein binding, hepatic metabolism and potential for drug-drug interactions. The results of these studies showed that:

- AB1010 had a high binding capacity to plasma protein in humans (93.93%).

- AB1010 was metabolized in several metabolites (MET 1 to MET 3) and AB3280 as major metabolite.

-  AB1010 was metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with a minor contribution of CYP2C8 (biotransformation ratio = 18.9% at 5 μM) and CYP2C8 was partly involved in the formation of AB3280 (AB3280 formation ratio = 7.0% at 5 μM).

- AB1010 was a weak to moderate inhibitor of the CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9, as well as CYP2D6 with IC50 values of 14, 20 and &gt; 30 μM, respectively. This inhibition was partly reversible.

-  AB1010  did  not  increase  the  activity  of  CYP3A4/5,  CYP2C9  and  2C19  but  slightly  increase  CYP1A2 activity. AB1010 did not affect the mRNA of CYPs 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5.

- At lower concentrations (&lt;10 μM), AB1010 appeared to be a substrate of P-gp mediated transport while at higher concentrations (≥10 μM), AB1010 appeared to be an inhibitor of P-gp mediated transport which is likely to be due to saturation of P-gp-mediated efflux.

- AB1010 was a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC50 not reached) and a slight inhibitor towards OATP1B3 (IC50 of 130 μM).

- AB1010 was found not to be an OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrate.
- AB1010 was a strong inhibitor of human BCRP with a calculated IC50 of 0.7 μM.

- AB1010 was an inhibitor of OCT2 (IC50 of 16.9 μM ± 2.1 μM) and a slight inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT2 (IC50 &gt;100 μM for both).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers (Study AB14004), there was a significant increase in exposure to masitinib in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with itraconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor (the mean Cmax and AUCt of masitinib rose by 26% and 41.6%, respectively). The exposure to the main active metabolite of masitinib (AB3280) was significant increased but less than the exposure to masitinib (the mean Cmax and AUCt of masitinib rose by 11% and 34.8%, respectively).

In summary,

- The plasma concentration of masitinib could thus be increased in a concomitant intake of CYP3A4 or Pgp inhibitor. So caution should be taken when administering masitinib with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 or Pgp.

- The plasma concentration of masitinib could be reduced in a concomitant intake of CYP3A4 inducer. The dose intended for the registration is 4.5 mg/kg/day which can cover the necessary mechanisms of action of the drug candidate. Even if the plasma concentration of masitinib is reduced, a dose at 3 mg/kg/day remains active against mast cells (inhibition of c-Kit with this dosage).

## Discontinuation due to AES

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the protocol period, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was slightly increased at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day and at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 17.1% at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with 7.9% for placebo (corresponding to a delta of +9.2% with respect to placebo), and the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 14.5% at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day (corresponding to a delta of +6.7% with respect to placebo).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 16.3% at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with 9.0% for placebo (corresponding to a delta of +7.3% with respect to placebo), and the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 16% at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day (corresponding to a delta of +7% with respect to placebo).

The most frequent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation with masitinib as compared with placebo were Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, followed by gastrointestinal disorders, investigations and Blood and Lymphatic System disorders (anemia)..

During the extension period, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was slightly increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day compared to placebo, and was decreased for the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day treatment-arm when compared with the placebo arm, regardless of the population.

- -In the 'Normal Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 9.1% at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with 2.7% for placebo (corresponding to a delta of +6.4% with respect to placebo), and the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 1.4% at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day (corresponding to a delta of -1.3% with respect to placebo).
- -In the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' population, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation was 8.2 % at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with 2.5% for placebo (corresponding to a delta of +5.7% with respect to placebo), and the frequency of AEs was 1.3% at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day (corresponding to a delta of -1.3% with respect to placebo).

The most frequent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo were infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorders.

## Adverse events leading to dose reduction

## Protocol period (W0-W48 period):

During the protocol period, the frequency of AEs leading to dose reduction was increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo. The frequency of AEs leading to dose reduction was 12.4% and 2.3% at the masitinib doses of 4.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, as compared with 1.5% for placebo (delta with respect to placebo = +12.4 % and +0.8%, respectively).

The most frequent AEs leading to dose reduction with masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo were gastrointestinal disorders, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, followed by Eye Disorders (oedema) and Blood,Lymphatic System Disorders (Iron Deficiency Anaemia and Anaemia Macrocytic) and investigations (weight decreased).

## Extension period (&gt;W48):

During the extension period, only 1 case of AEs leading to dose reduction was reported at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Safety databases and patient exposure

To support the MAA in the above claimed population, AB Science conducted one pivotal phase 2/3 study in patients with ALS (AB10015). Of all, in normal progressors 105 patients received masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, 110 patients received masitinib at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, and 114 patients received placebo. The mean treatment duration was 9.5 months (ranging from 0.3 to 11.7 months) in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm, 9.1 months (ranging from 0.7 to 12.8 months) in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, and 9.8 months (ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 months) in the placebo arm. In Normal + Faster Progressors 129 patients received masitinib at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day, 131 patients received masitinib at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, and 133 patients received placebo. The mean treatment duration was 9.1 months (ranging from 0.3 to 11.7 months) in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm, 9.0 months (ranging from 0.7 to 12.8 months) in the masitinib 3 mg/kg/day arm, and 9.6 months (ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 months) in the placebo arm.

## Adverse events

## Very common adverse events:

The main very common AEs that were observed to be increased in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm with respect to the placebo arm during the protocol period were the following; difference between treatment-arms expressed as ± delta (masitinib minus placebo):

- Nausea (+7.1%)
- Dysphagia (-0.4%)

## Common adverse events:

The main common AEs that were observed to be increased in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm with respect to the placebo arm during the protocol period were the following; difference between treatment-arms expressed as ± delta (masitinib minus placebo):

During the protocol period, common AEs having greatest positive difference of frequency between masitinib and placebo treatment-arms, regardless of the population and regardless of the dose, were: rash maculo-papular (+7.7%),, oedema peripheral (+6.3%), anxiety (+6.2%), weight decreased (+5.4%) and diarrhea (+4.1%)

## AEs of special interest

The following events were among the most severe AEs occurring during the clinical development of masitinib: severe neutropenia, Rash, Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Drug-Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic symptoms (DRESS). Other AE of special interest are diarrhoea, oedemas, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, cardiotoxicity. Risk of carcinogenicity has not been considered in the analysis as this is less relevant for the ALS patient population.

The AEs most increased during the protocol period for masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day were rash maculo-papular, nausea, respiratory failure, oedema peripheral, iron deficiency anaemia, dyspnoea and anxiety. For masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day, oedema peripheral, diarrhoea, respiratory failure, and rash maculo-papular.

Deaths and serious adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Deaths:

In ALS study (randomisation ratio 2:1), there were 54 fatal SAEs in masitinib arm and 17 fatal SAEs in placebo arm, all of them considered as not related to study medication (masitinib/placebo) by both investigator and sponsor. Seventeen (17) cases were reported with placebo arm and did not involve masitinib. Although acquired data possibly do not allow further causality conclusions, it is important to notice the asymmetry of deaths between masitinib treated patients (54 / 260 = 20.8%) and placebo patients (17/133 = 12.8%).

## SAE

During the protocol period, the frequency of SAE (any causality) was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo: -'Normal Progressor' 27.6% vs 16.7% for placebo and in the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' 31% vs. 18% for placebo .

## Discontinuation of treatment due to SAEs

During the protocol period, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was slightly increased at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day and at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day, regardless of the population: 'Normal Progressor' population 17.1% vs 7.9% for placebo ; 'Normal + Fast Progressor' 16.3% vs. 9.0%.

## Laboratory findings and vital signs

In ALS masitinib had an ALT, AST and bilirubin effect, increasing these values up to grade 3 severity. Masitinib had no effect on albumin level, alkaline phosphatase level, calcium level, cholesterol level, creatinine level, Gamma GT level, glucose level, potassium level, sodium level, and triglycerides level. Masitinib had an effect on hemoglobin count with decrease being more frequent than an increase in haemoglobin. Masitinib had a slight effect on leucocytes count with decrease being more frequent than an increase in white blood cells. The same holds for lymphocyte count.

There was no change in blood pressure or heart rate.

The  MAA  has  provided  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  different  types  of  neoplasm  which  have  been  identified  -  in preclinical  studies  and  previous  clinical  masitinib  trials  -  as  possibly  related  to  masitinib.  In  spite  of  bladder cancer still  being  a  possible  risk  to  masitinib  and  is  still  considered  a  possible  related  risk,  there  is  no  strong evidence that masitinib may induce neoplasms with clinical relevance in ALS patients.

Upon CHMP request, the MAA has performed a specific analysis of events of special concern, namely fractures / osteoporosis / hypophosphatemia, anaemia, weight loss and nausea. Of all these nausea is highlighted among other factors affecting masitinib safety. Bone fractures, anaemia and weight loss apparently have an impact on efficacy as measured by ALSFRS-R.

The method of assessment of the impact of an adverse event which requires time to produce an effect (anemia, weight loss) did not focus on patients who had the adverse event persistently throughout a significant period in the  study,  but  on  assessment  episode.  Including  all  patients  who  experienced  one  anemia  episode  or  one decrease in haemoglobin will dilute the effect, as many persons with a slight effect on red blood cells may also be in the placebo arm and many which will not have a systemic impact will counteract the impact of those where the effect was more prolonged. The narratives which were presented also raise a significant concern on the reliability of the acquisition and registration of AEs. To this aspect, the inspection which was carried out also raised the same concerns on AEs, and other additional safety concerns on the study population:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subject safety at risk:

- Very high number of protocol deviations related to inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria, safety tests (ECGs and  laboratory  analysis)  and  investigational  product  (IP)  intake  (overdose)  identified  for  at  least  20 subjects reviewed during the inspection at Dr. Delia Chaverri's site (this site randomized 106 subjects) and at least 12 subjects reviewed during the inspection at Dr. Conrado Estol's site (this site randomized 53 subjects).
- The appropriate conditions of the storage of the IP administered to the subjects could not be ensured according to the documentation reviewed. No monitoring of IMP conditions from site to the subjects).
- Deficiencies on the subject safety oversight. Delays on adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) notification to the Sponsor and the consequently delay of the Sponsor safety assessment.

Reliability of the data analysis:

Safety: Safety data has been updated after the submission for obtaining marketing authorization and was not provided to the Agency or to inspectors. The Applicant has also shown difficulties dealing with CROs monitoring the trial. This has had a relevant impact in the conduct of the trial, with relevant issues remain on the robustness of the collected data. It is not the impact of the individual concerns that have been identified and corrected, but the  impact  of  the  problems  that  may  not  have  been  identified  and  that  were  not  corrected  that  are  also  of concern.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

Based on the assessment of the submitted data, there were a high number of very common and common AEs reported in patients treated with masitinib and placebo. Many of these AEs are also coinciding with symptoms of the disease itself, and insufficient efforts have been made to discriminate both when possible.

Some of the known class effects of TKIs are also identified in patients treated with masitinib, such as skin toxicities, anaemia and hepatotoxicity.

In light of the intended chronic use of masitinib in this population with a reduced life expectancy, severe skin toxicities, are considered important safety concerns. Also relevant are anaemia and weight loss which impacts in overall strength and wellbeing, and the risk of bone fractures, which impact on decrease mobility and muscle exercise leading to increased wasting. Nausea also had a significant impact since it may contribute to faulty nutrition and increased mealtime duration, along with dysphagia.

Since the inclusion / exclusion criteria were prepared for a phase 2 study, patients with gastrostomy and tracheostomy were excluded. Patients with other comorbidities were also excluded, thus making this population very distant from real world ALS population, further increasing unknown risks.

The overall safety evaluation is, thus severely hampered by a number of limitations, i.e. the missing or poorly acquired data of the pivotal study AB10015 (e.g. with regard to details on dose reductions and concomitant treatments and impact thereof),  several issues on the control of study medication and most important, the lack of reliability on the registering and monitoring of clinical data.

## Conclusion

The CHMP and PRAC, having considered the data submitted in the application were of the opinion that due to the concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage.

## 2.8. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

Not applicable.

## 2.9. New Active Substance

The applicant compared the structure of masitinib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.

The CHMP, based on the available data, considers masitinib to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. However, in light of the negative recommendation, the new active substance status is not applicable at this stage.

## 2.10. Product information

In light of the negative recommendation, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet cannot be agreed at this stage.

## 2.10.1. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet does not yet meet the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 2.10.2. Additional monitoring

Not applicable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscular paralysis reflecting degeneration of motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, corticospinal tracts, brainstem and spinal cord [Wijesekera, 2009]. Incidence (average around 1/50,000 per year) and prevalence (average around 1/20,000) are relatively uniform in Western countries, although foci of higher frequency have been reported in the Western Pacific. The mean age of onset for sporadic ALS is about 60 years. Overall, there is a slight male preponderance (male to female ratio of around 1.5:1).

Approximately two thirds of patients with typical ALS have a spinal form of the disease (limb onset) and present with symptoms related to focal muscle weakness and wasting, in which onset of symptoms may start either distally or proximally in the upper and lower limbs. Gradually, spasticity may develop in the weakened atrophic limbs, affecting manual dexterity and gait. Patients with bulbar onset ALS usually present with dysarthria and dysphagia for solids or liquids. Limb symptoms can develop almost simultaneously with bulbar symptoms and in the vast majority of cases will occur within 1-2 years. Paralysis is progressive and leads to death due to respiratory failure within 2-3 years for bulbar onset cases and 3-5 years for limb onset ALS cases. Therefore, although the disease is heterogeneous, most patients die less than 3 years from symptom-onset [Gordon, 2013]. Approximately 60 % of patients have a predictable decline in function while the remainder die suddenly, sometimes from other causes.

Median survival for ALS is 2 to 4 years from onset; only 5-10% of patients survive beyond 10 years.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

## Main treatment options

At the time of this application, riluzole remains the only approved disease-modifying medicinal product in EU, and confers a survival advantage of 2-3 months (as reflected in the published EPAR). There is no available treatment to stop or reverse the progressive course of ALS. There has been no advance in efficacy of available therapeutic agents over the last 20 years since the introduction of riluzole, and even in its product information it is stated that: '[…] riluzole does not demonstrate a positive effect on functional symptoms of the disease whilst the magnitude of the effect on survival is modest. There are therefore remaining uncertainties on the product in the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' [EMA website, 2016].

Many symptomatic treatments, which do not slow disease progression but affect quality of life, appear helpful to individuals in clinic (Table 43 lists the various symptomatic treatments commonly used for management of ALS [Jenkins 2014]). However, evidence of benefit from those drugs is generally weak and further randomized clinical trials are required to provide a more robust evidence base. This opinion is reflected in a Cochrane systematic review of treatments for spasticity in ALS by Ashworth and colleagues (published in 2006 with update in 2011) [Ashworth 2006].

As such it is clear that there is an unmet medical need for the treatment of ALS, either for delay in disability progression, or to affect the loss of function and extend survival.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The development program of masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was based on the following single, pivotal phase 2/3 study:

- A Phase 2/3 study AB10015: A prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups, phase 2/3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib versus placebo in the treatment of patients suffering from ALS.

The applicant initially submitted the results from an interim analysis, and later in the procedure these were supplemented by the results of the final analysis of the study. Further analyses of the data, not provided at interim and final results' submissions, were requested by CHMP to clarify specific issues on efficacy and safety.

Four amendments were implemented during the running of the study, while the primary analysis hypothesis on the expected treatment effect (Δ3.3 points on ALSFRS-R) never changed. The most relevant protocol amendment was No. 3 when the distinction between patient populations of 'Normal Progressor' and 'Fast Progressor' was made. Hence, for study AB10015 two distinct ALS patient populations have been defined by the Applicant. The population of 'Normal Progressors' was defined as ALS patients whose progression of ALSFRS-R score before randomization is less than 1.1 points per month. The population of 'Fast Progressors' was defined as ALS patients whose progression of ALSFRS-R score before randomization is more than or equal to 1.1 points per month.

After amendment 4, patients were randomly allocated to one of the three following groups: Group 1: masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day + riluzole; Group 2: masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day + riluzole; Group 3: placebo of masitinib + riluzole. Patients received treatment for 48 week, with a possible extension.

The design of study AB10015 compared masitinib plus riluzole in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments against placebo plus riluzole in association with standard of care symptomatic treatments. The study protocol states that: 'All medications taken by the patients at the onset of study and all medication given in addition to the Investigational Medicinal Product during the study are regarded as concomitant medications', and 'All concomitant medications and/or therapies should be documented in the patient file and reported in the electronic Case Report Form'. Hence, there was no restriction placed on the investigator's choice of standard of care symptomatic treatments (for example, physical therapy, surgical interventions, and alternative therapies).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The patient population included mild to moderate ALS patients, with few co-morbidities and co-medications, and as such excluded patients on gastrostomy.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The data yielded several results that could be considered meaningful in this population:

At the time of the interim analysis of study AB10015 , in 'normal + fast progressors' at the dose of 4.5 mg/Kg/day, a difference of means of 4.2859 in absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R score was registered [(1-alpha) confidence interval] of [0.1376;8.4343], Re-randomization P-value 0.0213]. In theory, this difference could be considered clinically meaningful, as it represents a level of deterioration that usually takes place in the space of several months in the ALS patients' lives.

Another potential benefit was registered in the investigation of the quality of life using the ALSAQ-40. There, an absolute change from baseline to week 48 in Quality of Life (ALSAQ-40) score yielded a difference of means of 12.5695 [(1-alpha) confidence interval] [-19.5392;-5.5998], with a P-value 0.0005. There was also a reported effect on FVC, with an absolute change from baseline to week 48 in FVC score a difference of means of 11.9284, [(1-alpha) confidence interval] [1.4633;22.3934], P-value 0.0144

At the time of the assessment of the final results , the primary analysis was performed first in the 'Normal Progressor' population, testing patients randomized at an initial masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day (Group 1) versus placebo patients (Group 3). This analysis yielded a statistically significant difference in the ALSFRS-R score between masitinib and placebo (Difference of least-square means=3.39; p=0.0158), with an improvement of 27%, which could be considered relevant as it is in line with the 25% threshold defined for a clinically meaningful benefit in this situation[Castrillo-Viguera, 2010].

In the same 'Normal progressor' population, in the secondary efficacy evaluation, median progression free survival (PFS) was increased by 4 months with masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day) as compared with placebo treatmentarms, and this improvement was significant (p- value=0.0159), corresponding to a 25% increase. Additionally, a statistically significant difference was observed between masitinib (P=0.0078) and placebo treatment- arms in the Quality of life assessment (improvement between 42% and 46%), in the change from baseline in FVC, and in the CAFS score (difference = 8.91, p- value=0.2626) (see Section 2.5.2. for details).

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

A high number of uncertainties were identified during the assessment of this application. The CHMP expressed serious concerns about the conduct of the trial, the applied methodology and the robustness of the data used to support the claim for a positive B/R ratio of Masitinib in ALS. Additionally, there were uncertainties related to the reported effects according to the final analysis of the presented results.

Despite the claims of the applicant that the development programme was performed according to the GCP principles, the CHMP conveyed significant concerns about the conduct of the single pivotal trial, used as a basis for this application. During the procedure a triggered GCP inspection was requested, in two centres which enrolled &gt;40% of the total study population, and in light of the nature and relevance of the findings, and the observed systematic deficiencies, as a result of this inspection it was concluded that the data obtained at the inspected sites are not trustworthy enough to support the submitted marketing authorisation application for masitinib, and seriously affect the credibility of the data in the whole application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Independently from the issues identified in the conduct of the clinical development, there were severe methodological issues acknowledged, which considerably undermined the robustness of the data and added to the uncertainties. Study AB10015 does not meet the criteria concerning data quality and absence of indications of potential bias. There were a number of amendments, transforming the initial phase 2 trial into a phase 3 pivotal trial, which lacked a proper documented and justified rationale. Examples include revising the statistical hypothesis testing strategy between study arms, the primary analysis population and the strategy for the imputation of missing data. Initially data from the two active treatment arms were to be pooled in the primary comparison with the placebo arm. This was subsequently changed to a primary comparison of the higher dose versus placebo. There is no pharmacological rationale to support this revised strategy. Furthermore, the protocol amendment dichotomising the included patients into 'normal' and 'fast' progressors is justified neither in clinical terms nor in relation to the pharmacology of masitinib. In the absence of these amendments the single pivotal study fails to show statistically significant results on its primary endpoint: for the \"normal + fast progressor\" population the absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R between masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and placebo is 2.09 [-0.55;4.73], not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.1202).  Moreover, an excess of patients withdrew from treatment because of lack of efficacy and adverse events on both treatment arms compared to placebo. The handling of missing data arising from patient withdrawals is likely to give rise to important bias in the estimated treatment effect that favours masitinib.

From the results presented at the time of the final analysis, the following other inconsistencies emerged:

- There was no benefit on survival with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo even in the Applicant-defined 'Normal progressor' population.
- In terms of survival, in the same population ('normal  +  fast  progressor') masitinib failed to show an effect at the time of the final analysis.
- The 3mg/kg/day arm data demonstrated that there was a smaller trend of effect even in the 'normal progressors' group, than the one observed for the 4.5 mg dose. Like in the case of the 4.5 mg dose, most endpoints did not reach statistical significance. In the 'normal  +  fast  progressor' population masitinib   3  mg/kg/day had an absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R of 1.80 [0.91;4.51], with a P-value of 0.1918.

Although two study populations were described (normal and fast progressors) the paradigm to discriminate them was not robust, and the evidence provided does not fully explain it. Furthermore the cut-off point was based on retrospective data, and would be subjective to the point that clinicians could disregard the condition of a fast progressor if retrospective data was not available. Therefore, only the total enrolled population should be considered when assessing efficacy.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

Very common adverse events:

The main very common AEs that were observed to be increased in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm with respect to the placebo arm during the protocol period were the following;

- Nausea
- Dysphagia

Common adverse events:

The main common AEs that were observed to be increased in the masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day arm with respect to the placebo arm during the protocol period were the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -rash maculo-papular
- -oedema peripheral
- -anxiety
- -weight decreased
- -diarrhoea

## AEs of special interest

The following events were among the most severe AEs occurring during the clinical development of masitinib: severe neutropenia, Rash, Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Drug-Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic symptoms (DRESS). Other AE of special interest are diarrhoea, oedemas, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, cardiotoxicity. Risk of carcinogenicity has not been considered in the analysis as this is less relevant for the ALS patient population. The AEs most increased during the protocol period for masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day were rash maculo-papular, nausea, respiratory failure, oedema peripheral, iron deficiency anaemia, dyspnoea and anxiety. For masitinib at 3 mg/kg/day, oedema peripheral, diarrhoea, respiratory failure, and rash maculopapular.

## Deaths:

In ALS study (randomisation ratio 2:1), there were 54 fatal SAEs in masitinib arm and 17 fatal SAEs in placebo arm, all of them considered as not related to study medication (masitinib/placebo) by both investigator and sponsor. Seventeen (17) cases were reported with placebo arm and did not involve masitinib. Although acquired data possibly do not allow further causality conclusions, it is important to notice the asymmetry of deaths between masitinib treated patients (54 / 260 = 20.8%) and placebo patients (17/133 = 12.8%).

## SAE

During the protocol period, the frequency of SAE (any causality) was moderately increased with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and was similar with masitinib 3 mg/kg/day as compared with placebo: -'Normal Progressor' 27.6% vs 16.7% for placebo and in the 'Normal + Fast Progressor' 31% vs. 18% for placebo .

## Discontinuation of treatment due to SAEs

During the protocol period, the frequency of AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was slightly increased at a masitinib dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day and at a masitinib dose of 3 mg/kg/day, regardless of the population: 'Normal Progressor' population 17.1% vs 7.9% for placebo ; 'Normal + Fast Progressor' 16.3% vs. 9.0%.

## Laboratory findings and vital signs

In ALS masitinib had an ALT, AST and bilirubin effect, increasing these values up to grade 3 severity. Masitinib had no effect on albumin level, alkaline phosphatase level, calcium level, cholesterol level, creatinine level, Gamma GT level, glucose level, potassium level, sodium level, and triglycerides level. Masitinib had an effect on hemoglobin count with decrease being more frequent than an increase in haemoglobin. Masitinib had a slight effect on leucocytes count with decrease being more frequent than an increase in white blood cells. The same holds for lymphocyte count.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Upon CHMP request, the MAA has performed a specific analysis of events of special concern, namely fractures / osteoporosis / hypophosphatemia, anaemia, weight loss and nausea. Of all these nausea is highlighted among other factors affecting masitinib safety. Bone fractures, anaemia and weight loss apparently have an impact on efficacy as measured by ALSFRS-R.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

There are many aspects which increase the uncertainty of data regarding safety.

Reliability of the data analysis: data has been updated after the submission for obtaining marketing authorization and was not provided to the Agency or to inspectors. The Applicant has also shown difficulties dealing with CROs monitoring the trial. This has had a relevant impact in the conduct of the trial, with relevant issues remain on the robustness of the collected data. It is not the impact of the individual concerns that have been identified and corrected, but the impact of the problems that may not have been identified and that were not corrected that are also of concern.

Subject safety at risk: a) a very high number of protocol deviations related to inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria, safety tests (ECGs and laboratory analysis) and investigational product (IP) intake (overdose) identified for at least 20 subjects reviewed during the inspection at Dr. Delia Chaverri's site (this site randomized 106 subjects) and at least 12 subjects reviewed during the inspection at Dr. Conrado Estol's site (this site randomized 53 subjects); b) the appropriate conditions of the storage of the IP administered to the subjects could not be ensured according to the documentation reviewed. No monitoring of IMP conditions from site to the subjects); c) deficiencies on the subject safety oversight. Delays on adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) notification to the Sponsor and the consequently delay of the Sponsor safety assessment.

Further, the method of assessment of the impact of an adverse event which requires time to produce an effect (anemia, weight loss) did not focus on patients who had the adverse event persistently throughout a significant period in the study, but on assessment episode. Including all patients who experienced one anemia episode or one decrease in haemoglobin will dilute the effect, as many persons with a slight effect on red blood cells may also be in the placebo arm and many which will not have a systemic impact will counteract the impact of those where the effect was more prolonged.

Exclusion of gastrostomised patients precludes extrapolation both for efficacy and safety data (such as if a coagulation prolongation occurs, the risk of gastrostomy bleeding would be significant) in the general ALS population.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance and balance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The evaluation of the importance of the observed beneficial and unfavourable effects was significantly influenced by the trial conduct and methodological issues, described in previous sections. The latter lead to the conclusion that the credibility of the observed beneficial effects was seriously questioned, while for the unfavourable effects there were not enough well-controlled safety data were provided to potentially allow for the complete assessment of the safety profile of masitinib.

The development programme did not manage to create a clear chain of evidence supporting the use of masitinib in ALS. The transition from a  pre-clinical proof-of-principle, into a justified dose- selection strategy and proof-ofconcept development, and finally into confirmatory data generation from a properly designed clinical programme is lacking. Maintaining a solid, data driven and scientifically justified chain of supportive evidence is of paramount importance in the context of a single pivotal trial application, even in cases like in ALS, where it is recognized that the unmet medical need is severe. As this was not achieved, the importance of the observed beneficial effects is questionable.

Adding to the above deficiency is the fact that said benefits were only observed in a selected sub-population of patients making it difficult to predict the expected effect of masitinib in ALS patients, in real life conditions. What is more, the effects become substantially smaller and lose their statistical significance when the whole trial population is taken into account, and this is true not only for the effects described by the primary endpoint, but also for the ones observed for another important outcome - progression free survival.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additionally, the whole chosen strategy to sub-divide the trial population into the proposed sub-groups was not accepted as it was not sufficiently justified by scientific arguments. The doubts remain, that this strategy may have, at least in part, been driven by data emerging during the trial.

Against the deficiencies, regarding the data describing the beneficial effects, the CHMP had to position the uncertainties about the unfavourable effects, created by the issues in the trial conduct (see GCP section), and the lack of sufficient amount and duration of the collected safety data. In that context, the described safety profile of masitinib may seriously underestimate the real one to be expected, if the drug is to be used in clinical practice.

## 3.7.2. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

## Conditional marketing authorisation

As comprehensive data on the product were not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission.

The product falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and seriously debilitating disease.

ALS is a progressive, incurable and fatal neurodegenerative disease. ALS is a serious neurological disease that causes muscle weakness, disability and eventually death. Median survival for ALS is 2 to 4 years from onset; only 5-10% of patients survive beyond 10 years [Chio, 2013]. The disease is heterogeneous, but most patients die less than 3 years from symptom-onset [Gordon, 2013]. The cause of death in ALS is normally of a respiratory nature. Approximately 60 % of patients have a predictable decline in function while the remainders die suddenly, sometimes from other causes.

The Applicant proposed apply for conditional Marketing authorisation (CMA), basing the claim for positive B/R balance on the results from the interim analysis. As described above, these were not considered comprehensive and compelling. As a specific obligation of the CMA the Applicant initially proposed the final results from the pivotal study to be presented, and claimed that should CHMP be requesting a second study as a specific obligation, the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation would not affect the ability to complete this second study in a timely manner. The CHMP disagreed with the proposed strategy, despite agreeing with the claim for an unmet medical need in ALS. For the Committee, the available data, from both interim and final analyses, were not sufficient to establish a positive B/R for Alsitek in ALS, thus failing to fulfil condition a of Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, and not allowing a CMA to be granted.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R ratio of Alsitek is considered negative in the proposed indication.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Alsitek in combination with riluzole is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (probable or definitive), the CHMP considers by consensus that the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated.

The CHMP considers that:

## Whereas,

While CPMP/EWP/2330/99 indicates that a single pivotal study can be an acceptable basis for licensing where certain prerequisites are met, data from the single pivotal trial of Alsitek are not adequate to establish efficacy. Study AB10015 does not meet the criteria concerning data quality and absence of indications of potential bias. Multiple crucial protocol amendments have been implemented during the course of the study and for the CHMP the reasoning and drivers for some of those remain unclear. Examples include revising the statistical hypothesis testing strategy between study arms, the primary analysis population and the strategy for the imputation of missing data. Specifically:

- Initially data from the two active treatment arms were to be pooled in the primary comparison with the placebo arm. This was subsequently changed to a primary comparison of the higher dose versus placebo. There is no pharmacological rationale to support this revised strategy. Furthermore, the protocol amendment dichotomising the included patients into 'normal' and 'fast' progressors is justified neither in clinical terms nor in relation to the pharmacology of masitinib. In the absence of these amendments the single pivotal study fails to show statistically significant results on its primary endpoint: for the \"normal + fast progressor\" population the absolute change from baseline to week 48 in ALSFRS-R between masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and placebo is 2.09 [-0.55;4.73], not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.1202).
- Concerns related to this aspect of trial conduct are compounded by the systematic deficiencies observed at the requested GCP inspection, in which it was concluded that the data obtained at the inspected sites are not trustworthy enough to support the submitted marketing authorization application for masitinib. The possibility that amendments of the analytic strategy were driven by emerging trial data cannot be excluded.
- Moreover, an excess of patients withdrew from treatment because of lack of efficacy and adverse events on both treatment arms compared to placebo. The handling of missing data arising from patient withdrawals is likely to give rise to important bias in the estimated treatment effect that favours masitinib.

Thus, a reliable estimate of efficacy has not been presented. Therefore, a positive benefit/risk balance cannot be established.

The CHMP is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not properly or sufficiently demonstrated. Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation for Alsitek.

Due to the aforementioned concerns, a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, package leaflet, and risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage.
