Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cenegermin, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of the possible causal relationships between administration of the product and 34 cases of 'corneal deposit', the following changes to the product information of medicinal products containing cenegermin are recommended (new text underlined and in bold , deleted text strike through):

The  following  adverse  drug  reactions  should  be  added  under  the  SOC  Eye  disorders  with  a  frequency common:

## corneal deposit

The package leaflet will be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.
