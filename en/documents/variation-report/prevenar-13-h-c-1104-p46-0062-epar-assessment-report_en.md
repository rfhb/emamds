## 1. Introduction

On 29 th  June 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that a phase 4, randomised, open-label trial to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulated in multidose vials when given with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants in India, protocol B4671004 is a stand-alone study.

The current EU-approved indications for the use of Prevenar 13 are:

- Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age;
- Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults ≥ 18 years of age and the elderly

The 4 dose multidose vial (MDV) with a new formulation of Prevenar 13 containing the additional preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) was submitted to the European Medicines Agency(EMA) as a grouped Type II variation  (EMEA/H/C/001104/II/0130/G) on the 11 November 2015 and received a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Opinion on the 01 April 2016.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Suspension for Injection, 1 dose (0.5 mL) contains Streptococcus pneumoniae saccharides conjugated to diphtheria CRM197 protein:

Serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F ......................... 2.2 μg

Serotype 6B ............................................................................................4.4 μg

The vaccine is formulated with 5mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, and 0.125mg of aluminium as aluminium phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose. 13vPnC multidose vials (MDVs) will also contain 4 mg of 2-PE per 0.5-mL dose.

For this study, the investigational products are 13vPnC with 2-PE in multidose vials (MDVs) and 13vPnC without 2-PE in prefilled syringes (PFSs). Four (4) doses of 13vPnC (2.0 mL) will be contained within each MDV. For the purposes of this study, only a single 0.5-mL dose will be administered from each of the MDVs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A phase 4, randomised, open-label trial to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulated in multidose vials when given with routine paediatric vaccines in healthy infants in India, Protocol B4671004.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

A Phase 4, Randomized, Open-Label Trial to Describe the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Formulated in Multidose Vials When Given with Routine Pediatric Vaccines in Healthy Infants in India, Protocol B4671004

## Description

Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a public health problem affecting all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia, febrile bacteraemia, and meningitis are the most common manifestations of invasive pneumonia disease (IPD). Pneumococcal meningitis is a severe disease with high mortality and high incidence of neurologic sequelae. S pneumoniae also causes non-invasive pneumococcal disease, including otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and nonbacteraemic pneumonia. Of the estimated 8.8 million global annual deaths among children &lt; 5 years of age in 2008, the WHO estimated that 476,000 (333,000 to 529,000) were caused by pneumococcal infections. Disease rates and mortality are higher in developing regions than in industrialized regions, with the majority of deaths occurring in Africa and Asia.

The preservative, 2-PE, added to 13vPnC in MDVs is a phenolic derivative used in vaccine production. It was studied at high concentrations in animal studies and did not result in adverse effects (AEs). Furthermore, a study published by Khandke et al demonstrated that 2-PE at 5.0 mg per dose in the Prevenar 13 multidose formulation met the antimicrobial effectiveness requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. Currently, 2-PE is the preservative used in a number of commercially available vaccines, e.g., diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Daptacel; Infanrix) and hepatitis A inactivated and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine (Twinrix). In the earlier open-label, randomized study (B4671001) in healthy infants in the Gambia, the 13vPnC MDV formulation with 2-PE as preservative demonstrated immunogenicity and safety profiles comparable to those of the approved formulation of 13vPnC without 2-PE (provided in PFSs).

Prevenar 13 and the MDV 13vPnC+2-PE formulation are licensed in India for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by S pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, and acute otitis media) in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. Prevenar 13 is also licensed in India for active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F in children of 6 years to 17 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older.

This clinical study report (CSR) describes the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC with 2-PE presented in MDVs in infants and toddlers in India. This study is defined as a post-authorisation safety study (PASS).

## Methods

## Objectives and endpoints

The primary objective of this study was to describe the safety profile of the13vPnC multidose vial (MDV) formulation. The secondary objective pertains to the evaluation of the immune responses induced by this formulation, which were assessed through IgG as well as opsonophagocytic assay (OPA), which is a biological assay designed to measure functional pneumococcal serotype-specific antibodies present in human serum.

## Study design

This was a randomised, multi-centre and open-label phase 4 study. The subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 13vPnC with 2-PE from an MDV or 13vPnC without 2-PE in a PFS. Subjects were allocated to vaccine groups through the use of an interactive web-based response system.

Approximately 300 subjects (150 subjects per group) at 7 sites were randomized. The subjects were vaccinated in a 3-dose infant series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age. Subjects had 2 blood draws of up to 5 mL approximately 1 month after the infant series and approximately 1 month after the toddler dose. The approximate duration of the study was 20 months, assuming a 6-month recruitment period.

## Study population /Sample size

Approximately 300 Indian boys and girls (150 subjects per group) who were vaccinated in a 3-dose infant series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age followed by a toddler dose at 12 months of age.

## Treatments

At Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5, all subjects were administered 13vPnC (MDV or PFS) intramuscularly by injecting 0.5 mL into the left anterolateral thigh muscle. Concomitant vaccines were given in a different limb from that used to administer 13vPnC.

## Outcomes/endpoints

As reflected in Table 1 above.

## Safety evaluations

Local reactions (i.e., redness, swelling, and pain) at the 13vPnC injection site were monitored for the first 7 days (Days 1 to 7) following vaccination. Local reactions were measured in caliper units (range: 1 to 14) and recorded in the e-diary.

The e-diary was used also to record the presence of systemic events (i.e., loss of or decreased appetite, increased sleep, and irritability) daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) after each vaccination using the grading scale. A digital thermometer was given to the subject's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) with instructions on how to measure the child's axillary temperature at home. Axillary temperature was collected at evening bedtime daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) after each vaccination, and at any time during the 7 days if fever was suspected. The highest temperature for each day was recorded in the ediary. Fever was defined as a temperature of ≥38.0 ° C. Temperature was recorded to 1 decimal place and then categorized according to the scale for fever.

AEs, including serious adverse effects (SAEs)  were recorded on the AE page(s) of the case report form (CRF) from the time the subject/ parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) provided informed consent through and including Visit 6 (28 to 42 Days After Visit 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity Evaluations

Blood samples were obtained from all subjects 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose of 13vPnC. A high-throughput, multiplex direct Luminex-based immunoassay (dLIA) was performed on these samples to measure the concentration of antibodies elicited by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F present in the vaccine.

Pfizer's 13-plex dLIA was validated using immunized human serum that contained IgG antibodies to the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC.

Serotype-specific OPA assays for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were performed on blood samples taken from all subjects 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose of 13vPnC, where sufficient sera were available.

## Statistical Methods

## Evaluable Immunogenicity Population:

The evaluable immunogenicity population was defined for the 3-dose infant series and the toddler dose separately.

The infant evaluable immunogenicity population included all subjects who:

- met all eligibility criteria
- were aged 6 weeks (42 to 72 days, inclusive) at the time of the first vaccination
- had received 3 doses of vaccine that was randomly assigned to them
- had post-Dose 3 blood drawn within 27 to 49 days, inclusive, after the third vaccination
- had at least 1 valid and determinate post-Dose 3 assay result, and had no other major protocol violations

The toddler evaluable immunogenicity population included all subjects who:

- had received 3 doses in the infant series and 1 toddler dose of randomly assigned vaccine
- had post-Dose 4 blood drawn within 27 to 49 days, inclusive, after the fourth vaccination
- had at least 1 valid and determinate post-Dose 4 assay result, and had no other major protocol violations.

The infant and toddler evaluable immunogenicity populations were primary immunogenicity populations for the infant and toddler analyses.

## All- Available Immunogenicity Populations:

The all-available immunogenicity population were defined for the 3-dose infant series and the toddler dose separately.  The infant all-available immunogenicity population included all subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result after Dose 3.  The toddler all-available immunogenicity population included all subjects who had at least 1valid and determinate assay result after Dose 4.

## Safety Analysis Populations:

Separate safety populations were defined for the infant series and the toddler dose.  Each safety population included all subjects who received at least 1dose of the investigational product for the indicated regimen.

## Analysis of Demographic Characteristics:

The demographic characteristics that will be summarized using descriptive statistics include sex, ethnicity, and age at each vaccination.

## Efficacy Analysis:

The proportions of subjects with IgG ≥ the defined threshold was accompanied by 2-sided 95% confidence of intervals (CIs).  The Clopper-Pearson method was used. GMCs were obtained by log transformation of concentrations, averaging the transformed values, then exponentiating the results. 95% confidence was obtained for CIs.  The CIs were calculated in the log scale with reference to the appropriate t-distribution. Then the lower and upper limits were exponentiated. Empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were compiled for each serotype at each blood sampling time point. Two (2)-sided 95% CIs comparing the 2 vaccine groups were compiled in order to quantify the differences between the 2 vaccine groups.  For the proportions of subjects with IgG ≥ the defined threshold for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured, the 2-sided 95% CI on MDV minus PFS were compiled. For the GMC, the 2-sided 95% CI on MDV minus PFS were compiled, using the log concentrations, as a 2-sample CI on the difference between means. The t-distribution was used.  The lower and upper limits were exponentiated, so the results described the ratio of MDV to PFS. Assay results below the limit of quantification were set to the limit of detection before analysis.  Missing data will not be replaced or imputed.

## Safety Analysis:

Local injection site reactions, systemic events, and AEs were summarized by vaccine group and by vaccination.

The proportions of subjects with local reactions at the injection site and systemic events reported on any day within the 7-day period after each vaccination were estimated for each vaccine group.  Local reactions were not compiled for concurrent vaccinations.

Local reactions and systemic events that persist beyond Day 7 were listed in the CSR. AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  AEs within 1 month after vaccination were summarized by vaccine group for each vaccination separately.  AEs were also summarized from the first dose up to 1 month after the infant series. SAEs were summarized from the first dose up to 1 month after the toddler dose. Newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions were summarized from 1 month after the infant series up to the toddler dose. All safety analyses were performed on the safety population.  Subjects were assigned to the vaccine actually received.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 301 participants were randomized with 151 participants in the MDV group and 150 participants in the PFS group.  The majority of participants completed the blood draws after the third dose of the infant series (18 -week visit,285 [94.7%] ) and after the toddler dose (13-month visit, 276 [91.7%]). The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the disposition table. One participant in the MDV group was withdrawn prior to vaccination.  Seven participants in the MDV group and 8 in the PFS group were withdrawn before the blood draw at the 18week visit (Visit 4).  In addition, 4 participants in the MDV group and 3 participants in the PFS group were withdrawn between the 18-week blood draw and the toddler dose (Vaccination 4, Visit 5). Reasons for withdrawal before Visit 5 included AEs (0 participants MDV; 2 participants PFS), lost to follow-up (2 participants MDV; 1 participant PFS), no longer meets eligibility criteria (1 participant MDV, 0 participants PFS), and withdrawal by parent/guardian (8 participants MDV; 8 participants PFS). During the toddler dose, 1 participant each was withdrawn from the MDV and PFS groups by the parent/guardian.

## Baseline data

The demographical characteristics were well balanced between study arms.

## Efficacy results

## Serotype-Specific IgG GMCs and IgG Concentrations Equal to or Above the Defined

Threshold : Results were generally comparable for the MDV and PFS groups.  After the toddler dose, there was a clear boosting of immune response induced by 13vPnC and the percentage of subjects with serotype-specific IgG concentrations at or above the defined thresholds were very similar for the MDV and PFS groups.

Abbreviations:GMR=geometricmeanratio;GMT=geometricmean titer;LLOQ=lowerlimitof quantitation;OPA= opsonophagocytic activity.

Note: LLOQ for OPA titers for each serotype was set as follows: serotype 1, 18; serotype 3, 12; serotype 4, 21; serotype 5, 29; serotype 6A, 37; serotype 6B, 43; serotype 7F, 113; serotype 9V, 141; serotype 14, 35; serotype 18C, 31; serotype

19A, 18; serotype 19F, 48; and serotype 23F, 13.

a. Protocol-specified timing for blood sample collection.

b. N = number of subjects in the vaccine group with a blood sample collected at the specified sampling time point.

C. n = Number of subjects with valid and determinate assay results for the specified serotype at the given sampling time point.

d.GMTs were calculated as the mean of the logarithmically transformed titers and then transformed back to its original set to 0.5 x LLOQ for the analysis.

CIs were constructed by obtaining CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed titers using student's t distribution and transformingtheconfidencelimitsbacktotheoriginalunits.

f. GMRs were calculated as the mean of the difference (MDV -PFS) of the logarithmically transformed titers and then transformedbackto its original units.

CIs were constructed by obtaining CIs for the mean of the differences (MDV -PFS) of the logarithmically transformedtitersusingstudent'stdistributionandtransformingtheconfidencelimitsbacktotheoriginalunits.

## Immunogenicity conclusions

Results were generally comparable in the MDV and PFS groups for all immunogenicity endpoints as measured 1 month after the infant series of 13vPnC. Results were similar for the MDV and PFS groups as measured 1 month also after the toddler dose and, as expected, there was a clear boosting of the immune response induced by 13vPnC.

Assessor's comment: We endorse MAH conclusions. After the toddler dose close to 100 % of children responded with protective antibody levels for all serotypes regardless which vaccine vial type (multidose with 2-PE preservative or single shot vial without 2-PE) was used. This indicates that 2-PE do not affect immunogenicity of Prevenar 13.

## Safety results

## Local reactions

The proportions of subjects reporting local reactions were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  The most frequent local reaction reported was pain at injection site, and most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity.  The median durations of redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site were ≤ 2 days following each dose of the infant series and 1 day following the toddler dose.  Durations were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  Reported local reactions by day were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.

## Systemic events

The proportions of subjects reporting systemic events were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.  For the infant series, the most frequent systemic events reported were increased sleep and irritability.  For the toddler dose, the most frequent systemic event reported was irritability.  Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity for both the infant series and the toddler dose.  The median durations of fever, decreased appetite, increased sleep, and irritability, were ≤ 2 days following each dose of the infant series and ≤ 3 days following the toddler dose.  Durations were similar for the MDV and PFS groups.

The total incidence of any event was 11 (7.9%) in the MDV group and 12 (8.6%) in the PFS group from the toddler dose until 1month after the toddler dose.  No newly diagnosed chronical medical conditions (NDCMCs) were reported in either group. The distribution of AEs by system organ class and preferred term was similar in the MDV and PFS groups from the first vaccination until 1 month after the infant series and from the toddler dose until 1 month after the toddler dose.  During the infant series, the most frequently reported AE by preferred term was injection site pain in both groups (44 [29.3%] in the MDV and 46 [30.7%] in the PFS groups). These reactions were local in nature. Injection site swelling and upper respiratory tract infection were also frequently reported.  After the toddler dose, the most frequently reported AE by preferred term was upper respiratory tract infection (5 [3.6%] in the MDV and 2 [1.4%] in the PFS groups).

Two subjects, both in the PFS group, had AEs that led to withdrawal from the study; urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux was reported for 1 subject and seizure was reported for the other subject.  One participant was withdrawn prior to vaccination due to an AE.  None of the AEs leading to withdrawal were assessed as related to the investigational product by the investigator.

The incidence of SAEs was similar between the MDV and PFS groups.  From the first vaccination until 1 month after the infant series, SAEs were reported by 5 (3.3%) participants in the MDV group and 4 (2.7%) participants in the PFS group.  From 1 month after the infant series until the toddler dose, SAEs were reported by 6 (4.0%) participants in the MDV group and 3 (2.0%) participants in the PFS group.  From the toddler dose until 1 month after the toddler dose, SAEs were reported by 1 (0.7%) participants in the MDV group and no participants in the PFS group.  One SAE was considered related to the investigational product by the investigator, a Grade 1 seizure occurring on the day of Vaccination 1 for a participant in the PFS group.

## Safety conclusions

The proportions of participants reporting local reactions and systemic events within 7 days after vaccination were similar for the MDV and PFS groups. Most were mild or moderate in severity.

The proportions of participants reporting AEs were similar for the MDV and PFS groups. During the infant series, injection site pain, injection site swelling, and upper respiratory tract infection were the most frequently reported AEs. After the toddler dose, the most frequently reported AE was upper respiratory tract infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no deaths or NDCMCs reported during the study. Of the SAEs reported during the study period (14 in MDV group and 9 in PFS group), only 1 SAE was considered related to the investigational product by the investigator (seizure, PFS group). Two participants in the PFS group were withdrawn from the study for AEs assessed as unrelated to the investigational product (seizure, urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux). One participant in the MDV group was withdrawn prior to vaccination due to an AE.

Assessors comment: We endorse MAH conclusions. Addition of 2-PE to the vaccine did not affect the safety of Prevenar 13.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Present study confirmed immunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 MDV formulation among Indian infants and toddlers at age 6 weeks-12 month. Immunogenicity of 13vPnC was comparable for the MDV and PFS groups as measured 1 month after the infant series and 1 month after the toddler dose. The immunogenicity results are in agreement with previously reported studies.

The administration of 13vPnC in both MDV and PFS was well tolerated. The safety profile of 13vPnC in a MDV was similar to a PFS and consistent with prior studies. The study population was small (N= 300) and therefore the chance to detect rare AEs and SAEs is low. No new efficacy or safety concern is raised from this study.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate no new safety or efficacy concern. The P46 procedure is considered fulfilled.
