Clear, colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Teizeild is indicated to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in adult and paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with stage 2 T1D.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Teizeild should be administered by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage potential severe adverse reactions.

## Laboratory evaluation and vaccination prior to initiation

- Prior to initiating Teizeild, a complete blood count and liver enzyme tests should be obtained.
- Use of Teizeild is not recommended in patients with (see section 4.4):
- o Lymphocyte count less than 1.0 x 10 9 lymphocytes/L
- o Haemoglobin less than 100 g/L
- o Platelet count less than 100 x 10 9 platelets/L
- o Absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 x 10 9 neutrophils/L
- o Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Laboratory or clinical evidence of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV)
- o Active serious infection or chronic active infection other than localised skin infections
- All age-appropriate vaccinations should be administered prior to initiating Teizeild (see section 4.4 for detailed guidance).

## Premedication

Premedication should be used prior to Teizeild infusion for the first 5 days of dosing with: (1) a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or paracetamol, (2) an antihistamine, and (3) use of an antiemetic could be considered (see section 4.4). Additional doses of premedication should be administered if needed.

## Posology

Teizeild should be administered by intravenous infusion (over a minimum of 30 minutes), using a body surface area (BSA)-based dosing, once daily for 14 consecutive days as follows:

- Day 1: 65 micrograms/m 2
- Day 2: 125 micrograms/m 2
- Day 3: 250 micrograms/m 2
- Day 4: 500 micrograms/m 2
- Days 5 through 14: 1 030 micrograms/m 2

## Missed dose(s)

If a planned Teizeild infusion is missed, dosing should be resumed by administering all remaining doses on consecutive days to complete the 14-day treatment course.

## Treatment discontinuation

Temporary treatment discontinuation may be required according to the severity of laboratory abnormalities. Based on clinical judgment, treatment should be paused if platelet count, neutrophil count, or haemoglobin level decreases significantly.

Dose interruption should not exceed 3 days. Dosing may be resumed by administering all remaining doses on consecutive days to complete the 14-day treatment course (e.g. if dosing is missed on Days 4 and 5, dosing may restart at Day 6 with the dosing level specified for Day 4).

Treatment should be permanently discontinued if:

- Elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST greater than 5 times ULN) or bilirubin greater than 3 times ULN
- Prolonged severe lymphopenia (&lt; 0.5 x 10 9 lymphocytes/L lasting 1 week or longer)
- Clinically relevant (physician´s decision based on the individual patient´s data) decrease of platelet count, neutrophil count, or haemoglobin level for 3 consecutive days
- A serious infection develops

For additional information, see sections 4.4 and 4.8.

## Special populations

## Elderly

## Renal impairment

No studies have been performed in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Body weight

BSA-based dosing is required to normalise the exposure of Teizeild across body weight (see Posology and section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Teizeild in children younger than 8 years of age have not been established.

## Method of administration

Teizeild should be administered by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes. Two doses should not be administered on the same day.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and at the end of the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Cytokine release syndrome

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with teplizumab during the treatment period and through 28 days after the last administration (see section 4.8). CRS symptoms included fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased total bilirubin. These symptoms typically occurred during the first 5 days of treatment (see section 4.8).

To mitigate CRS:

- antipyretics, antihistamines and/or antiemetics should be administered prior to treatment (see section 4.2).
- liver enzymes and bilirubin should be monitored during treatment, more frequently within the first week. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop elevated ALT or AST more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin more than 3 times ULN.
- Symptoms of CRS should be treated with antipyretics, antihistamines and/or antiemetics. If severe CRS develops, temporarily pausing dosing for 1-2 days should be considered (and the remaining doses to complete the full 14-day course should be administered on consecutive days). If CRS does not improve or if CRS recurs despite the pause, discontinuing treatment may be warranted.

## Serious infections

Bacterial and viral infections have occurred in patients treated with Teizeild, including gastroenteritis, cellulitis, pneumonia, abscess, sepsis (see section 4.8). Use of Teizeild is not recommended in patients with active serious infection or chronic infection other than localised skin infections. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment. If serious infection develops, appropriate treatment should be provided and Teizeild should be discontinued.

## Lymphopenia

In clinical studies, 75% of patients treated with Teizeild developed lymphopenia. For most patients who experienced lymphopenia, lymphocyte levels began to recover after the fifth day of treatment and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

returned to pre-treatment values within two weeks after treatment completion and without dose interruption (see section 4.8).

White blood cell counts should be monitored during the treatment period. If prolonged severe lymphopenia (&lt; 0.5 x 10 9 cells/L lasting 1 week or longer) develops, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.8).

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Acute hypersensitivity reactions including serum sickness, angioedema, urticaria, rash, vomiting and bronchospasm occurred in patients treated with Teizeild. Generalised cutaneous reactions and anaphylaxis have occurred in at least one patient (see section 4.8). If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, Teizeild should be discontinued and treatment should be provided promptly.

## Vaccinations

The safety of immunisation with live-attenuated vaccines in patients treated with Teizeild has not been studied. Additionally, Teizeild may interfere with the immune response to vaccination and decrease vaccine efficacy.

- All age-appropriate vaccinations should be administered prior to starting Teizeild (see section 4.2).
- Inactivated or mRNA vaccinations are not recommended within the 2 weeks prior to treatment, during treatment, or up to 6 weeks after completion of treatment.
- Live-attenuated vaccinations are not recommended within the 8 weeks prior to starting treatment, during treatment, or up to 52 weeks after completion of treatment.

## Glucose monitoring

Blood glucose as well as signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia should be monitored and diabetes managed according to current practice guidelines.

## Other considerations

Patients must not have type 2 diabetes (T2D) or secondary dysglycaemia related to a condition other than T1D (e.g. diabetes secondary to medicinal products or surgery, monogenic diabetes).

## Educational/Safety advice tools

Healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients treated with Teizeild must be familiar with the guides available for the safe use of this medicinal product and inform patients about the potential risks associated with the use of Teizeild.

- Guide for risk minimisation for Healthcare Professionals: Healthcare Professional Guide
- Guide for risk minimisation for Patients: Patient Guide -to be provided to patients by healthcare professionals

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. Teizeild is administered in 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution (see section 6.6).

## Polysorbate 80

This medicinal product contains 0.10 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.05 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No drug interaction studies have been performed.

Teizeild should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medicinal products that are associated with significant liver abnormalities, cytopenias and other immune modulators.

Cytokine release syndrome accompanied by a slight and transient increase in IL-6 concentrations may occur with Teizeild.

Teizeild is not expected to have any relevant cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions.

Teizeild may interfere with the immune response to vaccination (see section 4.4).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with teplizumab and for 30 days after the last dose of treatment. Teizeild is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Pregnancy

There are no available data from the use of teplizumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Teizeild is not recommended during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether teplizumab is excreted in human milk. Toxicological data in animals suggest excretion of teplizumab in milk of lactating mice (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Teizeild and for 30 days after the last dose of treatment.

## Fertility

There are no clinical data available for teplizumab on the effects on fertility. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in female and male mice treated with a surrogate anti-mouse CD3 antibody (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Teizeild has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were lymphopenia (75%), leukopenia (58%), neutropenia (37%), and rash (36%). The most frequent serious adverse reaction was cytokine release syndrome (0.9%). Other serious adverse reactions included alanine aminotransferase increased (0.2%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (0.2%), lymphopenia (0.2%), neutropenia (0.2%), and infection (0.2%).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

In study TN-10, CRS was reported in 2% of patients treated with Teizeild.

In the pool of 7 clinical studies, 6% of patients treated with Teizeild developed CRS. In 14% of these patients, CRS was reported as serious (see section 4.4). Liver transaminase elevations were observed more frequently in patients treated with Teizeild who experienced CRS.

Serious infections

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study TN-10, serious infections (cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, wound infection) were reported in 9% of patients treated with Teizeild.

In the pool of 7 clinical studies, serious infections were reported in 3.1% of patients treated with Teizeild, including gastroenteritis, cellulitis, pneumonia, abscess, sepsis, and infectious mononucleosis.

## Lymphopenia

In study TN-10, lymphopenia was reported in 73% of patients treated with Teizeild. The average lymphocyte count nadir occurred at day 5 of treatment, with recovery and return to baseline by week 6 (see section 4.4).

In the pool of 7 clinical studies, severe lymphopenia (&lt; 0.5 x 10 9 cells/L) lasting 1 week or longer occurred in 2% of patients treated with Teizeild and 0.5% of patients permanently discontinued treatment because of lymphopenia.

## Rash and hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions were reported with Teizeild in study TN-10. Serum sickness was observed in 2% of patients treated with Teizeild.

In the pool of 7 clinical studies of patients:

- Anaphylaxis (with hypoxia and bronchospasm) was observed in one patient treated with Teizeild who was hospitalised.
- Angioedema (periorbital and facial) was observed in 0.2% patients treated with Teizeild,
- Peripheral and generalised oedema was reported in 1.2% of patients treated with Teizeild.
- Rash was observed in 36% of patients treated with Teizeild. 0.3% of patients treated with Teizeild had a serious rash.
- Urticaria was reported in 2.7% of patients treated with Teizeild.
- Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 1% of patients treated with Teizeild. Less than 0.1% of patients treated with Teizeild had a serious hypersensitivity reaction.

## Haemoglobin decreased and thrombocytopenia

In the pool of 7 clinical studies, haemoglobin decreased was reported in 23% of patients treated with Teizeild and thrombocytopenia was reported in 17% of patients treated with Teizeild; recovery occurred within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. In clinical studies, 1.2% of patients treated with Teizeild discontinued treatment due to haemoglobin less than 85 g/L (or a decrease of more than 20 g/L to a value less than 100 g/L), and 1% discontinued Teizeild due to platelet count less than 50 x 10 9 platelets/L.

## Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations

Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations were observed in patients treated with Teizeild, both in the context of CRS and in patients without CRS. On laboratory analysis, 7.8% of patients treated with Teizeild experienced a peak ALT more than 3 times the ULN. For AST, 5.3% of patients treated with Teizeild experienced a peak AST more than 3 times the ULN. Most liver enzyme elevations were transient and resolved 1-2 weeks after treatment.

## Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies.

In the placebo-controlled study in patients aged 8 years of age and older with stage 2 T1D (study TN10) (see section 5.1), approximately 57% of patients treated with Teizeild developed treatment emergent anti-teplizumab antibodies, 46% of whom developed neutralising antibodies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the available data, no definitive conclusion can be made to characterise the effects of ADA on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or effectiveness of Teizeild.

## Paediatric population

Immunogenicity data in children younger than 8 years of age have not been established.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no clinical experience with overdose with teplizumab.

There is no known specific antidote for Teizeild overdose. In the event of overdose the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and all appropriate measures should be taken immediately. Clinical judgement should be applied.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic Group: other drugs in diabetes, ATC Code: A10XX01

## Mechanism of action

Teplizumab binds to CD3 (a cell surface antigen present on T lymphocytes) and delays disease progression in patients with stage 2 T1D. The mechanism may involve partial agonistic signalling leading to deactivation of autoreactive CD8+ T lymphocytes and reduced immune-mediated beta-cell destruction. Teplizumab leads to an increase in the proportion of CD8+ T cells with signs of exhaustion in peripheral blood.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Clinical studies have shown that teplizumab binds to CD3 molecules on the surface of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during treatment, with internalisation of the teplizumab/CD3 complex from the surface of T cells. Pharmacodynamic effects include transient lymphopenia with a reduction in circulating T cells with a nadir on the 5 th day of dosing, during a 14-day course of teplizumab treatment (see section 4.4). Teplizumab exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of teplizumab have not been fully characterised.

## Target patient population

Teplizumab is indicated in adult and paediatric patients 8 years of age and older who have a diagnosis of stage 2 T1D.

Stage 2 T1D confirmed by:

- o At least two positive pancreatic islet autoantibodies
- o Dysglycaemia without overt hyperglycaemia

## Clinical efficacy and safety

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The effectiveness of teplizumab was investigated in the following clinical study:

## Study TN-10

A randomised, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled study in 76 patients, 8 to 49 years of age with stage 2 T1D. Stage 2 T1D was defined as having both of the following:

1. Two or more of the following pancreatic islet autoantibodies:
2. o Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD) autoantibodies
3. o Insulin autoantibody (IAA)
4. o Insulinoma-associated antigen 2 autoantibody (IA-2A)
5. o Zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8)
6. o Islet cell autoantibody (ICA)
2. Dysglycaemia on oral glucose tolerance testing

In this study, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive teplizumab or placebo once daily by intravenous infusion for 14 days. The 2 treatment groups were:

- 2 2
- Group 1: Daily intravenous doses of 51 micrograms/m , 103 micrograms/m , 207 micrograms/m 2 , and 413 micrograms/m 2 on study days 0 to 3, respectively, and 1 dose of 826 micrograms/m 2 on each of study days 4 to 13. The total dose for the 14-day course was approximately 9 034 micrograms/m 2 .
- Group 2: Intravenous placebo only.

Patients in the teplizumab group had a total drug exposure that was comparable to the total drug exposure achieved with the recommended total teplizumab dose (see section 4.2 ). The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the time from randomisation to development of stage 3 T1D diagnosis.

## Baseline patient characteristics

In this study, 45% were female and the median age was 14 years (72% were &lt; 18 years old) . Patients' characteristics are displayed in Table 2.

## Efficacy results

In study TN-10, stage 3 T1D was diagnosed in 20 (45%) of the patients treated with teplizumab and in 23 (72%) of the patients treated with placebo. A Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by age and oral glucose tolerance test status at randomisation, showed that the median time from randomisation to stage 3 T1D diagnosis was 50 months in the teplizumab group and 25 months in the placebo group, for a difference of 25 months. With a median follow-up time of 51 months, therapy with teplizumab resulted in a statistically significant delay in the development of stage 3 T1D, hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.78; p=0.0066) (Figure 1).

Study TN-10 was not designed to assess whether there were differences in the effectiveness between subgroups based on demographic characteristics or baseline disease characteristics.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Teizeild containing teplizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of stage 3 type 1 diabetes mellitus as per paediatric investigation plan (PIP) EMEA-000524-PIP02-24, for the granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Steady state concentrations of teplizumab are not expected to be achieved during the 14-day course of teplizumab.

## Absorption

There is no information about absorption since teplizumab is administered intravenously.

## Distribution

No protein binding studies were conducted as teplizumab is a monoclonal antibody.

## Metabolism

Teplizumab is expected to be metabolised into small peptides by catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

The apparent elimination half-life of teplizumab is approximately 3 days.

## Special populations

## Age

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab were observed based on age (8 to 35 years old).

## Gender

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab were observed based on gender.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Race

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab were observed based on racial groups (White, Asian).

## Body weight

BSA-based dosing normalises the exposure to teplizumab across body weight.

## Renal impairment

No specific studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab in patients with renal impairment have been performed.

## Hepatic impairment

No specific studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab in patients with hepatic impairment have been performed.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of teplizumab in children younger than 8 years of age have not been established.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

No studies have been performed to assess the genotoxic, including mutagenic, potential of teplizumab. As an antibody, teplizumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA. No long-term studies have been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of teplizumab. Based on the weight of evidence assessment  and  the  proposed  long  term  immunomodulatory  mode  of  action  a  very  low  potential carcinogenicity risk cannot fully be excluded.

## Developmental and reproductive toxicity

Non-clinical studies conducted in mice using a surrogate antibody directed towards murine CD3 indicate direct or indirect harmful with respect to pregnancy and embryonic/foetal development.

In an embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study in pregnant mice by subcutaneous injection at dose levels of 0, 0.03, 0.3, or 20 mg/kg on gestation days 6, 10, and 14, increase in post-implantation loss occurred in the 20 mg/kg group in the presence of maternal toxicity.

In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in pregnant mice administered every 3 days from gestation day 6 through lactation day 19 at doses of 0, 0.3, 3, or 20 mg/kg, no maternal toxicity or increased incidence of post-implantation loss was observed. Reductions in T cell populations and increases in B cells, and a reduction in the adaptive immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were observed in the offspring on postnatal days 35 and 84 at 20 mg/kg. The surrogate antibody was present in the offspring serum at level less than 1.5% that of maternal serum at the high dose. A trend towards reduction in fertility was observed in the offspring of dams at 20 mg/kg.

Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in female and male mice that received a murine surrogate anti-mouse CD3 antibody administered by the subcutaneous route at doses up to 20 mg/kg.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

Teizeild is supplied in a 2 mL Type 1 borosilicate glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a coloured polypropylene flip-off cap.

Pack sizes of 1, 10 or 14 vials.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Preparation for intravenous administration

- Must dilute Teizeild prior to use. This requires a two-step dilution process.
- In preparation for dilution, inspect the vial visually before use (the solution should be clear and colourless). Do not use if particulate matter or colouration is seen.
- Prepare using aseptic technique. Each vial is intended for single dose only.
- Start the infusion immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, store the diluted solution for infusion (see section 6.3).

## Step 1: Initial dilution (1:10)

- Prepare 18 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection in a:
- o Sterile glass vial or
- o Sterile polyvinylchloride (PVC) with di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) infusion bag or
- o Sterile syringe (polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC) or glass)
- Remove the cap from the vial -this is the preparation start time (see section 6.3).

Based on BSA dosing requirements (e.g. &gt; 1.94 m 2 ), two (2) Teizeild vials may be needed for days 5 through 14.

In this case, to make sure the complete dose for each day is contained in one (1) infusion bag or syringe:

- o Prepare two (2) dilution solutions
- o Add the cumulative volume for the calculated dose to a single infusion bag or syringe
- Remove 2 mL of Teizeild from the vial and slowly add to the 18 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Mix gently by slowly swirling the vial or rocking the infusion bag or syringe. The resulting 20 mL diluted solution contains 100 micrograms (mcg)/mL of teplizumab.
- Calculate patient's BSA (e.g. using the Mosteller formula) before treatment.
- Using the patient's BSA, calculate the dose based on treatment day (see section 4.2).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- Calculate the volume of 100 mcg/mL Teizeild solution (prepared in Step 1) to be further diluted in Step 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Step 2: Final dilution

There are two different methods for intravenous administration of final dilution: infusion bag or syringe pump infusion. Use the appropriate calculation depending on the selected method.

- Infusion bag for intravenous administration:
- o Using an appropriately sized syringe (e.g. 5 mL), withdraw the volume of diluted solution required for that day's calculated dose from the 100 mcg/mL solution (see Step 1: Initial dilution (1:10)).
- o Slowly add contents of the syringe containing the dose to a PVC with DEHP infusion bag containing 25 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Gently rock the infusion bag to ensure that the solution mixes sufficiently. Do not shake.
- o Infusion administration has a minimum duration of 30 minutes. Rate may be slowed for patient's tolerability.
- Syringe (PP, PC or glass) for intravenous infusion via syringe pump [Concentration range 15 mcg/mL to 60 mcg/mL]:
- o Calculate the maximum volume that can be administrated for the calculated dose (based on treatment day, dose and patient BSA) using a minimum infusion concentration of 15 mcg/mL.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- o Calculate the volume of saline to be added to the infusion syringe:
- a) If the calculated maximum volume to be administered is ≤ 60 mL:

VolumeSaline ( mL ) =  Volume Infusion ( mL ) -  Volume initial dilution, 1:10 ( mL )

- b) If the calculated maximum volume to be administered exceeds 60 mL -the maximum infusion volume is capped at 60 mL.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- o Measure the appropriate volume of saline and transfer it to the infusion syringe.
- o Using an appropriately sized syringe (e.g. 5 mL), withdraw the volume of diluted Teizeild solution calculated above (see volume of initial dilution, 1:10) and add it to the infusion syringe.
- o Gently rock the infusion syringe to ensure that the solution mixes sufficiently. Do not shake.
- o Attach infusion syringe to a syringe pump. The syringe pump should support rates as low as 1 mL/hour.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Run infusion with syringe pump -do not manually push the syringe . Calculate the infusion rate (to ensure a minimum of 30 minutes). The maximum infusion rate should be 2 mL/min (maximum 120 mL/hour). The actual rate will vary based on the volume of infusion, as shown below.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- o Infusion administration has a minimum duration of 30 minutes. Rate may be slowed for patient's tolerability.

These steps may be followed if using a sterile glass vial for dilution preparation instead of a syringe (for intravenous infusion via syringe pump). An overfill should be considered as part of the calculations.

Disposal

The unused portion of remaining diluted Teizeild solution in the PVC with DEHP infusion bag, syringe or sterile glass vial should be discarded.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Teizeild is and what it is used for

Teizeild is a medicine that contains the active substance teplizumab. Teplizumab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a target.

Teizeild is used in adults and children 8 years of age and older who have stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D). It is used to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in these patients.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune condition that occurs when your own immune system (the body's natural defences) mistakenly attacks cells in the pancreas (called beta cells) that make insulin (a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood). Over time, this leads to a complete lack of insulin in the body.

T1D develops in three stages. In stage 1 T1D, your blood sugar levels are normal and you don't have any symptoms. In stage 2 T1D, your blood sugar levels start to increase and become abnormal. In stage 3 T1D, your body cannot make enough insulin on its own to control your blood sugar and you need insulin treatment to manage the condition.

Before starting treatment with Teizeild your doctor will confirm that you have stage 2 T1D by ensuring that you test positive for 2 or more autoantibodies (a type of protein made by the immune system indicating the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas) and have dysglycaemia without persistently high blood sugar levels (overt hyperglycaemia).

The active substance in Teizeild, teplizumab, binds to an activating molecule on the surface of T cells (a type of white blood cell) known as CD3. By binding to CD3, teplizumab deactivates the T cells that attack and destroy beta cells which helps to preserve beta cell function and slows down the progression of T1D.

If you have any questions on how Teizeild works or about your treatment with Teizeild, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Teizeild

## You must not be given Teizeild

- if you are allergic to teplizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about all your medical conditions before you are given Teizeild, including if you:

- have a serious infection -or an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back.
- have recently had or are planning to have a vaccine. Teizeild may affect how well a vaccine works. Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist that you are being treated with Teizeild before having a vaccine. Depending on the type of vaccine, your doctor will tell you when you can safely receive any vaccine prior to and after the treatment with Teizeild.

## After you have been given Teizeild

Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following:

- Fever, nausea, tiredness, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) or increased liver enzymes in your blood, which may be signs and symptoms of a serious condition known as cytokine release syndrome (see section 4 'Possible side effects') .
- Fever, chills, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, swollen lymph nodes or a painful, swollen lump that feels warm (abscess). These may be symptoms of an infection (see section 4 'Possible side effects') .
- Hives, rash, joint pain or swelling, itching, dizziness, wheezing, difficulty breathing or swelling of your tongue and lips. These may be symptoms of allergic reactions (see section 4 'Possible side effects') .

Teizeild may lower your lymphocyte count, a type of white blood cells that helps fight infections (see section 4 'Possible side effects') .

Your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver and your complete blood counts before you start treatment and during treatment with Teizeild.

## Patient Guide

Your doctor will provide you with a patient guide that includes information about possible side effects, their symptoms, and instructions on what to do if they occur. Read it carefully and ask your doctor if you have any questions about your treatment.

## Children

The safety and efficacy of Teizeild in children under 8 years of age have not been established.

## Other medicines and Teizeild

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. Teizeild may harm your unborn baby.

- Teizeild is not recommended during pregnancy and in women who can have children who are not using contraception (birth control).

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed. It is not known if Teizeild passes into your breast milk and if it can harm your baby.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Teizeild contains sodium and polysorbate 80

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

This medicine contains 0.10 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial which is equivalent to 0.05 mg/mL. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you or your child have any known allergies.

## 3. How Teizeild is given

Teizeild should be given to you by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support needed to manage serious side effects. Teizeild is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein (intravenous (IV)).

Your doctor will determine your dose of Teizeild based on your body surface area, which is a way of measuring the total area of your skin.

## How often Teizeild is given

You will be given the infusion once a day for 14 days. Each infusion will last a minimum of 30 minutes.

For the first 5 days of treatment, your doctor or nurse will give you other medicines by mouth to reduce your risk of developing cytokine release syndrome.

These medicines include:

- ibuprofen or naproxen -or other medicines for fever such as paracetamol
- an antihistamine -a medicine used to treat allergies
- an anti-nausea medicine.

## If you are given more Teizeild than you should

If you are given too much Teizeild, your doctor will treat and monitor any side effects you may have.

## If you miss a Teizeild infusion

If you miss a scheduled infusion, your doctor or nurse will continue your treatment on the next scheduled day. You will not get 2 infusions on the same day.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- In preparation for dilution, inspect the vial visually before use (the solution should be clear and colourless). Do not use if particulate matter or colouration is seen.
- Prepare using aseptic technique. Each vial is intended for single dose only.
- Start the infusion immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, store the diluted solution for infusion (see package leaflet, section 'How to store Teizeild').

## Step 1: Initial dilution (1:10)

- Prepare 18 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection in a:
- o Sterile glass vial or
- o Sterile polyvinylchloride (PVC) with di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) infusion bag or
- o Sterile syringe (polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC) or glass)
- Remove the cap from the vial -this is the preparation start time.

Based on BSA dosing requirements (e.g. &gt; 1.94 m 2 ), two (2) Teizeild vials may be needed for days 5 through 14.

In this case, to make sure the complete dose for each day is contained in one (1) infusion bag or syringe:

- o Prepare two (2) dilution solutions
- o Add the cumulative volume for the calculated dose to a single infusion bag or syringe
- Remove 2 mL of Teizeild from the vial and slowly add to the 18 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Mix gently by slowly swirling the vial or rocking the infusion bag or syringe. The resulting 20 mL diluted solution contains 100 micrograms (mcg)/mL of teplizumab.
- Calculate patient's BSA (e.g. using the Mosteller formula) before treatment.
- Using the patient's BSA, calculate the dose based on treatment day (see section 4.2).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- Calculate the volume of 100 mcg/mL Teizeild solution (prepared in Step 1) to be further diluted in Step 2.

Volume of initial dilution, 1:10 (mL) = Dose (x mcg) 100

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 2: Final dilution

There are two different methods for intravenous administration of final dilution: infusion bag or syringe pump infusion. Use the appropriate calculation depending on the selected method.

- Infusion bag for intravenous administration:
- o Using an appropriately sized syringe (e.g. 5 mL), withdraw the volume of diluted solution required for that day's calculated dose from the 100 mcg/mL solution (see Step 1: Initial dilution (1:10)).
- o Slowly add contents of the syringe containing the dose to a PVC with DEHP infusion bag containing 25 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Gently rock the infusion bag to ensure that the solution mixes sufficiently. Do not shake.
- o Infusion administration has a minimum duration of 30 minutes. Rate may be slowed for patient's tolerability.
- Syringe (PP, PC or glass) for intravenous infusion via syringe pump [Concentration range 15 mcg/mL to 60 mcg/mL]:
- o Calculate the maximum volume that can be administrated for the calculated dose (based on treatment day, dose and patient BSA) using a minimum infusion concentration of 15 mcg/mL.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- o Calculate the volume of saline to be added to the infusion syringe:
- a) If the calculated maximum volume to be administered is ≤ 60 mL:

VolumeSaline ( mL ) = VolumeInfusion ( mL ) -  Volume initial dilution, 1:10 ( mL )

- b) If the calculated maximum volume to be administered exceeds 60 mL -the maximum infusion volume is capped at 60 mL.

VolumeSaline ( mL ) = 60 mL -  Volume initial dilution, 1:10 ( mL )

- o Measure the appropriate volume of saline and transfer it to the infusion syringe.
- o Using an appropriately sized syringe (e.g. 5 mL), withdraw the volume of diluted Teizeild solution calculated above (see volume of initial dilution, 1:10) and add it to the infusion syringe.
- o Gently rock the infusion syringe to ensure that the solution mixes sufficiently. Do not shake.
- o Attach infusion syringe to a syringe pump. The syringe pump should support rates as low as 1 mL/hour.
- o Run infusion with syringe pump -do not manually push the syringe . Calculate the infusion rate (to ensure a minimum of 30 minutes). The maximum infusion rate should be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2 mL/min (maximum 120 mL/hour). The actual rate will vary based on the volume of infusion, as shown below.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- o Infusion administration has a minimum duration of 30 minutes. Rate may be slowed for patient's tolerability.

These steps may be followed if using a sterile glass vial for dilution preparation instead of a syringe (for intravenous infusion via syringe pump). An overfill should be considered as part of the calculations.

## Disposal

The unused portion of remaining diluted Teizeild solution in the PVC with DEHP infusion bag, syringe or sterile glass vial should be discarded.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
