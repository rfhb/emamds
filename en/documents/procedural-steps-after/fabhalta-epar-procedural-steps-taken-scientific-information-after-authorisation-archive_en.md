1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

APPEAR-C3G is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan in patients with C3G. The study included a 6-month blinded, placebo-controlled period, followed by a 6-month period in which all patients receive open-label iptacopan (total study duration of 12 months). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated in accordance. Version 2.3 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.
