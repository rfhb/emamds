## I. INTRODUCTION

On December 2, 2010, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study number: 10PN-PD-DIT-063

Study  title:  A  phase  III,  controlled,  single-blind  study  to  assess  the  reactogenicity,  safety  and immunogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent  pneumococcal conjugate  vaccine  or  Prevenar™  when  co-administered  with  Hiberix™  at  12-18  months  of  age  in children primed with the same vaccines in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

Study number: 10PN-PD-DIT-063

Study title: A phase III, controlled, single-blind study to assess the reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Prevenar™ when co-administered with Hiberix™ at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036

##  Description

This study was conducted by 14 principal investigators in Korea.

##  Methods

## Objective(s)

Primary:

- To assess the reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in terms of the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) with grade 3 intensity, when co-administered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

Secondary:

- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when coadministered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.
- To assess the immunogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when coadministered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age in children primed with the same vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

## Study design

- This was a phase III, multi-centre, single-blind, controlled study with 2 parallel groups:
-  10Pn group: subjects previously primed with 3 doses of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine and with Hiberix in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036 and receiving a booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT and Hiberix at 12-18 months of age.
-  Prev group: subjects previously primed with 3 doses of Prevenar and with Hiberix in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036 and receiving a booster dose of Prevenar and Hiberix at 12-18 months of age.
- Control: Prev group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Vaccination schedule: a booster dose of either 10Pn-PD-DiT or Prevenar co-administered with Hiberix at 12-18 months of age.
- One blood sample was collected one month post-booster vaccination.
- Type of study: booster vaccination study of primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

## Study population /Sample size

## Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion:

- Subjects for whom the investigator believed that their parent(s)/guardian(s) could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol.
- Male or female between, and including, 12-18 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination.
- Subjects who received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT036.
- Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the child/ward.
- Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.

The sample size was contingent on the number of subjects who received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-036. Assuming that around 20% of these subjects did not enter this study, it could be considered that approximately 400 subjects (300 in group 10Pn and 100 subjects in group Prev) received the booster dose of study vaccines.

This sample size had at least 80% power to detect a difference between the considered 10Pn group and Prev group in terms of percentage of subjects with grade 3 adverse event.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fifty three subjects (37 from the 10Pn group and 16 from the Prev group) did not participate in the booster vaccination study for the following reasons:

- 18 subjects (12 in the 10Pn group and 6 in the Prev group) were not eligible.
- 19 subjects (15 in the 10Pn group and 4 in the Prev group) were lost to follow-up.
- 6 subjects (4 in the 10Pn group and 2 in the Prev group) did not fill in a tracking document (so missing information for them).
- 10 subjects (6 in the 10Pn group and 4 in the Prev group) did not want to participate (not because of AE or SAE).
- Baseline data

## Demography:

In the Total vaccinated cohort, the mean age at booster vaccination was 13.6 months (standard deviation of 1.05), 99.8% of subjects were Asian (East Asian heritage) and 50.7% of subjects were female.

## Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity:

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the Total vaccinated cohort. The immunogenicity results for the Total vaccinated cohort were consistent with those for ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

## Booster immune response to the pneumococcal antigens - descriptive analysis results:

- One month post-booster vaccination, for each of the 7 common serotypes contained in 10PnPD-DiT and Prevenar, at least 97.5% of subjects in the 10Pn group and at least 98.0% of subjects in the Prev group had antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL. For each of the 3 additional serotypes (1, 5, 7F), the observed percentage of subjects in the 10Pn group with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL was 100% for serotype 5 and 99.7% for serotypes 1 and 7F.
- A trend towards higher antibody GMCs was observed one month post-booster vaccination compared to the post-primary vaccination in both groups, for each of the serotypes for which subjects were primed.
- One month post-booster vaccination, the observed antibody GMCs were higher in the Prev group compared to the 10Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs) for each of the 7 common serotypes except for serotype 18C and 19F. For serotype 18C, the antibody GMC was in the same range in both groups and for serotype 19F, the antibody GMC was higher in the 10Pn group compared to the Prev group (no overlap of 95% CI). This trend was consistent with what was observed in the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.

- The observed post-booster OPA GMTs were higher in the Prev group compared to the 10Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs) for each of the 7 common serotypes except for serotype 19F for which OPA GMT was higher in the 10Pn group compared to the Prev group (no overlap of 95% CI). This trend was consistent with what was observed in the primary vaccination study 10PNPD-DIT-036.

- One month post-booster vaccination, 99.4% of subjects had measurable anti-protein D antibodies concentrations (≥ 100 EL.U/mL) in the 10Pn group. A trend towards lower antiprotein D antibody GMC was observed post-booster vaccination compared to post-primary vaccination in the 10Pn group.

## Booster immune response to the co-administered Hib polysaccharide PRP antigen - descriptive analysis results

One month post-booster vaccination, all subjects in both groups had seroprotective anti-PRP antibody concentrations (≥1.0 μg/mL). A trend toward higher anti-PRP antibody GMCs was observed in the 10Pn group compared to the Prev group.

## Safety results

The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on the ATP cohort. The results for the ATP cohort for safety were in line with those for the Total vaccinated cohort. Overall incidence of adverse events:

- During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, 76.8% and 77.9% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups respectively reported at least one AE (solicited and unsolicited, local and general).
- Regarding the primary endpoint, 12.7% and 11.5% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups respectively reported at least one grade 3 AE (solicited and unsolicited, local and general). Local grade 3 AEs (11.4% and 10.6% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups respectively) tended to be more frequent than general grade 3 AEs (2.1% and 1.8% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups respectively).

## Solicited local adverse events:

- Redness was the most frequently reported solicited local AE during the 4-day post-booster vaccination period in both groups (42.8% of subjects in the 10Pn group and 48.7% in the Prev group).
- Observed incidences of any solicited local AEs were within the same ranges in both groups.
- Low incidences of grade 3 pain and swelling were reported, ranging from 0.0% (for pain) to 4.2% (for swelling), whatever the group. Although grade 3 redness seemed to be reported more frequently, the incidences were within the same range in both groups (9.0% and 10.6% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively).
- Four subjects reported large swelling reactions following booster vaccination (all in the 10Pn group). Two of the four large swelling reactions were reported at the Hiberix injection site and 2 at the 10Pn- PD-DiT injection site. All the large swelling reactions were localized swelling at the injection site, not involving the adjacent joints and all resolved without sequelae.

## Solicited general adverse events:

- Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general AE in both groups (42.5% of subjects in the 10Pn group and 37.2% in the Prev group).
- Observed incidences of any solicited general AEs were within the same ranges in both groups.
- A low incidence of grade 3 solicited general AEs was reported and ranged from 0.0% to 1.8% (for irritability) whatever the group. Grade 3 fever (axillary temperature &gt; 39.5°C) was reported by one subject in the Prev group.
- Note: Tympanic measurement was the preferred route of temperature measurement. The statistical tables are standardized and present the axillary measurement. From the point of view of the validity of data, temperature values measured using tympanic route are considered equivalent to those measured using the axillary route.
- A low incidence of grade 3 solicited general AEs considered as causally related to vaccination by the investigator, was reported and ranged from 0.0% to 1.5% (for irritability) whatever the group.

10Pn=10Pn-PD-DiT+Hiberix

Prev=Prevenar+Hiberix

N=number of subjects with the documented dose

n/%= number/percentage of subjects reporting at least once the symptom

95%Cl=Exact 95% confidence interval; LL =lower limit, UL = upper limit

## Unsolicited adverse events:

- Upper respiratory tract infection was the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in both groups.
- 35.2% and 36.3% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively, reported at least one unsolicited AE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.6% and 4.4% of subjects in the 10Pn and Prev groups, respectively, reported at least one unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination.
- Only one subject (0.3%) in the 10Pn group reported a grade 3 unsolicited AE (i.e. vomiting) which was considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination.

## Serious adverse events:

- No fatal events were reported during the study period.
- Twelve subjects reported at least one SAE during the study period: 8 out of 335 vaccinated subjects (2.4%) in the 10Pn group and 4 out of 113 vaccinated subjects (3.5%) in the Prev group.
- None of the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all SAEs resolved without sequelae.

## Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events:

No subject was withdrawn from the study due to a non-serious AE or a SAE.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## MAH Conclusions:

- The observed incidences of grade 3 AEs (solicited and unsolicited, local and general) as well as the incidences of any solicited local and general AEs were within the same ranges in both groups.
- Incidences of reported grade 3 local symptoms, ranged from 0.0% (for pain) to 10.6% (for redness), whatever the group.
- Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general AEs were reported, ranging from 0.0% to 1.8% whatever the group. No grade 3 fever (axillary temperature &gt; 39.5°C) was reported in subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine.
- Only one subject (0.3%) in the 10Pn group reported a grade 3 unsolicited AEs, which was considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination.
- 8 out of 335 vaccinated subjects (2.4%) in the 10Pn group and 4 out of 113 vaccinated subjects (3.5%) in the Prev group reported at least one SAE during the study period. None of the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all SAEs resolved without sequelae. No fatal events were reported during the entire study period.
- One month post-booster vaccination, in the group boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT, at least 97.5% of subjects had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL and at least 94.6% of subjects had OPA titres ≥8 for each of the 10 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes. These percentages were at least 98.0% and 97.7% of subjects in the group boosted with Prevenar for each of the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes.
- The observed antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher for subjects boosted with Prevenar compared to 10Pn-PD-DiT (no overlap of 95% CIs), for each of the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes except for serotype 18C (for which the antibody GMC was in the same range in both groups) and 19F (for which the antibody GMC and OPA GMT were higher in subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT compared to Prevenar). This trend was consistent with what was observed in the primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-036.
- One month post-booster vaccination, 99.4% of subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT had measurable anti-protein D antibody concentrations (≥100 EL.U/mL).
- In both groups, all subjects reached seroprotective anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL, one month post-booster vaccination.
- The 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine was immunogenic and well tolerated when given as a booster (fourth) dose at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Hiberix in Korean children primed with the same vaccines.
