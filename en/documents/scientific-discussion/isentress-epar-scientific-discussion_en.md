## 1. Introduction

At the end of 2005 it was estimated that approximately 40 million people are living worldwide with an infection  with  the  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  or  AIDS  (acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome with HIV being the etiologic agent). AIDS continues to be a leading cause of mortality with approximately 3 million deaths per year.

Treatment for HIV infection has evolved rapidly and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease in mortality and morbidity so that HIV infection is now managed as a chronic disease. However, HAART is still limited by intolerance of complicated dosing regimens, long-term toxicities and multi-drug resistance.

In  particular  intra-class  resistance  has  become  common  and  often  limits  the  choice  and  efficacy  of antiretroviral  therapies  (ARTs)  for  patients  failing  their  current  regimens.  In  patients  infected  with multi-drug  resistant  virus  therapy  is  more  successful  if  an  agent  from  an  ART  class  to  which  the patient has not been previously exposed is combined with at least one other active ART. Therefore, the development of ARTs with novel mechanisms of action remains very important, especially for those with few remaining treatment options.

ISENTRESS  contains  raltegravir  as  active  substance.  Raltegravir  blocks  HIV-1  replication  by inhibiting the strand transfer activity of the HIV-encoded enzyme integrase and as such is an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (InSTI). Integration of the viral genome is an essential and characteristic step in  the  life  cycle  of  all  retroviruses  including  HIV-1.  The  rationale  behind  the  development  of ISENTRESS is that the  inhibition  of  the  HIV  integrase  represents  a  new  therapeutic  target  for  the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

A so-called full application has been submitted for the marketing authorisation. The assessment was made under accelerated timetable based on a request from the applicant. The CHMP did accept this request as it was considered that there is an unmet medical need for a novel antiretroviral agent that can deliver efficacy against  multiple drug resistant HIV and that the information provided with the request  for  accelerated  assessment  suggested  that  raltegravir  may  indeed  meet  this  unmet  need. Therefore, it was possible to concur that there could be a potential for raltegravir to constitute a major public  health  interest  based  on  its  potential  to  benefit  HIV-infected  patients  with  few  remaining treatment options.

In the initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) the applicant did not apply for a conditional marketing  authorisation.  During  the  evaluation  however  the  CHMP  considered  -  after  having consulted  with  the  applicant  -  that  the  application  would  meet  the  criteria  for  conditional  approval according to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 in conjunction with Commission Regulation (EC) 507/2006:

- -ISENTRESS is proposed to be indicated for  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection,  which  is  a  lifethreatening disease, and so falls within the scope of the legislative framework on conditional marketing authorisations as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) 507/2006.
- -In  support  of  the  MAA  the  applicant  provided  complete  24-week  data  from  two  Phase  3 studies.  Comprehensive  clinical  data  up  to  48  weeks  would  be  needed  to  further  assess important  issues  including  long-term  viral  suppression,  the  safety  profile  and  the  resistance pattern. Such data will be generated but were not available in the timeframe of the assessment. In addition, it was considered that further monitoring of resistance to raltegravir and the risk for malignancies is required.
- -Based  on  the  available  data  the  risk-benefit  analysis  was  considered  to  be  positive.  The product fulfils an unmet medical need as it has a novel mechanism of action that results in activity  against  HIV  that  is  resistant  to  many  other  antiretroviral  agents.  It  likely  has  an acceptable safety profile and a limited potential for drug interactions. On this basis it could be considered that the benefit to public health of allowing ISENTRESS to be marketed without

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

undue delay may outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Therefore, the application fulfilled the requirements for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) 507/2006.

ISENTRESS is available in film-coated tablet containing 400 mg of raltegravir (as potassium). The recommended dosage is 400 mg administered twice daily.

The  initially  claimed  indication  was  'ISENTRESS  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatmentexperienced patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy.'

The approved indication is:

'ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatment-experienced adult patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing anti-retroviral therapy.

This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 24 weeks duration in treatment-experienced patients (see section 5.1)'

## 2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

ISENTRESS  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  the  active  substance  raltegravir  as  the potassium  salt.  The  applicant  has  utilised  a  design  space  approach  in  developing  both  the  drug substance and drug product.

## Active Substance

Raltegravir is N -[(4-Fluorophenyl)methyl]-1,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[1-methyl-1-[[(5methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)carbonyl]amino]ethyl]-6-oxo-4-pyrimidinecarboxamide monopotassium salt.  It  is  a  white  powder,  soluble  in  water,  slightly  soluble  in  methanol,  very  slightly  soluble  in acetonitrile  and  ethanol  and  insoluble  in  isopropyl  alcohol.  It  has  no  chiral  centres  although polymorphism is observed.  Concerning lipophilicity of raltegravir in terms of octanol/water partition, the Dow and LogDow results at pH=7.4 are 2.80 ± 0.08 and 0.45 ± 0.01, respectively.

## · Manufacture

Raltegravir is manufactured utilizing a commercial process that is well described and the potentially critical parameters have been investigated and controls applied as appropriate.

The active ingredient has been fully characterised by conventional spectroscopic techniques. Three polymorphic  forms  have  been  identified.  The  synthetic  route  routinely  results  in  the  commercially marketed form, distinguishable by melting point and XRPD.

Based on laboratory runs the optimum synthetic conditions have been defined using a 'design space' concept. Further studies have investigated the main critical variables and there is evidence of a good understanding  of  the  process,  which  in  turn  has  enabled  the  design  space  limits  for  each  step  of synthesis to be defined within agreed boundaries.

## · Specification

The specification includes relevant tests with justified limits for identification (IR, flame test for K + ), assay (HPLC), residual solvents, and mean particle size.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Potential impurities, including process impurities, degradation products as well as potential contaminants  such  as,  residual  solvents  have  been  investigated  in  detail.  Analytical  methods  are acceptable  and  generally,  appropriate  validation  data  have  been  provided.  The  limits  proposed  for individual impurity limits are acceptable and all specified impurities are either qualified or below the qualification threshold.

## · Stability

High  stress  studies  have  served  to  identify  potential  degradants  and  the  active  substance  has  been studied under ICH storage conditions.  Results at 25°C/60% RH, and 40°C/75% RH for three drug substance lots manufactured using the commercial process are provided and the data confirm that there are no significant degradation products observed for the drug substance when stored in the proposed containers. A justified retest period has been defined and agreed.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Based on an in situ rat intestinal perfusion study, the measured permeability of raltegravir was similar to  that  of  the  high  permeability  reference  compound  metoprolol.  Raltegravir  is  classified  as  a  BCS class II compound, i.e. high permeability and low solubility at physiological pH.

Bearing this in mind, the aim of the development program has been to develop a robust formulation and  manufacturing  process  using  by  defining  a  design  space  (as  for  the  synthesis  of  the  active substance), and comprehensive studies have been carried out with this approach.

The  formulation  of  the  tablet  is  standard,  based  on  a  matrix  of  microcrystalline  cellulose,  lactose monohydrate,  calcium  phosphate  dibasic,  hypromellose  and  poloxamer  407.  The  excipients  were selected  to  provide  a  tablet  that  would  erode  rather  than  disintegrate  with  physical  and  chemical stability  and  appropriate  dissolution  characteristics.  The  tablet  cores  were  film-coated  to  mask  the bitter taste of the active ingredient using a conventional 'OpadryTM' formulation with good adhesion properties.

A number of prototype formulations were investigated in  vivo .  The  study  results  indicated  that  the plasma concentration profile for the chosen 400 mg formulation showed a flatter profile, with lower Cmax  and  longer  Tmax,  consistent  with  formulation  design  considerations  in  line  with  the  intended desirable  profile.  Based  on  the  positive  pharmacokinetic  data  and  results  from  the  biocomparison study, this formulation was selected as the candidate for development to a market formulation.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Raltegravir Tablets are manufactured utilizing a standard commercial process that is commonly used for  film-coated  tablets  of  this  type.  It  is  well  described  and  the  potentially  critical  parameters  have been investigated and controls applied as appropriate.

## · Product Specification

The product specification includes tests with validated limits for identity (NIR/HPLC), assay (HPLC) degradation products (HPLC), dose uniformity, dissolution, microbial contamination etc.

Batch analytical profiles confirm the satisfactory uniformity of the product.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies have been performed in line with current CHMP/ICH guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The packaged product was stored at the long term conditions of 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH and at  the  accelerated  condition  of  40°C/75%RH.  One  of  the  batches  was  evaluated  for  photostability. Results were available for at least 52 weeks for samples stored at 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH and for at least 6 months for batches stored at 40°C/75%RH. No significant changes were observed after storage under these conditions with no significant photodegradation.

Overall, the accumulated stability data confirm the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Comprehensive information has been presented to show that the development and manufacture of the active  substance  and  finished  product  are  sound  and  satisfactory.  The  applicant  has  taken  the opportunity  to  define  a  workable  design  space  for  the  active  substance  and  product,  based  on  an understanding of relevant processes in both cases. Satisfactory batch control specifications are in place and batch analytical data confirm the satisfactory uniformity of the product, and this in turn indicates that  the  product  should  perform  consistently  in  the  clinic,  from  batch  to  batch.  The  accumulated stability data have been used to support a validated retest period and shelf-life and storage conditions.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

A comprehensive set of nonclinical toxicity studies was conducted prior to and in parallel with the clinical programme. These studies included acute and repeated dose oral studies, safety pharmacology studies, a battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and developmental and reproductive toxicity  studies.  The  rat  and  dog  were  chosen  as  the  preclinical  toxicology  species  for  raltegravir development.

The pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with current international good laboratory  practice  (GLP)  standards.  Amongst  the  toxicokinetic  studies  the  quantification  of  the glucuronide  metabolite  of  raltegravir  in  plasma  was  not  GLP-compliant.  Also,  in  the  repeat  dose toxicity  studies  in  the  dog  the  determination  of  the  concentration  of  copper  in  the  bile  was  not conducted under GLP conditions. However, this was not considered to be critical for the assessment.

## Pharmacology

The mode of action related to antiviral activity and resistance aspects is also discussed in the section 'Clinical aspects, Pharmacodynamics'.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

## Integrase inhibition

The ability of raltegravir to inhibit the enzymatic activity of purified recombinant HIV-1 integrase was evaluated  in  an in  vitro assay.  Using  a  pre-assembled  complex  of  HIV-1  integrase  with  a  doublestranded 'donor' oligonucleotide mimicking one end of the mature HIV-1 cDNA the assay measured the  ability  of  integrase  to  catalyse  the  covalent  joining  or  strand  transfer  of  the  donor  DNA  into  a target  DNA. Raltegravir inhibited this reaction with an apparent IC50 of approximately 10 nM. The results indicated that raltegravir inhibits the third step of the integration process (i.e. strand transfer) and is therefore designated an Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (InSTI).

## Activity against laboratory and primary HIV-1 isolates

Antiviral  assays  were  multiple-cycle  replication  assays  in  which  replication  was  detected  by measuring the accumulation of HIV-1 and -2 gag proteins (p24 and p27) in cell culture supernatant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fluids.

- -Raltegravir  inhibited  replication  of  the  laboratory  HIV-1  isolate  H9IIIB  in  MT4  cells  with  a 95% cell inhibitory concentration (CIC95) of 18.7 ± 14 nM (n=77) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
- -In the presence of 50% normal human serum the apparent antiviral activity of raltegravir against H9IIIB was reduced with a CIC95 of 31 ± 20 nM (n=90).
- -The  15  primary  HIV-1  isolates  tested  included  six  subtypes  representing  both  syncytiuminducing and non-syncytium-inducing isolates. Raltegravir inhibited replication of these isolates in primary human PBMCs in the presence of 20% FBS with CIC95 values from 6 to 50 nM.
- -Raltegravir inhibited replication of a laboratory HIV-2 isolate in CEMx174 cells and 10% FBS with an average CIC95 of 6.3 nM.

## Antiviral mechanism of raltegravir in cell culture

Cells  from  the  human  T  cell  line  SupT1  were  infected  with  a  laboratory  HIV-1  isolate  with  and without 1 µM raltegravir. The progress of infection was evaluated at different times using a series of quantitative PCR assays to measure the abundance of various HIV-1 DNA forms.

Raltegravir at 1 µ M did not significantly inhibit the synthesis of HIV-1 DNA, but 1 µ M raltegravir reduced  detectable  integration  at  48  hr  by  approximately  50-fold.  In  addition,  the  presence  of raltegravir  resulted  in  a  15.8-fold  increase  in  the  abundance  of  2-LTR  circles  as  consequence  of reduced integration activity.

## Mutations in HIV-1 integrase that reduce susceptibility to raltegravir

The potential for HIV-1 to develop resistance to raltegravir was evaluated by culturing a laboratory HIV-1 isolate in human T lymphoid H9 cells in increasing concentrations of the agent over a period of months. Viruses able to replicate in higher concentrations of raltegravir emerged at the end of most passages and were characterised in detail by amplifying and molecularly cloning their integrase genes and determining the nucleotide sequences. A series of specific amino acid changes occurred over time during culture in increasing raltegravir concentrations.

The first change observed was Q148K, which arose during growth in 25 to 50 nM i.e. exceeding the IC95. After passage in 1 µM, mutations E138A and G140A were sequentially incorporated. Additional mutations in the integrase gene appeared increasing raltegravir concentrations suggesting correlation of raltegravir with the appearance of mutations in the integrase gene.

The  introduction  of  observed  mutations  in  a  wild-type  HIV-1  isolate  and  the  testing  of  resultant viruses  in  a  single-cycle  HIV-1  infectivity  assay  showed  that  the  Q148K,  E138A/Q148  and E138A/G140A/Q148K  mutations  resulted  in  average  fold-shift  IC50  values  of  46-fold,  90-fold  and 508-fold, respectively.

Other mutations were observed in the integrase genes of viruses isolated from HIV-1-infected patients who  failed  ART  regimens  including  raltegravir.  These  mutations,  including  the  primary  mutations N155H, Q148H, and Q148R, each conferred a greater than 10-fold increase in the IC50.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Raltegravir  was  evaluated  in  a  series  of in  vitro assays  to  investigate  its  potential  to  act  on  human targets. The evaluation of specificity of raltegravir in RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase activity assay showed that raltegravir is not an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase polymerase activity at the highest concentration tested (100 µM-IC50 &gt; 50 µM).

In an in vitro biochemical assay to test inhibition of RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, no  relevant  activity  of  raltegravir  up  to  25  µM  (the  highest  concentration  tested)  was  observed. Inhibition  of  HIV-1  reverse  transcription  is,  therefore,  not  responsible  for  the  antiviral  activity  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

raltegravir (IC50 &gt; 25 µM). Raltegravir did not inhibit human DNA polymerases α , β ,  or γ by more than 50% at the highest concentration tested (i.e., IC50 &gt;50 µM for each of the three polymerases).

Raltegravir  was  also  tested  in  a  series  of  enzyme  activity  assays,  transporter  assays,  and  receptorligand  displacement  assays.  Raltegravir  did  not  significantly  inhibit  any  of  the  166  enzymes, transporters and receptors included in the screening panel (IC50 &gt; 10 µM for all assays).

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Three GLP compliant studies to evaluate effects of raltegravir on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems were performed.

- -A cardiovascular  telemetry  study,  performed  in  dogs,  after  a  single  5,  15  or  45  mg/kg  dose, resulted  in  the  absence  of  any  change  in  cardiovascular  indices  attributable  to  raltegravir treatment, reaching Cmax of 3.6, 10 and 25 µM, respectively, at 1 hour after dosing.
- -Raltegravir  potential  to  affect  respiratory  or  neurobehavioural  system  was  tested  following single oral administration of 30, 90 or 120 mg/kg to Sprague Dawley rats. Both studies showed that  raltegravir  does  not  induce  any  treatment  related  changes.  A  maximum  concentration  of approximately 30 µM was reached at the highest dose, as estimated from toxicokinetic data.

Ancillary pharmacology studies were performed to determine the effects of raltegravir in cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal function in dogs, and CNS and gastrointestinal motility in mice. Single or multiple IV or oral doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg/kg of in dogs showed that: (i) raltegravir do not  affect  mean  arterial  pressure,  heart  rate  or  cardiac  intervals  (PR,  QRS,  QTc)  in  dogs;  (ii)  the respiratory  function,  evaluated  by  respiratory  ventilation,  mechanics,  blood  pH,  arterial  gases, haemostasis or platelet function is not affected by raltegravir; (iii) with respect to the renal function, raltegravir does not induce treatment related changes in renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration, urine excretion, sodium and potassium excretion. The effects of raltegravir on the CNS in CD-1 mice after a single  100  mg/kg dose administration showed that raltegravir did not affect behaviour, locomotion, grip strength in this study.

Gastrointestinal motility was evaluated in CD-1 mice after administration of a single 10 or 30 mg/kg oral dose. No treatment-related effect on gastrointestinal motility at 10 mg/kg was observed, while an increase  in  gastrointestinal  motility  resulted  at  the  highest  dose.  This  is  of  minimal  toxicological significance  to  humans  as  confirmed  by  the  absence  of  signs  of  increased  intestinal  transit  in  the completed chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs and in human clinical trials.

An additional cellular electrophysiological in vitro evaluation of a HIV Integrase Inhibitor on HERG was  performed,  on  CHO-K1  cells.  Raltegravir  had  a  very  small  effect  on  HERG  current  at concentrations of 30 µ M (0.94 ± 0.02  of  control,  n=8,  for  both  voltage  step  and  voltage  ramp)  and 100 µ M  (0.84 ± 0.04  of  control,  n=6,  voltage  step;  0.84 ± 0.06  of  control,  n=6,  voltage  ramp). Raltegravir inhibited the HERG current by 16 % ± 4 % at the highest testable concentration of 100 µ M when elicited with 2 voltage-clamp protocols, a voltage step or voltage ramp.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

To assess the potential for synergy or antagonism, the antiviral activity of raltegravir was evaluated in cell  culture  in  combination  with  18  licensed  antiviral  agents  from  all  4  classes  (protease  inhibitors, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and  entry  inhibitor).  Each  antiviral  agent,  including  raltegravir,  was  tested  over  a  wide  range  of concentrations spanning its IC50 in the replication assay.

The results showed that when both test compounds were present at lower concentrations (below the 95%  cell  culture inhibitory concentration), the effect of adding  raltegravir to other licensed antiretroviral agents was null or additive. At higher compound concentrations, typically in excess of their IC50 values, raltegravir displayed synergistic activity with all other antiviral compounds tested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

The ADME properties of raltegravir have been evaluated in rat and dog studies with additional studies in rabbits and mice, and a number of in vitro assays. A majority of the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies was conducted in male animals only.

## Absorption/Bioavailability

Raltegravir  is  a  low-  (dog)  to  intermediate-  (rat)  clearance  compound,  with  a  short  plasma  half-life ( ≤ 1.6  hr)  and  a  volume  of  distribution  ranging  from  ~0.4  to  2  L/kg.  In  both  rats  and  dogs,  the compound is rapidly absorbed (Tmax ≤ 0.6 hrs) and is orally bioavailable (&gt; 60%).

The  dose  dependence  of  the  oral  pharmacokinetics  of  raltegravir  was evaluated  after single administration of raltegravir at four dose levels to male rats (40, 80, 120, 240 mg/kg) and male dogs (5, 15, 45, and 135 mg/kg). In rats, the AUC was nearly linear over the dose range of 40 to 120 mg/kg, but  there  was  no  further  increase  in  exposure  with  increased  dose.  Above  the  120  mg/kg  dose absorption of raltegravir was saturable as a result of limited aqueous solubility.

In dogs, the plasma AUC and Cmax increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 5 to 45 mg/kg; the increase in either parameter was less than dose-proportional when the dose was increased to 135 mg/kg. Absorption of raltegravir was saturable at doses higher than 45 mg/kg.

## Distribution

After  oral  administration  of  [ 14 C]raltegravir  to  rats,  radioactivity  is  distributed  rapidly  and  widely throughout the body. In addition to plasma, the highest concentrations of radioactivity are observed in the gastrointestinal tract and organs of excretion (stomach, small intestine, liver, kidney and urinary bladder). A small amount of radioactivity was detected in the brain. The compound crosses the rat and rabbit placenta and is excreted extensively in the milk of lactating rats. Raltegravir binds to the plasma proteins of the mouse (70%), the rat (74%), the dog (70%) and the human (83%).

The  partitioning  of  raltegravir  (0.9-18 µ M)  into  blood  cells  was  studied  and  the  blood-to-plasma concentration ratios were determined to be 0.7, 0.9, and 0.6 for rat, dog, and human, respectively.

Raltegravir was evaluated in vitro as a potential inhibitor of P-gp Over a concentration range of 1 to 100 µ M raltegravir did not affect [ 3 H]-vinblastine (VBL) accumulation in L-MDR1 and KB-V1 cell lines. In contrast, in the presence of a typical P-gp inhibitor, cyclosporin A, cellular accumulation of [ 3 H]-VBL was increased 10- and 12-fold in L-MDR1 and KB-V1 cells, respectively. Though in vitro studies indicated that raltegravir is a substrate of P-gp mediated transport, P-gp is unlikely to have a significant  effect  on  the  absorption  and  elimination  of  raltegravir.  Potential  drug  interactions  have been addressed in section 4.5 of the SPC.

## Metabolism/Excretion

Metabolism of raltegravir was assessed in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies in mice, rats, dogs and humans.

## In vitro studies

The in vitro metabolism of raltegravir was studied in hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes from rats, dogs,  and  humans.  No  significant  metabolism  of  raltegravir  was  observed  in  NADPH-fortified microsomal  incubations  from  any  of  the  species.  In  contrast,  raltegravir  underwent  metabolism  in hepatocytes,  with  the  major  metabolite  in  all  three  species  being  the  glucuronide  derivative  of  the parent compound (M2). Small quantities of the glucose derivative (M1) of the parent compound and the  acetyl  hydrazine  derivative  (M3)  also  were  detected.  In  addition,  the  data  indicated  that glucuronidation  of  the  parent  compound  was  the  major  metabolic  pathway  in  all  species  and  that raltegravir is not a substrate, nor an inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further studies showed that the glucuronidation of raltegravir is mainly catalyzed by UGT1A1 with a minor contribution from UGT1A9 and 1A3. Raltegravir was found to be an inhibitor of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 with IC50 values of &gt;50 µ M for both UGT activities. Raltegravir is unlikely to interfere with metabolism of other compounds because Raltegravir was found to have very low potential to inhibit CYP  1A2,  2C8,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  3A4,  or  2B6  enzymes,  and  no  potential  to  induce  CYP3A4. Raltegravir is reported to be neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. It might be  subject  to  drug-drug  interactions  when  co-administered  with  compounds  that  are  known  to  be UGT1A1 inducers (e.g. rifampicin) or inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, an HIV-protease inhibitor).

## In vivo studies

The  metabolism  of  [ 14 C]raltegravir  was  assessed  in  mice  (20  mg/kg  PO),  rats  (3 mg/kg  IV),  dogs (1.5 mg/kg IV), and humans (200 mg PO). The glucuronide of raltegravir (M2) was identified as the major radioactive entity in bile of mice, and in bile and urine of rats and dogs accounting for 62% and 31% of the administered dose, respectively. The glucose conjugate of the parent compound (M1; rat urine,  dog  urine  and  bile)  and  the  acetyl  hydrazine  derivative  (M3,  rat  urine)  were  the  only  other metabolites detected in rats and dogs and each metabolite represented &lt;2% of the dose. The fraction of the dose excreted in urine and bile as unchanged parent compound was 10% in rats and 30% in dogs indicating that metabolism (via glucuronidation) is the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in preclinical species. The only metabolite detected in humans was M2 which accounted for 72% of the dose recovered in urine and was the major circulating metabolite in all species (mouse, rat, dog, and human).  Although  M2  circulates  at  significant  levels  in  humans  the  pharmacological  activity  can  be attributed to the parent compound since M2 has no activity against HIV-1.

Metabolism via glucuronidation is also the principal mode of clearance of raltegravir in humans since the majority of the dose recovered in urine was due to M2, and since a significant fraction of the parent compound observed in faeces is likely derived from the hydrolysis of M2 secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species.

Raltegravir is mainly excreted in the faeces (50 to 74%) in all species, with the remainder appearing in urine. The high recovery of the dose in faeces after IV administration indicates that biliary secretion is the primary mode of elimination of raltegravir-related radioactivity consistent with results observed in bile-duct cannulated rats. In rats, the recovery of the dose in urine was independent of the route of administration suggesting that absorption of the compound was complete in this species. In dogs, the lower recovery of dose in urine after P.O. administration relative to the IV route suggests that absorption of raltegravir is incomplete.

Raltegravir  is  excreted  into  the  milk  of  lactating  rats.  The  concentrations  of  the  parent  compound  in maternal plasma and milk on lactational day (LD) 14 following daily oral administration of raltegravir at 300 or 600 mg/kg/day from Gestational Day (GD) 6 to LD 14 were measured.  At 2 hours post the last dose LD 14, the milk-to-plasma concentration ratios were ~3 at both doses.

## Toxicology

The toxicity of raltegravir was studied in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog models, investigating single- and repeat  dose  studies,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  (on-going),  reproductive  toxicity  studies  and  a number of non-pivotal additional toxicity studies

## · Single dose toxicity

Five  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  raltegravir  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  to  determine  its approximate acute toxicity following a single oral dose. Raltegravir was well tolerated in mice and at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (LD 50  &gt;2000 mg/kg).

Intravenous dosing in rats of raltegravir, as a potassium salt in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride, caused treatment-related mortality at ≥ 200 mg/kg. Treatment-related physical signs were observed at 100, 200

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 400 mg/kg/day; No treatment-related body weight effects were noted in the surviving animals at 100  and  200  mg/kg.  Based  on  these  results  the  highest  tolerated  dose  was  100  mg/kg/day.  A  noobserved-effect-level (NOEL) was not determined.

In oral dosing in dogs, raltegravir was well tolerated up to 250 mg/kg, a dose determined to be within the plateau of exposure to raltegravir following a single administration.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic studies with raltegravir were conducted in mice (doses 50-5000 mg/kg/day),  rats  (doses  30-1200  mg/kg/day),  dogs  (doses  5-500  mg/kg/day)  and  rabbits  (one toxicokinetic study). Pivotal GLP toxicity studies after repeat doses were performed over 14 weeks in the mouse, 27 weeks in the rat and 53 weeks in the dog.

## Repeat dose studies in mice

In  a  14-week  oral  range-finding  study,  treatment-related  findings  at  dosages ≥ 1000 mg/kg/day  of raltegravir  included  mortality,  a  variety  of  physical  signs  (typically  distended  abdomen,  laboured breathing, audible respiratory noises, decreased activity, and eye partially closed), and body weight loss and/or decreases in body weight gain. The histopathological observations were limited to changes in the stomach of animals that died early, suggesting an irritant effect of the compound.  The no-effect level for this study is 50 mg/kg/day.

## Repeat dose studies in rats

Raltegravir was administered in oral toxicity studies of 5, 14, and 27 weeks duration. In the 5-week oral  toxicity  study,  target  organ  toxicity  was  not  observed  and  only  minor  increases  in  ALT  and evidence of stomach mucosa irritation were found. In the 14 week repeat dose study, the only drug related effect observed up to 120 mg/kg/day was post-dose salivation which was reported to be related to poor palatability of the compound. Raltegravir caused mortality at 600 mg/kg/day in the 27-week study that was associated with body weight loss, urine staining and/or decreased food consumption prior to death. Up to 17% decreases in mean body weight gain were observed in surviving male rats at 600 mg/kg/day. There were no other significant findings in the antemortem parameters of these studies including haematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis evaluations.  Degeneration of the glandular mucosa of the  stomach  was  observed  at  600  mg/kg/day  and  120 mg/kg/day  upon  histopathological evaluation  of  the  tissues.  Additional  observations  were  likely  due  to  poor  palatability,  aspiration and/or irritation of the compound, including stomach inflammation in the 5-week study and postdosing salivation audible respiratory sounds, and inflammation in the nose and nasopharynx in the 27-week study. The NOAEL was considered to be 120 mg/kg/day which provides an exposure margin of 1.6fold above the expected exposure of the 400 mg/BID dose in patients.

## Repeat dose studies in dogs

Oral studies: In dogs, raltegravir was studied in repeat dose oral toxicity studies of 5, 14, 27 and 53 weeks  duration.  No  deaths  associated  with  drug  treatment  were  observed  during  any  of  the  dog studies. With the exception of emesis with or without body weight loss, and there were no treatmentrelated changes during the antemortem phase of the studies. Emesis was transient and/or intermittent and the underlining mechanism is unknown. There were no treatment-related changes in the gross or histopathological appearance of tissues examined from these studies in dogs. Therefore, the no-effect level in dogs, with the exception of emesis, following 53 weeks of treatment was &gt;360 mg/kg/day.

Intravenous studies : Repeat dose i.v. toxicity studies in dogs revealed changes to liver enzymes and kidney  function  biochemistry.  The  3-Day  escalating  toxicity i.v. study  in  dogs  showed  treatmentrelated  changes  in  serum  biochemistry  at  100  mg/kg/day  including  increases  in  AST,  ALT,  and alkaline phosphatase. Treatment-related histopathological changes consisted of interstitial inflammation of the renal cortex in the female. The inflammation was considered very slight and was characterized by mixtures of lymphocytes and macrophages in association with tubular dilatation. No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment-related  histopathological  changes  in  the  liver  were  observed.  Based  on  the  mortality observed  in  this  study  during  intravenous  administration  of  358 mg/kg,  likely  due  to  cardiac arrhythmia  secondary  to  the  amount  of  administered  potassium  (raltegravir  potassium  salt)  the maximum tolerated dose of raltegravir, when formulated as a monopotassium salt and administered intravenously, is considered to be &lt;358 mg/kg. Treatment-related changes observed in the 7-days i.v. toxicity study at both doses (30 or 100 mg/kg/day) included transient postdosing emesis/retching and local  changes  at  the  injection  sites  (swelling  and/or  induration,  and  red/purple  discoloration). Additional changes at 100 mg/kg/day consisted of persistent swelling and red/purple discoloration of the  forelimbs,  body  weight  loss,  minimal  increases  in  serum  urea  nitrogen,  increases  in  alanine aminotransferase  activity,  alkaline  phosphatase  activity,  and  cholesterol,  and  very  slight,  multifocal tubular dilatation in the cortex of the kidneys. Based on the physical signs seen at 30 mg/kg/day, the NOEL  for  treatment-related  changes  was  considered  to  be &lt; 30 mg/kg/day.  At  the  NOEL  safety margins were 6.5-fold or 24-fold the AUC and C max  of the 400-mg/BID MRD.

## Toxicokinetic data

The toxicokinetic programme was performed in the context of the repeat dose toxicity studies. With respect  to  toxicokinetics  the  results  showed  no  significant  sex-differences  in  systemic  exposure  to raltegravir and no accumulation of raltegravir after repeated exposure.

Furthermore,  toxicokinetic  studies  in  mice  were  conducted  in  parallel  with  the  ongoing  main carcinogenicity study:

- -Results from a 27-week study in mice indicate that at the high dose, 400 mg/kg/day in females and  250  mg/kg/day  in  males,  systemic  exposure  is  approximately  2-fold  greater  (females)  or equal to (males) the AUC (54 mM·hr) at the 400-mg/BID MRD when adjusted for 30% and 17% unbound drug in mice and humans, respectively.
- -Results from a 26-week study in rats indicate that at 300 to 600 mg/kg/day in females and 150 to 300 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure is approximately 10.3-fold greater (females) or 1.7-fold greater (males) the AUC (54 mM·hr) at the 400-mg/BID MRD when adjusted for 26% and 17% unbound drug in rats and humans, respectively.

## · Genotoxicity

Raltegravir  has  been  tested  for  genotoxicity  in  four  GLP  studies.  Raltegravir  did  not  show  any mutagenic/genotoxic  effects  in  the  (i) in  vitro bacterial  mutation  assay  (Salmonella  typhimurium strains and Escherichia coli strain); (ii) alkaline elution/rat hepatocyte assay (Primary Rat hepatocytes);  (iii)  chromosome  aberration  assay  (Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  cells);  (iv) in  vivo in  the mouse micronucleus assay (Mouse/CRL). All studies were conducted using a range of doses; at the highest  dose,  there  was  evidence  of  cytotoxicity  and/or  drug  insolubility.  The  results  are  uniformly negative, indicating the absence of genotoxic potential for raltegravir.

## · Carcinogenicity

No short term carcinogenicity studies (e.g. with use of a transgenic model) were conducted.

## Long-term studies

Two-year  GLP  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats  are  currently  ongoing  and  scheduled  to  be completed in 4Q 2007 with a draft report expected in 3Q-4Q 2008. In mice, oral doses of 50, 250, and 400  mg/kg/day  in  females  and  50,  100  and  250  mg/kg/day  in  males  were  selected  for  the carcinogenicity  study.  In  rats,  oral  doses  of  50,  150,  and  300  mg/kg/day  in  males  and  50,  300  and 600 mg/kg/day in females were selected for the carcinogenicity study.

1-year interim data has shown high mortality rates: up to 38% in female mice dosed 400 mg/kg/day; up to 26% in female rats dosed 600 mg/kg/day and up to 20% in male rats dosed 300 mg/kg/day. The cause of these deaths was attributed to aspiration of dosing material into the nose/nasopharynx. Effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of drug irritation to the nose/nasopharynx were seen and include chronic inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia and metaplasia.

The  CHMP considered  it  acceptable  that  the  carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  yet  been  completed. According to the guideline on carcinogenicity evaluation of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/194898/2006) the submission of the results of the carcinogenicity studies  as  a  post-approval  commitment  may  be  accepted  for  products  intended  for  the  treatment  of patients  with  limited  treatment  options  or  of  a  clearly  demonstrable  added  value.  The  applicant  did commit to provide the final study report within a defined time-frame.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

The potential for raltegravir to affect reproductive system was studied in rats and rabbits.

## Fertility and early embryonic development

Raltegravir was administered orally to female rats at dose levels of 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg/day for 14 days prior to cohabitation, during cohabitation, and through GD 7. There were no treatment-related findings in the F 0  generation and there were no treatment-related effects on embryonic/fetal survival in the F 1  generation. Based on these data, the no-effect level for effects of raltegravir on fertility in F 0 female rats was ≥ 600 mg/kg/day.

Male rats were administered raltegravir orally once daily at doses of 100, 300, or 600 mg/kg/day for approximately  8  weeks.  There  were  no  treatment-related  effects  on  mortality,  physical  signs,  body weights, food consumption, mating performance, fertility, embryonic/fetal survival, sperm count, or sperm motility. There were no treatment-related gross changes in the thoracic or abdominal cavities. There were no treatment-related alterations in testicular weights nor were there gross or microscopic changes  in  the  testes  or  epididymides.  Based  on  these  findings,  the  no-effect  level  for  routine antemortem  and  postmortem  parameters  in  male  rats  was ≥ 600  mg/kg/day.  The  no-effect  level  for male fertility was ≥ 600 mg/kg/day.

## Embryo-fetal, prenatal and postnatal development including maternal function

In an oral range-finding reproduction study in female rats, raltegravir was administered once daily at doses of 150, 300, 450, or 600 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats from GD 6 through LD 20. There was no evidence of significant treatment-related maternal or developmental toxicity. Based on these results, the  recommended  high-dose  level  for  the  subsequent  developmental  toxicity  study  in  rats  was  600 mg/kg/day.

In  an  oral  developmental  and  reproduction  study  in  female  rats  (with  post-weaning  assessment), raltegravir was administered to female rats once daily at doses of 100, 300, or 600 mg/kg/day from GD 6 through 20 or through LD 20. There were no treatment-related findings in the F 0 generation. In the F 1 generation, the only treatment-related finding was an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs  in  the  600-mg/kg/day group as compared to concurrent control and to historical control. There were no treatment-related findings in the F 2 generation. Based on the results of this study, the no-effect level for maternal toxicity  was ≥ 600 mg/kg/day. Based  on the treatment-related increase in supernumerary ribs in the F 1 generation at 600-mg/kg/day group, the no-effect level for developmental toxicity was 300 mg/kg/day.

In an oral range-finding study in pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered to pregnant rabbits at doses of 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day from GD 7 though 20. There was no evidence of treatmentrelated  maternal  toxicity  or  developmental  toxicity  in  the  raltegravir-treated  groups.  Based  on  these results,  the  recommended  high-dose  level  for  the  subsequent  oral  developmental  toxicity  study  of raltegravir in rabbits was 1000 mg/kg/day.

In an oral developmental toxicity study in pregnant rabbits, raltegravir was administered once daily to pregnant  rabbits  at  doses  of  100,  500,  or  1000  mg/kg/day  from  GD  7  through  20.  There  were  no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indications of maternal toxicity or developmental toxicity at any dose level. Based on these results, the no-effect level of raltegravir for maternal and developmental toxicity was ≥ 1000 mg/kg/day.

The safety margin at the NOEL for developmental toxicity is reported to be approximately 3.4-fold the value at the maximum recommended dose (MRD). In rabbits, no developmental toxicity was found at the maximum dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, resulting in a safety margin of about 3.7-fold relative to the AUC in patients at the MRD.

Relevant findings have been appropriately addressed in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC.

## Oral toxicity study in juvenile rats

In an oral range-finding toxicity study in juvenile rats, raltegravir was administered once daily at doses of 150, 300, 450, or 600 mg/kg/day from postnatal day (PND) 5 to postnatal week (PNW) 9. The only indication  of  toxicity  was  slightly  decreased  mean  serum  glucose  values  in  males  of  the  450 mg/kg/day and 600 mg/kg/day groups. Based on these results, in a subsequent oral toxicity study in juvenile rats, raltegravir was administered to groups of 43 or 44 juvenile rats per sex at dose levels of 50, 200, or 600 mg/kg/day from PND 5 to PNW 8. A total of 19 deaths were reported during the study, but none of the deaths were considered to be treatment-related.

In the remaining study animals the applicant reported that there was no evidence of toxicity based on ante mortem parameters of mortality, physical signs, body weights, developmental signs, haematology, serum biochemistry, ophthalmologic examination, behavioural assessments, and reproductive performance, including embryonic/fetal survival.

Treatment-related histopathological findings consisted of vacuolation of the nonglandular mucosa at the limiting ridge at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day as well as inflammation which occurred at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day in males and at 600 mg/kg/day in females. This difference has been related to the absolute amount of drug deposited directly on the stomach mucosa, which is higher in males due to their body weight. Both vacuolar and inflammatory changes recovered following cessation of treatment for approximately  6  weeks.  The  mucosal  epithelial  vacuolation  and  associated  increased  inflammation were consistent with raltegravir causing very slight irritation to the limiting ridge of the nonglandular stomach  of  orally  gavaged  rats.  Based  on  the  histopathological  results,  the  no-effect  level  for treatment-related  changes  in  juvenile  rats  was  50  mg/kg/day.  These  findings  in  juvenile  rats  were consistent with the stomach irritation effects seen in adult rats.

## · Local tolerance

A total of 7 local tolerance studies were conducted: three in vitro , two in mice (topical administration) and two in rabbits (dermal administration). Raltegravir is classified as a mild irritant for the free base and  as  a  severe  irritant  as  the  potassium  salt  in  the  bovine  corneal  opacity  (BCOP) in  vitro assay. However, when applied to the skin of rabbits, no evidence of irritation was found. The results of the local  lymph  node  assay  (LLNA)  in  mice  and  of  dermal  irritation  study  in  rabbits,  showed  that raltegravir, as either free base or potassium salt, is not a dermal sensitizer. The same conclusion has been drawn after studying the dermal irritation potential of raltegravir (potassium salt) in an in vitro human epidermal skin culture system.

## · Other toxicity studies

No  specific  nonclinical  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  to  assess  antigenicity  or  immunotoxicity. However, raltegravir was assessed in multiple-dose studies in rats and dogs. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, by evaluation of haematological (including differential white blood cell counting) and  serum  biochemical  parameters,  and  by  gross  and  histopathological  examination  of  lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus). There was no evidence of antigenicity or immunotoxicity resulting from these studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  nonclinical  dependence  studies  were  conducted  to  support  an  antiviral  indication.  Tissue distribution studies indicate that raltegravir is poorly brain penetrating, yielding the lowest detectable concentrations of all tissues tested (0.00971 µ g/g of a 6 mg radiolabelled oral dose of raltegravir).

Specific nonclinical studies to evaluate the toxicity of specific metabolites were not conducted. The principal metabolite of raltegravir observed in humans and in rats and dogs is a glucuronide. In the rat and dog toxicity studies exposure to the glucuronide was 3.3-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, above the projected exposure in patients receiving 400 mg/BID raltegravir.

The  toxicological  assessment  of  impurities  is  covered  by  an  oral  gavage  study  in  rats  over approximately 5 weeks. The results of this study support the proposed specification limits.

- Other studies

After a single dose administration of raltegravir (1000, 1500, or 2000 mg/kg) by oral gavage to female mice,  the  phototoxicity  potential  was  determined  exposing  animals  to  UVB  light  (280  to  320  nm, 5 minutes), UVA light (300 to 400 nm-4hrs) and visible light (400 to 900 nm-4hrs). Additional groups of mice were placed in the dark during the 4-hour exposure period as negative controls. No treatmentrelated mortality, body weight effects, or phototoxic effects were noted in any dose group. Based on these findings, raltegravir is considered non-phototoxic at doses up to 2000 mg/kg.

An  assessment  of  the  potential  for  raltegravir  to  cause in  vitro haemolysis  of  human,  dog,  or  rat erythrocytes was conducted prior to initiation of the toxicity studies. The in  vitro haemolysis assay produced negative results for raltegravir.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment conducted according to the guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 was provided.

In the phase I, a worst-case PEC in surface water was higher than the action limit of 0.01 µg/L stated in  the  guidance  hence  a  phase  II  environmental  fate  and  effect  analysis  was  performed.  The conclusions  from  these  phase  II  studies  were  that  raltegravir  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  to  the aquatic  environment  or  to  microorganisms.  The  results  indicate  that  raltegravir  is  unlikely  to bioaccumulate.

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  main  clinical  programme  to  support  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for  ISENTRESS consisted of:

- -two  identical  phase  III  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trials  investigating  the safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  raltegravir  400  mg  b.i.d.  in  combination  with  optimised background  therapy (OBT)  in treatment-experienced patients who  failed antiretroviral therapies with triple-class resistant virus (Protocols 018 and 019);
- -one phase II study for dose-finding in combination therapy in treatment-experienced patients (Protocol 005);
- -one phase II study for proof of concept in monotherapy (part 1) and thereafter dose-finding in combination therapy (part 2), both in treatment-naïve patients (Protocol 004).

Details of these studies are summarised in Table 1. Furthermore, a phase I program was conducted investigating amongst others the pharmacokinetics profile including different pharmaceutical formulations as well as drug-drug interactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  clinical  development  program  of  raltegravir  was  consistent  with  the  CHMP  guidance,  and specifically in accordance with the applicable EU guideline for the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (CPMP/EWP/633/02). The overall development strategy for raltegravir including the clinical programme was subject to CHMP Scientific Advice.

A  paediatric  development  programme  has  not  been  initiated  at  time  of  application  for  marketing authorisation.

The approved indication for ISENTRESS is the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatment-experienced adult patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The difference to the initially claimed indication is the restriction to the use in adult patients. The recommended dose is 400 mg twice daily.

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The programme investigating the clinical pharmacokinetics of raltegravir comprised several phase I studies in healthy subjects and in special populations (patients with hepatic insufficiency, patients with renal insufficiency) as well as an additional study studying the effect of UGT1A1 polymorphism.

Concentrations  of  raltegravir  in  human  biological  fluids  (plasma  and  urine)  were  determined  using validated  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometric  detection  (LC-MS/MS)  methods.  The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the plasma assay was 4.5nM (2ng/ml) and the linear calibration range was 4.5-2250 nM (2-1000 ng/ml). The LLOQ for urine assay was 563 nM (250 ng/ml) and the linear  calibration  range  was  563-56300 nM  (250-25000  ng/ml).  All  the  methods  were  properly validated and met usual acceptance criteria.

## · Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir from clinically used formulations has not been determined. In a mass balance study in which a single dose of 200 mg [ 14 C]-raltegravir (185.92 µCi) formulated in a capsule was administered to eight male subjects in the fasted state urinary recovery suggested that the minimum bioavailability in this study was 32%.

## Bioequivalence

The  clinical  development  was  performed  with  three  different  pharmaceutical  formulations.  First  a rapidly  disintegrating  tablet  was  developed  (Phase  I  lactose  formulation)  followed  by  a  tablet presenting improved  pharmacokinetic  properties  (Phase I poloxamer  formulation).  The  Phase II/III/FMI poloxamer formulation was developed for use in later clinical studies and is intended for marketing.

An  open-label,  single-dose,  4-period,  partially  randomised,  crossover  bioequivalence  study  was conducted in fifteen young, healthy, male subjects investigating different formulations of raltegravir in a fasted state (study 007). This study included the comparison between the Phase I lactose formulation tablet  and  the  Phase  I  poloxamer  formulation  tablet.  Raltegravir  was  more  bioavailable  from  the Phase 1  lactose  tablet  than  from  the  Phase  1  poloxamer  formulation  (AUC0-∞ :  25.69 µ M·hr  versus 16.07 µ M·hr; geometric Mean (90% CI for GMR) for Treatment Ratio: 0.63 (0.51, 0.77)).

A  bioequivalence  study  was  not  performed  between  these  phase  I  formulations  and  the  phase II/III/FMI  formulation.  As  shown  in  Table  2  a  comparison  between  monotherapy  in  ART-naïve patients in study 004 and multiple dosing of healthy volunteers in the fasted state showed that mean raltegravir PK parameters on dosing with the Phase I poloxamer formulation were generally similar to those observed with the Phase II/III/FMI poloxamer formulation. There was also no evidence of any formulation-related  alterations  in  clearance  and  so  the  results  of  the  three  drug  interaction  studies performed  with  the  Phase  I  poloxamer  formulation  were  considered  to  be  applicable  to  the Phase II/III/FMI poloxamer formulation.

## Effect of food

In  a  cross  over  study  in  20  subjects,  a  single  dose  of  400  mg  as  the  Phase  II/III/FMI  poloxamer formulation was administered either with a standard high fat meal or in the fasting state (study 028). The extent of raltegravir absorption (AUC0-∞ ) was slightly higher in the fed state but food slowed the rate and extended the duration of absorption with a 34% decrease in Cmax, an 8.5-fold increase in C12 h and a 7.3 h delay in Tmax.

A  second  study  investigated  the  food  effect  in  a  4-period  crossover  design  in  20  subjects  who  all received  400  mg  raltegravir  q12h  for  10  days  (study  035).  On  Days  4,  6,  8  and  10  subjects  were randomised  to  receive  the  morning  dose  after  one  of  the  following:  Treatment  A  (low-fat  meal), Treatment  B  (moderate-fat  meal),  Treatment  C  (high-fat  meal)  and  Treatment  D  (fasted).  Blood samples were collected after the morning doses on Days 4, 6, 8 and 10 (last dose in the morning). The results are presented in Table 3.

a Median (min, max) values presented for Tmax.

The results suggest that a low fat meal resulted in plasma levels lower than seen in the fasted state while a high fat meal increased Cmax, AUC and C12h and a moderate fat meal increased C12h but had only a small effect on Cmax and AUC. It is proposed that the differences between low, moderate and high-fat meals may be attributable to differences in gastric or biliary secretions secondary to meal fat content  or  change  in  gastric  pH.  However,  considerable  inter-individual  variability  was  seen particularly with respect to C12hr for which the coefficients of variation were 201%, 123% and 221% percent for low, moderate and high-fat meals, respectively, compared to 47% for the fasted state.

Raltegravir was taken with or without food in clinical studies in patients. Therefore, although the true effect of food on the absorption of raltegravir remains uncertain, the SPC recommends that it may be taken with or without food.

## · Distribution

Raltegravir  is  83%  bound  to  human  plasma  proteins;  binding  is  independent  of  concentration (2-10 µ M).  Directional  transport  studies  in  LLC-PK1  cells  expressing  human  (L-MDR1)  P-gp

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indicated  that  raltegravir  is  a  substrate  of  P-gp  in  humans.  However,  there  was  no  effect  on  [ 3 H]vinblastine (VBL) accumulation in L-MDR1 and KB-V1 cell lines, indicating that raltegravir is not a P-gp inhibitor. Based on the estimated apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of 287 L raltegravir seems to distribute extensively beyond the extracellular space. Raltegravir crossed the placenta in rats and rabbits and there was substantial excretion into rat milk.

## · Elimination

In the mass balance study 51.1% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 31.8% in urine over a 10-day period post-dose and mostly within 72 hours (study 011). Approximately 8 to 11% of the oral dose  was  excreted  unchanged  in  urine  during  a  steady-state  dosing  interval,  with  renal  clearance values of approximately 54 to 65 ml/min. The apparent terminal elimination half-lives after multiple doses were 1 h ( α ) and 10 to 12 h ( β ) with an inflection point at around 12 h for most subjects. After administration of 400 mg doses in studies 025 and 028 AUC0-12hr accounted for approximately 88% of AUC0-∞ and thus AUC12hr-∞ accounted for approximately 12% of AUC0-∞ .

Based  on in  vitro studies  and  a  clinical  interaction  study  with  oral  midazolam  raltegravir  is  not expected to be a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 at clinically recommended doses. Studies of in vitro metabolism indicated that glucuronidation of the parent compound was the major metabolic pathway in humans, mainly catalysed by UGT1A1 with a minor contribution from UGT1A9 and  1A3.  The  glucuronidated  metabolite  (M2)  does  not  exhibit  potentially  useful  antiviral  activity. Raltegravir is not a potent inhibitor of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7.

Polymorphisms  in  UGT1A1  are  common  and  the  applicant  conducted  a  study  to  compare  the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in subjects homozygous for the (TA)6 allele (UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype) or  homozygous  for  the  (TA)7  allele  (UGT1A1*28/*28  genotype;  expected  maximal  impairment  of UGT1A1 activity) (study (013)). Subjects in the two groups were matched for race, gender, age and BMI.  Each  subject  received  a  400  mg  single  oral  dose  of  raltegravir  (Phase  II/III/FMI  poloxamer formulation) in the fasted state.

The study enrolled 30 subjects in the UGT1A1 *28/*28 group and 27 in the UGT1A1*1/*1 group. All subjects  were  included  in  the  PK  and  statistical  analyses.  On  comparing  former  with  the  latter genotype the GMR for AUC0-∞ was 1.41 (90% confidence interval 0.96, 2.09) while the GMR for Cmax was  1.40  (90%  confidence  interval  0.86,  2.28).  In  addition,  there  was  an  increase  of  91%  in  the observed C12hr for raltegravir in subjects with UGT1A1*28/*28  compared  to  subjects with UGT1A1*1/*1.

Raltegravir pharmacokinetics in subjects deficient in UGT1A1 were consistent with those observed on co-administration with atazanavir (a UGT1A1 inhibitor). Since plasma levels of raltegravir would be higher in those with UGT1A1*28/*28 there is no efficacy concern arising from these data. Taking into account  particularly  the  comparative  safety  data  from  the  two  groups  in  study  005  (i.e.  with  and without co-administered atazanavir) no dose adjustment is advised with respect to UGT1A1 activity.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Dose proportionality of raltegravir has been assessed in healthy adult subjects for the Phase I lactose formulation (Protocol 001) and for the Phase II/II/FMI formulation (study 025).

Single  and  multiple  doses  across  a  wide  range  were  employed  in  healthy  subjects  (study  001); administration was in the fasting state except that single doses of 100 mg and 200 mg were also taken with a high fat meal. Steady state was achieved within two days of dosing at all dose levels examined with average accumulation ratios for AUC0-12hr and Cmax of 0.7 to 1.2 and for C12 hr of 1.2 to 1.6. After administration of multiple doses the AUC0-12hr and Cmax did not show dose proportionality beyond 600 mg twice daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, in a definitive assessment of dose proportionality with single doses in study 025 the AUC0-∞ and Cmax were dose proportional over 100 to 1600 mg and there was approximate dose proportionality for C12 h over 100 to 800 mg.

Raltegravir does not appear to display time-dependent pharmacokinetics.

## · Inter- and intra-subject variability

Data from healthy subjects and from patients (mainly from sparse sampling) demonstrated that there was variability in Tmax within and between subjects that was associated with variability in Cmax and C12hr so that a later Tmax resulted in a lower Cmax and higher C12hr compared to an earlier Tmax. It was noted  that  the  same  subject  could  have  very  different  Tmax  values  on  different  sampling  days, indicating that the variability in Tmax cannot be fully explained by a constant descriptor such as gender or UGT1A1 genotype.

Table 4 presents pharmacokinetic data obtained after administration of the Phase II/III/FIM poloxamer formulation  in  healthy  subjects  (study  025)  and  HIV-infected  patients  (studies  018  and  019), respectively.

Food,  gastric  pH  and  concomitant  medications  (e.g.  that  affect  UGT1A1  activity  or  increase  intragastric  pH)  are  also  likely  to  affect  exposure.  The  impact  of  some  of  these  factors  on  raltegravir pharmacokinetics  can  be  seen  in  an  examination  of  mean  observed  raltegravir  C12h  values  during dosing with 400 mg twice daily in HIV positive patients under various dosing conditions in the Phase II and III studies (Table 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetic data collected during studies in treatment experienced patients were too few and collected under too variable conditions to allow for reliable conclusions to be drawn from population PK analyses.

As a result, it was not possible to determine from available evidence whether the extremes of plasma concentrations of raltegravir that have been documented have a clinically important effect on safety and efficacy. The applicant's proposals for pharmacokinetic criteria that might indicate no important effects  for  safety  (AUC  increase)  and  efficacy  (C12h)  were  considered  to  be  unreliable.  The  SPC describes  the  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  observed  and  mentions  possible  contributing factors.  The  CHMP  requested  that  the  applicant  provides  post-approval  a  detailed  plan  to  further explore  the  implications  for  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  in  the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

## · Special populations

## Renal impairment

Due to the projected minor component of renal elimination for raltegravir the applicant compared the pharmacokinetics only between subjects with severe renal insufficiency and controls with normal renal function. Of the ten subjects with severe renal insufficiency three had notably lower plasma exposures (AUC 3.6 to 7.4 µM·h) compared to the other seven (AUC ≥ 10 µM·h and up to 43 µM·h) whereas the ten controls all had AUCs in the range 10.8 - 31.7 µM·h. There was no apparent relationship between raltegravir AUC0-∞ , Cmax or C12 h and the pre-study creatinine clearance value. No dose adjustment is considered to be necessary when creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min.

## Hepatic impairment

Raltegravir pharmacokinetics were compared between eight subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency  (Child-Pugh  scores  7-8)  and  eight matched  controls  per  group.  Among  the  eight  with moderate  hepatic  insufficiency  the  actual  range  of  AUC  and  Cmax  values  was  wide  (e.g.  from 3.05 µM·h to 50.08 µM·h) whereas the eight controls all had AUCs in the range 13.24 - 36.42 µM·h. However,  this  spread  of  values  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  other  studies  in  healthy  subjects.  On comparing mean values between healthy subjects and those with moderate hepatic insufficiency there was no clinically important effect of moderate hepatic insufficiency on raltegravir pharmacokinetics, which was thought likely because glucuronidation is spared in hepatic insufficiency. For this reason no study in severe hepatic insufficiency was performed.

## Other populations

There did not appear to be significant effect of gender, age race or weight on raltegravir pharmacokinetics. However, it needs to be considered that the results from the population PK analysis must be interpreted with caution as the model provided a poor prediction of the absorption phase in the fed state, which is of relevance due to the very large effect on food on the PK profile of raltegravir and the unknown food status of the patients during the data collection in the phase II and III studies.

There are no data in children (age &lt; 16 years).

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Table 6 summarises the data from the drug-drug interaction studies. Single or multiple doses of 400 mg raltegravir were co-administered (except study 006). The formulations used varied but 6 out of 9 studies  used  one  of  the  two  poloxamer  formulations  and  exposure  to  raltegravir  would  have  been potentially higher in the three that used the Phase I lactose tablets.

* Population PK estimates

# Data derived from patient sampling during phase 2 studies

In addition, an interaction study with midazolam was conducted (study 016). The study confirms that raltegravir does not alter the pharmacokinetics of a CYP3A4  substrate (GMR  (90%  CI): AUC 0.92 ng·h/ml (0.82, 1.03); Cmax 1.03 µ g/ml (0.87, 1.22)).

Overall, raltegravir probably has a low propensity to affect or to be affected by the majority of coadministered medicinal products. Nevertheless, the following issues were particularly discussed during the assessment:

- -During the 10-day monotherapy phase in ART naïve patients in 004 the PK findings were similar  to  those  observed  in  healthy  subjects  when  administered  the  same  dose  and formulation.  However,  during  combination  therapy  with  tenofovir  and  lamivudine  the AUC0-12  h  (41%),  Cmax  and  C12  h  (42%)  raltegravir  were  higher  compared  to  the monotherapy  phase.  Also,  exposure  to  lamivudine  was  higher  when  it  was  given  with raltegravir compared to administration with efavirenz (each in combination with tenofovir).
- -Administration  of  omeprazole  prior  to  administration  of  raltegravir  in  healthy  subjects resulted in an approximately 3.1-fold increase in raltegravir AUC0-∞ ,  4.1-fold  increase  in Cmax, and 46% increase in C12hr. A likely mechanism to explain these results is increased bioavailability due to improved solubility of raltegravir at higher pH. It has been reported that  AIDS  patients  have  gastropathy  with  hypochlorhydria.  The  applicant  proposed  that this  may  explain  in  part  why  the  population  PK  data  suggested  that  raltegravir  PK parameters  were  not  significantly  altered  in  treatment  experienced  patients  taking  a  pHaltering agent. However, the data in patients are considered to be unreliable and there is a particular need to further assess the effects of medicinal products that increase intra-gastric pH in patients rather than in healthy subjects.
- -Co-administration  with  rifampicin  produces  a  profound  decrease  in  raltegravir  plasma concentrations. The data suggest that an increase in raltegravir dose is needed during coadministration.

The SPC in section 4.5 provides an adequate description of the currently known interaction profile of raltegravir.  The  CHMP  requested  further  data  to  be  generated  post-approval  by  studying  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interaction between raltegravir and rifabutin, as well as the interaction between raltegravir and one PPI and one H2 blocker.

## Pharmacodynamics

The  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  raltegravir  were  investigated  in  isolates  obtained  from  HIV patients  enrolled  into  the  phase  II  and  III  studies  (see  Table  1).  The  following  presents  these  data together  with  a  brief  summary  of  virological  data.  In  addition,  information  from  the  QTc  study  in healthy subjects and the integrated PK/PD analyses is described.

Details on nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies are presented in section 'Nonclinical Aspects'.

- Mechanism of action

Raltegravir  inhibits  the  HIV-1  integrase  enzyme,  which  is  an  enzyme  encoded  by  the  HIV-1 responsible for covalent insertion of the HIV-1 proviral DNA into the genomic DNA of the host cell. The  process  of  integration  occurs  in  four  steps  (assembly,  3'  processing,  strand  transfer,  and reparation) of which the first three are realised by the integrase; raltegravir inhibits the third step of the integration process (Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor, InSTI).

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Raltegravir inhibited the enzymatic activity of purified recombinant HIV-1 integrase with an apparent IC50  of  approximately  10  nM.  In  comparison,  raltegravir  did  not  inhibit  the  DNA  polymerase  or RNaseH activities  of  HIV-1  reverse  transcriptase  at  concentrations  of  25 µM  or  higher.  There  was &gt;1,000-fold selectively for integrase with respect to human DNA polymerases α , β and γ , with IC50 &gt; 50 µM for each of these polymerases.

## In vitro resistance

The potential for HIV-1 to develop resistance to raltegravir was evaluated by culturing a laboratory HIV-1 isolate in human T lymphoid H9 cells in increasing concentrations of the agent over a period of months.  The  first  change  observed  was  Q148K,  which  arose  during  growth  in  25  to  50  nM  i.e. exceeding the CIC95. The Q148K mutation persisted during growth in increasing concentrations up to 500nM. After passage in 1 µM, mutations E138A and G140A were sequentially incorporated. Growth in still higher concentrations resulted in the appearance of additional mutations in the integrase gene. Thus,  the  ability  of  HIV  variants  to  replicate  in  higher  concentrations  of  raltegravir  was  correlated with the appearance of mutations in the integrase gene.

To further evaluate effects of mutations on susceptibility some of those that had been observed were introduced into a wild-type HIV-1 isolate and the resultant viruses were tested in a single-cycle HIV-1 infectivity assay. The Q148K, E138A/Q148 and E138A/G140A/Q148K mutations resulted in average fold-shift IC50 values of 46-fold, 90-fold and 508-fold, respectively.

Viruses containing other integrase mutations were also evaluated for their effects on susceptibility to raltegravir. Some  of these mutations were observed during cell culture resistance selection experiments with integrase inhibitors other than raltegravir. In general, these mutations conferred less than 10-fold differences in susceptibility to raltegravir although the N155S mutation resulted in ~19fold increase in IC50. Other mutations were observed in the integrase genes of viruses isolated from HIV-1-infected patients who failed ART regimens including raltegravir. These mutations, including the primary mutations N155H, Q148H, and Q148R, each conferred a greater than 10-fold increase in the IC50.

## In vivo resistance

In  raltegravir-treated  patients  who  had  viral  rebound  or  non-response  in  the  clinical  studies,  the emergence of resistant viruses was monitored by isolating plasma viral RNA, determining the amino

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acid sequences encoded by the integrase gene and comparing the sequence at virological failure with the sequence at baseline for the same patient. The first resistance mutations were observed at Week 4. The following observations were made:

- -Virological  failure  was  generally  associated  with  mutation  at  either  amino  acid  148  (Q changed to H, K, or R) or amino acid 155 (N changed to H). When introduced into HIV-1 by site-directed mutagenesis, primary mutations at position 155 or 148 conferred decreased susceptibility to raltegravir and were associated with decreased viral replication capacity in cell culture.
- -The majority  of  viruses  isolated  at  virological  failure  contained  two  or  more  resistanceassociated  mutations in integrase. In viruses from a  small number of virological failures there were two or more secondary mutations without a mutation at amino acid 148 or 155. Individually, secondary mutations at amino acid residues L74, E92, T97, F121, E138 and G140 had a minimal effect on susceptibility to raltegravir but combinations of mutations resulted  in  decreased  susceptibility.  Secondary  mutations  at  other  positions  (e.g.  Y143, G163, S230 and D232) have not yet been examined in detail. The addition of secondary mutations  to  primary  mutations  sometimes,  but  not  always,  resulted  in  increased  viral replication capacity, though replication capacities of these mutants were lower compared to wild-type virus.
- -Factors that decreased the likelihood of developing mutation at either amino acid 148 or 155 (i.e. with a Hazard Ratio &lt;1) included lower viral load, the use of darunavir in OBT, PSS  &gt;0  and  GSS&gt;0.  A  factor  that  increased  the  likelihood  of  developing  a  mutation  at either amino acid 148 or 155 was lower CD4 count ( ≤ 50 vs &gt; 200).

By  Week  24,  84  raltegravir-treated  patients  in  studies  018  and  019  had  met  the  definition  of virological failure and integrase genotype data were available for 60 patients. Among the viruses from these 60 patients 42 (70%) showed genotypic evidence of raltegravir resistance when tested at a point near or corresponding to the time of rebound.

Table  7  shows  the  number  and  percent  of  patients  displaying  signature  integrase  mutations  in  the N155 pathway, the Q148 pathway, the Y143 pathway or other pathways. A subgroup analysis is also reported for patients who had baseline GSS of 0, 1 or ≥ 2 (defined as before with respect to counting of enfuvirtide and darunavir).

| Without mutations known to confer R               | 18 (30)                                          | 8 (25.8)                             | 3 (20)                               | 7 (50)                               |

Thus available data continue to indicate that the 148 and 155 pathways constitute the major raltegravir resistance  pathways  but  there  have  been  a  small  number  of  patients  failing  raltegravir  who  have developed integrase mutations that do not include a substitution at either 148 or 155. Substitutions at Y143  (Y143C  or  Y143R)  occurred  in  some  patients  and  one  patient  had  a  substitution  at  F121 (F121N).  Phenotypic  testing  of  site-directed  mutants  in  a  single-cycle  infectivity  assay  shows  that these substitutions can contribute to raltegravir resistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect on the OTc interval

The  effect  of  raltegravir  on  the  QTc  interval  has  been  investigated  in  a  double-blind,  randomised, placebo-controlled,  double-dummy, 3-period,  balanced  cross  over  study  in  healthy  volunteers  using moxifloxacin as the positive control. Mean exposure to raltegravir (in a subset of 12 subjects) after a 1600 mg dose was considerably higher than seen for 400 mg doses. While the actual range of values after 1600 mg was from 2.9 to 56.9 µM for Cmax, 15 to 181 µM.h for AUC 0-12h and 143 to 391 nM for C12h there was no relationship detected between plasma exposure and QTcf. Raltegravir appeared not to have a clinically important effect on the QTc interval and there were no notable effects on heart rate, PR intervals and QRS duration.

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship

Two integrated PK/PD reports were produced by the applicant: 360 - PK/PD from 004 and 005 (Phase II dose-finding studies), and 375 - PK/PD from 005, 018 and 019 (pooled 400 mg b.i.d. in treatmentexperienced patients plus OBT).

Due to the limited PK sampling in treatment-experienced patients and the degree of inter- and intraindividual variability observed, the CHMP considered that the findings reported from these analyses must  be  viewed  with  some  considerable  caution.  Therefore  the  following  conclusions  are  not considered to be well-founded at present and there is a need for further evaluation of the importance of intermittent or persistent exposure to low or high raltegravir plasma concentrations post-approval:

- -In  ART-experienced  patients  in  study  005  no  PK/PD  association  was  detected  for  any efficacy response at week 16 compared to the observed C12 h parameters.
- -The  data  from  018  and  019  suggested  an  association  between  efficacy  and  the  modelpredicted AUC0-12 h. The applicant considered that the range of raltegravir concentrations obtained over 200 to 600 mg doses falls near the top of the concentration-response curve, where treatment response may be only modestly concentration-dependent.
- -Based on the monotherapy period of 004 in ART naïve patients the applicant considered that Ctrough (C12 hr) is likely the most sensitive PK parameter to predict viral response. The lower limit of clinical experience (i.e. with 100 mg b.i.d.) was ~0.4-fold (60% decrease) that  seen  with  the  recommended  dose  regimen  of  400  mg  b.i.d.  Since  the  applicant considered that 100 mg b.i.d. was an efficacious dose a decrease in plasma exposure of up to 0.4-fold was considered unlikely to affect efficacy.
- -Since  the  applicant  considered  that  AEs  did  not  seem  to  correlate  with  Cmax  it  was considered  that  AUC  was  the  most  appropriate  PK  parameter  for  judging  the  clinical significance of increases in raltegravir plasma concentrations in terms of safety. In Phase II, 51 patients received 600 mg raltegravir twice daily in combination with tenofovir and/or atazanavir. The applicant states that with this dose a ~50% increase in AUC over that seen with  400  mg  would  be  expected  plus  an  increase  by  an  extra  30  to  70%  due  to  the additional medicinal products. Thus the applicant considered that AUCs approximately 2fold  the  typical  value  observed  with  400  mg  twice  daily  dosing  were  likely  achieved without a clear association with AEs.

The applicant did commit to provide CHMP with a detailed plan to further explore the implications for safety and efficacy of the inter- and intra-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

## Clinical efficacy

The application contained efficacy data from the four studies presented in Table 1. For the assessment of the marketing authorisation application, the following data was available:

- -Study  004:  week  48  double-blind  data  for  all  doses;  available  data  beyond  week  48 reported
- -Study  005:  week  24  double-blind  data  for  all  doses;  available  data  beyond  week  48 reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Study 018: week 16 and week 24 double-blind data (final data for all patients)
- -Study 019: week 16 and week 24 double-blind data (final data for all patients)

In addition, the applicant provided limited and preliminary results of week 48 from studies 018 and 019  during  the  procedure  based  on  data  available  in-house  as  of  03.08.2007  and  31.07.2007, respectively.  The  final  week  48  efficacy  and  safety  data  was  however  considered  necessary  by  the CHMP for the assessment; the applicant did commit to provide these data post-approval.

All these studies have been performed with the formulation intended for marketing (Phase II/III/FMI poloxamer formulation).

## · Dose response studies

Two studies were conducted to establish the dose for raltegravir in combination antiretroviral therapy, one in ART naïve patients (004) and one in treatment experienced patients (005). The range of doses chosen for study was based on the results of the Phase I pharmacokinetic studies using the Phase I lactose formulation and the noted relationship between mean C12 hr and the IC95 in 50% human serum for antiretroviral activity.

## Study 004

Study 004 was a multi-centre, double-blind randomised dose-ranging, controlled study in ART naïve patients, which was conducted in two parts:

- -Part I compared raltegravir monotherapy (100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg, all b.i.d.) with placebo over 10 days (N=35). This was followed by a planned interim analysis before initiation of Part II that necessitated a time gap between Parts I and II.
- -Part  II  compared  raltegravir  (100 mg,  200 mg,  400 mg  and  600 mg,  all  b.i.d.)  with efavirenz  600  mg  once  daily  each  administered  in  combination  with  tenofovir  and lamivudine. By amendment the study will continue to Week 144 (N=198).

In part I the mean ages per group were in the range 35-45 years, log10 HIV RNA was from 4.5 to 5.0 and the CD4 counts were from 256 to 568 mm -3 ; in part II the mean ages per group were in the range 33-36 years, log10 HIV RNA was from 4.7 to 4.9 and the CD4 counts were from 225 to 277 mm -3 .

In part I each active groups showed a change from baseline in HIV RNA that was superior to placebo at Day 10. Over half per active group had &lt;400 copies/ml at Day 10 and one or two per group had &lt;50 copies/ml (Table 8).

For  patients  with  &gt;100,000  copies/ml  at  baseline,  77,  75,  83  and  100  %  in  the  four  ascending raltegravir dose groups had &lt;50 copies/ml at Week 24 compared with 86% in the efavirenz group. A similar analysis of Week 48 data showed that 85, 67, 67 and 88% raltegravir patients with &gt;100,000 copies/ml at baseline had &lt;50 copies/ml compared with 71% in the efavirenz group.

At Week 24, the average increase in CD4 cell count ranged from 122 to 184 cells/ml for raltegravir groups compared to 101 cells/ml for efavirenz. Corresponding values at Week 48 were 140 to 216 cells/ml compared to 156 cells/ml.

## Study 005

Study  005  was  a  multi-centre,  double-blind,  randomised,  dose-ranging,  placebo-controlled  study  in treatment-experienced  patients.  Patients  had  HIV  RNA  &gt;5,000  copies/ml  and  CD4  cell  counts &gt;50 cells/ml despite current stable (&gt; 3 months) therapy, plus documented resistance to at least one compound in each of the three classes of oral antiretroviral therapies (NRTI, NNRTI and PI). Patients with hepatitis B or C co-infection were excluded.

Raltegravir  (200,  400  and  600  mg  b.i.d.)  was  compared  with  placebo,  each  administered  in combination with an investigator-selected optimised background therapy (OBT). The use of tipranavir or  darunavir  was  not  allowed.  The  duration  of  the  double-blind,  dose-ranging  portion  was  at  least 24 weeks.

A total of 179 patients were enrolled with one patient never treated. Based on increase of exposure due to  atazanavir  (almost  all  subjects  received  atazanavir  boosted  with  ritonavir)  two  sub-studies  were performed:

A - Patients who did not receive atazanavir in their OBT (N=127);

B - Patients who did receive atazanavir in their OBT (N=52).

Patients were also stratified within each sub-study) by: (1) enfuvirtide use in OBT (yes or no); and (2) degree of resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) at study entry (resistant to 1 PI or &gt;1 PI).

Patients  who  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  or  virological  failure  after  completing  at  least 16 weeks  of  double-blind  therapy  were  allowed  to  enter  an  open-label  post  virological  failure (OLPVF) phase in which they received raltegravir in addition to current or revised OBT (initially 600 mg b.i.d. but reduced to 400 mg b.i.d. when Phase III data were available). Also, later during the study conduct  all  patients  who  had  completed  at  least  24  weeks  could  continue  to  receive  400  mg  b.i.d. without OBT changes.

Patient disposition shows the dramatic loss of patients from the placebo group into the OLPVF phase with 37 out of 45 patients (82.2%) in the placebo group entering the OLPVF phase.

The median age was 43 years. A diagnosis of AIDS applied to 82%. The median number of prior ARTs was 12 with a median duration of any ART of 10 years. At baseline about half of patients had HIV RNA &gt; 50,000 copies/ml. Excluding enfuvirtide,  there  was  no  active  antiretroviral  compound

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(GSS=0) in the OBT for 72% of patients based upon genotypic test results and for 48.3% of patients based upon phenotypic test results.

In sub-study A (no atazanavir that might augment plasma levels of raltegravir) the mean changes from baseline in log10 HIV RNA (OF approach) were -1.83, -1.76, -1.74 and -0.26 for the three ascending raltegravir  groups  and  placebo,  respectively.  The  changes  in  the  three  raltegravir  groups  were  each statistically significantly superior to placebo based upon Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test (p&lt;0.001) and adjustment for multiple comparisons. However there was no significant difference between the raltegravir dose groups.

The  applicant  concluded  that  the  benefit  of  raltegravir  over  placebo  was  not  significantly  different between  the  sub-studies  A  and  B.  However,  the  data  from  sub-  study  B  showed  some  possible numerical advantages for proportions with &lt; 400 and &lt; 50 copies/ml and for change in CD4 count when  raltegravir  was  co-administered  with  atazanavir  and  when  600  mg  was  used  compared  to 400 mg (Table 10).

On pooling the data from sub-studies A and B the results for the three raltegravir groups at Week 24 (using the Observed Failure approach for mean change from baseline in viral load and CD4 count) were generally similar although a lower proportion in the 400 mg b.i.d. group achieved &lt;50 copies/ml and  there  was  a  higher  rate  of  rebound  (Table  11).  Nevertheless,  for  the  virological  and  cellular endpoints all raltegravir groups were superior to placebo.

The  virological  and  CD4  responses  to  raltegravir  were  of  rapid  onset  with  early  (2-4  weeks) divergence from the placebo group.

Enfuvirtide use in OBT (Yes vs. No), baseline HIV RNA (&lt;50,000 copies/ml vs. &gt;50,000 copies/ml) and baseline phenotypic sensitivity score (&gt;0 vs. 0) appeared to be strongly associated with time to virological  failure  while  baseline  genotypic  sensitivity  score  was  less  strongly  associated  with  this endpoint.

Data  available  up  to  week  72  demonstrated  a  sustained  efficacy  response  to  at  least  Week  48.  An example is provided in Figure 1. Time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) has been assessed for raltegravir patients using any data available to week 72. Failures beyond Week 24 were uncommon.

Among patients who had failed during the study and entered the OLPVF phase nearly 90% (32/36) from the original placebo group showed an initial response to raltegravir and achieved &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 4 (Figure 2). Similarly 17/36 achieved &lt;50 copies/ml at Week 4. However, responses tended to drop over time, especially among those who did not achieve &lt;50 copies/ml soon after the initiation of raltegravir.

- Main studies

The two double-blind phase 3 studies with identical protocols have been initiated and are ongoing at time of this assessment. Both were multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of raltegravir (400 mg b.i.d) in combination with an optimized background therapy (OBT), versus OBT:

- -Protocol 018 (BENCHMRK 1) - conducted at 65 sites in Europe, Asia/Pacific, and South America (n=352);
- -Protocol 019 (BENCHMRK 2) - conducted at 53 sites in North and South America (n=351).

## METHODS (FOR BOTH STUDIES)

## Study Participants

Male and female patients at least 16 years of age were enrolled. Patients were to have a screening plasma HIV RNA &gt;1000 copies/ml on stable ART for ≥ 2 months and were to be infected with HIV that showed reduced susceptibility to at least one compound in each of NNRTI, NRTI and PI classes based on a genotypic/phenotypic resistance report from the central laboratory.

Blood samples for viral resistance  assays  were  collected  at  screening  to  confirm  viral  resistance  as required  by  the  inclusion  criteria  and  to  aid  selection  of  OBT  by  commercial  assays.  If  resistance evaluation with this assay failed, a prior resistance report, which showed reduced susceptibility to one or more ART agents and listed specific mutations indicative of resistance to the specific ART classes, was accepted as documentation for study entry.

## Treatments

Raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. or matching placebo was to be taken without regard to food.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on screening resistance testing results and prior treatment and resistance history, ARTs were reevaluated  to  optimize  the  background  therapy  (OBT).  OBT  could  include  investigational  medicinal products, which were under review for licensure provided the following protocol specified conditions were met: (1) The agent was available under an expanded access program; (2) The agent had been submitted for regulatory approval; and (3) Potential drug-drug interactions with raltegravir had been evaluated. Darunavir, in combination with ritonavir, became available during the conduct of the studies. The impact of this agent on the efficacy of raltegravir was evaluated and presented as part of the efficacy analyses.

During the double-blind portion of the study the OBT could be changed only for toxicity management (only in-class substitutions were permitted) or after confirmed virological failure, when OBT could be changed upon entry into the open-label post virological failure phase (OLPVF) of the study.

## Objectives

The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. compared to placebo, both in combination with OBT, as measured by proportions with &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 16.

## Other efficacy objectives were

- -to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of raltegravir compared to placebo based on:
- a. Proportion of patients with virological response at Week 16
- b. Change from baseline in HIV RNA (log10 copies/ml)
- c. Change from baseline in CD4 cell count
- -to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of raltegravir in combination with OBT at Week 48.

An evaluation of the safety and tolerability of raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. compared to placebo, both in combination with OBT, was performed by review of the accumulated safety data.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary measurement for efficacy in the study was the percentage with &lt; 400 copies/ml and the primary time point for evaluation of efficacy was Week 16.

## Sample size

With 230 patients in the raltegravir group and 115 in the placebo group, each study had 90% power to demonstrate superiority of raltegravir over placebo when the true response rate at Week 16 is 70% for raltegravir and 50% for placebo assuming a discontinuation rate of 10%.

## Randomisation

Patients who met the eligibility requirements were randomised to treatment (2 raltegravir: 1 placebo). Patients  were  stratified  by  enfuvirtide  use  in  OBT  (yes  or  no)  and  degree  of  resistance  to  protease inhibitors (resistant to 1 PI or &gt;1 PI).

## Blinding (masking)

These  were  double-blind  studies  in  which  the  patients  enrolled,  the  investigator(s)  and  study  site personnel and applicant's personnel were blinded to the study therapy received until all patients had completed  the  study  to  Week  16,  the  data  had  been  screened  for  completeness  and  accuracy  and protocol violators were identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

The primary analysis population used to assess efficacy was the modified intention to treat (MITT), all treated  regardless  of  any  protocol  deviations.  The  MITT  was  constituted  by  the  population  of  all randomised patients excluding the ones that did not receive any study medication (see Table 12).

For  primary  and  secondary  binary  endpoints,  a  logistic  regression  model  adjusted  for  following covariates was used: baseline plasma HIV RNA, enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients (Yes/No), active PI in OBT determined by phenotypic resistance test (Yes/No), darunavir use in the OBT in darunavir-naïve patients (Yes/No) and treatment group.

The  following  approaches  were  used  to  handle  missing  values  for  patients  who  prematurely discontinued:

- ¾ Observed Failure (OF): Patients who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment due to lack of efficacy were considered as failures thereafter. The OF approach considers a virological failure endpoint, which is focused on the antiretroviral effect of the treatment
- ¾ Treatment-Related Discontinuation = Failure (TRD=F): Patients who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment due to lack of efficacy or adverse experiences were considered as failures thereafter. The TRD=F approach considers a treatment failure endpoint, which also takes tolerability into consideration
- ¾ Non-Completer = Failure (NC=F): Patients  who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment regardless  of  reasons  were  considered  as  failures  thereafter.  The  NC=F  approach  considers  a study failure endpoint, which depends on the conduct of the study. In a well-conducted trial, the non-treatment-related discontinuation rate is low and TRD=F is similar to NC=F.

Patients with virological failures starting at Week 16 or beyond were allowed to receive open-label raltegravir (OLPVF).

## Conduct of the study

The first protocol amendment (about 6 months after commencement of enrolment) changed the timing of  the  primary  and  secondary analyses from Week 24 to Week 16 and extended the study from 48 weeks to 156 weeks. All patients in the double blind and OLPVF phases are eligible for the extension.

Further important baseline data were as follows:

- -In study 018, 52.6% raltegravir and 45.8% placebo patients had baseline plasma HIV RNA &gt;50,000 copies/ml while 33.2% and 28.0% in respective groups had &gt;100,000 copies/ml. CD4 counts ≤ 50 cells/mm 3 were seen in 29.7% and 33.9%. 43.1% in the raltegravir group and  46.6%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  no  active  PI  in  the  OBT  based  on phenotypic sensitivity test results. About 30% per group had no active agent in OBT based on GSS and about 20% had no active agent in OBT based on PSS scores.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -In  study  019,  about  54%  and  49%  in  respective  groups  had  baseline  plasma  HIV  RNA &gt;50,000  copies/ml,  38%  in  each  group  had  &gt;100,000  copies/ml  and  34%  and  32%  per group had baseline CD4 &lt;50 cells/mm3. 29% raltegravir and 35% placebo group patients had no active PI in the OBT based on PSS. By GSS 20% and 26% had no active agent in their OBT compared to 10% and 19% by PSS.

## Numbers analysed

In study 018, of the 352 randomized patients 2 did not receive any study medication. The remaining 350 patients constitute the MITT population and were included in the efficacy analyses. All treated patients received the correct assigned treatment; there were no cross-treated patients.

In study 019, of the 351 randomized patients 2 did not receive any study medication. The remaining 349 patients constitute the MITT population and were included in the efficacy analyses. 3 patients did receive incorrect therapy for approximately 1 month each due to medication dispensing errors. These patients are included in the efficacy analyses in their assigned treatment groups.

## Outcomes and estimation

In the primary analysis at Week 16 (% with &lt; 400 c/ml) of both studies individually, raltegravir was statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  (p&lt;0.001)  based  upon  a  logistic  regression  model adjusted for baseline HIV RNA level, enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients, active PI in OBT determined by phenotypic resistance test and darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients. The model adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for this primary endpoint between raltegravir and placebo were 10.6 (5.60, 20.25) and was 9.6 (5.02, 18.25) for studies 018 and 019, respectively. The results are presented in Table 14.

## Ancillary analyses

Tables  15  and  16  show  that  proportions  who  achieved  &lt;  400  and  &lt;  50  c/ml  were  lower  in  both treatment groups when baseline viral load was &gt; 50,000 or &gt; 100,000 c/ml and when CD4 counts were less than 50 mm-3. However, response rates at both levels were higher in the raltegravir group.

H Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir naïve patients was counted as one active PI

‡ The Phenotypic Sensitivity Score (PSS) and the Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) were defined as the total oral ARTs in OBT to which a patients viral isolate showed phenotypic sensitivity and genotypic sensitivity, respectively, based upon phenotypic and genotypic resistance tests. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the GSS and PSS. Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir na¨ve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the PSS and GSS.

Inclusion of enfuvirtide or darunavir in the OBT for patients who were naïve to these agents improved the responses in raltegravir and placebo groups compared to patients without these agents in the OBT. While  the  response  rates  were  higher  in  the  raltegravir  group  the  relative  effects  of  including enfuvirtide and darunavir in the OBT in naïve patients were greater in the placebo group. That is, the patterns observed suggested that while darunavir and enfuvirtide made some contribution to overall response rates in the raltegravir group these two agents probably accounted for much of the response seen in the placebo group. An analysis of changes in CD4 counts according to the same prognostic factors showed a generally similar pattern of effects.

H Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir naïve patients was counted as one active PI

‡ The Phenotypic Sensitivity Score (PSS) and the Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) were defined as the total oral ARTs in OBT to which a patients viral isolate showed phenotypic sensitivity and genotypic sensitivity, respectively, based upon phenotypic and genotypic resistance tests. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the GSS and PSS. Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir na¨ve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the PSS and GSS.

In the OLPVF phase patients initially assigned to placebo had consistently greater numerical responses compared to those who had failed while taking raltegravir (and so could only change their OBT in the OLPVF phase). None of the prior raltegravir patients but 35-40% (study 018) and 23% (study 019) of the prior placebo patients achieved &lt; 50 copies/ml up to the cut-off.

In study 018, nine patients (rate 9.0 per 100 patient-years) on raltegravir and three (rate 5.6 per 100 patient-years) on placebo had confirmed definitive ADCs. Some patients had more than one ADC. In study  019,  five  patients  (rate  5.1  per  100  patient-years)  on  raltegravir  and  three  (rate  5.6  per  100 patient-years) on placebo had confirmed definitive ADCs. Most had only one ADC.

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The applicant performed a pre-specified meta-analysis for studies 018 and 019 only after homogeneity tests  did  not  show  a  heterogeneous  treatment  effect  across  protocols  (p=0.503  for  treatment  related discontinuation  =  failure  approach;  p=0.518  for  non-completer  =  failure  approach;  p=0.766  for observed  failure  approach).  In  line  with  the  results  of  the  homogeneity  tests  this  meta-analysis demonstrated the same overall efficacy of raltegravir in combination with OBT.

At Week 16 there was no significant treatment interaction detected for the prognostic factors baseline HIV  RNA,  enfuvirtide  use  in  OBT  in  enfuvirtide-naïve  patients,  active  PI  in  OBT  determined  by phenotypic resistance test, and darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients.

At Week 16 those who received both enfuvirtide and darunavir without prior exposure had the highest responses while the lowest occurred in those who received neither agent for the first time.

In addition to Week 16 outcomes, the final data of the Week 24 evaluation has been provided during the assessment on the request of the CHMP. These data are presented in Table 16. For those patients who did respond at Week 16 there was almost always a documented sustained response to week 24.

To address whether baseline HIV RNA, enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients, active PI in OBT determined by phenotypic resistance test and darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients were  associated  with  outcome,  each  factor  was  assessed  as  a  main  effect  in  the  logistic  regression model. Table 17 shows that at Week 24 these factors exhibited statistically significant effects on the proportions of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml.

Patients with poor prognostic factors had lower response rates than patients without poor prognostic factors. However, benefits over placebo were maintained. Table 18 shows responses for proportions with &lt;50 copies/ml.

To further evaluate efficacy and durability of the response in patients with a baseline GSS = 0, Table 18 and Figure 3 show the percentage of patients with GSS = 0 who achieved reduction of plasma viral load  to  &lt;50  copies/ml  out  to  24  weeks  (observed  failure  approach).  In  this  subset  43%  in  the raltegravir group achieved a viral load of &lt;50 copies/ml after 8 weeks of therapy and 44.1% had &lt; 50 copies/ml at week 24. In contrast, only 11.1% of GSS = 0 patients receiving OBT alone achieved viral loads of &lt;50 copies/ml at week 8 and 6.3% at week 24.

The proportions of GSS = 0 patients with &lt;50 copies/ml at week 16 and week 24 were lower than observed among patients with GSS &gt; 0. Similar results were observed in patients with PSS = 0.

† Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active PI.

‡ The Phenotypic Sensitivity Score (PSS) and the Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) were defined as the total oral ARTs in OBT to which a patients viral isolate showed phenotypic sensitivity and genotypic sensitivity, respectively, based upon phenotypic and genotypic resistance tests. Enfuvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the GSS and PSS. Darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT and added to the PSS and GSS.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

In 18 Phase I studies, including healthy subjects and subjects with renal or hepatic impairment, 315 were treated with at least a single dose of raltegravir. Single doses up to 1600 mg and multiple dosing regimens with up to 800 mg b.i.d. for 10 days were employed.

Overall 758 patients were randomised to receive raltegravir. With addition of those who continued on to  open-label  raltegravir  treatment  there  were  875  patients  exposed  in  the  four  studies  in  ARTexperienced patients (004, 005, 018 and 019).

The  safety  database  was  updated  during  the  assessment,  including  data  up  to  1Q2007.  The  update included  899  patients.  Most  had  been  treated  for  at  least  24  weeks  and  some  for  up  to  90  weeks. Median durations of double blind treatment were 35 weeks for raltegravir and 27 weeks for placebo with corresponding times at risk of 332.2 patient-years (raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d.) and 150.2 patientyears for placebo. Time at risk in the OLPVF phase was 106.8 patient-years.

## · Adverse events

In study 005, 152/178 patients (85.4%) reported in the initial submission had a clinical adverse events but rates and patterns were generally similar between the two sub-studies (with and without atazanavir in OBT). Rates of all and drug-related adverse events were slightly higher with the 600 mg b.i.d. dose compared to lower dose groups although the rate for drug-related adverse events was similar to that in the placebo group.

In  a  pooled  analysis  across  studies  005,  018  and  019,  there  were  no  drug-related  clinical  adverse events that occurred at frequencies at least 2% greater in the pooled raltegravir group compared to the pooled  placebo  group.  Diarrhoea  was  the  commonest  AE  reported  with  raltegravir  use  in  ARTexperienced patients,  occurring  in  at  16.6%  compared  to  19.5%  in  the  control  groups,  as  shown  in Table 19.

Based on the safety update that was received during the assessment period, clinical adverse events that occurred at frequencies at least 2% greater in the raltegravir group were limited to fatigue (7.9% versus 4.6%), herpes zoster (4.1% versus 0.7%), nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 3.9%) and rash (5.3% versus 2.5%). Rates of these adverse events in patients who received atazanavir and/or tenofovir as part  of  the  OBT  regimen,  which  would  be  expected  to  increase  raltegravir  plasma  levels,  were compared to patients who did not receive these agents. In the raltegravir group receiving atazanavir and/or tenofovir rates were 8.6%, 4.3%, 5.1% and 6.1% for these respective adverse events compared to 5.4%, 3.6%, 9.8% and 2.7% of patients not taking atazanavir and/or tenofovir.

Of  the  21  patients  with  herpes  zoster  in  the  raltegravir  group  irrespective  of  atazanavir  and/or tenofovir  use  none  was  serious,  most  were  of  mild  intensity  and  none  caused  interruption  of discontinuation of study medication. Herpes zoster in patients beginning HAART has been reported as a  manifestation  of  Immune  Reconstitution  Syndrome  (IRS).  The  rate  of  herpes  zoster  seen  with raltegravir was in the range of published rates among HIV-infected patients recently commenced on HAART.

In the initial application documentation, the proportion of patients with rash was 6.7% (34/507) for the raltegravir group and 3.9% (11/282) for the placebo group. Several patients reported more than one rash (3 raltegravir and one placebo). Drug related rash was reported in 2.0% (10/507) of the raltegravir arm  and  2.5%  (7/282)  of  the  placebo  arm.  There  were  no  discontinuations  due  to  rash  or  serious adverse events of rash. In the raltegravir group the intensity of rash was mild-moderate for 33/34 and 25/34 recovered. In the placebo group all rashes were mild to moderate and 8/11 recovered. In the raltegravir  group  23/34  took  two  or  more  concomitant  medications  commonly  associated  with  rash (e.g. atovaquone, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, abacavir, amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, efavirenz, fosamprenavir and tipranavir) compared with 3/11 in the placebo group who took two or more of these agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety update showed that the rate of rash remained higher in the raltegravir group. Drug-related rash was reported for 2.2% (11/507) raltegravir patients in the cumulative period. There were seven additional OLPVF phase patients with rash during the safety update report period of which four were considered drug-related but only one patient interrupted study therapy and the investigator considered that the rash was related to delavirdine.

Because of a serious adverse event of rash in an ongoing Phase I study of raltegravir with darunavir and ritonavir rash was examined according to use darunavir in OBT. In the double-blind cohort in the cumulative period there were 294 patients who used darunavir in OBT and 495 patients who did not. Among those who darunavir in OBT the proportions with rash in the cumulative period were 13.5% (26/193) in the raltegravir group compared to 4/101 (4%) in the placebo group. Drug-related rash was reported in 3.1% (6/193) and 2% (2/101). Among patients who did not use darunavir rash occurred in 4.5% (14/314; related in 5) and in 3.9% (7/181) in respective groups. The intensity of drug-related rash was mild to moderate for all patients and all patients recovered from drug-related rash.

The safety update also revealed that rash occurred in 9.4% (37/395) patients in the raltegravir group who used atazanavir and/or tenofovir in OBT. The frequency of drug-related rash in this subset was 2.8%.  In  contrast,  rash  occurred  in  2.7%  (3/112)  in  the  raltegravir  group  patients  who  did  not  use atazanavir and/or tenofovir in OBT and none of the three cases was considered to be drug-related.

At present there appear to be several possible explanations for the higher rates of rash observed in the raltegravir group overall and on co-administration with particular other antiretroviral agents. Rash is included as a specific issue in the Risk Management Plan.

In  the  pooled  400  mg  b.i.d.  double-blind  cohort  of  005,  018  and  019  there  were  8/789  patients  (4 raltegravir)  with  a  report  of  drug  hypersensitivity  or  hypersensitivity.  The  four  reported  from  the raltegravir group seem unlikely to have been related to this medicinal product.

Adverse  events  with  onset  during  the  OLPVF  phase  are  reported  for  177  patients  of  whom  100 (56.5%) reported an adverse event. Drug-related adverse events were reported by 19.2% (34/177). In general, the adverse event profile was similar to that for raltegravir during the double-blind phase.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There  was  one  serious  adverse  event  reported  from  a  Phase  I  study  (029),  which  involved  coadministration of raltegravir with darunavir and ritonavir. On co-administration a patient had a diffuse maculopapular  rash  on  the  trunk  and  extremities  and  discontinued  all  study  medications.  A  punch biopsy  indicated  superficial  perivascular  chronic  inflammation  with  rare  intravascular  neutrophils, which  was  consistent  with  a  delayed  hypersensitivity  reaction.  When  the  rash  worsened  to  include facial and periorbital oedema the subject was admitted to hospital for 2 days. Recovery was almost complete by Day 38. At the time of the safety update there had been four discontinuations due to rash from  this  study.  These  were  moderate  (3)  or  severe  (1)  grade  2  pruritic  rashes  determined  to  be definitely related to co-administration of the three agents by the investigator. Rash occurred after at least 9 days of co-administration, was similar in nature across the four subjects and was considered to be similar to that seen in other darunavir studies. All four subjects have recovered.

In  study  004  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  by  2-5  patients  per  dose  group  but  none  was considered  drug-related.  In  the  safety  update  one  patient  had  a  serious  adverse  event  of  Kaposi's sarcoma but no patient had died.

Six  of  the  seven  deaths  in  the  400  mg  b.i.d.  double-blind  phases  of  005,  108  and  019  occurred  in patients  who had been assigned to raltegravir. None was considered to be drug-related. There were two additional deaths reported in the safety update - one had a fatal serious adverse event of coronary artery disease and one had pleural effusion, splenic abscess and lymphadenopathy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Across these studies the most frequent serious adverse events were infections and infestations, which were  of  a  very  varied  nature.  In  the  safety  update  additional  serious  adverse  events  included  the additional patients who died and a patient with a second bout of pancreatitis

There were eight raltegravir patients with drug-related serious adverse events but in 5/8 the serious adverse events were ascribed to the OBT. In the other three cases the serious adverse events were renal failure,  gastritis  and  hepatitis  that  recurred  on  re-starting  therapy  after  treatment  interruption.  In  the safety update there were four more drug-related serious adverse events in the double-blind cohort of studies 018 and 019 (herpes simplex, renal failure, gastritis and overdose)

Three raltegravir patients were reported to have serious adverse events of IRS, of which one occurred in  the  OLPVF phase and was considered to be drug-related. Study therapy was interrupted for one patient. Two had a documented recovery but the other was ongoing at the cut-off.

One patient died as a result of progressive multi-focal leuco-encephalopathy in the OLPVF phase with onset detected at day 177. Also, in the OLPVF phase serious adverse events were reported by 10.7% (19/177) of patients of which one case of immune reconstitution syndrome was considered to be drugrelated.  Two  more  serious  adverse  events  in  the  OLPVF  phase  (depression  and  diarrhoea)  were reported in the safety update.

In  the  safety  update  serious  adverse  events  had  been  reported  by  36/827  patients  in  the  expanded access  programme.  These  included  a  B-cell  lymphoma  and  three  cases  of  PME.  One  case  of hypersensitivity resolved after stopping the medicinal product while another continued with therapy and the episode resolved.

Based on the data from the double blind cohort the patient-year adjusted incidence rates of malignancy were 2.3 for raltegravir and 1.9 for comparator per 100 patient-years, which gives a relative risk of 1.2 with  an  associated  95%  confidence  interval  of  (0.4,  4.1).  The  difference  between  raltegravir  and control  groups  that  had  been  calculated  based  on  the  initial  submission  was  therefore  reduced  with further follow-up (Table 21).

On inclusion of open label and double blind exposure there were 916 raltegravir patients with 1118 patient-years time at risk, which is approximately 500 additional patient years of exposure compared to  the  initial  analysis  (Table  22).  The  patient-year-adjusted  incidence  rate  of  malignancy  during  all raltegravir therapy was 2.3 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.5, 3.4).

Patients with active cancer were eligible for 018 and 019 provided that they were clinically stable and not expected to require chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy. In the four Phase II/III studies (004, 005, 018 and 019) 17.4% of raltegravir patients and 16.4% of controls had a malignancy or premalignant  condition  prior  to  enrolment.  In  8/19  patients  in  the  double-blind  period,  the  cancer represented a recurrence or progression. All of the patients had a diagnosis of AIDS and most had CD4 cell counts &lt;150 cells/mm 3 .  Co-existing conditions associated with malignancy were present in

all  patients including presence of oncogenic viral infections such as HPV and HBV or tobacco use. Malignant neoplasia features in the Risk Management Plan as a potential risk.

## · Laboratory findings

There were no serious laboratory AEs reported in the Phase I studies. The most common laboratory AE was hyperbilirubinaemia but this occurred after initiation of atazanavir in two interaction studies.

In ART-naïve patients in 004 laboratory AEs were reported in 39/198 patients, the most frequent being AST increased (10.5% in the efavirenz group vs 5.6  %  in  the  pooled  raltegravir  groups).  The  most frequently reported drug-related laboratory AEs were increases in ALT and AST, both of which were reported in 3.8% raltegravir and 5.3% efavirenz patients. There was no apparent association between all or related laboratory AEs and the dose of raltegravir.

In  ART-experienced  patients  the  most  frequently  reported  ( ≥ 3%) laboratory  AEs  were  increases  in ALT, AST, triglycerides and CK.

## ALT/AST

In the treatment-experienced raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. cohort during the double-blind phase laboratory adverse  events  of  increased  ALT  and  increased  AST  were  reported  in  4.7%  (24/507)  and  4.5% (23/507) of patients, respectively, as compared with 2.1 % (6/282) and 2.8 % (8/282) in the placebo group. Drug related increases were reported in 3.2% (16/507) and 2.6% (13/507) of raltegravir patients compared with 0.7% (2/282) and 1.1% (3/282) in the placebo group. On review of laboratory results that exceeded pre-defined limits of change (PDLC) Grade 3 and 4 aminotransferase elevations were uncommon.

In  the  treatment-experienced  raltegravir  400  mg  b.i.d.  cohort  during  the  double-blind  phase,  11.6% (59/507) of raltegravir patients had a Grade 2 or higher AST elevation compared to 8.5% (24/282) in the  placebo  group.  Corresponding  rates  for  ALT  were  10.4%  (53/507)  and  10.3%  (29/282).  In  the OLPVF phase, 5.0% (10/199) of patients had a Grade 2 or higher AST elevation and 6.5% (13/200) of patients had a Grade 2 or higher ALT elevation.

Patients with Grade 2 or higher AST or ALT elevations were further analysed by baseline HBV and/or HCV infection, concurrent CK elevation and tipranavir use in OBT. Raltegravir patients with Grade 2 AST or AST elevations were more likely to have HBV or HCV and a concurrent increase in CK than placebo patients but there was no difference with regard to tipranavir use. A review of patients whose OBT  included  or  did  not  include  tipranavir  showed  that  slightly  higher  rates  of  AST  and  ALT elevations  reported  as  adverse  events  and  recorded  as  PDLC  were  seen  for  both  raltegravir  and comparator treatment groups among those whose OBT contained tipranavir.

## Creatin kinase (CK)

In the treatment-experienced raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d. cohort during the double-blind phase laboratory AEs of increased CK were reported in 3.7% (19/507) compared to 1.1% (3/282) in the placebo group. Drug-related  adverse  events  of  increased  CK  were  reported  in  1.2%  (6/507)  and  1.1%  (3/282)  in respective  groups.  During  the  double-blind  and  the  OLPVF  phases  there  were  no  serious  adverse events or discontinuations due to increased CK. Many were isolated increases that returned to normal with time and elevations for several patients were noted by the investigators to be related to physical exercise.

All  grades  of  CK  elevations  occurred  more  often  in  the  raltegravir  group.  There  was  only  one  CK elevation of Grade 1 or higher present during 2 visits at least 30 days apart.

Since  the  cut-off  date  for  the  safety  update  several  cases  of  myopathy  and  rhabdomyolysis  have occurred in ongoing studies. Although the relationship to raltegravir is not clear these events need to be mentioned in the SPC and added as specific issues for attention in the Risk Management Plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Lipids

The  data  from  004  with  a  fixed  NRTI  combination  regimen  indicated  no  significant  elevation  of triglycerides,  total  cholesterol  or  LDL-cholesterol  in  the  raltegravir  groups  compared  with  the efavirenz  group.  The  pooled  data  in  ART-experienced  patients  with  400  mg  b.i.d.  showed  that  the frequency of lipid abnormalities reaching Grade 3 or 4 according to the DAIDS toxicity criteria and the mean change from baseline in fasting lipids were generally similar between raltegravir and placebo groups.  However,  hyperlipidaemia,  dyslipidaemia,  hypercholesterolaemia  and  hypertriglyceridaemia were commonly present at baseline (16.7%, 4.9%, 7.2% and 12.9% of patients, respectively) and lipid lowering agents were commonly used along with ARTs associated with lipid disorders. The frequency of lipodystrophy or lipoatrophy reported as AEs was &lt;1% but the background rates were high (27.4% and 12.0%).

## Glucose

Fasting glucose was routinely monitored. From pooled data with 400 mg b.i.d. hyperglycaemia was reported in one patient in each of raltegravir and placebo groups while diabetes mellitus was reported in 1.0% (5/507) and 1.1% (3/282), respectively. Grade 3 and 4 abnormalities in blood glucose were uncommon.

- Safety in special populations

Adverse  events  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  generally  similar  in  patient  subgroups  based  on gender,  age  (&lt;65  or ≥ 65  years)  and  race.  However,  interpretations  are  limited  due  to  the  lack  of patients  aged ≥ 75  years  and  to  relatively  small  numbers  of  females,  patients  aged ≥ 65  and  from certain racial groups.

In  study  004,  one  raltegravir  patient  (400  mg  b.i.d.  group)  reported  a  pregnancy  and  discontinued during the extension phase. The outcome of the pregnancy is unknown. The single pregnancy reported in study 005 occurred in a patient randomised to raltegravir 200 mg b.i.d. who switched to open label 400  mg  b.i.d.  on  day  363  even  though  a  pregnancy  test  on  day  350  was  positive.  On  Day  382 additional  urine  pregnancy  tests  were  positive  and  all  therapy  was  interrupted.  She  had  an  elective abortion  and  then  restarted  study  medication  therapy  including  OBT.  There  were  no  pregnancies reported for female patients in 018 or 019 but the wife of a patient in 019 became pregnant while he was  taking  blinded  study  therapy  and  had  an  elective  abortion.  A  pregnancy  register  has  been established by the applicant.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Diarrhoea was reported more frequently when raltegravir was given with tipranavir (22.5% compared with 13.8% without tipranavir). See above regarding rates of rash when raltegravir was and was no coadministered with other ARTs.

To assess for potential toxicity based on the presumed highest exposure to raltegravir the applicant reviewed  the  data  for  74  patients  who  received both atazanavir  and  tenofovir  DF  in  OBT  with inclusion of 36 in the 400 mg b.i.d. group, 9 in the 600 mg b.i.d. group and 29 in the placebo group. Nausea appeared at a higher frequency (33.3%) in the 600 mg b.i.d. group. There were no adverse events of rash reported in these 74 patients except for a pruritic rash in a raltegravir patient who took 400  mg  b.i.d.  with  atazanavir  and  tenofovir  DF.  Laboratory  adverse  event  profiles  were  generally similar in the patient subgroups.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

In 004 one patient discontinued raltegravir (600 mg b.i.d.) due to a G4 AST elevation considered to be drug-related. In study 005 three patients in sub-study A discontinued during the double-blind phase,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

two  of  whom  had  been  assigned  to  raltegravir  and  died.  One  raltegravir  patient  in  sub-study  B discontinued during the double-blind phase due to increased ALT and AST.

During treatment with 400 mg b.i.d. 13 patients (9 raltegravir) discontinued due to adverse events. In the  raltegravir  group  five  adverse  events  in  four  patients  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be drug-related but hepatomegaly and hyperlactacidaemia in one patient were considered related to OBT. The other three patients with drug-related adverse events had hepatitis, renal failure or flatulence. One of the nine raltegravir patients discontinued due to a laboratory adverse event that was not considered to be drug-related.

In the safety update there were another 10 patients in the double blind cohort that discontinued due to adverse events and one in the OLPVF phase. These adverse events were of no clear pattern.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory for the intended clinical use as defined in the SPC. There are no unresolved quality issues which may have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Biochemical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that raltegravir inhibits integrase strand transfer and consequently inhibits integration of HIV-1 into host cell genomic DNA and inhibits replication of HIV-1 and HIV-2. No significant  off-target  activities  were  detected  for  raltegravir.  Several  pivotal non-clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  safety  pharmacology  of  Raltegravir.  No significant  treatment  related  effects  were  found  in  any  of  these  studies.  At  higher  compound concentrations, typically in excess of their IC50 values, Raltegravir displayed synergistic activity with all other antiviral compounds tested, regardless of their mechanism of inhibition.

The  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  raltegravir  have  been  evaluated  in  rat  and  dog  studies  with additional  studies  in  rabbits  and  mice,  and  a  number  of in  vitro assays.  Raltegravir  is  a  low  to intermediate clearance, and orally bioavailable compound, with a short plasma half-life, a volume of distribution  ranging  from  ~0.4  to  2  L/kg  and  a  rapid  absorption.  Raltegravir  is  cleared  primarily  by glucuronidation and the main route of excretion is by the faeces. The main metabolite of raltegravir is M2, which has no activity against HIV-1. Raltegravir is excreted into the milk of lactating rats.

The toxicology profile of raltegravir was assessed by single-dose and repeat dose studies, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity (in progress), reproductive toxicity studies and a number of non-pivotal additional  toxicity  studies.  Raltegravir  was  generally  well  tolerated,  with  an  exposure  margin  of  at least 1.6-fold above the expected exposure of the 400 mg/BID dose in patients. The results of the four GLP genotoxicity studies are negative, indicating the absence of a genotoxic potential for raltegravir.

Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats are currently on-going. The final study reports will be provided post-approval. No short-term carcinogenicity studies have been conducted.

The  'no  observed  adverse  effect  levels'  of  reproduction  studies  were  600  mg/kg/day  for  maternal toxicity, ≥ 600 mg/kg/day  for  male  fertility  and  300  mg/kg/day  for  embryo-fetal  development.  The safety margin at the 'no observed effect levels' for developmental toxicity is approximately 3.4-fold the value at the maximum recommended dose (MRD). In rabbits, no developmental toxicity was found at the maximum dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, resulting in a safety margin of about 3.7-fold relative to the AUC in patients at the MRD.

With respect to local tolerance, raltegravir is not considered a dermal sensitizer and is classified as a mild irritant as the free base and as a severe irritant as the potassium salt. Raltegravir did not show evidence  of  immunogenicity  or  antigenicity  and  it  is  considered  non-phototoxic  at  doses  up  to

2000 mg/kg.  The  specification  limits  of  the  impurities  have  been  adequately  justified,  and  their potential for toxicity, including genotoxicity, has been adequately investigated.

A  satisfactory  revised  environmental  risk  assessment  for  raltegravir  was  provided;  there  was  no evidence of a risk to the aquatic environment, nor to micro-organisms. The data did not suggest any potential for raltegravir to bioaccumulate.

## Efficacy

The  results  from  the  two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  (018  and  019)  at  Week  16  demonstrate  the superiority of raltegravir over placebo when used in combination with OBT in treatment-experienced patients.  The  general  study  designs,  including the  patient  selection  criteria,  were  appropriate  except that even in treatment-experienced patients the optimal outcome is to achieve &lt;50 copies/ml hence the choice of primary endpoint of &lt;400 copies/ml at Week 16 could be criticised. Nevertheless data at &lt;50 copies/ml  also  showing  this  overall  outcome  have  been  provided  and  show  an  advantage  for raltegravir. Data through to Week 24 showed that for those patients who did respond at Week 16 there was almost always a documented sustained response to Week 24

In studies 018 and 019 about 30% per group had no active agent in OBT based on GSS and about 20% per group had no active agent in OBT based on PSS scores. For those with a PSS score of zero in oral OBTs about half of raltegravir patients achieved &lt;50 copies/ml at Week 24 compared to 5% in the placebo  group.  In  both  groups  these  patients  may  have  been  receiving  enfuvirtide  and  so  the raltegravir  results  cannot  be  interpreted  as  responses  to  monotherapy.  As  expected,  the  response  to raltegravir  was  lower  in  those  with  baseline  viral  load  &gt;50,000  or  &gt;100,000  copies/ml  and/or  CD4 counts  &lt;50  mm-3.  However,  response  rates  were  still  much  higher  in  the  raltegravir  than  placebo group.

Inclusion of enfuvirtide or darunavir in the OBT for patients who were naïve to these agents improved the responses in raltegravir and placebo groups compared to patients without these agents in the OBT. Those who received both agents without prior exposure had the highest responses at this level while the lowest occurred in those who received neither agent for the first time. While the response rates were higher in the raltegravir group the relative effects of including enfuvirtide and darunavir in the OBT in naïve patients were greater in the placebo group. The patterns observed suggested that while darunavir and enfuvirtide  made some contribution to overall response rates in the raltegravir group these two agents probably accounted for much of the response seen in the placebo group.

There is a low genetic barrier to the selection of raltegravir-resistant mutants; the CHMP requested that  further  examinations  of  the  resistance  profile  should  be  performed  post-approval.  Thus  far  the applicant has been able to identify several mutations that correlate with virological failure and reduced susceptibility  to  raltegravir.  Whereas in  vitro studies  suggested  that  these  mutant  viruses  have  a reduced  capacity  for  replication in  vitro this  finding  seems  to  be  irrelevant  to  the  clinical  situation since  failure  has  occurred.  Viruses  with  these  mutations  have  emerged  from  about  Weeks  2-4 onwards. Factors that decreased the likelihood of developing mutation at either amino acid 148 or 155 included lower viral load, the use of darunavir in OBT, PSS &gt;0 and GSS&gt;0. Having a low CD4 count ( ≤ 50 mm-3 vs. &gt;200 mm-3) increased the likelihood of developing a mutation at either amino acid 148 or 155. The SPC specifically advises against use of functional monotherapy.

## Safety

The safety database was significantly updated during the assessment with data on 899 patients and corresponding  treatment  times  of  332.2  and  150.2  patient-years  for  raltegravir  400  mg  b.i.d  and placebo, respectively.

In  the  clinical  studies  the  most  common  side  effects  seen  were  diarrhoea,  nausea,  headache  and pyrexia.  Important  safety  issues  which  require  a  specific  follow-up  post-marketing  include  immune reconstitution inflammatory  syndrome,  malignancies, serious rash, increase in liver  enzymes,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lipodystrophy/fat maldistribution, and increase in creatine kinase with clinical manifestations (myophathy, rhabdomyolysis).

Regarding the risk of malignant neoplasm, patient-year adjusted incidence rates for malignancies were 2.3 for raltegravir vs. 1.9 for placebo per 100 patient-years resulting in a relative risk of 1.2 and 95% confidence interval of (0.4, 4.1). Overall, the numbers are relatively small, the types of malignancies have been diverse and several occurred so early in the course of treatment that a relationship to the medicinal product seems unlikely. Also, the listing of cases shows that these patients included several who achieved good viral suppression and others who seemed to have failed to respond from the start. Malignancies feature in the Risk Management Plan.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

User  testing  was  performed  in  26  subjects.  The  results  demonstrated  that  at  least  90%  of  the participants  were  able  to  find  each  point  of  information.  It  also  showed  that  at  least  90%  of  those participants were able to express the information in their own words. The leaflet therefore fulfils the requirements for user testing.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

The  differences  observed  between  raltegravir  and  placebo,  both  in  combination  with  optimised background  therapy,  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  studies  in  treatment-experienced  patients  indicate  that addition of raltegravir  to  an  appropriate  optimised  background  therapy  regimen  can  provide suppression of HIV replication that is sustained to 24 weeks.

With regard to the likely efficacy of raltegravir in routine clinical use in the intended target population there remains a question regarding the possible clinical importance of intermittent or persistent low plasma  exposure  to  raltegravir  in  terms  of  risk  of  selecting  for  drug-resistant  virus  and  virological failure.

## Risks

Thus far the applicant has been able to identify several mutations that correlate with virological failure and  reduced  susceptibility  to  raltegravir.  The  data  strongly  suggest  a  low  genetic  barrier  for  the selection of raltegravir-resistant mutants that requires further evaluation.

Furthermore, there remains a need for very careful study of the following specific issues in the postmarketing period: malignant neoplasm, increases in liver enzymes or CK, gastrointestinal irritation, immune  reconstitution syndrome, interaction with strong UTG1A1  inducers, rash and lipid abnormalities. The Risk Management Plan addresses these issues; an adequately designed observational cohort study is needed to generate appropriate long-term safety data.

## Balance

Based on the assessment of the available data, and in particular the 24-week safety and efficacy data from  the  two  pivotal  trials,  it  is  considered  that  the  risk-benefit  relationship  is  favourable  for  a conditional  approval  according  to  Article  14(7)  of  Regulation  (EC)  726/2004  in  conjunction  with Commission Regulation (EC) 507/2006:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -ISENTRESS is proposed to be indicated for  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection,  which  is  a  lifethreatening disease, and so falls within the scope of the legislative framework on conditional marketing authorisations as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) 507/2006.
- -In  support  of  the  MAA  the  applicant  provided  complete  24-week  data  from  two  Phase  3 studies.  Comprehensive  clinical  data  up  to  48  weeks  would  be  needed  to  further  assess important  issues  including  long-term  viral  suppression,  the  safety  profile  and  the  resistance pattern. Such data will be generated but were not available in the timeframe of the assessment. In addition, it was considered that further monitoring of resistance to raltegravir and the risk for malignancies is required.
- -Based  on  the  available  data  the  risk-benefit  analysis  was  considered  to  be  positive.  The product fulfils an unmet medical need as it has a novel mechanism of action that results in activity  against  HIV  that  is  resistant  to  many  other  antiretroviral  agents.  It  likely  has  an acceptable safety profile and a limited potential for drug interactions. On this basis it could be considered that the benefit to public health of allowing ISENTRESS to be marketed without undue delay may outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Therefore, the application fulfilled the requirements for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) 507/2006.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- -pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
- -no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of ISENTRESS in the therapeutic indication

'ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatment-experienced adult patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing anti-retroviral therapy.

This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 24 weeks duration in treatment-experienced patients (see section 5.1)'

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation.
