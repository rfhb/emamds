## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 200 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets is a medicinal product containing ribavirin  as  an  active  substance.  The  application  for  200  mg  tablets  was  submitted  under  the Article 10(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  i.e.  generic  application  referring  to  a  reference  medicinal product.  The  application  for  400  mg  tablets  was  submitted  under  the  Article  10(3)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC i.e. hybrid application (change in strength).

The active substance is chemically designated as 1β -D-Ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3carboxamide  (Chemical  Name)  or  1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (Chemical IUPAC Name) and has the following structure:

Ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analogue that is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. There are numbers of proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin. These include indirect effects such as  inhibition  of  inosine  monophosphate  and  immunomodulatory  effects  and  direct  effects  such  as polymerase inhibition and interference with viral RNA capping. Ribavirin has demonstrated antiviral activity in vitro against  respiratory  syncytial  virus  and in  vivo in  infected  cotton  rats  when administered intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Pharmacokinetic properties as well as clinical efficacy and safety are documented for the reference medicinal product Rebetol. A single dose bioequivalence study with the Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. and with the reference product Rebetol was submitted to support the application. The indication proposed for Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product Rebetol. Rebetol is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and must only be  used  as  part  of  a  combination  regimen  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (adults)  or  interferon  alfa-2b (adults and children of 3-years of age or older). There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Rebetol with other forms of interferon (i.e., not alfa-2b), or on the use of Rebetol with peginterferon alfa-2b in children or adolescents. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Ribavirin  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  200 mg  or  400 mg  of ribavirin (active substance). The 200 mg film-coated tablets are light pink to pink, debossed with '93' on one side and '7232' on the other. The 400 mg film-coated tablets are light pink to pink, debossed with 'R' on one side and '400' on the other. The excipients used in the preparation of Ribavirin Teva Pharma  B.V.  are  well  known  excipients  used  in  tablets  preparations  such  as  calcium  hydrogen phosphate dehydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone and magnesium stearate (present in the tablet core)  and  Opadry  II  85F23470  (coating  agent)  which  is  composed  of  polyvinyl  alcohol  -  partly hydrolysed, macrogol, titanium dioxide, talc, and red, yellow and black iron oxide. Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. film-coated tablets are packaged in polyvinyl chloride / polyethylene / polyvinyl acetate (PVC/PE/PVAc) blisters. Active Substance Medicinal product no longer authorised

Ribavirin is a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol (96%). It has a specific optical rotation between -33.0 ° and -37.0 ° (dried basis 10mg/ml, t=20 ° C), pH 4.0-6.5. Ribavirin may exist in two polymorphic forms A and B which are distinguishable by their melting range.  One  form  crystallised  from  aqueous  ethanol  melts  at  166 ~ 168 ° C  (form  A)  while  form crystallised from ethanol has a melting range of 174 ~ 176 ºC 9 form B). The commercially utilised manufacturing process is optimised to produce the desired polymorph. · Manufacture Information  about  manufacturing  process  has  been  provided  using  Active  Substance  Master  File (ASMF) procedure. A three step synthesis involving coupling step, ammonolysis and re-crystallisation has been well described. Critical parameters and accompanying in-process controls, to ensure quality of the final compound, have been defined. Confirmation of the chemical structure of ribavirin was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation of  the  determined elementary composition), spectroscopic methods as IR, 1 H-NMR,  13 C-NMR, MS, X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  and    differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC).  X-ray  diffraction studies and DSC confirm the morphology of ribavirin and confirm the proposed polymorphic form to be consistent with the compendia standard. Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin and potential carry-over into the final drug substance. · Specification The drug substance specification includes tests for physical appearance and solubility, identification (IR),  specific  rotation,  loss  of  drying,  pH,  sulphated  ash,  heavy  metals,  related  substances  (HPLC), assay (HPLC), bulk and tapped density, particle size distribution, polymorphism, melting range and residual solvents (GC). The specification generally complies with the Ph Eur monograph for ribavirin with additional in-house tests for which suitable validation data are provided. A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Most of the methods are Ph Eur apart from  particle  size,  polymorph  testing,  melting  range,  related  substances  and  residual  solvents.  Full method validation data was provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. Particle  size  (laser  diffraction)  was  suitably  validated  for  repeatability,  intermediate  precision  and robustness. Two HPLC methods were proposed for assay and related substances. One is the same as the Ph Eur and the other is an in-house method. The latter method was suitably validated with respect to system precision, linearity, range, accuracy, recovery, method precision, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. The limit test for residue of polymorph form and determination of melting point has been suitably validated with respect to specificity, precision, accuracy, detection limit and robustness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety.

The GC method for residual solvents has been suitably validated for reproducibility, linearity, method precision,  accuracy  (recovery),  limit  of  detection  and  limit  of  quantitation.  All  residual  solvent acceptance  criteria  are  in  line  with  ICH  recommended  limits  and  proposed  limits  for  impurities comply with the Ph Eur monograph for ribavirin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance.

Data on five consecutive batches of ribavirin was provided by the ASMF Holder. In addition data on six batches of ribavirin used in the manufacture of the biobatch and other pilot batches was provided by the drug product manufacturer. All batches represented full scale production and complied with the requirements in the drug substance specification.

- Stability

Stability  studies  were  carried  out  according  to  ICH  guidelines  for  real  time  (25 ° C/60% RH)  and accelerated  conditions  (40 ° C/75% RH). Data for three validation batches are given with 60 months real  time  and  6  months  accelerated  data.  In  addition,  further  eight  batches  were  also  subjected  to stability studies. Data obtained under real time and accelerated testing showed all results to comply with the proposed specification. No specific trends were evident. Additionally,  data  from  photostability  study  (UV  light  exposure),  and  from  stressed  degradation studies (including exposure to heat, acid and base degradation and oxidative conditions) was provided. Under stress testing both the sample batches and the reference standard degraded with the same trend and formation of similar degradation products. The stability studies confirmed the proposed re-test period. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical development The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  immediate  release  tablets,  containing quantitatively and qualitatively the same drug substance as the reference medicinal product, Rebetol 200mg capsules and to be bioequivalent. Similarity with the reference medicinal product was addressed by way of composition comparisons, dissolution studies, solubility studies and comparative impurity profiles. Compositions of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. film-coated tablets and the reference medicinal product are  similar.  Ribavirin  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  film-coated  tablets  contain  calcium  hydrogen  phosphate, croscarmellose  sodium,  povidone  and  magnesium  stearate.  The  reference  medicinal  product  was authorised through the centralised procedure and therefore the qualitative and quantitative composition of the active substance [ribavirin] and the excipients [microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, croscarmellose  and  magnesium  stearate]  is  identical  in  all  Member  States.  The  formulation  of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. film-coated tablets differs, namely by the inclusion of calcium hydrogen phosphate  anhydrous  and  povidone  product  compared  to  lactose  monohydrate  and  microcrystalline cellulose in reference medicinal product. Similarity  between  two  products  was  also  shown  with  dissolution  testing.  Dissolution  studies  were carried out in line with the Ph Eur. The dissolution profiles for both products were similar. Solubility of ribavirin was tested in buffered solution over the physiological pH range 1.0 to 7.5. It was found to be highly soluble in all cases. Medicinal product no longer authorised

An impurity comparison of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. drug substance and the reference product was undertaken. Results showed no degradation to occur as a result of the manufacturing process as the impurity profile for the drug substance was similar to that of the product. In addition, Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. film-coated tablets and the reference medicinal product showed levels of impurities to be under the reporting limit.

Since  the  application  concerned  two  strengths  of  200  mg  and  400  mg  film-coated  tablets,  the bioequivalence was demonstrated between Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 200 mg film-coated tablets

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and Rebetol 200 mg capsules, and biowaiver for a bioequivalence study with the 400 mg strength was claimed. The biowaiver could be applied since:

- -both strengths are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process,
- -the  drug  input  has  been  shown  to  be  linear  over  the  therapeutic  dose  range  following  single doses of 200-1200 mg ribavirin,
- -the qualitative composition of the strengths is the same,
- -the ratio between amounts of active substance and excipients is the same,
- -the dissolution profiles were similar for both strengths of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. 200 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets and the tablets are rapidly dissolved products (more than 85% of the labelled amount dissolved after 15 minutes).

The drug product manufacturing process development was also performed. Details were provided for experimental  batches  manufactured  to  establish  optimum  manufacturing  conditions.  To  obtain immediate  release  tablets,  which  were  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  product,  a  formulating strategy was undertaken in order to optimise the manufacturing process with respect to: -use of existing production equipment technology, -choice of wet granulation as the appropriate process -formulation of a product which meets the in-house specification, -use of blister packs which meet the European market patient pack initiative. The  tablet  formulations  are  based  on  Ribavirin  Teva  capsule  formulation,  which  has  already  been authorised via centralised procedure. Essentially, the objective of preliminary formulation studies was to  select  adequate  excipient  grades  and  manufacturing  conditions  in  order  to  develop  capsules  and later  on  tablets  that  exhibit  acceptable  physical  and  chemical  characteristics.  Wet  granulation  was selected as the conventional method of converting powders into granules having a suitable flow and cohesive properties for both encapsulation and tabletting. Developmental work therefore commenced with details for the capsule formulation and then progressed onto the tablets. The  first  set  of  experiments  compared  the  effect  of  different  percentages  of  the  disintegrant, croscarmellose sodium, on the dissolution profile of two sizes of capsules. Experiments also allowed establishing an appropriate concentration of disintegrant in the formulation. The second set of experiments performed on larger scale batches, examined the effect of a batch size on the physical properties and chemical results (dissolution profile). The study re-examined batches with different quantities of disintegrant in the formulation. The granulation process was carried out in exactly the same way as for the capsules, following which the tablets were compressed. Following scale up a sticking phenomenon was observed. To resolve the amount  of  povidone  was  increased  to  obtain  a  final  blend  with  better  characteristics.  No  sticking phenomen  was  observed  during  the  compression  of  the  tablets  at  the  high  speed.  However,  when compressed  at  the  lower  speed,  a  slight  sticking  phenomenon  was  observed.  The  slight  sticking problem was overcome by increasing the quantity of the lubricant, magnesium stearate · Adventitious Agents None of the excipients used in the drug product are of animal origin. Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetal origin. Manufacture of the Product Medicinal product no longer authorised

•

The manufacturing process is sufficiently described with granulation and tabletting being defined as the  critical  steps.  A  flow  diagram  and  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been provided.

Briefly, the manufacturing process involves (1) Premixing, (2) Granulation (3) Drying and milling the  dry  granulate  is  milled;  (4)  Final  blending,  (5)  Compression  -  the  mix  is  pressed  according  to product specification; (6) Coating - the film coating suspension is sprayed over the tablets cores and (6) Packaging - film-coated tablets are packed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The critical steps in the manufacturing process are granulation and tabletting. The homogeneity of the final blend was examined by testing for uniformity of blend during the validation procedure for two batches, one of pilot scale and one of commercial scale. Results clearly showed that the granulate is homogenous and the manufacturing process suitably controlled.

As part of the discussion on the in-process controls, process validation data were provided for pilot scale  batches  of  each  tablet  strength.  In  addition  the  validation  protocol  has  been  provided  and  the applicant committed that full process validation will be performed on three consecutive commercial scale batches.

· Product Specification The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), dissolution, uniformity of dosage units (by mass variation), thickness, friability  of  uncoated  tablets,  resistance  to  crushing  of  tablets,  assay,  impurities  and  degradation products (HPLC), microbial limits, water content and identification of colour. Full details of all analytical methods have been provided. All non pharmacopoeial methods have been satisfactory validated. The HPLC method for assay, dissolution and impurity/degradant products has been  suitably  validated  with  respect  to  specificity,  precision,  linearity,  accuracy,  detection  limit, quantitation limit, robustness, stability of sample and standard solution. As part of method validation, stress studies (light, heat, acid/base hydrolysis and oxidation) were performed to provide an indication of the stability-indicating properties and specificity of the HPLC method. Results confirmed that all impurities are adequately controlled. Batch  analysis  data  was  provided  on  one  pilot  scale  and  one  commercial  scale  batches  of  200 mg strength and on two pilot scale batches of 400 mg strength. Batches met the proposed specification limits. Results showed that tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the finished product specifications. · Stability of the Product Stability  studies  were  carried  out  under  ICH  conditions  of  25ºC/60%RH  (long  term,  12 months), 30ºC/65%RH (intermediate, 3 months) and 40ºC/75%RH (accelerated, 6 months). Batches  stored  under  long  term  conditions  met  all  the  proposed  specification  limits;  appearance  of tablets  did  not  change,  ribavirin  assay  values  did  not  change  significantly,  dissolution  values  were within specification, values for degradants met the proposed specification limits. Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable. In summary the stability data provided support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues, which have no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve them as Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

No  new  nonclinical  data  were  submitted  in  support  of  this  application.  The  applicant  provided  an acceptable  summary  of  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  of  ribavirin  based  on published  literature  as  well  as  reference  books  and  information  from  databases.  The  nonclinical aspects of the SPC are in line with the SPC of the reference product. No further studies were required and the applicant has justified why no such data were provided.

The  impurity  profile  of  the  product  compared  with  that  of  the  reference  product  was  adequately discussed and no further studies were warranted. The absence of an environmental risk assessment was justified by the fact that the medicinal product will be prescribed interchangeably with other similar products already marketed in Europe. It is assumed that the introduction is unlikely to result in any significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  for  ribavirin-containing  products  hence  will  not  have  an adverse impact on the environment. This justification was considered acceptable. 2.4 Clinical Aspects Introduction This is  an  abridged application for film-coated tablets containing 200 mg and 400 mg ribavirin. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted a single dose bioequivalence study with crossover design conducted under fed conditions using the 200 mg strength. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. For the 400 mg strength the applicant applied for a biowaiver. The relevant clinical data on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of the active substance  ribavirin  and  respective  formulations  have  been  summarised  by  the  applicant  based  on published literature. The proposed SPC of the product is in line with the one of the reference product. No  formal  scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP  was  given  for  this  medicinal  product.  For  the  clinical assessment  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98)  in  its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  Guidelines  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  are  of  particular relevance. GCP The pivotal study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trial  S08-0152  was  conducted  outside  the  community  and  was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Exemption The  applicant  requested  a  biowaiver  for  the  conduct  of  a  bioequivalence  study  with  the  400  mg strength based on the following justification related to the comparison of the 200 mg strength and the 400 mg strength as well as characteristics of the active substance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As detailed under 'Quality aspects', both strengths are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process, have the same qualitative composition as well as the same ratio between amounts of active substance  and  excipients.  Furthermore,  the  dissolution  profiles  are  similar  for  both  strengths  of  the film-coated  tablets  and  the  tablets  are  rapidly  dissolving  products  (more  than  85%  of  the  labelled amount dissolved after 15 minutes).

From a pharmacokinetic point of view, it has been shown for ribavirin that the drug input is linear over the therapeutic dose range following single doses of 200-1200 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A bioequivalence study was conducted with the 200 mg strength. Based on the above information and taking into account the criteria laid out in the applicable Note for Guidance, the CHMP considered that a bioequivalence study with the 400 mg strength is not necessary.

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study; the details of this study are summarised in table 1.

Subjects were housed at the clinical facility on the day prior to drug administration and remained at the  clinical  facility  until  the  24  hour  blood  sample  collection.  The  randomisation  scheme  was computer generated and treatment sequences were randomly assigned to each subject number. Dosing occurred 30 minutes after the initiation of a standardised high-fat breakfast, consisting of two eggs cooked in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 240 mL of whole milk. Subjects were required to consume the entire breakfast prior to drug administration, and were no allowed additional food for 4 hours after dosing. No fluid, except that given with drug administration, was allowed from one hour prior to dose administration to one hour following dose administration. Study drug was administered with 240 mL water. Blood samples were collected within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0-hour) and after dose administration at  0.25,  0.5,  0.75,  1,  1.25,  1.5,  1.75,  2,  2.25,  2.5,  2.75,  3,  4,  6,  8,  12,  24,  36,  48,  72  and  96  hours. Twenty-two blood samples (approximately 130 ml) were collected over the course of the study period. The washout period between the study periods was five weeks.

Expiry date: February 2009 POPULATION(S) STUDIED 34  healthy,  male  (27)  and  post-menopausal  female  (7),  non-smoking  subjects  were  enrolled  and randomised to receive either test or reference product according to the dosing randomisation schedule. According to the study protocol 36 subjects had to be enrolled, due to the lack of eligible subjects 34 were finally enrolled. The mean demographic data of all enrolled subjects are summarised in Table 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were presented and were acceptable for the product and for this type of  study.  Subjects  were  not  allowed  to  consume  grapefruit,  Seville  oranges  and  pomelo  containing products  for  14  days  prior  to  period  I  dosing  and  throughout  the  study,  alcoholic  beverages  and caffeine  containing  beverages  were  not  allowed  48  hours  prior  to  each  dose.  Subjects  were  not allowed  to  use  prescription  medications  for  a  period  of  14  days  prior  to  dosing.  Over-the-counter medications  were  restricted  for  a  period  of  7  days  prior  to  dosing.  Female  subjects  did  not  use hormone replacement therapy for a period of 6 months prior to dosing. 30 subjects completed the clinical part of the study in its entirety, had plasma samples analysed for ribavirin and were included in the statistical analysis. Table 2: Summary of Mean Demographic Data (±SD) for enrolled subjects (n=34) ANALYTICAL METHODS The analysis was performed using a LC/MS/MS method. Within-study accuracy and precision was within the acceptance range. The bioanalytical method was considered adequately validated. PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax,  AUC0-96  and  Tmax  were  determined.  PK  parameters  for  each individual  were  tabulated  and  graphically  presented.  Non-compartmental  analysis  and  the  linear trapezoidal method were used to calculate AUC0-96. Actual blood collection times were used for PK calculations.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed for ribavirin plasma data. Data was analysed if the subject completed the study. Analyte concentration values from subjects who withdraw consent or are dropped from the study were reported, but they were not to be included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.

Subjects  who  exhibited  pre-dose  levels  higher  than  5%  of  Cmax  were  excluded  from  the  statistical analysis. Subjects that exhibit non-zero pre-dose levels &lt; 5% of Cmax were included in the statistical analysis with no baseline correction.

<!-- image -->

Data  from  subjects  with  missing  concentration  values  (missed  blood  draws,  lost  samples,  samples unable to be quantitated) may have been used if pharmacokinetic parameters could be estimated using the remaining data points. Otherwise, concentration data from these subjects were excluded from the final  analysis.  The  exclusion  was  to  be  conducted  prior  to  sample  analysis.  The  statistical  analysis should be performed on all data from all subjects in the final data set. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-96 and Cmax. The ANOVA model included sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence was tested using subject nested within sequence as the error term. Each ANOVA included a calculation of least-squares means, the difference between adjusted formulation means, and the standard error associated with this difference. Ratios  of  least-squares  means  and  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  difference  between  drug formulation  least-squares  means  were  calculated  for  the  parameters  AUC0-96  and  Cmax  using  lntransformed data. The geometric mean values were reported. Statistical  analyses  were  considered  appropriate  for  a  two-period  crossover  design  to  assess  the bioequivalence of the two products. · Results 34  subjects  were  enrolled  and  were  dosed  in  period  I.  30  subjects  were  dosed  in  period  II;  these subjects  completed  the  study,  had  plasma  samples  analysed  for  ribavirin  and  were  included  in  the statistical analysis. Of the four subjects who discontinued the study after period I, two withdrew their consent  after  period  I  due  to  personal  reasons.  Two  subjects  were  dropped  after  period  I  by  the investigator/sponsor due to too many missing return blood draws: · One subject did not come back for 36, 72, and 96 hour draws on period I. It was judged that there were not enough data points to calculate the AUC to 96 hours. · One subject did not come back for the 48, 72, and 96 hour draws in period I. It was judged that there were not enough data points to calculate the AUC to 96 hours. All  pre-dose  samples  collected  in  period  II  after  the  administration  of  test  and  reference  product contained  detectable  levels  of  ribavirin.  Reported  plasma  levels  of  ribavirin  were  below  10  ng/mL, mostly below 5 ng/mL, which is less than 5% of corresponding Cmax. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the 30 subjects who completed the clinical part of the study in its entirety are summarised in Table 3. The results of the statistical analysis for ln-transformed data are displayed in Table 4. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

The applicant should ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities are in line with the current safety measures applied to the reference medicinal product.  Risk Management Plan The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring additional risk minimization activities have been identified. Discussion on Clinical aspects A single dose bioequivalence study in crossover design under fed conditions was conducted with the 200 mg strength. Overall the bioequivalence study design was adequate considering the pharmacokinetic properties of ribavirin. Bioequivalence  was  demonstrated  after  a  single  dose  administration.  The  pharmacokinetics  of ribavirin  is  linear  after  single  dose  administration.  Ribavirin  accumulates  with  a  ratio  of  6:1  after multiple versus single dose administration due to very slow elimination. No saturation in elimination mechanisms  or  absorption  has  been  described,  indicating  that  the  kinetics  is  time-  and  doseindependent. Hence, the single dose design is acceptable. The  test  and  reference  product  were  administered  according  to  the  randomisation  scheme  in  twosequence, two-period crossover design. Washout period between study periods was 5 weeks. All study subjects after administration of test and reference product had detectable levels of ribavirin in pre-dose samples  collected  in  period  II  indicating  a  carryover  from  period  I.  The  plasma  ribavirin  levels  in period II pre-dose samples were however below 10 ng/mL, mostly &lt;5 ng/mL, which is approximately 1% of the corresponding Cmax and is therefore acceptable. The bioequivalence study was conducted under fed conditions (high-fat high-calorie meal). The SmPC of the reference product recommends drug intake with food to maximise absorption, the dose could be subsequently reduced based on the individual tolerance. It is known that food increases AUC and Cmax of ribavirin by 70%. A bioequivalence study under fed conditions is therefore acceptable. Ribavirin has an elimination half-life of 80 hours due to the extensive distribution into non-plasma compartments. Elimination from red blood cells has been reported to occur with a half-life of 40 days. The bioanalytical  method  had  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  adequate  for  the  purpose.  Ribavirin plasma  levels  were  determined  at  various  time  points  for  up  to  96  hours  post  dose.  Ribavirin concentrations were measurable at the last time point 96 hours post dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  bioequivalence  conclusion  was  based  on  the  Cmax  and  AUC0-96,  which  is  appropriate.  The  test product in the bioequivalence study is identical to the product for which the marketing authorisation is applied for. The size of the biobatch was adequate.

The Applicant  applied  for  a  biowaiver  for  the  conduct  of  a  bioequivalence  study  with  the  400  mg strength. The justification is sufficient as all criteria for biowaiver according to the applicable CHMP guideline are fulfilled.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality data. From a nonclinical perspective the applicant provided an adequate summary of the current scientific knowledge related to ribavirin, compared the impurity profiles of the test and reference products, and adequately justified the absence of an environmental risk assessment. Therefore no further non-clinical data are warranted.

With regard to the clinical data, an appropriate summary of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C was provided. The pivotal basis of this  application  was  a  bioequivalence  between  the  test  product (200 mg strength) and the reference product. This study was a two sequence, cross-over study in fed state; the overall design as well as the bioanalytical  methods  are  considered  adequate.  The  statistical  analysis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data from  this  study  showed  that  the  target  parameters  AUC0-96  h  and  Cmax  (ln-transformed  data)  were within the acceptance limits of 0.8-1.25. Therefore, bioequivalence has been shown. For the 400-mg strength  the  biowaiver  concept  is  deemed  acceptable  and  a  specific  bioequivalence  study  is  not needed. Overall, a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus decision that the benefit/risk ratio of Ribavirin Teva Pharma B.V. in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C as part of a combination  regimen  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  (adults)  or  interferon  alfa-2b  (adults,  children  (3years of age or older), and adolescents) was favourable and therefore recommended granting of the marketing authorisation.
