## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal Product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

IntronA 3 million IU/0.5 mL solution for injection or infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One vial of solution for injection or infusion contains 3 million IU of recombinant interf eron alfa-2b produced in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology, in 0.5 mL of solution.

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection or inf usion. Clear and colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Chronic hepatitis B Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1). Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.

When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

## Hairy cell leukaemia

Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

Monotherapy

Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by &lt; 34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is /uniF0B3 34 %, but &lt; 90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.

## Combination therapy

The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alf a-2b monotherapy.

## Multiple myeloma

The recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.

As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interf eron alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated. Follicular lymphoma Treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (&gt; 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each &gt; 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss &gt; 10 %, pyrexia &gt; 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia. Carcinoid tumour Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\". Malignant melanoma As adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. Not all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and strength must be selected. If adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the dose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously. Chronic hepatitis B Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white blood cells &lt; 1,500/mm 3 , granulocytes &lt; 1,000/mm 3 , thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/mm 3 ). Treatment should be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (&lt; 1,200/mm 3 ), severe neutropaenia (&lt; 750/mm 3 ) or severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt; 70,000/mm 3 ).

For all patients, if  no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Chronic hepatitis C

## Adults

IntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.

## Children 3 years of age or older and adolescents

IntronA 3 MIU/m 2  is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).

(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh &lt; 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC.)

## Naïve patients (children and adolescents)

Relapse patients (adults) IntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. Naïve patients (adults) The efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. - IntronA in combination with ribavirin Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available f or 12 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. Treatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and high pre-treatment viral load. Other negative prognostic factors (age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into account in order to extend therapy to 12 months. During clinical trials, patients who f ailed to show a virologic response af ter 6 months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCVRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). - IntronA alone The optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between 12 and 18 months is advised. It is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point HCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.

## Duration of treatment for children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped &lt; 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

## Hairy cell leukaemia

The recommended dose is 2 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell leukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of IntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet count and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained unless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

The recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some patients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously in association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per month (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, administer the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m 2 daily) to maintain haematological remission. IntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial haematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved. Multiple myeloma Maintenance therapy In patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy, interf eron alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, subcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m 2 three times a week (every other day). Follicular lymphoma Adjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens are advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone). Carcinoid tumour The usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The treatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long as the patient responds to interferon alf a-2b treatment. Malignant melanoma As induction therapy, interf eron alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of  20 million IU/m 2 daily for f ive days a week f or a f our-week period; the calculated interferon alf a-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see section 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three days a week (every other day) f or 48 weeks. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 500/mm 3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. Interferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 250/mm 3 or ALT/AST rises to &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.

Although the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at the recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.

IntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.
- -Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.
- -Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).
- -Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.
- -Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.
- -Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients.
- -The use of interferon alf a-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

-Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. -Combination of IntronA with telbivudine. Children and adolescents -Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more f requently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, conf usion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable eff ects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with interferon alf a-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of  severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated af ter having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Patients with substance use/abuse:

HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of  developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interf eron is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential f or other substance use should be caref ully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even af ter treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.

## Children and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)

During the course of interf eron (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of  substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off treatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.

## Need for adequate hydration

Case by case benefit/risk assessment in children The expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections  4.8 and 5.1). -It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. -This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively inf luence the disease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic f actors of response, (HCV genotype and viral load). Whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. Hypersensitivity reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interf eron alf a-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. Adverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities Moderate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in some cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. Discontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients. Hypotension Hypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive treatment. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension related to f luid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.

## Pyrexia

While pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.

## Patients with debilitating medical conditions

IntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.

## Pulmonary conditions

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interf eron alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.

Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of IntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk.

Ocular adverse events Ocular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous retinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances af ter treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders. Obtundation, coma and encephalopathy More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of IntronA. Patients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial inf arction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of  cardiac disease. Hypertriglyceridemia Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. Monitoring of lipid levels is, theref ore, recommended. Patients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Kidney and liver graft rejection

Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graf t rejection has also been reported.

## Auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders

The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inf lammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).

## Concomitant chemotherapy

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events include mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the concomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the frequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.

Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).

Chronic hepatitis C Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological conf irmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment. Monotherapy Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of IntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents). Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## HCV/HIV Coinfection

Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of  developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.

Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.

## HCV/HBV Coinfection

Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interf eron. The f requency of such re-activation appears to be low.

All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interf eron f or hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Dental and periodontal disorders Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. Laboratory Tests Standard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA. During treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to greater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be monitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin. In patients treated f or malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and differential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the maintenance phase of therapy. Effect on fertility Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). Important information about some of the ingredients of IntronA This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\". Traceability Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with IntronA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interactions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents.

Interferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).

<!-- image -->

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration) (see section 4.4). Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alf a-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the saf ety and eff icacy of  telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human leukocyte interf eron. IntronA must be used with caution in fertile men. Combination therapy with ribavirin Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see ribavirin SPC). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus.

## Combination therapy with ribavirin

Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of  treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

See ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (f rom 6 MIU/m 2 /week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m 2 /week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment. Adults In clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three times a week. In Table 1 the f requency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable eff ects is presented from clinical trials in naïve patients treated f or one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the f ollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rarely (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rarely (&lt;1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is administered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For example, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flulike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C trials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of patients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower doses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment.

*These events were only common with IntronA alone. § See section 4.4 # Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension. These undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).

Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, notably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). Events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interf eron alf a.

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interf erons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).

The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and adolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis subjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. Children and adolescent population Chronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin In clinical trials of  118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specif ic concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44 th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48 th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of  whom 10 of  the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term f ollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of  those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy f or up to 48 weeks with IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile f rom baseline to the end of  the longterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alf a-2b protein corresponding to 2.6 x l0 8 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.

§ See section 4.4 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for any pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is indicated. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 IntronA is a sterile, stable, f ormulation of  highly purif ied interf eron alf a-2b produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interf erons have been identified. IntronA has been classif ied as recombinant interferon alf a-2b.

Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specif ic membrane receptors on the cell surface. Human interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly asymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species specificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specif icity. However, certain monkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.

The results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible f or the various cellular responses to interf eron, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell prolif eration and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.

IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical trials in 2,552 interf eron-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of IntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (&gt; 100 copies/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.

Recombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative eff ects in studies employing both animal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo . Although the exact antiviral mode of action of  recombinant interf eron alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if  replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. Chronic hepatitis B Current clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alf a-2b f or 4 to 6 months indicates that therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been observed. Interferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m 2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated with interferon alf a-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. Chronic hepatitis C in adult patients In adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is 47 %. Superior eff icacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose &gt; 10.6 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01).

IntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated f or one year. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (f rom two studies) are shown in Table 3 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benef it of  combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) ( Table 3 ).

Response rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received /uniF0B3 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took &lt; 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).

Overall, in both studies, patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load &lt; 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' f rom chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).

Relapse patients A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (&lt; 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment. Long-Term efficacy data In a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa2b or non-pegylated interferon alf a-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term f ollow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population

Three clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and ribavirin and one with pegylated interf eron and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m 2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day

for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % /uniF0A3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable eff ects, the benef it/risk of  the combination of  ribavirin and interf eron alf a-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Study results are summarized in Table 5 .

Results from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin In a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 /uniF06D g/m 2 plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % &lt; 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alf a-2b with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs section 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.

Overall Response a Genotype 1 (n=92) Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) *Number (%) of patients a Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during followup period Long-term efficacy data A five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C patients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all enrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but one of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term f ollow-up after completion of treatment with interf eron alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients treated with interf eron alf a-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at follow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic inf ection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV.

a: Response to treatment was def ined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of detection=125 IU/mL.

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7 . The pharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or adolescents.

b: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. c: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (&lt; 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of  treatment while those with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of  treatment. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m 2 and 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m 2 administered intramuscularly and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %. After intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than af ter subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-lif e was approximately two hours. Urine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received IntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interf eron. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. Children and adolescent population Medicinal Product no longer authorised

No studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alf a-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3 of  Rebetol SPC if  IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).

*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) f or IntronA Transfer into seminal fluid Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal f luid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Although interferon is generally recognised as being species specif ic, toxicity studies in animals were conducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no evidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given 100 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months. In studies of interf eron use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed (see section 4.4). Results of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely aff ect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of treated rats. Interf eron alf a-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 . Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 ). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce doserelated anovulatory and abortifacient eff ects in rhesus monkeys. Mutagenicity studies with interferon alf a-2b revealed no adverse events. IntronA plus ribavirin Medicinal Product no longer authorised

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection or inf usion. Clear and colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Chronic hepatitis B Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1). Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.

When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

## Hairy cell leukaemia

Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

## Monotherapy

Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by &lt; 34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is /uniF0B3 34 %, but &lt; 90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.

## Combination therapy

The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alf a-2b monotherapy.

## Multiple myeloma

The recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.

As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interf eron alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated. Follicular lymphoma Treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (&gt; 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each &gt; 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss &gt; 10 %, pyrexia &gt; 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia. Carcinoid tumour Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\". Malignant melanoma As adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. Not all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and strength must be selected. If adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the dose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously. Chronic hepatitis B Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white blood cells &lt; 1,500/mm 3 , granulocytes &lt; 1,000/mm 3 , thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/mm 3 ). Treatment should be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (&lt; 1,200/mm 3 ), severe neutropaenia (&lt; 750/mm 3 ) or severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt; 70,000/mm 3 ).

For all patients, if  no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Chronic hepatitis C

## Adults

IntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.

IntronA 3 MIU/m 2  is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).

(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh &lt; 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC.)

## Naïve patients (children and adolescents)

Relapse patients (adults) IntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. Naïve patients (adults) The efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. - IntronA in combination with ribavirin Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available f or 12 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. Treatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and high pre-treatment viral load. Other negative prognostic factors (age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into account in order to extend therapy to 12 months. During clinical trials, patients who f ailed to show a virologic response af ter 6 months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCVRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). - IntronA alone The optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between 12 and 18 months is advised. It is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point HCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.

## Duration of treatment for children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped &lt; 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

## Hairy cell leukaemia

The recommended dose is 2 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell leukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of IntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet count and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained unless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manif ested.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

The recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some patients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously in association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per month (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, administer the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m 2 daily) to maintain haematological remission. IntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial haematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved. Multiple myeloma Maintenance therapy In patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy, interf eron alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, subcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m 2 three times a week (every other day). Follicular lymphoma Adjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens are advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone). Carcinoid tumour The usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The treatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long as the patient responds to interferon alf a-2b treatment. Malignant melanoma As induction therapy, interf eron alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of  20 million IU/m 2 daily for f ive days a week f or a f our-week period; the calculated interferon alf a-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see section 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If severe adverse events develop during interferon alf a-2b treatment, particularly if  granulocytes decrease to &lt; 500/mm 3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. Interf eron alf a-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 250/mm 3 or ALT/AST rises to &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.

Although the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at the recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.

IntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.
- -Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.
- -Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).
- -Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.
- -Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal.
- -Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients.
- -The use of interferon alf a-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

-Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. -Combination of IntronA with telbivudine. Children and adolescents -Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more f requently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, conf usion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable eff ects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with interferon alf a-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of  severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated af ter having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Patients with substance use/abuse:

HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of  developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interf eron is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential f or other substance use should be caref ully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even af ter treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.

## Children and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)

During the course of interf eron (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of  substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off treatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.

## Need for adequate hydration

Case by case benefit/risk assessment in children The expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). -It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. -This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively inf luence the disease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV genotype and viral load). Whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. Hypersensitivity reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interf eron alf a-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. Adverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities Moderate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in some cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. Discontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients. Hypotension Hypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive treatment. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension related to f luid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.

## Pyrexia

While pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.

## Patients with debilitating medical conditions

IntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.

## Pulmonary conditions

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.

Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of IntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk.

Ocular adverse events Ocular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous retinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances af ter treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders. Obtundation, coma and encephalopathy More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of IntronA. Patients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial inf arction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of  cardiac disease. Hypertriglyceridemia Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended. Patients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Kidney and liver graft rejection

Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graf t rejection has also been reported.

## Auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders

The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inf lammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).

## Concomitant chemotherapy

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events include mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the concomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the frequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.

Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).

Chronic hepatitis C Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological conf irmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment. Monotherapy Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of IntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents). Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## HCV/HIV Coinfection

Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of  developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.

Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.

## HCV/HBV Coinfection

Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interf eron. The f requency of such re-activation appears to be low.

All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interf eron f or hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Dental and periodontal disorders Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. Laboratory Tests Standard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA. During treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to greater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be monitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin. In patients treated f or malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and differential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the maintenance phase of therapy. Effect on fertility Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). Important information about some of the ingredients of IntronA This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\". Traceability Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with IntronA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interactions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents.

Interferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).

<!-- image -->

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration) (see section 4.4). Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alf a-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the saf ety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human leukocyte interf eron. IntronA must be used with caution in fertile men. Combination therapy with ribavirin Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see ribavirin SPC). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus.

## Combination therapy with ribavirin

Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of  treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

See ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (f rom 6 MIU/m 2 /week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m 2 /week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment. Adults In clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three times a week. In Table 1 the f requency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable eff ects is presented from clinical trials in naïve patients treated f or one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the f ollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rarely (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rarely (&lt;1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is administered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For example, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flulike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C trials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of patients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower doses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment.

*These events were only common with IntronA alone. § See section 4.4 # Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension. These undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).

Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, notably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). Events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interf eron alf a.

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interf erons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).

The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and adolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis subjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. Children and adolescent population Chronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin In clinical trials of  118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specif ic concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44 th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48 th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of  whom 10 of  the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term f ollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of  those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy f or up to 48 weeks with IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile f rom baseline to the end of  the longterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alf a-2b protein corresponding to 2.6 x l0 8 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.

§ See section 4.4 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for any pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is indicated. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 IntronA is a sterile, stable, f ormulation of  highly purif ied interf eron alf a-2b produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interf erons have been identified. IntronA has been classif ied as recombinant interferon alf a-2b.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specif ic membrane receptors on the cell surface. Human interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly asymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species specificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specif icity. However, certain monkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.

The results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible f or the various cellular responses to interf eron, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell prolif eration and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.

IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical trials in 2,552 interf eron-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of IntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (&gt; 100 copies/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.

Recombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative eff ects in studies employing both animal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo . Although the exact antiviral mode of action of  recombinant interf eron alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if  replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. Chronic hepatitis B Current clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alf a-2b f or 4 to 6 months indicates that therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been observed. Interferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m 2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated with interferon alf a-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. Chronic hepatitis C in adult patients In adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is 47 %. Superior eff icacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose &gt; 10.6 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01).

IntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated f or one year. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (f rom two studies) are shown in Table 3 .

Co-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benef it of  combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) ( Table 3 ).

Response rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received /uniF0B3 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took &lt; 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).

Overall, in both studies, patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load &lt; 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' f rom chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).

Relapse patients A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (&lt; 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment. Long-Term efficacy data In a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa2b or non-pegylated interferon alf a-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term f ollow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population

Three clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and ribavirin and one with pegylated interf eron and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m 2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day

for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % /uniF0A3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials for children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable eff ects, the benef it/risk of  the combination of  ribavirin and interf eron alf a-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Study results are summarized in Table 5 .

Results from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin In a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 /uniF06D g/m 2 plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % &lt; 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alf a-2b with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs section 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.

Overall Response a Genotype 1 (n=92) Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) *Number (%) of patients a  Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period Long-term efficacy data A five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C patients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all enrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but one of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term f ollow-up after completion of treatment with interf eron alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients treated with interf eron alf a-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at follow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic inf ection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

a: Response to treatment was def ined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of detection=125 IU/mL.

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7 . The pharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or adolescents.

b: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. c: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (&lt; 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of  treatment while those with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of  treatment. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m 2 and 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m 2 administered intramuscularly and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %. After intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than af ter subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-lif e was approximately two hours. Urine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received IntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interf eron. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. Children and adolescent population Medicinal Product no longer authorised

*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) f or IntronA

Transfer into seminal fluid Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal f luid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Although interferon is generally recognised as being species specif ic, toxicity studies in animals were conducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alf a-2b for up to three months have shown no evidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given 100 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months. In studies of interf eron use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed (see section 4.4). Results of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interf eron alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely aff ect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of treated rats. Interf eron alf a-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 . Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 ). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce doserelated anovulatory and abortifacient eff ects in rhesus monkeys. Mutagenicity studies with interferon alf a-2b revealed no adverse events. IntronA plus ribavirin No studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alf a-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3 of  Rebetol SPC if  IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection or inf usion. Clear and colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Chronic hepatitis B Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1). Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA.

When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

## Hairy cell leukaemia

Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

## Monotherapy

Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by &lt; 34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is /uniF0B3 34 %, but &lt; 90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.

## Combination therapy

The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alf a-2b monotherapy.

## Multiple myeloma

The recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.

As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interf eron alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated. Follicular lymphoma Treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (&gt; 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each &gt; 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss &gt; 10 %, pyrexia &gt; 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia. Carcinoid tumour Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\". Malignant melanoma As adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. Not all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and strength must be selected. If adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the dose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously. Chronic hepatitis B Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white blood cells &lt; 1,500/mm 3 , granulocytes &lt; 1,000/mm 3 , thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/mm 3 ). Treatment should be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (&lt; 1,200/mm 3 ), severe neutropaenia (&lt; 750/mm 3 ) or severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt; 70,000/mm 3 ).

For all patients, if  no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Chronic hepatitis C

## Adults

IntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.

## Children 3 years of age or older and adolescents

IntronA 3 MIU/m 2  is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).

(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh &lt; 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC.)

## Naïve patients (children and adolescents)

Relapse patients (adults) IntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. Naïve patients (adults) The efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. - IntronA in combination with ribavirin Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available f or 12 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. Treatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and high pre-treatment viral load. Other negative prognostic factors (age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into account in order to extend therapy to 12 months. During clinical trials, patients who f ailed to show a virologic response af ter 6 months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCVRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). - IntronA alone The optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between 12 and 18 months is advised. It is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point HCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.

## Duration of treatment for children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped &lt; 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

## Hairy cell leukaemia

The recommended dose is 2 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell leukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of IntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet count and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained unless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

The recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some patients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously in association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per month (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, administer the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m 2 daily) to maintain haematological remission. IntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial haematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved. Multiple myeloma Maintenance therapy In patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy, interf eron alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, subcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m 2 three times a week (every other day). Follicular lymphoma Adjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens are advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone). Carcinoid tumour The usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The treatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long as the patient responds to interferon alf a-2b treatment. Malignant melanoma As induction therapy, interf eron alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of  20 million IU/m 2 daily for f ive days a week f or a f our-week period; the calculated interferon alf a-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see section 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 500/mm 3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. Interferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 250/mm 3 or ALT/AST rises to &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.

Although the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at the recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.

IntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.

- -The use of interferon alf a-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

-Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. -Combination of IntronA with telbivudine. Children and adolescents -Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more f requently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, conf usion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable eff ects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions: If treatment with interferon alf a-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of  severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated af ter having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Patients with substance use/abuse:

HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of  developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interf eron is judged necessary in these patients, the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential f or other substance use should be caref ully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even af ter treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.

## Children and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)

During the course of interf eron (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of  substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off treatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.

## Need for adequate hydration

Case by case benefit/risk assessment in children The expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). -It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. -This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively inf luence the disease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic f actors of response, (HCV genotype and viral load). Whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. Hypersensitivity reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interf eron alf a-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. Adverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities Moderate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in some cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. Discontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients. Hypotension Hypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive treatment. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension related to f luid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.

## Pyrexia

While pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.

## Patients with debilitating medical conditions

IntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.

## Pulmonary conditions

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.

Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of IntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk.

Ocular adverse events Ocular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous retinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances af ter treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders. Obtundation, coma and encephalopathy More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of IntronA. Patients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial inf arction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of  cardiac disease. Hypertriglyceridemia Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. Monitoring of lipid levels is, theref ore, recommended. Patients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Kidney and liver graft rejection

Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graf t rejection has also been reported.

## Auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders

The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inf lammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).

## Concomitant chemotherapy

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events include mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the concomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the frequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased.

Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).

Chronic hepatitis C Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological conf irmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment. Monotherapy Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of IntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents). Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## HCV/HIV Coinfection

Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of  developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.

Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.

## HCV/HBV Coinfection

Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interf eron. The f requency of such re-activation appears to be low.

All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interf eron f or hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Dental and periodontal disorders Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. Laboratory Tests Standard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA. During treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to greater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be monitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin. In patients treated f or malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and differential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the maintenance phase of therapy. Effect on fertility Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). Important information about some of the ingredients of IntronA This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 1 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodiumfree\". Traceability Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with IntronA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interactions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents.

Interferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4).

Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration) (see section 4.4). Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alf a-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the saf ety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human leukocyte interf eron. IntronA must be used with caution in fertile men. Combination therapy with ribavirin Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see ribavirin SPC). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus.

## Combination therapy with ribavirin

Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of  treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

See ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (f rom 6 MIU/m 2 /week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m 2 /week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment. Adults In clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three times a week. In Table 1 the f requency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable eff ects is presented from clinical trials in naïve patients treated f or one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the f ollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rarely (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rarely (&lt;1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is administered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For example, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, f lulike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C trials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of patients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower doses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment.

*These events were only common with IntronA alone. § See section 4.4 # Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension. These undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).

Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, notably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). Events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interf eron alf a.

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interf erons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).

The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and adolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis subjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. Children and adolescent population Chronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin In clinical trials of  118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specif ic concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44 th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48 th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of  whom 10 of  the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term f ollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of  those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy f or up to 48 weeks with IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile f rom baseline to the end of  the longterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alf a-2b protein corresponding to 2.6 x l0 8 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.

§ See section 4.4 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for any pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is indicated. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 IntronA is a sterile, stable, f ormulation of  highly purif ied interf eron alf a-2b produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interf erons have been identified. IntronA has been classif ied as recombinant interferon alf a-2b.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specif ic membrane receptors on the cell surface. Human interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly asymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species specificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specif icity. However, certain monkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.

The results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible f or the various cellular responses to interf eron, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell prolif eration and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.

IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical trials in 2,552 interf eron-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of IntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (&gt; 100 copies/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.

Recombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative eff ects in studies employing both animal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo . Although the exact antiviral mode of action of  recombinant interf eron alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if  replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. Chronic hepatitis B Current clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alf a-2b f or 4 to 6 months indicates that therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been observed. Interferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m 2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated with interferon alf a-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. Chronic hepatitis C in adult patients In adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is 47 %. Superior eff icacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose &gt; 10.6 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

IntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated f or one year. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (f rom two studies) are shown in Table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benef it of  combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) ( Table 3 ).

Response rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received /uniF0B3 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took &lt; 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).

Overall, in both studies, patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-inf ected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load &lt; 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' f rom chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).

JAMA 2004; 292(23): 2839-2848. 2  Laguno M, Murillas J, Blanco J.L et al.  AIDS 2004; 18(13): F27-F36. Relapse patients A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (&lt; 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment. Long-Term efficacy data In a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alfa2b or non-pegylated interferon alf a-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term f ollow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population

Three clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and ribavirin and one with pegylated interf eron and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m 2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day

for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % /uniF0A3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials f or children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable eff ects, the benef it/risk of  the combination of  ribavirin and interf eron alf a-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Study results are summarized in Table 5 .

Results from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin In a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 /uniF06D g/m 2 plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % &lt; 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alf a-2b with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs section 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.

Overall Response a Genotype 1 (n=92) Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) *Number (%) of patients a  Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period Long-term efficacy data A five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C patients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all enrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but one of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term f ollow-up after completion of treatment with interf eron alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients treated with interf eron alf a-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at follow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic inf ection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

a: Response to treatment was def ined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment, lower limit of detection=125 IU/mL.

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7 . The pharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or adolescents.

b: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. c: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (&lt; 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of  treatment while those with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of  treatment. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m 2 and 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m 2 administered intramuscularly and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %. After intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than af ter subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-lif e was approximately two hours. Urine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received IntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interf eron. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. Children and adolescent population Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Transfer into seminal fluid Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal f luid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Although interferon is generally recognised as being species specif ic, toxicity studies in animals were conducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alfa-2b for up to three months have shown no evidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given 100 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months. In studies of interf eron use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed (see section 4.4). Results of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interferon alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely aff ect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of treated rats. Interf eron alf a-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 . Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 ). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce doserelated anovulatory and abortifacient eff ects in rhesus monkeys. Mutagenicity studies with interferon alf a-2b revealed no adverse events. IntronA plus ribavirin No studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alf a-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3 of  Rebetol SPC if  IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Chronic hepatitis B Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1). Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

## Hairy cell leukaemia

Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

## Monotherapy

Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by &lt; 34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is /uniF0B3 34 %, but &lt; 90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.

## Combination therapy

The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alf a-2b monotherapy.

If adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the dose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.

Multiple myeloma As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interf eron alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated. Follicular lymphoma Treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (&gt; 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each &gt; 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss &gt; 10 %, pyrexia &gt; 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia. Carcinoid tumour Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\". Malignant melanoma As adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. Not all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and strength must be selected. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis B

The recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.

The administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white blood cells &lt; 1,500/mm 3 , granulocytes &lt; 1,000/mm 3 , thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/mm 3 ). Treatment should be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (&lt; 1,200/mm 3 ), severe neutropaenia (&lt; 750/mm 3 ) or severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt; 70,000/mm 3 ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For all patients, if  no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.

## Chronic hepatitis C

## Adults

IntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.

## Children 3 years of age or older and adolescents

IntronA 3 MIU/m 2  is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).

It is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point HCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA.

(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh &lt; 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC.) Relapse patients (adults) IntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. Naïve patients (adults) The efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. - IntronA in combination with ribavirin Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available f or 12 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. Treatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and high pre-treatment viral load. Other negative prognostic factors (age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into account in order to extend therapy to 12 months. During clinical trials, patients who f ailed to show a virologic response af ter 6 months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCVRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). - IntronA alone The optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between 12 and 18 months is advised. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Naïve patients (children and adolescents)

The efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.

## Duration of treatment for children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped &lt; 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

## Hairy cell leukaemia

The recommended dose is 2 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell leukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of IntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet count and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained unless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.

As induction therapy, interf eron alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of  20 million IU/m 2 daily for f ive days a week f or a f our-week period; the calculated interferon alf a-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see section 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.

Chronic myelogenous leukaemia The recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some patients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously in association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per month (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, administer the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m 2 daily) to maintain haematological remission. IntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial haematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved. Multiple myeloma Maintenance therapy In patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy, interf eron alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, subcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m 2 three times a week (every other day). Follicular lymphoma Adjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens are advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone). Carcinoid tumour The usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The treatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long as the patient responds to interferon alf a-2b treatment. Malignant melanoma Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 500/mm 3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. Interferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 250/mm 3 or ALT/AST rises to &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at the recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.

IntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.
- -Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.
- -Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).

## Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:

-Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. -Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. -Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. -Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. -Combination of IntronA with telbivudine. Children and adolescents -Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more f requently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, conf usion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable eff ects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If treatment with interferon alf a-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of  severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated af ter having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.

- -The use of interferon alf a-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Patients with substance use/abuse:

HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of  developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interf eron is judged necessary in these patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential f or other substance use should be caref ully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even af ter treatment discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.

## Children and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)

During the course of interf eron (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of  substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off treatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.

## Hypotension

Case by case benefit/risk assessment in children The expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). -It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. -This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively inf luence the disease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic f actors of response, (HCV genotype and viral load). Whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. Hypersensitivity reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interf eron alf a-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. Adverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities Moderate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in some cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. Discontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Hypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive treatment.

## Need for adequate hydration

Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension related to f luid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.

## Pyrexia

While pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interf eron therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with debilitating medical conditions

IntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.

## Pulmonary conditions

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.

Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. Monitoring of lipid levels is, theref ore, recommended.

Ocular adverse events Ocular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous retinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances af ter treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders. Obtundation, coma and encephalopathy More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of IntronA. Patients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial inf arction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of  cardiac disease. Hypertriglyceridemia Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Patients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis

Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of IntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk.

## Kidney and liver graft rejection

Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graf t rejection has also been reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders

The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inf lammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).

Concomitant chemotherapy Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events include mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the concomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the frequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased. Chronic hepatitis C Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological conf irmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment. Monotherapy Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of IntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents

Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## HCV/HIV Coinfection

Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of  developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.

Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.

## HCV/HBV Coinfection

Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interf eron. The f requency of such re-activation appears to be low. All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interf eron f or hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. Dental and periodontal disorders Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. Laboratory Tests Standard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA. During treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to greater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be monitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin. In patients treated f or malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and differential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the maintenance phase of therapy. Effect on fertility Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). Important information about some of the ingredients of IntronA Medicinal Product no longer authorised

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 3 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodiumfree\".

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with IntronA.

Interactions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents.

Interferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration) (see section 4.4). Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alf a-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the saf ety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human leukocyte interf eron. IntronA must be used with caution in fertile men. Combination therapy with ribavirin Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see ribavirin SPC).

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus.

## Combination therapy with ribavirin

Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of  treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

See ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (f rom 6 MIU/m 2 /week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m 2 /week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment. Adults In clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three times a week. In Table 1 the f requency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable eff ects is presented from clinical trials in naïve patients treated f or one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the f ollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rarely (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rarely (&lt;1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is administered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For example, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flulike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C trials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of patients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower doses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment.

*These events were only common with IntronA alone. § See section 4.4 # Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension. These undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).

Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, notably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). Events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interf eron alf a.

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interf erons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).

The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and adolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis subjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. Children and adolescent population Chronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin In clinical trials of  118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specif ic concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44 th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48 th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of  whom 10 of  the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term f ollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of  those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy f or up to 48 weeks with IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile f rom baseline to the end of  the longterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alf a-2b protein corresponding to 2.6 x l0 8 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.

§ See section 4.4 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for any pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is indicated. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 IntronA is a sterile, stable, f ormulation of  highly purif ied interf eron alf a-2b produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alf a-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interf erons have been identified. IntronA has been classif ied as recombinant interferon alf a-2b.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specif ic membrane receptors on the cell surface. Human interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly asymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species specificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specif icity. However, certain monkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.

The results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible f or the various cellular responses to interf eron, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell prolif eration and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.

IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical trials in 2,552 interf eron-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of IntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (&gt; 100 copies/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.

Recombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative eff ects in studies employing both animal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo . Although the exact antiviral mode of action of  recombinant interf eron alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if  replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. Chronic hepatitis B Current clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alf a-2b f or 4 to 6 months indicates that therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been observed. Interferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m 2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated with interferon alf a-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. Chronic hepatitis C in adult patients In adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is 47 %. Superior eff icacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose &gt; 10.6 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

IntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated f or one year. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (f rom two studies) are shown in Table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benef it of  combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most difficult to treat subgroup of patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) ( Table 3 ).

Response rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received /uniF0B3 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took &lt; 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).

Overall, in both studies, patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load &lt; 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' f rom chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).

Relapse patients A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (&lt; 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment. Long-Term efficacy data In a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alf a2b or non-pegylated interferon alf a-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term f ollow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population

Three clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and ribavirin and one with pegylated interf eron and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m 2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day

for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % /uniF0A3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials f or children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable eff ects, the benef it/risk of  the combination of  ribavirin and interf eron alf a-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Study results are summarized in Table 5 .

Results from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin In a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 /uniF06D g/m 2 plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % &lt; 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alf a-2b with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs section 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.

Overall Response a Genotype 1 (n=92) Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) *Number (%) of patients a  Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period Long-term efficacy data A five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C patients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all enrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but one of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term f ollow-up after completion of treatment with interf eron alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients treated with interf eron alf a-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at follow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic inf ection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7 . The pharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or adolescents.

b: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. c: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (&lt; 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of  treatment while those with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of  treatment. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m 2 and 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m 2 administered intramuscularly and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %. After intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than af ter subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-lif e was approximately two hours. Urine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received IntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interf eron. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. Children and adolescent population Medicinal Product no longer authorised

*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) f or IntronA

Transfer into seminal fluid Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal f luid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Although interferon is generally recognised as being species specif ic, toxicity studies in animals were conducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alf a-2b for up to three months have shown no evidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given 100 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months. In studies of interf eron use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed (see section 4.4). Results of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interf eron alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely aff ect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of treated rats. Interf eron alf a-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 . Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 ). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce doserelated anovulatory and abortifacient eff ects in rhesus monkeys. Mutagenicity studies with interferon alf a-2b revealed no adverse events. IntronA plus ribavirin No studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alf a-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3 of  Rebetol SPC if  IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection or inf usion. Clear and colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Chronic hepatitis B Treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication (presence of DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV-DNA) and hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histologically proven active liver inflammation and/or fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis C Before initiating treatment with IntronA, consideration should be given to the results from clinical trials comparing IntronA with pegylated interferon (see section 5.1). Adult patients IntronA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) (see section 4.4). The best way to use IntronA in this indication is in combination with ribavirin. Children 3 years of age and older and adolescents IntronA is indicated, in a combination regimen with ribavirin, for the treatment of children 3 years of age and older and adolescents, who have chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, and who are positive for HCV-RNA. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

When deciding not to defer treatment until adulthood, it is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. The decision to treat should be made on a case by case basis (see section 4.4).

## Hairy cell leukaemia

Treatment of patients with hairy cell leukaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Chronic myelogenous leukaemia

## Monotherapy

Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl translocation positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

Clinical experience indicates that a haematological and cytogenetic major/minor response is obtainable in the majority of patients treated. A major cytogenetic response is defined by &lt; 34 % Ph+ leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, whereas a minor response is /uniF0B3 34 %, but &lt; 90 % Ph+ cells in the marrow.

## Combination therapy

The combination of interferon alfa-2b and cytarabine (Ara-C) administered during the first 12 months of treatment has been demonstrated to significantly increase the rate of major cytogenetic responses and to significantly prolong the overall survival at three years when compared to interferon alfa-2b monotherapy.

If adverse events develop during the course of treatment with IntronA for any indication, modify the dose or discontinue therapy temporarily until the adverse events abate. If persistent or recurrent intolerance develops following adequate dose adjustment, or disease progresses, discontinue treatment with IntronA. At the discretion of the physician, the patient may self-administer the dose for maintenance dose regimens administered subcutaneously.

Multiple myeloma As maintenance therapy in patients who have achieved objective remission (more than 50 % reduction in myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy. Current clinical experience indicates that maintenance therapy with interf eron alfa-2b prolongs the plateau phase; however, effects on overall survival have not been conclusively demonstrated. Follicular lymphoma Treatment of high tumour burden follicular lymphoma as adjunct to appropriate combination induction chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen. High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (&gt; 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each &gt; 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss &gt; 10 %, pyrexia &gt; 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia. Carcinoid tumour Treatment of carcinoid tumours with lymph node or liver metastases and with \"carcinoid syndrome\". Malignant melanoma As adjuvant therapy in patients who are free of disease after surgery but are at high risk of systemic recurrence, e.g., patients with primary or recurrent (clinical or pathological) lymph node involvement. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of the disease. Not all dose forms and strengths are appropriate for some indications. Appropriate dose form and strength must be selected. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis B

The recommended dose is in the range 5 to 10 million IU administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for a period of 4 to 6 months.

The administered dose should be reduced by 50 % in case of occurrence of haematological disorders (white blood cells &lt; 1,500/mm 3 , granulocytes &lt; 1,000/mm 3 , thrombocytes &lt; 100,000/mm 3 ). Treatment should be discontinued in case of severe leukopaenia (&lt; 1,200/mm 3 ), severe neutropaenia (&lt; 750/mm 3 ) or severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt; 70,000/mm 3 ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For all patients, if  no improvement on serum HBV-DNA is observed after 3 to 4 months of treatment (at the maximum tolerated dose), discontinue IntronA therapy.

## Chronic hepatitis C

## Adults

IntronA is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU three times a week (every other day) to adult patients, whether administered as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin.

## Children 3 years of age or older and adolescents

IntronA 3 MIU/m 2  is administered subcutaneously 3 times a week (every other day) in combination with ribavirin capsules or oral solution administered orally in two divided doses daily with food (morning and evening).

It is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA alone for at least 3 to 4 months, at which point HCV-RNA status should be determined. Treatment should be continued in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA.

(See ribavirin capsules SPC for dose of ribavirin capsules and dose modification guidelines for combination therapy. For paediatric patients who weigh &lt; 47 kg or cannot swallow capsules, see ribavirin oral solution SPC.) Relapse patients (adults) IntronA is given in combination with ribavirin. Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available for 6 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for 6 months. Naïve patients (adults) The efficacy of IntronA is enhanced when given in combination with ribavirin. IntronA should be given alone mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin. - IntronA in combination with ribavirin Based on the results of clinical trials, in which data are available f or 12 months of treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin for at least 6 months. Treatment should be continued for another 6-month period (i.e., a total of 12 months) in patients who exhibit negative HCV-RNA at month 6, and with viral genotype 1 (as determined in a pre-treatment sample) and high pre-treatment viral load. Other negative prognostic factors (age &gt; 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis) should be taken into account in order to extend therapy to 12 months. During clinical trials, patients who f ailed to show a virologic response af ter 6 months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) did not become sustained virologic responders (HCVRNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). - IntronA alone The optimal duration of therapy with IntronA alone is not yet fully established, but a therapy of between 12 and 18 months is advised. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Naïve patients (children and adolescents)

The efficacy and safety of IntronA in combination with ribavirin has been studied in children and adolescents who have not been previously treated for chronic hepatitis C.

## Duration of treatment for children and adolescents

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 1: The recommended duration of treatment is one year. Patients who fail to achieve virological response at 12 weeks are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(negative predictive value 96 %). Therefore, it is recommended that children and adolescent patients receiving IntronA/ribavirin combination be discontinued from therapy if their week 12 HCV-RNA dropped &lt; 2 log10 compared to pretreatment, or if they have detectable HCV-RNA at treatment week 24.

- /uniF0B7 Genotype 2/3: The recommended duration of treatment is 24 weeks.

## Hairy cell leukaemia

The recommended dose is 2 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day) for both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. For most patients with hairy cell leukaemia, normalisation of one or more haematological variables occurs within one to two months of IntronA treatment. Improvement in all three haematological variables (granulocyte count, platelet count and haemoglobin level) may require six months or more. This regimen must be maintained unless the disease progresses rapidly or severe intolerance is manifested.

As induction therapy, interf eron alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of  20 million IU/m 2 daily for f ive days a week f or a f our-week period; the calculated interferon alf a-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection and administered as a 20-minute infusion (see section 6.6). As maintenance treatment, the recommended dose is 10 million IU/m 2 administered subcutaneously three days a week (every other day) for 48 weeks.

Chronic myelogenous leukaemia The recommended dose of IntronA is 4 to 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously. Some patients have been shown to benefit from IntronA 5 million IU/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously in association with cytarabine (Ara-C) 20 mg/m 2 administered daily subcutaneously for 10 days per month (up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg). When the white blood cell count is controlled, administer the maximum tolerated dose of IntronA (4 to 5 million IU/m 2 daily) to maintain haematological remission. IntronA treatment must be discontinued after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment if at least a partial haematological remission or a clinically meaningful cytoreduction has not been achieved. Multiple myeloma Maintenance therapy In patients who are in the plateau phase (more than 50 % reduction of myeloma protein) following initial induction chemotherapy, interf eron alfa-2b may be administered as monotherapy, subcutaneously, at a dose of 3 million IU/m 2 three times a week (every other day). Follicular lymphoma Adjunctively with chemotherapy, interferon alfa-2b may be administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 5 million IU three times a week (every other day) for a duration of 18 months. CHOP-like regimens are advised, but clinical experience is available only with CHVP (combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisolone). Carcinoid tumour The usual dose is 5 million IU (3 to 9 million IU) administered subcutaneously three times a week (every other day). Patients with advanced disease may require a daily dose of 5 million IU. The treatment is to be temporarily discontinued during and after surgery. Therapy may continue for as long as the patient responds to interferon alf a-2b treatment. Malignant melanoma Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If severe adverse events develop during interferon alfa-2b treatment, particularly if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 500/mm 3 or alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) rises to &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal, discontinue treatment temporarily until the adverse event abates. Interferon alfa-2b treatment is to be restarted at 50 % of the previous dose. If intolerance persists after dose adjustment or if granulocytes decrease to &lt; 250/mm 3 or ALT/AST rises to &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal, discontinue interferon alfa-2b therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although the optimal (minimum) dose for full clinical benefit is unknown, patients must be treated at the recommended dose, with dose reduction for toxicity as described.

IntronA may be administered using either glass or plastic disposable injection syringes.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmic disorders.
- -Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction; including that caused by metastases.
- -Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function (see section 4.4).

## Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:

-Chronic hepatitis with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. -Chronic hepatitis in patients who are being or have been treated recently with immunosuppressive agents excluding short term corticosteroid withdrawal. -Autoimmune hepatitis; or history of autoimmune disease; immunosuppressed transplant recipients. -Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment. -Combination of IntronA with telbivudine. Children and adolescents -Existence of, or history of severe psychiatric condition, particularly severe depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during IntronA therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period. Among children and adolescents treated with IntronA in combination with ribavirin, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more f requently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6-month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence). Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others such as homicidal ideation), bipolar disorders, mania, conf usion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders. If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable eff ects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered. If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal or homicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with IntronA be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

If treatment with interferon alf a-2b is judged necessary in adult patients with existence or history of  severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated af ter having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.

- The use of interferon alf a-2b in children and adolescents with existence of or history of severe psychiatric conditions is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Patients with substance use/abuse:

HCV infected patients having a co-occurring substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, etc) are at an increased risk of  developing psychiatric disorders or exacerbation of already existing psychiatric disorders when treated with alpha interferon. If treatment with alpha interf eron is judged necessary in these patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities and the potential f or other substance use should be caref ully assessed and adequately managed before initiating therapy. If necessary, an inter-disciplinary approach including a mental health care provider or addiction specialist should be considered to evaluate, treat and follow the patient. Patients should be closely monitored during therapy and even af ter treatment discontinuation. Early intervention for re-emergence or development of psychiatric disorders and substance use is recommended.

## Children and adolescent population: Growth and development (chronic hepatitis C)

During the course of interf eron (standard and pegylated)/ribavirin combination therapy lasting up to 48 weeks in patients ages 3 through 17 years, weight loss and growth inhibition were common (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The longer term data available in children treated with the combination therapy with standard interferon/ribavirin are also indicative of  substantial growth retardation (&gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile as compared to baseline) in 21 % of children (n=20) despite being off treatment for more than 5 years. Final adult height was available for 14 of those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment.

## Hypotension

Case by case benefit/risk assessment in children The expected benefit of treatment should be carefully weighed against the safety findings observed for children and adolescents in the clinical trials (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). -It is important to consider that the combination therapy induced a growth inhibition that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. -This risk should be weighed against the disease characteristics of the child, such as evidence of disease progression (notably fibrosis), co-morbidities that may negatively inf luence the disease progression (such as HIV co-infection), as well as prognostic factors of response, (HCV genotype and viral load). Whenever possible the child should be treated after the pubertal growth spurt, in order to reduce the risk of growth inhibition. There are no data on long term effects on sexual maturation. Hypersensitivity reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) to interf eron alf a-2b have been observed rarely during IntronA therapy. If such a reaction develops, discontinue the medicine and institute appropriate medical therapy. Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment. Adverse experiences including prolongation of coagulation markers and liver abnormalities Moderate to severe adverse experiences may require modification of the patient's dose regimen, or in some cases, termination of IntronA therapy. IntronA increases the risk of liver decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. Discontinue treatment with IntronA in patients with chronic hepatitis who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decomposition. Any patient developing liver function abnormalities during treatment with IntronA must be monitored closely and treatment discontinued if signs and symptoms progress. Liver enzymes and hepatic function should be closely monitored in cirrhotic patients. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Hypotension may occur during IntronA therapy or up to two days post-therapy and may require supportive treatment.

## Need for adequate hydration

Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing IntronA therapy since hypotension related to f luid depletion has been seen in some patients. Fluid replacement may be necessary.

## Pyrexia

While pyrexia may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent pyrexia must be ruled out.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with debilitating medical conditions

IntronA must be used cautiously in patients with debilitating medical conditions, such as those with a history of pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes mellitus prone to ketoacidosis. Caution must be observed also in patients with coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) or severe myelosuppression.

## Pulmonary conditions

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.5). Any patient developing pyrexia, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken. If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha. While this has been reported more often in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alpha, it has also been reported in patients with oncologic diseases treated with interferon alpha. Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.

Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed. Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.

Ocular adverse events Ocular adverse events (see section 4.8) including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, serous retinal detachment, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances af ter treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should have a baseline eye examination. Any patient complaining of changes in visual acuity or visual fields, or reporting other ophthalmologic symptoms during treatment with IntronA, must have a prompt and complete eye examination. Periodic visual examinations during IntronA therapy are recommended particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Discontinuation of IntronA should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders. Obtundation, coma and encephalopathy More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses. While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks. Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of IntronA. Patients with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities Adult patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial inf arction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, who require IntronA therapy, must be closely monitored. It is recommended that those patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities and/or are in advanced stages of cancer have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of IntronA therapy. There are no data in children or adolescents with a history of  cardiac disease. Hypertriglyceridemia Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Patients with psoriasis and sarcoidosis

Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of IntronA in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk.

## Kidney and liver graft rejection

Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graf t rejection has also been reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders

The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons. Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk. Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Chronic hepatitis C, Monotherapy (thyroid abnormalities) and section 4.8). Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. This syndrome is a granulomatous inf lammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin. If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).

Concomitant chemotherapy Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product. The most commonly reported potentially life-threatening or fatal adverse events include mucositis, diarrhoea, neutropaenia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, careful adjustments of doses are required for IntronA and for the concomitant chemotherapeutic agents (see section 4.5). When IntronA is used with hydroxyurea, the frequency and severity of cutaneous vasculitis may be increased. Chronic hepatitis C Combination therapy with ribavirin Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological conf irmation. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment. Monotherapy Infrequently, adult patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with IntronA developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In clinical trials using IntronA therapy, 2.8 % patients overall developed thyroid abnormalities. The abnormalities were controlled by conventional therapy for thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism by which IntronA may alter thyroid status is unknown. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, evaluate serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA treatment may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Determine TSH levels if, during the course of IntronA therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, IntronA treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Discontinuation of IntronA therapy has not reversed thyroid dysfunction occurring during treatment (also see Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Thyroid supplemental monitoring specific for children and adolescents

Approximately 12 % of children treated with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy developed increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Another 4 % had a transient decrease below the lower limit of normal. Prior to initiation of IntronA therapy, TSH levels must be evaluated and any thyroid abnormality detected at that time must be treated with conventional therapy. IntronA therapy may be initiated if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication. Thyroid dysfunction during treatment with interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin has been observed. If thyroid abnormalities are detected, the patient's thyroid status should be evaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Children and adolescents should be monitored every 3 months for evidence of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. TSH).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## HCV/HIV Coinfection

Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of  developing lactic acidosis. Caution should be used when adding IntronA and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC). Patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia.

Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death. Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.

## HCV/HBV Coinfection

Cases of hepatitis B re-activation (some with severe consequences) have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and C viruses treated with interf eron. The f requency of such re-activation appears to be low. All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interf eron f or hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. Dental and periodontal disorders Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA and ribavirin. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards. Laboratory Tests Standard haematological tests and blood chemistries (complete blood count and differential, platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, serum protein, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine) are to be conducted in all patients prior to and periodically during systemic treatment with IntronA. During treatment for hepatitis B or C the recommended testing schedule is at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and every other month, thereafter, throughout treatment. If ALT flares during IntronA therapy to greater than or equal to 2 times baseline, IntronA therapy may be continued unless signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. During ALT flare, the following liver function tests must be monitored at two-week intervals: ALT, prothrombin time, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and bilirubin. In patients treated f or malignant melanoma, liver function and white blood cell (WBC) count and differential must be monitored weekly during the induction phase of therapy and monthly during the maintenance phase of therapy. Effect on fertility Interferon may impair fertility (see section 4.6 and section 5.3). Important information about some of the ingredients of IntronA Medicinal Product no longer authorised

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-free\".

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used concomitantly with IntronA.

Interactions between IntronA and other medicinal products have not been fully evaluated. Caution must be exercised when administering IntronA in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents.

Interferons may affect the oxidative metabolic process. This must be considered during concomitant therapy with medicinal products metabolised by this route, such as the xanthine derivatives theophylline or aminophylline. During concomitant therapy with xanthine agents, serum theophylline levels must be monitored and dose adjusted if necessary.

Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients, including those treated with IntronA. The aetiology has not been defined. These symptoms have been reported more frequently when shosaikoto, a Chinese herbal medicine, is administered concomitantly with interferon alpha (see section 4.4). Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration) (see section 4.4). Also see ribavirin SPC if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alf a-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the telbivudine SPC). Moreover, the saf ety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Decreased serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations have been reported in women treated with human leukocyte interf eron. IntronA must be used with caution in fertile men. Combination therapy with ribavirin Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking IntronA in combination with ribavirin. Females of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded. Male patients or their female partners must use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see ribavirin SPC).

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IntronA is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus.

## Combination therapy with ribavirin

Ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.

Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued prior to initiation of  treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Patients are to be advised that they may develop fatigue, somnolence, or confusion during treatment with IntronA, and therefore it is recommended that they avoid driving or operating machinery.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

See ribavirin SPC for ribavirin-related undesirable effects if IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In clinical trials conducted in a broad range of indications and at a wide range of doses (f rom 6 MIU/m 2 /week in hairy cell leukaemia up to 100 MIU/m 2 /week in melanoma), the most commonly reported undesirable effects were pyrexia, fatigue, headache and myalgia. Pyrexia and fatigue were often reversible within 72 hours of interruption or cessation of treatment. Adults In clinical trials conducted in the hepatitis C population, patients were treated with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin for one year. All patients in these trials received 3 MIU of IntronA three times a week. In Table 1 the f requency of patients reporting (treatment related) undesirable eff ects is presented from clinical trials in naïve patients treated f or one year. Severity was generally mild to moderate. The adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are based on experience from clinical trials and post-marketing. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the f ollowing categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rarely (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rarely (&lt;1/10,000); not known. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

§

See section 4.4

The undesirable effects seen with hepatitis C are representative of those reported when IntronA is administered in other indications, with some anticipated dose-related increases in incidence. For example, in a trial of high-dose adjuvant IntronA treatment in patients with melanoma, incidences of fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, neutropaenia/anaemia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, flulike symptoms, depression, alopecia, altered taste, and dizziness were greater than in the hepatitis C trials. Severity also increased with high dose therapy (WHO Grade 3 and 4, in 66 % and 14 % of patients, respectively), in comparison with the mild to moderate severity usually associated with lower doses. Undesirable effects were usually managed by dose adjustment.

*These events were only common with IntronA alone. # Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension. These undesirable effects have also been reported with IntronA alone. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4). Cardiomyopathy,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease (see section 4.4).

Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon alfa products, notably in patients with risk factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV-infection, cirrhosis). Events were reported at various time points typically several months after starting treatment with interf eron alf a.

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interf erons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies (see also section 4.4).

The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 are based on experience from the two multicentre children and adolescent clinical trials. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, &lt;1/10). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, most frequently occurring at doses greater than 10 million IU daily, include reduction in granulocyte and white blood cell counts; decreases in haemoglobin level and platelet count; increases in alkaline phosphatase, LDH, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels. Moderate and usually reversible pancytopenia has been reported. Increase in serum ALT/AST (SGPT/SGOT) levels have been noted as an abnormality in some non-hepatitis subjects and also in some patients with chronic hepatitis B coincident with clearance of viral DNAp. Children and adolescent population Chronic Hepatitis C - Combination therapy with ribavirin In clinical trials of  118 children and adolescents (3 to 16 years of age), 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In general, the adverse reaction profile in the limited children and adolescent population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric- specif ic concern regarding growth inhibition as decrease in height percentile (mean percentile decrease of 9 percentile) and weight percentile (mean percentile decrease of 13 percentile) were observed during treatment. Within the 5 years follow-up post-treatment period, the children had a mean height of 44 th percentile, which was below the median of the normative population and less than their mean baseline height (48 th percentile). Twenty (21 %) of 97 children had a &gt; 15 percentile decrease in height percentile, of  whom 10 of  the 20 children had a &gt; 30 percentile decrease in their height percentile from the start of treatment to the end of long-term f ollow-up (up to 5 years). Final adult height was available for 14 of  those children and demonstrated that 12 continued to show height deficits &gt; 15 percentiles, 10 to 12 years after the end of treatment. During combination therapy f or up to 48 weeks with IntronA and ribavirin, growth inhibition was observed that resulted in reduced final adult height in some patients. In particular, decrease in mean height percentile f rom baseline to the end of  the longterm follow-up was most prominent in prepubertal age children (see section 4.4). Furthermore, suicidal ideation or attempts were reported more frequently compared to adult patients (2.4 % vs 1 %) during treatment and during the 6 month follow-up after treatment. As in adult patients, children and adolescents also experienced other psychiatric adverse events (e.g., depression, emotional lability, and somnolence) (see section 4.4). In addition, injection site disorders, pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in children and adolescents compared to adult patients. Dose modifications were required in 30 % of patients, most commonly for anaemia and neutropaenia. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The activity of IntronA is expressed in terms of IU, with 1 mg of recombinant interferon alf a-2b protein corresponding to 2.6 x l0 8 IU. International Units are determined by comparison of the activity of the recombinant interferon alfa-2b with the activity of the international reference preparation of human leukocyte interferon established by the World Health Organisation.

§ See section 4.4 Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported that has led to acute clinical manifestations. However, as for any pharmacologically active compound, symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is indicated. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: interferon alfa-2b, ATC code: L03A B05 IntronA is a sterile, stable, f ormulation of  highly purif ied interf eron alf a-2b produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19,300 daltons. It is obtained from a clone of E. coli, which harbours a genetically engineered plasmid hybrid encompassing an interferon alfa-2b gene from human leukocytes. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The interferons are a family of small protein molecules with molecular weights of approximately 15,000 to 21,000 daltons. They are produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infections or various synthetic and biological inducers. Three major classes of interferons have been identified: alpha, beta and gamma. These three main classes are themselves not homogeneous and may contain several different molecular species of interferon. More than 14 genetically distinct human alpha interf erons have been identified. IntronA has been classif ied as recombinant interferon alf a-2b.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specif ic membrane receptors on the cell surface. Human interferon receptors, as isolated from human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) cells, appear to be highly asymmetric proteins. They exhibit selectivity for human but not murine interferons, suggesting species specificity. Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specif icity. However, certain monkey species, eg, rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.

The results of several studies suggest that, once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible f or the various cellular responses to interf eron, including inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells, suppression of cell prolif eration and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells. Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon's therapeutic effects.

IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin has been studied in 4 randomised Phase III clinical trials in 2,552 interf eron-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared the efficacy of IntronA used alone or in combination with ribavirin. Efficacy was defined as sustained virologic response, 6 months after the end of treatment. Eligible patients f or these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) (&gt; 100 copies/mL), a liver biopsy consistent with a histologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.

Recombinant interferon alfa-2b has exhibited antiproliferative eff ects in studies employing both animal and human cell culture systems as well as human tumour xenografts in animals. It has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory activity in vitro . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo . Although the exact antiviral mode of action of  recombinant interf eron alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism. This action inhibits viral replication or if  replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell. Chronic hepatitis B Current clinical experience in patients who remain on interferon alf a-2b f or 4 to 6 months indicates that therapy can produce clearance of serum HBV-DNA. An improvement in liver histology has been observed. In adult patients with loss of HBeAg and HBV-DNA, a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been observed. Interferon alfa-2b (6 MIU/m 2 3 times a week for 6 months) has been given to children with chronic active hepatitis B. Because of a methodological flaw, efficacy could not be demonstrated. Moreover children treated with interferon alf a-2b experienced a reduced rate of growth and some cases of depression were observed. Chronic hepatitis C in adult patients In adult patients receiving interferon in combination with ribavirin, the achieved sustained response rate is 47 %. Superior eff icacy has been demonstrated with the combination of pegylated interferon with ribavirin (sustained response rate of 61 % achieved in a study performed in naïve patients with a ribavirin dose &gt; 10.6 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

IntronA was administered at a dose of 3 MIU 3 times a week as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The majority of patients in these clinical trials were treated f or one year. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months after the end of treatment for the determination of sustained virologic response. Sustained virologic response rates for treatment groups treated for one year with IntronA alone or in combination with ribavirin (f rom two studies) are shown in Table 3 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of IntronA with ribavirin increased the efficacy of IntronA by at least two fold for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in naïve patients. HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates. The increased response rate to the combination of IntronA + ribavirin, compared with IntronA alone, is maintained across all subgroups. The relative benef it of  combination therapy with IntronA + ribavirin is particularly significant in the most dif f icult to treat subgroup of  patients (genotype 1 and high virus load) ( Table 3 ).

Response rates in these trials were increased with compliance. Regardless of genotype, patients who received IntronA in combination with ribavirin and received /uniF0B3 80 % of their treatment had a higher sustained response 6 months after 1 year of treatment than those who took &lt; 80 % of their treatment (56 % vs. 32 % in trial C/I98-580).

Overall, in both studies, patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin, were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b with ribavirin. The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 4. Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months. Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV. Patients were randomized to receive either pegylated interferon alf a-2b (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or IntronA (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight). The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load &lt; 800,000 IU/mL (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical 'cure' f rom chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).

Relapse patients A total of 345 interferon alpha relapse patients were treated in two clinical trials with IntronA monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. In these patients, the addition of ribavirin to IntronA increased by as much as 10-fold the efficacy of IntronA used alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (48.6 % vs. 4.7 %). This enhancement in efficacy included loss of serum HCV (&lt; 100 copies/mL by PCR), improvement in hepatic inflammation, and normalisation of ALT, and was sustained when measured 6 months after the end of treatment. Long-Term efficacy data In a large study, 1,071 patients were enrolled after treatment in a prior non-pegylated interferon alf a2b or non-pegylated interferon alf a-2b/ribavirin study to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes. 462 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term f ollow-up and only 12 sustained responders' out of 492 relapsed during this study. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 97 % with a 95 % Confidence Interval of [95 %, 99 %]. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Chronic hepatitis C in children and adolescent population

Three clinical trials have been conducted in children and adolescents; two with standard interferon and ribavirin and one with pegylated interf eron and ribavirin. Patients who received IntronA plus ribavirin were less likely to respond than patients who received pegylated interf eron alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received IntronA 3 MIU/m 2 3 times a week plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day

for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after-treatment. A total of 118 patients were enrolled: 57 % male, 80 % Caucasian, and 78 % genotype 1,64 % /uniF0A3 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted in children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. In the two multicentre trials sustained virological response rates in children and adolescents were similar to those in adults. Due to the lack of data in these two multicentre trials f or children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable eff ects, the benef it/risk of  the combination of  ribavirin and interf eron alf a-2b needs to be carefully considered in this population (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8).

Study results are summarized in Table 5 .

Results from the clinical trial conducted with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin In a multicentre trial children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b 60 /uniF06D g/m 2 plus ribavirin 15 mg/kg per day once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks, based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load. All patients were to be followed for 24 weeks post-treatment. A total of 107 patients received treatment of whom 52 % were female, 89 % Caucasian, 67 % with HCV Genotype 1 and 63 % &lt; 12 years of age. The population enrolled mainly consisted of children with mild to moderate hepatitis C. Due to the lack of data in children with severe progression of the disease, and the potential for undesirable effects, the benefit/risk of the combination of peginterferon alf a-2b with ribavirin needs to be carefully considered in this population (see peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin SPCs section 4.4). The study results are summarized in Table 6.

Overall Response a Genotype 1 (n=92) Genotype 2/3/4 (n=26) *Number (%) of patients a  Defined as HCV-RNA below limit of detection using a research based RT-PCR assay at end of treatment and during follow-up period Long-term efficacy data A five-year long-term, observational, follow-up study enrolled 97 paediatric chronic hepatitis C patients after treatment in the standard interferon multicentre trials. Seventy percent (68/97) of all enrolled subjects completed this study of which 75 % (42/56) were sustained responders. The purpose of the study was to annually evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes for patients who were sustained responders 24 weeks post-treatment of the 48-week interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin treatment. All but one of the paediatric subjects remained sustained virologic responders during long-term f ollow-up after completion of treatment with interf eron alfa-2b plus ribavirin. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years is 98 % [95 % CI: 95 %, 100 %] for paediatric patients treated with interf eron alf a-2b and ribavirin. Additionally, 98 % (51/52) with normal ALT levels at follow-up week 24 maintained normal ALT levels at their last visit. SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic inf ection and clinical 'cure' from chronic HCV. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma). Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties for IntronA injection and ribavirin capsules in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C, between 5 and 16 years of age, are summarized in Table 7 . The pharmacokinetics of IntronA and ribavirin (dose-normalized) are similar in adults and children or adolescents.

b: n = number of responders/number of subjects with given genotype, and assigned treatment duration. c: Patients with genotype 3 low viral load (&lt; 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 24 weeks of  treatment while those with genotype 3 and high viral load (≥ 600,000 IU/mL) were to receive 48 weeks of  treatment. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of IntronA were studied in healthy volunteers following single 5 million IU/m 2 and 10 million IU doses administered subcutaneously, at 5 million IU/m 2 administered intramuscularly and as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. The mean serum interferon concentrations following subcutaneous and intramuscular injections were comparable. Cmax occurred three to 12 hours after the lower dose and six to eight hours after the higher dose. The elimination half-lives of interferon injections were approximately two to three hours, and six to seven hours, respectively. Serum levels were below the detection limit 16 and 24 hours, respectively, post-injection. Both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration resulted in bioavailabilities greater than 100 %. After intravenous administration, serum interferon levels peaked (135 to 273 IU/mL) by the end of the infusion, then declined at a slightly more rapid rate than af ter subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of medicinal product, becoming undetectable four hours after the infusion. The elimination half-lif e was approximately two hours. Urine levels of interferon were below the detection limit following each of the three routes of administration. Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received IntronA in Schering-Plough monitored clinical trials. Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interf eron. The clinical incidence of neutralising factors developing in cancer patients treated systemically is 2.9 % and in chronic hepatitis patients is 6.2 %. The detectable titres are low in almost all cases and have not been regularly associated with loss of response or any other autoimmune phenomenon. In patients with hepatitis, no loss of response was observed apparently due to the low titres. Children and adolescent population Medicinal Product no longer authorised

*AUC12 (ng.hr/mL) for ribavirin; AUC0-24 (IU.hr/mL) f or IntronA

Transfer into seminal fluid Seminal transfer of ribavirin has been studied. Ribavirin concentration in seminal f luid is approximately two-fold higher compared to serum. However, ribavirin systemic exposure of a female partner after sexual intercourse with a treated patient has been estimated and remains extremely limited compared to therapeutic plasma concentration of ribavirin. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Although interferon is generally recognised as being species specif ic, toxicity studies in animals were conducted. Injections of human recombinant interferon alf a-2b for up to three months have shown no evidence of toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits. Daily dosing of cynomolgus monkeys with 20 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months caused no remarkable toxicity. Toxicity was demonstrated in monkeys given 100 x 10 6 IU/kg/day for 3 months. In studies of interf eron use in non-human primates, abnormalities of the menstrual cycle have been observed (see section 4.4). Results of animal reproduction studies indicate that recombinant interf eron alfa-2b was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, nor did it adversely aff ect pregnancy, foetal development or reproductive capacity in offspring of treated rats. Interf eron alf a-2b has been shown to have abortifacient effects in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) at 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 . Abortion was observed in all dose groups (7.5 million, 15 million and 30 million IU/kg), and was statistically significant versus control at the mid- and high-dose groups (corresponding to 90 and 180 times the recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose of 2 million IU/m 2 ). High doses of other forms of interferons alpha and beta are known to produce doserelated anovulatory and abortifacient eff ects in rhesus monkeys. Mutagenicity studies with interferon alf a-2b revealed no adverse events. IntronA plus ribavirin No studies have been conducted in juvenile animals to examine the effects of treatment with interferon alf a-2b on growth, development, sexual maturation, and behaviour. Preclinical juvenile toxicity results have demonstrated a minor, dose-related decrease in overall growth in neonatal rats dosed with ribavirin (see section 5.3 of  Rebetol SPC if  IntronA is to be administered in combination with ribavirin).

-if  you have cirrhosis or other liver problems (other than hepatitis B or C). -if  you have psoriasis, it may get worse during treatment with IntronA. -when receiving IntronA, you may temporarily have a greater risk of getting an infection. Check with your doctor if you think you are getting an inf ection. -if  you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory inf ection, such as fever, cough, or any diff iculty in breathing, tell your doctor. -if  you notice unusual bleeding or bruising check with your doctor immediately. -if  you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as diff iculty in breathing, wheezing, or hives) while on this medicine seek medical help immediately. -if  you  are  also  being  treated  f or  HIV  (see  section  'Other  medicines  and  IntronA'). -if  you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. -if  you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interf eron treatment may increase the risk of rejection. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.

Patients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver f ailure. Your doctor will monitor you f or signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaf let also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).

If you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interf eron product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.

IntronA with food and drink and alcohol While being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, interf erons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The ef fect on human pregnancy is not known. If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if  there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - if  you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months af ter stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. - if  you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance f or ribavirin to be lef t in the woman's body. If  your f emale partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you a or your partner must use an eff ective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an inf ant if  you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.

## HOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA

Syringe with an unattached needle

<!-- image -->

The following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself . Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to selfinject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-injection.

<!-- image -->

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe (for example 1 mL); -a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it f irmly onto the tip of  the syringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. Injecting the solution Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Change your injection site each time.

Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.

The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container.

Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.

Your doctor will monitor you f or signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaf let also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).

If you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interf eron product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.

IntronA with food and drink and alcohol While being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, interf erons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The ef fect on human pregnancy is not known. If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if  there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - if  you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months af ter stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. - if  you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance f or ribavirin to be lef t in the woman's body. If  your f emale partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an ef fective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an inf ant if  you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.

## HOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA

Syringe with an unattached needle

<!-- image -->

The following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself . Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to self inject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-injection.

<!-- image -->

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe (f or example 1 mL); -a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it f irmly onto the tip of  the syringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surface. Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. Injecting the solution Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Change your injection site each time.

Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.

The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container.

Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.

Tell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.

Patients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver f ailure. Your doctor will monitor you f or signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaf let also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).

If you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interf eron product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

IntronA with food and drink and alcohol While being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, interf erons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The ef fect on human pregnancy is not known. If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if  there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - if  you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months af ter stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. - if  you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance f or ribavirin to be lef t in the woman's body. If  your f emale partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an ef fective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an inf ant if  you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.

## HOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA

Syringe with an unattached needle

<!-- image -->

The following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself . Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to selfinject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-injection.

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe (for example 2 mL); -a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it f irmly onto the tip of  the syringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surf ace. Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose. Injecting the solution Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Change your injection site each time.

Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage.

The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container.

Be sure to discuss this with your doctor. Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.

Tell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.

Patients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver f ailure. Your doctor will monitor you f or signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaf let also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).

If you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interf eron product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

IntronA with food and drink and alcohol While being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, interf erons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The ef fect on human pregnancy is not known. If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if  there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - if  you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months af ter stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. - if  you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance f or ribavirin to be lef t in the woman's body. If  your f emale partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an ef fective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an inf ant if  you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.

## HOW TO SELF INJECT INTRONA

Syringe with an unattached needle

<!-- image -->

The following instructions explain how to inject IntronA yourself . Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or his/her assistant will instruct you how to selfinject IntronA. Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirement of self-injection.

<!-- image -->

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe (for example 1 mL); -a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when preparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it f irmly onto the tip of  the syringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose.

Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surf ace.

Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.

## Injecting the solution

Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.

<!-- image -->

Change your injection site each time. Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container.

In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of IntronA with ribavirin. You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. In addition some patients may experience vomiting. If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.

Tell your doctor if you have ever been treated for depression or any other psychiatric disorder; confusion; unconsciousness; thoughts of suicide or attempted suicide, or have a history of  substance abuse (e.g., alcohol or drugs). Be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking the Chinese herbal medicine shosaikoto. Other medicines and IntronA Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Tell your doctor if you are taking theophylline or aminophylline for asthma, and about all other medicines you are taking, or have taken recently, even those not prescribed, as the dose of some medicines may have to be adjusted while you are treated with IntronA.

Patients who also have HIV infection: Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment. If you are receiving HAART, the addition of IntronA and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver f ailure. Your doctor will monitor you f or signs and symptoms of these conditions (Please be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaf let also). Additionally, patients treated with IntronA and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).

If you take telbivudine with a pegylated interferon alfa-2a or any type of injectable interf eron product, your risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs) is higher. These events may also be more severe. Therefore, the combination of IntronA with telbivudine is contraindicated.

Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

IntronA with food and drink and alcohol While being treated with IntronA, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. In studies in pregnant animals, interf erons have sometimes caused miscarriage. The ef fect on human pregnancy is not known. If you are prescribed IntronA in combination with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if  there is any chance for pregnancy to occur: - if  you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped. You must use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months af ter stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. - if  you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a condom. This will lessen the chance f or ribavirin to be lef t in the woman's body. If  your f emale partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped. This can be discussed with your doctor. If you are a male patient, you or your partner must use an ef fective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment. This can be discussed with your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is present in human milk. Therefore, do not breast-feed an inf ant if  you are taking IntronA. In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products. Driving and using machines Do not drive or use machines if you become drowsy, tired, or confused from using this medicine. IntronA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 2.5 mL, i.e., essentially \"sodium-f ree\". 3. How to use IntronA Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe (for example 1 mL); -a needle for the subcutaneous injection (for example 0.4 x 13 mm [27 gauge 0.5 inch]); -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when preparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Do not touch the tip of the syringe. Take the needle and place it f irmly onto the tip of  the syringe. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose. Volume to be withdrawn according to the dose: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Replace the needle guard and place the syringe with the needle on a flat surf ace.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.

## Injecting the solution

Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.

Change your injection site each time.

<!-- image -->

Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely in a closed container.

Preparation Collect necessary items before you begin: -a vial of IntronA solution f or injection; -a syringe with an attached needle for subcutaneous injection; -a cleansing swab. Wash your hands carefully. Measuring the dose of IntronA Remove the cap from the vial. If this is a multidose vial, you will only have to remove the cap when preparing the first dose. Clean the rubber stopper on the top of the vial containing the IntronA solution with a cleansing swab. Remove the syringe from the wrapping. Ensure that needle with needle guard is firmly attached to the syringe by pushing while turning the needle guard. Remove the needle guard without touching the needle, and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger to the level that represents your dose as prescribed by your doctor. Hold the IntronA vial upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands. Insert the needle into the vial containing the IntronA solution and inject air into the vial. Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand. Be sure the tip of needle is in the IntronA solution. Your other hand will be free to move the plunger. Pull back on the plunger slowly to draw the correct dose as prescribed by your doctor into the syringe. Remove the needle from the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, pull the plunger slightly back; tap the syringe gently, with the needle pointing up, until the bubbles disappear. Push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Be sure the solution is at room temperature up to 25°C. If the solution is cold, warm the syringe between your palms. Examine the solution prior to administration: it should be clear and colourless. Do not use if discolouration or particulate matter is present. You are now ready to inject the dose.

## Injecting the solution

Select the injection site. The best sites f or injection are tissues with a layer of f at between skin and muscle: thigh, outer surface of the upper arm (you may need the assistance of another person to use this site), abdomen (except the navel or waistline). If you are exceptionally thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.

Change your injection site each time.

Cleanse and disinfect the skin where the injection is to be made. Wait for the area to dry. Remove the needle guard. With one hand, pinch a fold of loose skin. With your other hand hold the syringe as you would a pencil. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°. Inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently. Pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for several seconds. Do not massage the injection site. If  there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. The vial and injection materials intended for single use must be discarded. Dispose of the syringe with attached needle safely in a closed container. For multidose vials, be sure to return the vial to the refrigerator. Medicinal Product no longer authorised
