| II/0001     | This type II variation concerned the provision of the final study report for the follow-up part BPLG-004- FUP of the clinical study BPLG-004, undertaken to further investigate the long-term safety and to provide further final height data. The requested variation proposed no amendments to the product information. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority Medicinal | 23/01/2014 product | n/a no longer | The objective of the 2-year follow-up period of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of LB03002 in pre- pubertal children and to further explore efficacy and safety endpoints by prolonged treatment with LB03002. For the comparative period (1st treatment year), patients were randomised to receive either weekly LB03002 or daily Genotropin injections. Patients completing the 12-month comparative period were given the option to participate in a 12-month extension period where all patients received LB03002 (2nd treatment year). Patients who completed the extension period were offered to continue treatment with LB03002 for another two years (follow-up period) or until final height (FH) was reached, whichever occurred first (3rd and 4th treatment year). The patient population consisted of 58 patients from India and 9 from Egypt who continued into the follow-up period. In children with GHD, Somatropin Biopartners at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/week demonstrated non-inferior efficacy compared to daily Genotropin at an appropriate dose of 0.21 mg/kg/week during the initial active controlled 12- month treatment period. In addition, short- and long-term efficacy (up to 4 years) is comparable to that published for daily somatropin regimens using dosages within the range recommended for GHD children in the EU (0.175 - 0.245 mg/kg/week). It can be concluded that LB03002, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/week, produces the expected growth responses and growth patterns over time. Therefore, similar final height gain with LB03002 as compared to currently licensed daily somatropins can be expected. authorised |

C.I.12 - Inclusion or deletion of black symbol and explanatory statements for medicinal products in the list of medicinal products that are subject to additional monitoring

13/12/2013

Most AEs were related to normal childhood diseases or could be attributed to the underlying disorder. Local tolerance does not raise special safety concerns, since only one patient suffered from injection site reactions in the 2year follow-up period. No new or unexpected TEAEs or SAEs occurred in the 2-year follow-up period of study BPLG-004. LB03002 remains with a tolerable safety profile. In conclusion, the CHMP considers this specific postauthorisation measure (PAM) 03 to be fulfilled. No more data can be expected from study BPLG004-FUP. No concerns regarding efficacy or safety arise from the longterm data of this study. In order to obtain further longterm efficacy data in the future, the CHMP has encouraged the MAH to provide final height data as part of the PASS. During the 2-year follow-up no new adverse events occurred that would change the benefit/risk balance of Somatropin Biopartners. The results from the 2-year follow-up period of study BPLG-004 support the previously undertaken benefit/risk assessment and hence do not warrant any changes to the currently approved product information.
