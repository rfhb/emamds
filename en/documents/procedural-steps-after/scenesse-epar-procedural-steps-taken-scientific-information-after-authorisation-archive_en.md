| II/0052              | Update of section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the posology recommendations by removing the current recommendation of a maximum of four implants per year, based on a literature review and analysis of safety data. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0049   | To remove study CUV-RCR-001 (Scenesse (Afamelanotide 16mg) Retrospective Chart Review) listed as an obligation in the Annex II of the Product Information. This is a retrospective study comparing long term safety data and outcome endpoints in patients receiving and not receiving Scenesse, or having discontinued Scenesse use. The Annex II and the RMP (version 9.11) are updated accordingly. C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the obligations and conditions of a marketing authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of change(s) which require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH where significant assessment is required | 11/04/2024 | 25/04/2025 | Annex II | In view of the infeasibility of the retrospective chart review (RCR) study due to the lack of patient recruitment and given that the vast majority of Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) patients is included in the registry study, listed as specific obligation for the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances of SCENESSE in the Annex II of the Product Information, which has the same objectives as the RCR and that these data are presented in annual reports to CHMP and PRAC, it is agreed that no significant additional knowledge gain is to be expected from the RCR. The EEDR runs with unlimited validity and data (including long-term safety data) have been collected for eight consecutive years now. Taking into consideration the above, it is considered that terminating the retrospective chart review study CUV-RCR-001 will not impact the benefit-risk of SCENESSE. Consequently, the obligation to conduct the retrospective chart review study is being removed from the Annex II of the Product Information. |
