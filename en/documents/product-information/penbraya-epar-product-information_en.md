<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

## Primary vaccination

2 doses should be administered (0.5 mL each) 6 to 12 months apart for prevention of meningococcal disease caused by groups A, B, C, W, and Y.

Penbraya should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or subcutaneously.

Booster A booster dose should be considered for individuals at continued risk of invasive meningococcal disease who completed primary vaccination with Penbraya or completed primary vaccination with both meningococcal group b vaccine (recombinant, adsorbed) and a meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y vaccine. Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Penbraya are available up to 4 years after vaccination (see section 5.1). There are no data available to indicate the need for or timing of a booster dose of Penbraya (see section 5.1). Interchangeability There are no data available on the interchangeability of Penbraya with other meningococcal vaccines to complete the primary vaccination series. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Penbraya in children under 10 years of age have not yet been established. Penbraya should not be used in infants aged 2 to 6 months because of safety concerns (see section 4.8). No data are available for children &gt;6 months through 9 years of age. Method of administration This vaccine is for intramuscular injection only. The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. For instructions on reconstitution of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Management of acute allergic reactions

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress -related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Penbraya may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. Tetanus vaccination Penbraya contains tetanus toxoid carrier protein, however, vaccination with Penbraya does not substitute for routine tetanus vaccination. Limitations of clinical trials There are no data on the use of Penbraya in individuals older than 25 years of age. Data in individuals older than 25 years of age are available for the individual components of Penbraya (MenACWY conjugate component and MenB component). Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Vaccination with Penbraya may not protect all vaccine recipients. Excipients This vaccine contains polysorbate 80. Polysorbate 80 may cause hypersensitivity reactions. This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant administration of Penbraya with other vaccines has not been studied. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Animal studies with the vaccine components of Penbraya (MenACWY conjugate component and MenB component) do not indicate reproductive or developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).

Penbraya should only be used during pregnancy when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks.

<!-- image -->

Breast-feeding It is unknown whether Penbraya is excreted in human milk. Penbraya should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks. Fertility No human data on the effect of Penbraya on fertility are available. Animal studies with the vaccine components of Penbraya (MenACWY conjugate component and MenB component) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see section 5.3). Penbraya or its vaccine components has not been evaluated in animal studies for impairment of fertility in males. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Penbraya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site ( ≥ 94%), fatigue ( ≥ 64%), headache ( ≥ 58%), muscle pain ( ≥ 36%), and swelling ( ≥ 34%) and redness ( ≥ 33%) at the injection site. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The safety profile of Penbraya was evaluated in more than 2 500 participants ≥ 10 to ≤ 25 years of age across clinical studies who received at least 1 dose of Penbraya. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies and post-marketing data of the component vaccines are listed per system organ class (SOC), in decreasing order of seriousness according to the following frequency categories: very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare ( ≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

The study was terminated as two infants 2 months of age developed fever (39.3°C and 39°C, respectively) after the first vaccination that, despite the use of antipyretics, led to medical attention and investigations including lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed pleocytosis without positive microbiological test results in 1 infant. Both cases were treated as presumed infections. Symptoms resolved for both infants. Post-marketing data after administration of Trumenba revealed 3 additional cases in which infants 1 to 3 months of age experienced fever leading to medical attention and investigations including lumbar puncture 1 day after vaccination. CSF analysis showed no pleocytosis in 2 cases and in 1 case showed pleocytosis without a positive microbiological test result.

a. ADR identified from experience with the MenACWY conjugate component and/or MenB component. b. Hypersensitivity is a cluster term which includes pruritis, urticaria, and rash. Paediatric population The paediatric safety profile, as evaluated in the study population of 1 791 children and adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, was generally comparable to that in adults. Infants less than 1 year of age In a study including 115 infants 2 months and 48 infants 6 months of age who received Penbraya or Trumenba co-administered with vaccines licensed for this age group, the following adverse reactions occurred at a frequency of very common ( ≥ 1/10): drowsiness, irritability (fussiness), loss of or decreased appetite, fever, and injection site pain, swelling and redness. Fever ( ≥ 38°C) was reported in 74% of subjects, with 69% of subjects (33 out of 48) 6 months of age reporting fever and 76% of subjects (87 out of 115) 2 months of age. Occurrence of fever &gt;38.9 ˚ C-40.0 ˚ C was very common (12.0-25.0%) in both age groups, despite the use of paracetamol. The rate and severity of fever did not decrease with the second vaccination in the youngest infants. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<!-- image -->

In study 1001 (phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre study) immunogenicity of Penbraya at 0 and 6 months or MenB at 0 and 6 months and MenACWY-CRM at 0 months was evaluated in a total of 2 431 randomised participants. Percentages of participants achieving seroresponse for groups A, B, C, W, and Y and composite response for group B following 2 doses of Penbraya are presented in Table 2. Percentages of seroprotected participants for groups A, B, C, W, and Y following 2 doses of Penbraya are shown in Table 3.

4.9 Overdose In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH11 Mechanism of action Penbraya induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y and to the fHbp subfamily A and B variants of Neisseria meningitidis group B. Anti-meningococcal antibodies protect against invasive meningococcal disease via complement mediated bactericidal activity. Clinical efficacy The efficacy is inferred by measuring immunogenicity using a serogroup-specific serum bactericidal assay with exogenous human complement (hSBA). An hSBA titre of ≥ 1:4 is the accepted correlate of protection against meningococcal disease. For groups A, C, W, and Y, 1 strain was utilised per group. The 4 group B test strains utilised in the immunogenicity evaluation express fHbp variants representing the 2 fHbp subfamilies (A and B) and are representative of prevalent strains causing invasive group B disease. Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of Penbraya described in this section includes data from 3 clinical studies: two studies (1001 and 1057) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of two doses of Penbraya administered at 0 and 6 months or MenB at 0 and 6 months and MenACWY-CRM at 0 months in participants 10 through 25 years of age in the US and Europe. All participants were MenB vaccine-naïve. Both ACWY-naïve and ACWY-experienced participants (received 1 dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine and/or monovalent MenC at least 4 years prior to enrolment) were part of the studies. In addition study 1004 evaluated an extended 2-dose schedule of Penbraya with an interval of 12 months in participants 10 through 14 years of age. Participants were naïve to any meningococcal vaccine. Primary vaccination immunogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Penbraya seroresponse rates after 2 doses were demonstrated to be non-inferior (non-inferiority margin of 10%) to Meningococcal Groups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugated to Corynebacterium

diphtheriae CRM197 protein conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) after 1 dose in both ACWY-naïve and ACWY-experienced population. Similarly, Penbraya seroresponse and composite response rates were demonstrated to be non-inferior (non-inferiority margin of 10%) to MenB after 2 doses.

ACWY-naïve and ACWY-experienced combined Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; LOD = limit of detection; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; MenACWY-CRM = meningococcal (groups A, C, W, and Y) oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 conjugate vaccine; MenB = meningococcal group B factor H binding protein. Note: The LLOQ is an hSBA titre = 1:16 for A22 and 1:8 for A56, B24, and B44 and groups A, C, W, and Y. Note: Seroresponse is defined as the 4-fold increase as follows: (1) For participants with a baseline hSBA titre &lt; 1:4 (LOD), a 4-fold response was defined as an hSBA titre ≥ 1:16. (2) For participants with a baseline hSBA titre ≥ LOD and &lt; LLOQ, a response is defined as an hSBA titre ≥ 4 times the LLOQ. (3) For participants with a baseline hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ, a response is defined as an hSBA titre ≥ 4 times the baseline titre. Composite response = hSBA ≥ LLOQ for all 4 primary meningococcal B strains. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Note: Seroprotection is defined as hSBA titre ≥ 1:8 for A56, B24, and B44 and groups A, C, W, and Y and ≥ 1:16 for A22 a. Evaluable immunogenicity populations. In Study 1004 (phase 2 descriptive study), following 2 doses of Penbraya administered at 0 and 12 months, 98.2% to 99.1% and 92.9% to 100% of participants (n = 155 randomised) achieved seroresponse for groups A, C, W, and Y and group B, respectively. The group B composite response was achieved by 96.4% of participants following 2 doses of Penbraya. Immunopersistence and booster immunogenicity Immunopersistence up to four years following 2 doses of Penbraya and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Penbraya 4 years after primary series completion was evaluated in stage 2 of Study 1057 (open-label) in a total number of 353 participants.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

ACWY-naïve and ACWY-experienced combined for group B endpoints Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; MenACWY-CRM = meningococcal (groups A, C, W, and Y) oligosaccharide diphtheria CRM197 conjugate vaccine; MenB = meningococcal group B factor H binding protein. Note: Seroprotection is defined as hSBA titre ≥ 1:16 for A22 and ≥ 1:8 for A56, B24, and B44 and groups A, C, W, and Y. a. Booster evaluable immunogenicity population. b. Sample sizes (N) in the ACWY-experienced groups for the hSBA assessments for groups A, W, and Y are lower than for group C as participants who previously received a monovalent C vaccine only contributed to hSBAs for group C. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Penbraya in 1 or more subsets of the paediatric population for prevention of invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, B, C, W, and Y (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Non-clinical studies have not been conducted with Penbraya; however, non-clinical studies were conducted with the vaccine components of Penbraya (MenACWY conjugate component and MenB component). Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, and reproductive and developmental toxicity.

Step 2. Attach the vial adapter to the vial containing powder for Penbraya

- Keep the vial adapter in the packaging and orient it vertically over the centre of the vial so that the adapter spike aligns with the centre of the vial's rubber stopper.
- Hold the base of the vial on a flat surface.
- Connect the vial adapter to the vial with a straight downward push. The vial adapter will lock into place.
- Invert the vial completely with the vial adapter and syringe still attached.

· Do not push vial adapter in at an angle as this may result in leaking during use. · Remove the vial adapter packaging. Step 3. Resuspend suspension contained in the pre-filled syringe · During storage, a white deposit and clear supernatant may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the suspension. · Shake the syringe vigorously to obtain a visually white homogenous suspension. Do not use the syringe if the contents cannot be resuspended. Step 4. Remove the pre-filled syringe cap · For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adapter located at the tip of the syringe. This will prevent the Luer lock adapter from detaching during use. · Remove the syringe cap by slowly turning the cap counterclockwise while holding the Luer lock adapter. Step 5. Connect the pre-filled syringe to the vial adapter · Hold the syringe's Luer lock adapter and connect it to the vial adapter by turning clockwise. · Stop turning when you feel resistance, overtightening the syringe may result in leaking during use. · Once the syringe is securely attached to the vial adapter, there will be a small space between the top of the vial adapter and the Luer lock adapter of the syringe. Step 6. Inject suspension and gently swirl · Inject the entire contents of the syringe containing the MenB suspension into the vial. · Do not remove the empty syringe. · While holding the plunger rod down, gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until the powder is completely dissolved (less than 1 minute). Step 7. Withdraw the contents Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe.
- Do not pull the plunger rod out.
- Drawing up all obtainable content ensures a complete 0.5 mL dose for administration.

Date of first authorisation:

Step 9. Attach needle · Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection to the pre-filled syringe by turning clockwise. · Do not overtighten the needle as this may result in leaking during use. Step 10. Resuspend and visual inspection · Immediately prior to dose administration, shake the syringe to ensure a homogenous suspension. · The prepared vaccine is a white homogenous suspension. · Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discoloration is found. Disposal Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

## Package leaflet: Information for the user

## Penbraya powder and suspension for suspension for injection

Meningococcal groups A, C, W, Y conjugate and group B vaccine (recombinant, adsorbed)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you. · Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. · If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Penbraya is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive Penbraya 3. How Penbraya is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Penbraya 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Penbraya is and what it is used for Penbraya is a vaccine which helps protect people aged 10 years and older against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called Neisseria meningitidis types A, B, C, W, and Y. These bacteria can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections such as: · Meningitis - an infection of the tissues that lines the brain and spinal cord. · Sepsis - a blood infection. Penbraya contains small amounts of fragments from the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria types A, B, C, W and Y. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) recognises the fragments as 'foreign' and makes antibodies (proteins) against them. If the person later comes into contact with the bacteria, these antibodies, together with other components of the immune system, will be able to fight off the bacteria more effectively and so help protect the person against the disease. 2. What you need to know before you receive Penbraya Penbraya should not be given -if you or your child are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child receive Penbraya. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this vaccine if you or your child:

- have ever had an allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you or your child were given Penbraya in the past.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- have ever fainted following any needle injection.
- have any bleeding problems or bruise easily.
- have a severe illness or high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
- have a weakened immune system or are taking medicines that can affect your immune system, which may prevent you or your child from getting the full benefit from Penbraya.

As with any vaccine, Penbraya may not fully protect all those who receive it. Children and adolescents Penbraya is not for use in children younger than 10 years of age. Other medicines and Penbraya Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are scheduled to receive any other vaccines or have recently received any other vaccines. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before receiving this vaccine. Driving and using machines Penbraya has no or minimal effects on your ability to drive or use machines. Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you experience any of these side effects. Penbraya contains sodium This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. Penbraya contains polysorbate 80 This vaccine contains 0.018 mg of polysorbate 80 per dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you or your child has any known allergies. 3. How Penbraya is given Penbraya will be given to you or your child by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Penbraya is given as a single injection of 0.5 mL usually into the upper arm muscle. You will be given two doses. The second dose is given 6 to 12 months after the first. It is important to get both doses in order to provide the best protection against all types of meningococcal disease. Individuals who are at continued risk of getting meningococcal disease after 2 doses may need a booster dose of the vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor, pharmacist or nurse so that you or your child completes the course of injections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lyophilised powder (MenACWY conjugate component) must be reconstituted only with the provided pre-filled syringe containing suspension (MenB component) using the vial adapter to form Penbraya.

## Preparation of Penbraya for administration

<!-- image -->

- Remove the syringe cap by slowly turning the cap counterclockwise while holding the Luer lock adapter.

Pre-filled syringe containing suspension (MenB component) for Penbraya Syringe cap Luer lock adapter Step 1. Prepare vial adapter · Remove plastic flip-off cap from vial and wipe the rubber stopper. · Open the packaging containing the vial adapter by peeling the top cover off. · Do not remove the vial adapter from its package. Step 2. Attach the vial adapter to the vial containing powder for Penbraya · Hold the base of the vial on a flat surface. · Keep the vial adapter in the packaging and orient it vertically over the centre of the vial so that the adapter spike aligns with the centre of the vial's rubber stopper. · Connect the vial adapter to the vial with a straight downward push. The vial adapter will lock into place. · Do not push vial adapter in at an angle as this may result in leaking during use. · Remove the vial adapter packaging. Step 3. Resuspend suspension contained in the pre-filled syringe · During storage, a white deposit and clear supernatant may be observed in the pre-filled syringe containing the suspension. · Shake the syringe vigorously to obtain a visually white homogenous suspension. Do not use the syringe if the contents cannot be resuspended. Step 4. Remove the pre-filled syringe cap · For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adapter located at the tip of the syringe. This will prevent the Luer lock adapter from detaching during use. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Step 5. Connect the pre-filled syringe to the vial adapter

- Stop turning when you feel resistance, overtightening the syringe may result in leaking during use.
- Hold the syringe's Luer lock adapter and connect it to the vial adapter by turning clockwise.

<!-- image -->

· Once the syringe is securely attached to the vial adapter, there will be a small space between the top of the vial adapter and the Luer lock adapter of the syringe. Step 6. Inject suspension and gently swirl · Inject the entire contents of the syringe containing the MenB suspension into the vial. · Do not remove the empty syringe. · While holding the plunger rod down, gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until the powder is completely dissolved (less than 1 minute).
