## 1. INTRODUCTION

Neoclarityn (desloratadine) is a non-sedating long acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor  antagonist  activity.  Neoclarityn  was  first  authorised  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  on  15 January 2001 with the indication:  in  adults  and  adolescents  (12  years  of  age  or  over)  for  the  relief  of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (AR). On 6 August 2001, a Commission Decision extended the use of Neoclarityn in chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

This variation refers to an extension of indication for Neoclarityn from 'chronic idiopathic urticaria' to 'urticaria' .  Consequently sections 4.2 and 5.1  of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were updated. Sections 1 and 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL)  were amended accordingly.

## 2. CLINICAL ASPECTS

## Introduction

Urticaria is a condition in which 'wheal and flare' lesions develop on the skin as a result of mast cell degranulation,  with  liberation  of  several  mediators,  among  which  histamine  is  the  most  important.

The causes of urticaria vary widely, but the end result is similar and is based on mast cell activation.

Causes are acute IgE mediated allergy (e.g to drugs or foods; in which case it is possible that the acute urticaria evolves to more generalised anaphylactic reactions), contact reactions (eg latex, water, certain chemicals),  pseudo  allergic  reactions  (foods,  drugs),  physical  triggers  (dermographism,  pressure, vibration, heat, cold…), exercise, autoimmunity or unknown causes. The course can be hyper acute (from minutes to hours), acute (hours to six weeks) or chronic (more than six weeks).

The rationale for the antihistamine treatment (and of second generation antihistamines in particular) in urticaria patients is based upon the insights in the pathophysiology of urticaria, with the prominent role of histamine as a mediator.

The effectiveness of second generation oral antihistamines have however mainly been studied in the treatment of chronic urticaria, but the common patho-physiologic role of histamine supports their use in urticaria in general.

Urticaria  can  be  mimicked  by  injection  of  histamine  in  the  skin  of  normal  volunteers,  and  second generation antihistamines effectively suppress this reaction 1 .

## Treatment guidelines for urticaria

The  2006  guideline  of  the  European  Academy  of  Allergy  and  Clinical  Immunology  (EAACI), approved by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) 2 , states:

'Considering their good safety profile, second generation antihistamines must be considered as first line  symptomatic  treatment  for  urticaria'. Similarly,  the  position  statements  of  the  American Academy of Emergency Medicine 3 and other literature references 4 for treatment of acute urticaria in emergency departments uniformly recommend the use of second generation antihistamines as first line symptomatic treatment.

## Clinical  Efficacy

Clinical studies with antihistaminics are generally performed in chronic idiopathic urticaria patients, because chronic patients can be prospectively recruited. Studies in other types of urticaria are limited.

One  study  has  prospectively  studied  the  prevention  of  acute  urticaria  in  510  atopic  children  with levocetirizine given for 18 months, and found it to be effective 5 .

Studies  on  treatment  in  acute  urticaria  can  only  be  done  in  emergency  departments  or  in  general practice, as the attacks are totally unexpected, and then last for hours to weeks.

For  some  types  of  chronic  urticaria,  different  from  the  ' chronic  idiopathic  urticaria ',  literature references (including studies with desloratadine) support the use of second generation antihistamines in cold urticaria 6 , delayed pressure urticaria 7 , dermographic urticaria 8 , cholinergic urticaria 9 .

## Clinical safety

No  new  clinical  safety  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application.  From  the  safety  database  of desloratadine all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have already been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment

Based on the limitation to recruit patients with urticarial conditions other than chronic urticaria and taking into account the common patho-physiologic role of histamine in the development of urticaria, the CHMP is of the opinion that the recommendation from EAACI guideline is justified and considers the use of the second generation antihistaminics as first line symptomatic treatment of urticaria to be acceptable. Furthermore,  the  safety  profile in  the  proposed  indication  is  expected  to  remain unchanged.

Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  for  Neoclarityn  in  the  symptomatic  treatment  of urticaria was favourable and recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation.

## 3. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION

The MAH proposed the following changes (new text= underlined, deleted text= strikethrough) :

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## · Section 4.1

Neoclarityn is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with:

- -allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1)
- -chronic idiopathic urticaria

## · Section 4.2

Reference to 'chronic idiopathic urticaria' has been changed to 'urticaria' in accordance to the change in section 4.1 of the SPC.

## · Section 5.1

Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a model for urticarial conditions. Since histamine release is a causal factor in urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected  to be effective in  providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria.

## Package Leaflet

## · Sections 1 and 3

Reference to 'chronic idiopathic urticaria' has been changed to 'urticaria' in accordance to the change in section 4.1 of the SPC.

Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  the  proposed  SPC  and  PL  changes  acceptable  but  required  a  crossreference from section 4.1 to section 5.1 of the SPC to explain that it is hardly possible to perform clinical trials in the applied indication and thus the extension of indication from 'chronic idiopathic urticaria' to ' urticaria' is based on the use in patients with chronic urticaria as it is advised in clinical guidelines.

Further to the CHMP recommendations, the MAH amended the proposal for sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SPC as follows (new text= underlined, deleted text= strikethrough):

## · Section 4.1

Neoclarityn is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with:

- -allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1)
- -chronic idiopathic urticaria (see section 5.1)

## · Section 5.1

Chronic  idiopathic  urticaria  was  studied  as  a  clinical  model  for  urticarial  conditions,  since the underlying  pathophysiology  is  similar,  regardless  of  etiology, and because  chronic  patients  can  be more easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a model for urticarial conditions. Since histamine release is a causal factor in urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected  to be effective in  providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria.

The CHMP considered the final proposal for sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SPC acceptable.
