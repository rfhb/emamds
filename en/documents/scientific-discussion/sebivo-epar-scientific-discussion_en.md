## 1. Introduction

The hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  disease  represents  a  major  public  health  concern,  with  more  than  350 million people infected and about 1 million deaths annually. The prevalence of HBV varies widely by geographic  area,  ranging  from  0.1-2%  in  low  prevalence  areas  such  as  Western  Europe  (primarily acquired through horizontal transmission during adulthood) to 8% and more in the high prevalence areas of South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (usually acquired through vertical transmission).

In  Europe,  the  incidence  of  HBV  infection  is  approaching  1  million,  leading  to  80  000  to  100 000 chronic HBV carriers, 19 000 cirrhosis and 5 000 HCC (Van Damne et al. Vaccine 1995; 13: 954957). Incidence varies from 29 per 100 000 in Western Europe to 523 per 100 000 in Eastern Europe. The weighted average incidence for the WHO European region is 115 per 100 000 inhabitants. Hence, chronic hepatitis B is also a major public health concern in Europe. HBV is a small DNA virus belonging to the hepadnaviridae family. The infectious enveloped particle has an outer protein coat (hepatitis B surface antigen or HBsAg) and an inner protein core (hepatitis B core  antigen  or  HBcAg).  In  infected  hepatocytes,  HBcAg  is  produced  in  excess  and  during  export from the hepatocytes is cleaved to release a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). HBV has a high rate of spontaneous mutation. A mutation in the pre-core region of the gene coding for the nucleocapside stops the synthesis of the HBeAg. Such HBeAg negative or pre-core mutants patients, which account for 7 to 30 % of infections worldwide is particularly common in Southern Europe and Asia. HBV infection is a complex disease that may either resolve spontaneously or manifest itself in variety of ways. Following acute hepatitis B infection, approximately 5% of adults and 20-90% of children, depending  on  the  age  at  infection,  fail  to  produce  adequate  immune  response  and  become  chronic carrier  of  the  virus.  Chronic  carriers  of  HBV  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  long-term complications, i.e. cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among patients with chronic  active  hepatitis  B,  some  40%  will  develop  cirrhosis  over  their  lifetime  at  a  rate  of approximately 2% per year. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, 10% per year progress to a decompensated state, with a 1-year survival rate of 60%, compared with over 90% for compensated cirrhosis. The ultimate goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis B is to suppress HBV replication and to induce remission in liver disease before cirrhosis and HCC develop. There are however remaining scientific uncertainties  for  instance  which  level  of  viraemia  is  associated  with  sustained  virological  response, with HBeAg seroconversion, whether viral clearance is an attainable goal because of the difficulty in eliminating  the  covalently  closed  circular  form  of  HBV  DNA  (cccDNA)  in  the  liver,  when  to  stop safely  the  treatment  (when  viral  eradication  or  when  sustained  suppression  of  viral  replication necessary to prevent progression of disease are achieved). There  are  currently  four  approved  therapies  for  chronic  HBV  infection  in  Europe:  alfa-interferon, lamivudine,  adefovir  dipivoxil,  the  prodrug  of  adef acts primarily as an immunomodulator, whereas the nucleoside/nucleotide analogues directly inhibit viral replication. Current therapy of chronic hepatitis B has limited long-term efficacy and potential drawbacks.  Therefore,  there  remains  a  great  medical  need  for  new  therapeutic  options  for  naïve patients  as  well  as  for  patients  with  lamivudine-resistant  HBV  and  for  the  more  difficult  to  treat population (e.g. HBeAg negative patients, HIV co-infected patients and patients with decompensated hepatitis) with improved efficacy and safety profiles, with durable response and with low propensity for developing viral resistance.

The  present  application  for  marketing  authorisation  of  Sebivo  is  made  under  Article  8.3  (i)  and concerns  a  new  active  substance,  telbivudine  for  which  a  complete  dossier  has  been  submitted. Telbivudine  (LdT)  is  a  thymidine  nucleoside  analogue  of  guanosine  with  selective  activity  against HBV.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  approved  indication  at  the  recommended  dose  of  600  mg  once  daily  is:  'for  the  treatment  of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with compensated liver disease and evidence of viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis. See section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics for details of the study and specific patient characteristics on which this indication is based.'

2. Quality aspects Introduction Sebivo an immediate release dosage form is presented as film-coated tablets containing 600 mg of telbivudine as active substance. The other ingredients are cellulose microcrystalline, povidone, sodium starch  glycolate,  magnesium  stearate,  silicon  dioxide  and  purified  water.  The  film  coat  consists  of hypromellose, talc, titanium dioxide, macrogol and purified water. The film-coated tablets are marketed in PVC blisters lacquered to an aluminium foil. Active Substance The active substance is telbivudine and its chemical name is 1-((2S,4R,5S)-4-hydroxy-5hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-5-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione according to the IUPAC nomenclature. Telbivudine  is  a  white  to  slightly  yellowish  powder  and  only  one  crystalline  form  (form  A)  was identified. Telbivudine is sparingly soluble in water and aqueous solutions, soluble in methanol, very slightly  soluble  in  ethanol,  n-octanol  and  polyethylene  glycol  400  and  slightly  soluble  in  propylene glycol,  acetonitrile  and  cremophor  EL/ethanol  65:35  (V/V).  The  above-mentioned  active  substance contains 3 chiral centres and is a single enantiomer (2S, 4R and 5S). · Manufacture Telbivudine is synthesised in three reactions steps. The manufacturing process has been adequately described.  Critical  parameters  have  been  identified  and  adequate  in-process  controls  included. Specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. Adequate control of critical steps and intermediates has been presented. The active substance is purified by recrystallisation. Structure elucidation has been performed by ultraviolet spectroscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, 13 C-NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy. The molecular weight was determined by mass spectrometry. Elemental analysis is in agreement with the calculated composition. · Specification The active substance specifications include tests for appearance (white to slightly yellowish powder), particle size (laser light diffraction), identification (IR-KBr, IR-ATR and X-ray diffraction), impurities (HPLC),  loss  on  drying  (thermogravimetry),  sulphated  ash,  specific  optical  rotation,  heavy  metals, clarity of solution, colour of solution, assay (HPLC), content of active substance and microbiological limit tests.

It was verified that all specifications reflect the relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods, which were used in the routine controls, were well described and their validations are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines.

Impurities were described, classified as process related impurities and possible degradation products, and qualified. Residual solvents were satisfactorily controlled in the active substance according to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relevant  ICH  requirements.  Certificates  of  analyses  for  the  active  substances  were  provided  and  all batch analysis results comply with the specifications and show a good uniformity from batch to batch.

· Stability The stability results from long-term accelerated and stress studies were completed according to ICH guidelines  demonstrated  adequate  stability  of  the  active  substance.  The  active  substance  is  not susceptible to degradation under the influence of light, oxygen and nitrogen exposure. The results of the long-term and accelerated studies fulfil the proposed specification and for that reason support the proposed retest period. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development All  information  regarding  the  choice  of  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  are  sufficiently justified. Four strengths of Sebivo tablets were developed (25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 600 mg) and used in clinical trials. However, only one tablet strength (600 mg) will be commercialised. The  main  aim  of  the  applicant  was  to  develop  a  formulation  that  would  rapidly  release  the  active substance, for that reason different formulation containing different excipients were investigated and optimised. Results of formulation and process development studies demonstrate that the tablet formulation and the manufacturing process are robust and under control. · Manufacture of the Product The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing processes such as mixing, granulating, compressing and film-coating unit operations. Furthermore,  the  equipment  used  is  commonly  available  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  It  was demonstrated that there are no critical steps in the manufacturing process. The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications. · Product Specification The medicinal product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, identification (UV, HPLC and colour reaction), mean mass, dissolution after 30 minutes, impurities/degradants (HPLC), assay and microbial limits (Ph Eur). All  analytical  procedures  that  were  used  for  testing  the  medicinal  product  were  properly  described. Moreover,  all  relevant  methods  were  satisfactorily  validated  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH guidelines. Batch analysis data on three stability batches and three production scale batches (validation batches) confirm satisfactory uniformity of the product at release. · Stability of the Product Medicinal product no longer authorised

The stability studies were conducted according to the relevant ICH guidelines. One production scale batch  and  two  pilot  scale  batches  have  been  stored  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  in  the proposed market packaging.

One  production  batch  was  stored  under  photostability  stress  testing  under  ICH  conditions.  The photostability results show that the tablets are not sensitive to light.

Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) are acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  information  on  development,  manufacture,  control  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the  finished  product.  Therefore,  this  medicinal  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform performance in the clinic.

3. Non-clinical aspects Introduction Telbivudine ( β -L-2 ′ -Deoxythymidine, LdT) is the unmodified L-enantiomer of the naturally nucleoside D-thymidine. The non-clinical programme consisted of a series of studies aiming to define the pharmacological, pharmacokinetics and toxicological profile of telbivudine. Safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  Good  Laboratory Practices. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Telbivudine is phosphorylated to the monophosphate form, which is then sequentially converted to the 5 ′ -diphosphate  and  to  the  active  triphosphate  form  by  cellular  nucleoside  kinases.  Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase (TK) are implicated in the conversion of telbivudine. Investigations suggested that telbivudine, in contrast to lamivudine, acts preferentially on HBV DNA second-strand  synthesis  (DNA-dependent  DNA  synthesis)  rather  than  first  minus  DNA  strand synthesis (reverse transcription). It is not clear how this feature translates into clinical activity. Telbivudine is phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner in hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes.  Telbivudine  tri-phosphate  inhibits  hepadnaviral  DNA  synthesis  with  an  inhibitory concentration (IC50) for virion-associated woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) polymerase of 0.24 µM. In hepatoma cell culture assays (2.2.15 cells derived from HepG2 cells), telbivudine inhibited HBV production  with  a  mean  50%  effective  concentration ( EC50)  of  0.19+/-0.09  µM. Viral  rebound occurred after treatment withdrawal and HBV replication returned to 50% of pre-treatment levels by day  10  post-treatment.  The  kinetics  of  viral  rebound  suggested  that  the  antiviral  effect  seen  after withdrawal was consistent with the intracellular half-life of 14 hours in HepG2 cells. Telbivudine was non-cytotoxic to the human hepatoma cell line 2.2.15: 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50)  &gt;  2000  µM.  Telbivudine  was  not  cytotoxic  to  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (CC50 &gt; 200 µM). In  in-vitro  studies  telbivudine-TP  was  not  an  inhibitor  of  human  DNA  polymerases α , β ,  or γ at concentrations up to 100 µM, the highest concentration tested. The antiviral activity of telbivudine against lamivudine or adefovir resistant HBV genomes has been extensively evaluated. The genotypic identities  of  the  HBV  genomes  in  the  cell  lines  tested  were  the  lamivudine  selected mutations M204V, M204I, L180M + M204V, L180M + M204I in comparison with wild-type. Telbivudine  was  essentially  inactive  (EC50 &gt; 1000 µ M)  against  the  M204I  or  the  L180M/M204V mutant viruses. Telbivudine reached an EC50 below 1000 µ M against L180M/M204I double mutant in some but not all experiments. However, telbivudine exhibited essentially unchanged anti-viral activity against the M204V mutant virus. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Like lamivudine, telbivudine is active in cell lines against the N236T mutant, which so far seems the primary mutation responsible for resistance to adefovir dipivoxil.

In vitro , cross-resistant data showed that the second conserved site mutation rtA181V which conferred clinical resistance to adefovir dipivoxil led to only a modest reduction in the activity of telbivudine (3.7 fold).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall results suggest that telbivudine is cross-resistant with lamivudine and entecavir.

In vivo studies were conducted in woodchucks, species that is susceptible to infection with hepatitis virus. In a 28-day study, telbivudine was active at all doses tested (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg/day given orally once daily). Telbivudine showed a clear dose response at the end of treatment. Serum WHV DNA levels decreased by up to 8 log10 and to below the limit of detection by PCR in two of the dosed animals and by about 6 log10 in the third animal. Following treatment withdrawal at day 28, viral rebound reached near pre-treatment levels between weeks 8 and 12 (day 56 and 84).

Pharmacokinetic characteristics of telbivudine were studied in the species used in toxicological studies (mice,  rats,  rabbits,  and  monkeys)  as  well  in  pharmacodynamic  studies  (woodchucks).  Telbivudine plasma concentrations were measured using sensitive and specific HPLC with UV detection and/or LC-MS/MS methods.

In the other study, after 12 weeks of telbivudine at 1 mg/kg/day the decline in serum WHV DNA was more  gradual.  Individual  animals  showed  more  variation  in  the  extent  and  duration  of  antiviral suppression. Nevertheless, WHV viral load reductions of at least 6 to 7 log10 were seen in the four telbivudine-treated animals at some point during therapy. Serum WHsAg levels decreased throughout the treatment phase by 0.5 to 1.5 log10 from baseline and WHsAg rebound lagged behind viral load rebound  by  approximately  1-2  weeks.  All  were  positive  for  WHV  core  antibody  and  there  was  no evidence of an anti-WHsAg response during the 12-week follow-up. Unlike lamivudine and adefovir but like entecavir, telbivudine did not inhibit replication of any other virus than hepadnaviruses including HIV. · Secondary pharmacodynamics The absence of specific secondary pharmacodynamics studies is acceptable taking into consideration the  specificity  of  telbivudine  against  hepadnaviruses,  the  absence  of  inhibition  of  human  DNA polymerases α , β and γ by telbivudine -TP, the lack of mitochondrial toxicity of telbivudine in vitro and the weak cytotoxicity of telbivudine against various human cell lines. · Safety pharmacology programme Safety pharmacology studies investigated the effect of telbivudine on cardiovascular, respiratory and central  nervous  systems.  Cardiovascular  and  respiratory  endpoints  were  examined  in  cynomolgus monkeys after single oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Toxicokinetic data suggested that this dose would have  produced  an  exposure  (AUC0-24)  of  approximately  9  times  the  expected  human  exposure following a 600 mg/day dose. No effects on cardiovascular or respiratory variables were seen. Telbivudine did not show any potential for QT interval prolongation, as it had no effect on potassium channel (hERG) current at concentrations up to 10,000 µ M. Effects on the central nervous system were assessed by means of a functional observational battery in rats. Single oral doses up to 1000mg/kg did not cause any adverse clinical signs. Toxicokinetic data suggested that this dose would have produced exposure (AUC) of approximately 7 times the expected human exposure. The  lack  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  renal  and  gastrointestinal  systems  was  considered acceptable in view of the lack of findings on these systems reported in the general toxicity studies as well as in the clinical development. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No negative antiviral activity was evidenced in  vitro between telbivudine and NRTIs active against HIV. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Absorption- Bioavailability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Telbivudine  was  absorbed  at  a  moderate  to  fast  rate  (Tmax  0.5-3.0  hr).  The  oral  bioavailability  of telbivudine (10 mg/kg) was 60% in rats, 59% in monkeys and 38% in woodchucks. Studies conducted with fed and fasted female rats suggested that food had no effect on the absorption of telbivudine (10 mg/kg dose).

Telbivudine exposure was less than dose-proportional especially at doses greater than 1000 mg/kg. As shown by an in vitro Caco-2 study, telbivudine has moderate permeability properties. Various in vitro studies  demonstrated  that  telbivudine  does  not  interact  with  P-gp  and  MRP.  A  lack  of  interaction between telbivudine and transporters was also shown in humans.

There were no sex-related differences in the pharmacokinetics profile of telbivudine. · Distribution Following oral  administration  (10  mg/kg)  of  [ 14 C]-telbivudine  to  male  rats,  telbivudine  was  widely distributed,  with  the  highest  concentrations  observed  in  small  and  large  intestines,  urinary  bladder, kidneys,  prostate  gland,  mesenteric  lymph  nodes,  stomach,  and  pancreas.  There  was  limited penetration  to  the  central  nervous  system,  moderate  crossing  the  placenta,  and  substantial  secretion into rat milk as evidenced by a milk/plasma AUC ratio of 2.3. Telbivudine was weakly bound to plasma protein (from 3.3 to 7.5% in rat, monkey and human) and was independent of telbivudine concentration over the range evaluated (0.4 to 40 µ g/ml). Telbivudine partitioned  into  the  erythrocytes  of  rats,  monkeys  and  humans  independently  of  its  concentration (range 32 to 43%). · Metabolism and elimination Telbivudine undergoes extensive in vitro anabolism to form the 5'-mono-, the 5'-di-, and the 5'-triphosphate derivatives, the later moiety being the active form of telbivudine. While the mono-, di- and triphosphate metabolites of telbivudine have been observed in  vitro ,  they have not been seen in plasma, urine or faeces in vivo .  Following a single oral dose of radiolabelled telbivudine to rats, the parent compound was the predominant radioactive component excreted in both males  and  females.  One  minor  and  unidentified  metabolite  (M-4)  was  observed  in  females.  This metabolite represented up to 3.9% of the radioactivity present in plasma and no more than 7.3% of radioactivity in urine (representing no more than 1.1% of the administered radioactivity). Analysis of the  bile  revealed  five  compound  derived  peaks  including  M-4.  As  less  than  0.80%  of  the  total administered dose was eliminated in the bile, these were considered to be minor metabolites. No metabolites were observed in plasma or urine of monkeys or woodchucks receiving radiolabelled telbivudine. After a single oral administration of [ 14 C]-telbivudine to rats (10 mg/kg) radiocarbon was eliminated in both urine and feces in approximately equivalent amounts (40-50%) over 168 hr; overall recovery of radiocarbon was &gt;91%. The comparison of results after both routes of administration suggested that urine  was  the  primary  route  of  excretion,  and  that  radioactivity  recovered  in  the  feces  after  oral administration corresponded to unabsorbed substance. In  monkeys,  drug-related  radioactivity  was  primarily  eliminated  in  the  urine  following  intravenous administration of [ 3 H]-telbivudine (74% of the dose as telbivudine). After oral administration, 36.6% of the administered compound was eliminated in the urine. Telbivudine was eliminated at a moderate to rapid rate (t1/2 2-8 hr) in mice, rats, and woodchucks, but more  slowly  in  monkeys  (t1/2  7.5-18  hr)  and  humans  (t1/2  41.1  hr).  No  gender  differences  were observed in elimination. Telbivudine  did not inhibit in vitro human  CYP450  enzymes  including  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In addition, Telbivudine did not induce rat CYP1A2, CYP2B,  3A  or  4A in  vivo .  The  occurrence  interactions  with  other  compounds  mediated  via cytochrome P450 therefore seems unlikely.

## Toxicology

A comprehensive toxicological programme was conducted in mice, rats, and monkeys.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Single dose toxicity

In  rats  and  monkeys,  telbivudine  did  not  show  any  clear  signs  of  toxicity  at  oral  doses  up  to  2000 mg/kg.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Studies  were  conducted  in  mice  up  to  13  weeks,  in  rats  up  to  6  months,  and  in  monkeys  up  to  9 months. After oral administration in mice, telbivudine did not induce particular signs of toxicity. Therefore, it was concluded that in both 4- and 13-weeks studies the high-dose levels (2000 mg/kg/day and 3000 mg/kg/day  respectively)  were  the  no-observed  adverse  effects  (NOAEL),  corresponding  to  animal exposures of at least 22-times the anticipated human exposure. Telbivudine administered orally to rats for 28 days and 6 months did not reveal histological evidence of  toxicity.  As  in  mice,  it  was  concluded  that  the  high-dose  levels  administered  were  the  NOAELs (2000 mg/kg/d and 1000 mg/kg/d respectively). Toxicokinetic data indicated that exposures of animals at  these  NOAELs  (in  terms  of  AUC)  were  14  and  6  times  the  anticipated  human  exposure respectively. An intravenous dosing study in rats was associated with changes in the kidney, pancreas and heart. While  exposure,  in  terms  of  AUC,  was  greater  in  the  oral  dosing  study,  the  Cmax  seen  following administration of the high intravenous dose was greater than that seen following administration of the high  oral  dose.  This  may  suggest  that  the  histological  evidence  of  toxicity  seen  in  the  intravenous dosing study was related to the rate of infusion. In  monkeys,  high  oral  doses  of  telbivudine  ( ≥ 1000  mg/kg/day)  caused  some  gastro-intestinal intolerance,  as  evidenced  by  occasional  soft  stools  and  emesis.  In  the  9-month  study,  equivocal evidence of axonopathy was seen at the highest dose tested (1000 mg/kg/day). A re-analysis showed that effect on sciatic nerves was most evident in high dose female group, while the effect on spinal cord was most evident in high dose male group. A possible effect of telbivudine could not be ruled out.  In  this  study  the  NOAEL  was  therefore  considered  to  be  500  mg/kg/day  corresponding  to  an animal/human exposure multiple of 4.5. Overall while repeat oral dosing studies revealed little toxicity, the ratio animal/human exposure were modest. Nonetheless at high doses, toxicokinetic results showed a non-linear relationship between the dose and the exposure suggesting that it would have been difficult to obtain animal exposures higher than the ones obtained in the studies conducted by the applicant. · Genotoxicity In the standard battery of tests, telbivudine was not clastogenic or mutagenic in vitro . Also, there was no  evidence  for  genotoxic  potential in  vivo in  the  mouse  micronucleus  test  (concentrations  up  to 2000mg/kg). · Carcinogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

The carcinogenic potential of telbivudine was assessed in rats and in the mice Tgras H2 transgenic model. Due to low survival rates, especially in rats receiving the high dose (38% at 2000 mg/kg/day), the originally planned duration was shortened from 104 weeks to 85 weeks (high dose group) or 95 weeks (control,  low  dose  and  mid  dose  groups).  It  is  not  clear  if  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  was achieved however administrating a higher dose of telbivudine would probably not have resulted in a significant  higher  exposure.  The  study  suggested  that  telbivudine  might  have  contributed  to  the progression of chronic progressive nephropathy, particularly in the mid and high dose groups but as chronic  progressive  nephropathy  is  not  considered  to  have  a  correlate  in  humans,  this  finding  was considered  of  limited  significance.  While  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  certain  neoplasms (pancreatic acinar cell adenomas, benign phaeochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla and fibroadenoma of the mammary gland), particularly in high dose group, the size of the effects and the lack of a dose response relationship suggests that these findings may have been incidental.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  26  week  oral  dosing  study  in  TgrasH2  transgenic  mice,  telbivudine  did  not  show  any carcinogenic potential and the NOAEL was 2000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

In the combined fertility and developmental toxicity study in rats, a lower fertility rate was noted in pairs given 500 mg/kg/day (76%) or 1000 mg/kg/day (72%) when compared to controls (92%). Oral doses  up  to  1000  mg/kg/day  of  telbivudine  did  not  cause  adverse  effects  on  foetal  development Fertility  was  further  investigated  in  separate  studies  in  male  and  female  rats  at  dosages  up  to  2000 mg/kg/day and no effects on fertility nor on general reproductive function were observed.

<!-- image -->

In  the  embryo-foetal  development  toxicity  study  in  rabbits,  reduced  body  weight  gain  and  reduced food consumption were observed in the high oral dose group (1000 mg/kg). Increased incidence of abortion and early delivery observed for the high dose was secondary to maternal toxicity. There were no developmental anomalies detected. NOAEL  maternal was 250 mg/kg/day  and  NOAEL developmental was 1000 mg/kg for foetal effects corresponding to 37 times the human dose based on AUCs obtained in pregnant rabbits. The perinatal and postnatal development study in rats with doses up to 1000 mg/kg did not show any adverse toxic effects with telbivudine. The absence of studies in juvenile animal was considered acceptable as telbivudine is not indicated in children. · Local tolerance There were no specific studies assessing the local tolerance as telbivudine is to be administered orally. While inflammation was noted at the injection site in the intravenous toxicity study, it was attributed to repeated injections rather than irritation due to telbivudine. · Other toxicity studies Telbivudine did show any evidence of mitochondrial toxicity in a model (HepG2) currently used for this  type  of  study.  In  addition  a  study  for  up  to  12  weeks  in  woodchucks,  a  species  reported  to  be sensitive indicator of mitochondrial toxicity, did not reveal signs of potential mitochondrial toxicant for telbivudine. As certain nucleoside analogues have myelosuppressive effects (eg anemia, neutropenia) the effect of telbivudine on human bone marrow progenitor cell colony formation was examined but no effect on hematopoietic progenitor cells was observed. The potential of telbivudine to induce contact allergy was assessed in a GLP study using the murine local lymph node assay. Telbivudine did not produce immune system activation. No  studies  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  of  metabolites  have  been  performed  considering  the  lack  of telbivudine metabolites detected in humans and of no major metabolites detected in plasma of rats, woodchucks or monkeys. There were no impurities that required toxicological qualification. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was 0.3 µg/l, which exceeds the trigger value (0.01 µg/l).

The applicant conducted also a brief groundwater risk assessment. Telbivudine is unlikely to persist in the environment. These data taken together indicate a low environmental risk for telbivudine.

## 4. Clinical aspects

<!-- image -->

Introduction The clinical programme, mainly conducted in Asia, consisted of: -studies aiming to characterise the pharmacokinetics profile of telbivudine (including interaction studies, studies in special populations and population PK analysis), -dose finding trials (Phase I/IIa study: NV-02B-001 and international Phase IIb trial: NV-02B-003 and its extension phase NV-02B-010), -a  global  Phase  III  (NV-02B-007  also  called  Globe)  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of telbivudine versus lamivudine in a mixed  population of HBeAg  positive  and negative, nucleoside/nucleotide naïve adult patients with compensated chronic liver disease. Good Clinical Practices The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. An inspection was conducted at the EMEA request to assess the GCP standards in investigator sites in Thailand and China of the pivotal study NV-02B-007. The standard of GCP compliance at both sites in this trial was found to be equivalent to EU standards. Pharmacokinetics The  pharmacokinetics  of  telbivudine  has  been  evaluated  using  validating  methods  in  15  Phase  I studies in healthy volunteers or special populations and one Phase I/IIa in HBV infected patients, as well  as  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  using  the  results  from  all  Phase  I/II  studies.  The pharmacokinetics of telbivudine in HBV  infected  patients has not been evaluated with the recommended dose of 600 mg. · Absorption Telbivudine was rapidly absorbed following single oral administration (600 mg) with Tmax attained in 3h (1 - 6), a Cmax of 3.2 ± 1.1mg/l, AUCo-t of 28.0 ± 8.5 mg.h/l and AUCo-inf 30.0 ± 8.7 mg.h/l. Due to the lack of an adequate intravenous formulation, the oral absolute bioavailability has not been determined. The bioavailability has nonetheless been estimated to be about 42 %. Bioequivalence between the clinical trial tablet formulations and the film-coated tablet to be marketed was demonstrated. There was no food effect on telbivudine bioavailability and therefore as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics, telbivudine can be taken with or without food. · Distribution Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Due  to  the  lack  of  intravenous  formulation,  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  has  not  been determined  but  estimated  to  be  8.2  +  4.1  l/kg,  suggesting  that  telbivudine  widely  distributed  into tissues.  Protein  binding  was  low  (between  2  -  5  %)  and  constant  over  the  range  of  therapeutic concentrations.  Telbivudine  equally  partitioned  between  plasma  and  blood  cells  in  a  concentration independent manner with a mean erythrocyte-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.01.

- Elimination

Plasma  telbivudine  penetrated  into  the  hepatocytes  and  was  converted  to  mono,  di  -  and  triphosphorylated metabolite. The 5-triphosphate derivate was the predominant active metabolite. The in vitro  intracellular  half-life  of  telbivudine  5'triphosphate  was  approximately  14  hours  in  liver  cells. Other than intracellular conversion to its active 5'-triphosphate derivative (found in vitro ), telbivudine did not appear to undergo detectable metabolism in vivo .

The mass balance study showed that 42 % and 49.6 % of 14C labelled telbivudine single oral dose (600 mg) was recovered in urine and faeces respectively (total 91.6 %). No metabolites were found in plasma, urine or faeces. Renal clearance (130 ml/min) approached total clearance indicating that renal route was the major elimination pathway mainly by glomerular filtration. The plasma decay of telbivudine was biexponential with a short T½ of approximately 3 - 5 h followed by a second slower elimination phase of 40 - 50 h which was evidenced by sampling up to 168 h. In  vivo  interconversion  of  telbivudine  to  the  endogenous β -D-thymidine  has  been  shown  to  be unlikely. · Dose proportionality and time dependencies Dose  proportionality  of  telbivudine  was  shown  for  Cmax  and  AUCo-t  over  a  dose  range  of  25  to 1800 mg although in some Chinese and Japanese PK studies, the PK of telbivudine appeared to be less than dose-proportional in the upper range of the tested doses. Following multiple doses administration, steady-state was reached within 5 to 7 days. The mean value of terminal half-life after repeated administration was similar to that after single dose suggesting that the systemic clearance did not change after multiple dosing. The mean accumulation ratios were low i.e. 1 - 1.2 for Cmax and 1.2 - 1.5 for AUC. The inter-individual variability for Cmax and AUC of telbivudine was moderate around 30 % while the intra-individual variability was lower (10-20%). · Special populations Renal impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of telbivudine was assessed in a single dose study where subjects were assigned to the following doses administered on Day 1 depending of their degree of impairment: 600 mg (normal and mild impairment), 400 mg (moderate impairment), 200 mg (severe impairment), 200 mg either 2 hours before or within 2 hours after hemodialysis and opposite schedule on Day 8 (end stage renal disease). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (Clcreat 49 - 30 ml/min), the 600 mg normalized AUC048  h  was  equivalent  to  2  x  AUC0-24  h  from  the  normal  group.  In  subjects  with  severe  renal impairment (Clcreat &lt; 30 ml/min) the 600 mg normalized extrapolated AUC0-72 h was approximately equivalent  to  3  x  AUC0-24  h  from  the  normal  group  and  in  subjects  with  end  stage  renal  disease (hemodialysis)  the  600  mg  normalized  extrapolated  AUC0-96  h  was  4  x  AUC0-24  h  the  normal subjects.

Based on the results on dose-normalized telbivudine parameters of exposure, and pharmacodynamic considerations, dose adjustment through extending dosing interval of the recommended 600 mg dose was  proposed  i.e  600  mg  once  every  48  hours  (Clcreat  30  -  49  ml/min),  600  mg  every  72  hours (Clcreat &lt; 30 ml/min not requiring dialysis) and 600 mg once every 96 hours (ESRD). However these recommendations  are  not  based  on  results  from  patients  with  impaired  renal  impairment  receiving 600 mg dose. A warning has therefore been introduced in the SPC highlighting that the dose interval adjustment  might  lead  to  sub-optimal  exposure  in  some  patient  and  requiring  close  monitoring  of virological  response.  In  addition  applicant  committed  to  explore  with  an  oral  solution  under development possible daily dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

A parallel group study was conducted in 24 patients with normal or impaired hepatic function [Child Pugh  scores  of  5-6  (mild),  7-9  (moderate)  and  10-15  (severe)]  to  assess  the  impact  of  hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of telbivudine after oral administration of a single 600 mg dose. Results showed that the median Cmax and AUC values in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment were close to normal subjects. However there were three outliers identified (one per hepatic impairment group) on the basis of the criteria in the protocol with AUC value much higher to other patients. Further analysis showed that the increased exposure and decreased clearance seen in those  'outliers'  were  reflective  of  impaired  renal  function  that  is  often  associated  with  hepatic dysfunction. On the basis of these results, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment  if  they  present  adequate  renal  function.  More  information  will  be  obtained  postauthorisation  from  an  ongoing  phase  III  trial  (Study  NV-02B-011)  in  HBV-infected  patients  with decompensated liver diseases .

Co-administration of telbivudine (200 mg daily) with lamivudine (100 mg daily) increased the Cmax telbivudine  with  a  ratio  of  107  (90%  CIs  89-129).  The  ratio  for  AUC  was  106  (90%  CIs  92-123). Lamivudine  Cmax  decreased  on  co-administration  (ratio  86,  90%  CIs  71-104)  while  AUC  was unaffected  (ratio  99,  90%  CIs  87-112).  Although  the  study  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  relevant interaction, there is no information at a clinical dose of telbivudine.

Gender, weight, age, race Gender did not affect telbivudine pharmacokinetics, which was confirmed in the population PK. The effect of weight was not specifically investigated. In the population PK analysis, weight was not identified as a covariate influencing telbivudine clearance. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in elderly. Some data included from the population PK analysis suggest that age was not a covariate of PK parameters of telbivudine PK (19-76 years). No conventional pharmacokinetic study was designed to investigate the effect of ethnic origin in the pharmacokinetics of telbivudine. The population pharmacokinetic analysis identified that the race had an  effect  on  exposure  (~  20  %  decrease  in  telbivudine  exposure  in  Hispanic  versus  Caucasians, Africans, Chinese and Japanese ethnic groups) but this was considered not clinically relevant. Paediatric population There are currently no pharmacokinetic data in children or adolescents. Pharmacokinetics in target population Pharmacokinetics  of  telbivudine  in  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  were  assessed  after  repeated administrations of daily doses ranging from 25 to 400 mg and 800 mg. Based on the data available, the pharmacokinetics in HBV infected patients appears similar to that in healthy volunteers. Nevertheless further data on pharmacokinetics in HBV  HBeAg  positive infected patients receiving the recommended 600 mg dose will be provided post-authorisation. · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of telbivudine showing that elimination through metabolism is limited and that the main pathway of elimination as unchanged is via the kidney, a caution has been included  in  the  SPC  on  the  potential  co-administration  with  other  substances  that  may  affect  renal function.  In  addition  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  were  performed  to  establish  whether  telbivudine could interact either with other antivirals which share the same pathway of elimination or that could be co-administered  with  telbivudine  in  hepatitis  B  treatment.  In  addition,  a  study  was  performed  to evidence any interaction between the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin administered in transplant recipients and telbivudine.

In the telbivudine/pegylated interferon study, while the telbivudine PK 600 mg (as 3 x 200 mg tablets) was not affect by concomitant pegylated interferon alfa 2a (single dose 180 µg), the 90% CI for the Peg-IFN  parameters,  though  containing  100%,  fell  outside  the  pre-defined  80-125%  range  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

equivalence, likely due to the larger than anticipated inter-individual variability of Peg-IFN parameters (CV%: ~70% for Cmax and AUC) and small sample size in this study. Although the AUC and Cmax of Peg-IFN in combination with telbivudine were comparable to historical data (Modi et al 2000), the high inter-individual variability of the pegylated interferon pharmacokinetics makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusion in this field. Further interaction data derived from the clinical study investigating this combination therapy will be provided post-authorisation.

Co-administration of multi doses of telbivudine (600 mg) and adefovir dipivoxil (10mg) did not affect the PK of either compound: the 90% CIs for Cmax and AUC, for all studied agents were within the 80% to 125% target range. The  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  telbivudine  and  cyclosporin  A  appeared  to  be  unaltered following  multiple  dose  administration  of  telbivudine  in  combination  with  multiple  doses  of cyclosporine  A  (4  mg/kg/day  given  in  two  divided  doses).  The  mean  peak  and  AUC  whole  blood cyclosporin  values  were  higher  on  co-administration  with  telbivudine  and  the  90%  CIs  for  the comparison  of  Cmax  were  106-126.  Nevertheless,  given  the  potential  toxicity  of  telbivudine  and cyclosporin  on  the  muscle  a  pharmacodynamic  interaction  cannot  be  excluded.  A  warning  has therefore been included in the SPC. Preliminary  results  of  a  study  between  telbivudine  and  tenofovir  did  not  reveal  any  potential interaction. The final results will be provided as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled postauthorisation. There was no interaction between telbivudine (3 x 200 mg tablets) with an experimental nucleoside compound valtorcitabine (2 x 300 mg tablets). Pharmacodynamics · Mechanism of action As already mentioned in section 3.3, telbivudine is a selective inhibitor of HBV replication. Telbivudine resistance profile : Evidence of telbivudine resistance was firstly described in vitro studies and in clinical study NV-02B003 where M204I mutation was identified as the key determinant behind telbivudine resistance. A genotypic analysis was performed based on the sequencing and genotyping of virus sample in all patients  included  in  pivotal  phase  III  study  NV-02B-007  (described  under  the  main  study)  and  the sequencing of the virologic breakthrough patients identified in the study. Virologic breakthrough and treatment-emergent HBV  resistance was significantly lower for telbivudine  recipients  compared  to  lamivudine  recipients  in  both  the  HBeAg-positive  and  HBeAgnegative patient populations (table 1).

However, there was a concern about the definition of virologic breakthrough used to detect rebound (based  on  either  a  confirmed  HBV  DNA&gt;  5  log10  copies/ml  or  a  &gt;  1  log10  copies/ml  increase according  to  the  initial  virologic  response)  which  may  have  led  to  underestimate  the  emergence  of resistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant re-analysed the data using a revised definition of virologic breakthrough, as confirmed ≥ 1 log10 copies/ml increase in HBV DNA from nadir by PCR assay. Results of the new analysis shown in table 2 did not modify the study conclusions from the original analysis.

The applicant provided also the results of a resistance analysis based on patients without virological breakthrough but with detectable HBV DNA levels at Week 52. In this analysis an approximately 10% rate of emergence of resistance was observed at one year with no new mutation apart from the M204I. Analysis of resistance at 104 weeks The completed analysis of the final 2 years resistance data for NV-2B-007 is not yet available but the applicant provided a preliminary analysis of resistance at Year 2 using August 23, 2006 as the cut off date  (table  3).  This  analysis  took  the  patients  selected  from  the  unlocked  database  (as  meeting  the relevant  breakthrough  criteria)  and  focused  exclusively  on  examination  of  mutational  changes  at codon M204. Table 3: Preliminary Resistance (Viral Breakthrough with M204 mutation) Summary at Year Two 1 HBV DNA returns to &gt; 5 log10 copies/ml or within 1 log10 copies/ml of baseline and with M204 resistance mutation 2 HBV DNA returns to 1 log10 copies/ml above nadir and with M204 resistance mutation The resistance rates increased for both lamivudine and telbivudine treatment groups during the second year of treatment although there was a slightly lower resistance rate with telbivudine . The applicant committed to provide further data on resistance, including cross-resistance, as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. · Relationship between plasma concentration and effects An analysis performed in study NV02B-001 regarding plasma concentrations and effects on plasma HBVDNA. This is presented under the dose selection study section. A clinical pharmacology study (NV-02B-024) evaluated the effects of telbivudine on cardiac safety. In this  placebo-controlled  study,  the  effect  of  telbivudine  on  cardiac  repolarization  (QT/QTc  interval duration) in healthy volunteers was  evaluated at clinical (600 mg/day)  and  supra-therapeutic (1800 mg/day) telbivudine doses. No safety concerns have been identified. 1 In patients with a confirmed 1 log10 copies/ml decrease in HBV DNA from Baseline, Virologic Breakthrough defined as a confirmed ≥ 1 log10 copies/ml increase from nadir by PCR assay. 2 Results exclude breakthrough patients who have not been sequenced. 3 P-values for difference between proportions controlling for randomisation strata.

Table 4 Overview of the clinical trials Dose selection studies : The telbivudine dose selection was based on the results of 2 studies: -a  Phase  I/II  dose-escalation  study  NV-02B-001  investigating  the  telbivudine  doses  over  the range of 25 mg to 800 mg daily -a  one-year  Phase  IIb  dose-confirmation  study  NV-02B-003  that  examined  two  doses  of telbivudine 400 mg and 600 mg alone or in combination with lamivudine. There was two-year extension study of NV-02B-003 [study NV-02B-010]. Both studies were performed in HBeAg positive patients with no prior nucleosi/tide therapy. Study NV-2B-001 Telbivudine  was  associated  with  marked  anti-HBV  activity.  A  virological  response  ( ≥ 2  log10 decrease  from  baseline  in  HBV  DNA  at  Week  4)  was  obtained  in  34/35  [97%]  telbivudine-treated patients  compared  to  none  on  placebo.  The  median  and  mean  reductions  in  HBV  DNA  over  time showed a trend to increase with dose and were typically maximal at the end of treatment (Week 4), when median reductions (in log 10 copies/ml) were 2.50 in the 25 mg group, 2.68 for 50 mg, 3.19 for 100 mg, 2.89 for 200 mg, 3.63 for 400 mg and 3.75 for 800 mg. In contrast, the median reduction in the placebo cohort was 0.133 log10 copies/ml. The  relationship  between  telbivudine  dose  and  HBV  DNA  reduction  was  examined  by  an  Emax modelling  approach.  Telbivudine  exhibited  a  quantitative  exposure-viral  response  relationship  with about 3 log10 copies/ml reduction in serum HBV DNA at week 4 at the 200 mg/day dose and near maximum antiviral effects (3.5-4.0 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load) achieved with telbivudine doses of 400-800 mg/day. Study NV-02B-003 The antiviral effects of five oral antiviral treatment regimens were investigated: Group A: LdT-400 (telbivudine 400 mg/day). Group B: LdT-600 (telbivudine 600 mg/day). Group C: LAM-100 (lamivudine 100 mg/day). Group D: LdT-400/LAM-100 (telbivudine 400 mg and lamivudine 100 mg/day). Group E: LdT-600/LAM-100 (telbivudine 600 mg and lamivudine 100 mg/day).

This study enrolled 107 patients, predominantly Asian (86%), males (81 %) with a mean age of 37 years.  The  primary efficacy endpoint was HBV DNA area-under-the-curve (AUC) from Week 1 to Week 12, termed HBV DNA AUCMB (Weeks 1-12), expressed in log10 copies/ml, with the primary comparison being the results for the pooled 400 mg/day telbivudine dosing groups (Groups A and D) vs. the pooled 600 mg /day dosing groups (Groups B and E).

At week 104, the notable mean change from baseline in HBV DNA that was observed at week 52 was still  maintained  ranging  from  -5.3  to  -5.5  log10  copies/ml  in  the  telbivudine  600  mg  containing groups  (ITT  population)  compared  to  -3.8  log10  copies/ml  in  the  lamivudine  group.  In  the  PP populations, the same trend was observed.

At week 52, a notable mean change from baseline in HBV DNA ranging from -5.49 to -6.53 log10 copies/ml was observed in the telbivudine containing groups compared to -4.57 log10 copies/ml in the lamivudine group. The conclusion was similar when the analysis was stratified by baseline ALT level. Results were not significantly different between the pooled comparison of telbivudine 400 and 600 mg dose groups suggesting that the efficacy of the 600 mg telbivudine dose over the 400 mg telbivudine dose is not significantly greater. In addition, when considering the individual results for HBV DNA reduction, proportionally greater clearance was shown for all four telbivudine arms, compared to the lamivudine monotherapy group in each other AUCMB analysis (Week 0-Week 24 change and Week 0-Week 52 change). There  was  no  improvement  in  viral  load  reduction  (as  measured  by  AUCMB  methods)  with  the addition  of  lamivudine  to  telbivudine  (400  mg/day  or  600  mg/day)  compared  to  the  results  for telbivudine alone. Overall 21% of patients experienced at least one drug-related AE and the overall incidence of drugrelated AE did not differ significantly across the five treatment groups. Considering that the results could not exclude the modest (0.2 log10, ~40%) efficacy advantage for the 600 mg/day dose predicted by the Emax modeling of the Phase I/II trial data and that there were no apparent  dose-related  clinical  AEs  or  laboratory  abnormalities  in  the  Phase  IIb  trial,  the  applicant selected  the  600  mg/day  telbivudine  dose  to  conduct  the  pivotal  phase  III  trial  versus  lamivudine monotherapy (100 mg/day). The choice of 600 mg for the Phase III study which may be regarded as a conservative attitude, appeared acceptable. Study NV-02B-010 two-year extension of study NV-02B-003 Out of 104 patients enrolled in the [NV-02B-003] trial (ITT populations) 90 subsequently enrolled in the  [NV-02B-010]  two-year  extension  study,  which  corresponded  to  the  PP  populations.  The  prespecified  interim  analysis  after  104  weeks  of  treatment  (from  Baseline  in  [NV-02B-003])  was provided. The primary endpoint for this first interim analysis is the reduction of HBV DNA levels from Baseline to nominal Week 104. Medicinal product no longer authorised

By nominal Week 104, HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 38.1% of telbivudine recipients, 24.4% of patients on combination therapy, and 22.2% of lamivudine recipients. The proportion of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seroconverters increased over the second year of therapy in both telbivudine (31.0% to 38.1%) and combination (14.6% to 24.4%) groups from nominal Weeks 52 to 104. HBeAg seroconversion rates for patients receiving lamivudine therapy group did not increase over this time period.

At  Week  96,  fewer  patients  on  telbivudine  (20%)  experience  virologic  breakthrough  compared  to patients  on  lamivudine  (32%)  and  combination  therapy  (33%).  Results  are  nonetheless  difficult  to interpret because of the limited number of patients.

A  statement  has  therefore  been  introduced  in  the  SPC  highlighting  that  the  therapeutic  response observed  with  the  combination  telbivudine  and  lamivudine  was  lower  than  that  with  telbivudine monotherapy and therefore telbivudine is not recommended to be used with lamivudine. Main study NV-02B-007 METHODS This is an ongoing 104-week, phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, international clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of telbivudine to lamivudine. Study Participants The population targeted in this study was a mixed population of HBeAg-positive and -negative HBV infected patients. Eligible patients were aged 16-70 years and at the screening visit (up to 7 weeks pre-randomisation) had: - Documented chronic hepatitis B (CHB), defined by: · clinical history compatible with CHB · detectable serum HBsAg · HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative · ALT 1.3-10 x ULN · liver biopsy within 12 months prior to randomisation with histology compatible with CHB (five  unstained  formalin  fixed  slides  were  to  be  available  at  the  investigator's  site  prior  to randomisation). - Compensated liver disease - No  prior  nucleoside/nucleotide  analogue  therapy  at  any  time  and  no  interferon  alfa  or  other immunomodulators for at least one year before screening for this study. - HBV DNA ≥ 6 log10 copies/ml (by central laboratory COBAS Amplicor HBV Monitor assay) The most notable exclusion criteria were: - Co-infection with HCV, HDV, HIV-1 or HIV-2 - Any history/evidence of hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) -  Known  primary  or  secondary  causes  of  liver  disease  other  than  hepatitis  B  (except  Gilbert's syndrome and Dubin-Johnson syndrome did not exclude patients) - History of clinical pancreatitis Treatments Patients were randomised to receive telbivudine 600 mg (Group A) + or lamivudine 100 mg once daily (Group B). Treatments were to be taken in the morning without regard to food intake. Treatment discontinuation (without study discontinuation) was available (but not mandated) at week 52 or later if the patients met the criteria for virologic response: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- For HBeAg-positive patients at entry, the patient had exhibited loss of HBeAg for at least 24 weeks and the patient's HBV DNA level was &lt;5 log10 copies/ml.
- For HBeAg-negative patients at entry, the patients had to achieve confirmed HBsAg loss at or after Week 52 on two consecutive visits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These patients were to continue with normal study assessments and restart the same blinded therapy if they experienced a post-treatment disease relapse.

## Objectives

## The primary objectives were:

o

- o For those who did not attain HBV DNA suppression but achieved ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction this was defined as a return of HBV DNA to within 1 log10 copies/ml of baseline on two consecutive visits with no more than one subsequent level &gt;1 log10 copies/ml  below  baseline  or  a  single  HBV  DNA  level  within  1  log10  copies/ml  of baseline at the last treatment visit

 To  investigate  the  clinical  efficacy  of  telbivudine  and  lamivudine  in  adults  with  compensated HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB over two years (104 weeks).  To compare safety between the two treatments. The secondary objectives were:  To  assess  the  post-treatment  durability  of  the  virological  response  (loss  of  detectable  serum HBeAg with serum HBV DNA &lt;5 log10 copies/ml) in the subgroup with HBeAg-positive CHB.  To  compare  the  frequency  of  virological  breakthrough  during  two  years  of  treatment  and  its clinical correlates.  To characterise treatment-emergent HBV associated with virological breakthroughs. Outcomes/endpoints The primary efficacy variable was the therapeutic response defined as serum HBV DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/ml associated with either HBeAg loss or ALT normalisation at week 52. Other efficacy variables The main secondary endpoint was histological response was defined as at least 2-point reduction in the Knodell necroinflammatory score with no worsening in the fibrosis score. Other secondary efficacy variables included: -Magnitude of HBV DNA reduction -HBV DNA suppression to &lt;5 log10 copies/ml in patients with ≥ 6 log10 copies/ml at baseline -PCTR HBV DNA non-detectable (below LLOQ of 300 copies/ml) -ALT normalisation -HBe seroconversion (HBeAg positive only) -Virologic response (HBeAg positive only) defined as HBV DNA &lt;5 log10 copies/ml and HBe Ag loss -3-component HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg positive only) defined as HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA &lt;5 log10 copies/ml -HBsAg Loss and HBsAg Seroconversion -Treatment discontinuation due to efficacy (see above) -Treatment failure o Primary = after 24 weeks of treatment, HBV DNA never fell to &lt;5 log10 copies/ml for two consecutive visits after the start of study treatment Secondary = Week ≥ 24 ALT increases to 10 × ULN or is ≥ 2 × ULN for 16 weeks and HBV DNA is ≥ 6 log10 copies/ml or meets the definition of virological breakthrough · OR discontinuation for disease progression · OR discontinuation for lack of efficacy after Week 24 · OR discontinuation at a time when ALT ≥ 2 × ULN and HBV DNA is ≥ 6 log10 copies/ml or meets the definition of virological breakthrough Virological breakthrough o For those who attained HBV DNA suppression, this was defined as HBV DNA ≥ 5 log10 copies/ml on two consecutive visits with no more than one subsequent value &lt;5 log10 copies/ml or HBV DNA ≥ 5 log10 copies/ml at the last treatment visit.

- -Treatment-emergent  HBV  resistance  defined  as  virological  breakthrough  by  Week  48  with genotypic evidence of resistance-associated mutations in HBV DNA amplified from patient sera.

Liver biopsy samples were to be obtained pre-treatment and at Week 52 during treatment. Histology slides  were  scored  for  necroinflammatory  and  fibrotic  activity  using  the  Knodell  and  Ishak  scoring systems.

Sample size The sample size calculations were based on accruing at least 1200 patients, with at least 600 HBeAgpositive patients and at least 400 HBeAg-negative patients. For the therapeutic response endpoint, this sample  size  provided  99%  power  for  the  non-inferiority  claim,  with  an  assumption  of  a  15%  noninferiority  criterion,  and  92%  power  for  the  superiority  claim  if  the  response  rate  on  telbivudine  is 15%  better  than  lamivudine.  The  study  was  adequately  powered  overall  as  well  as  for  the  subpopulations of HBeAg positive and HBe-Ag negative separately at one year for the primary and the key secondary endpoints. Randomisation Randomisation was performed via an IVRS system to assign patients (1:1) to the two treatments. There was also stratification according to: ¾ HBeAg positive or negative ¾ ALT &lt;2.5 x ULN or ALT ≥ 2.5 x ULN Blinding (masking) This  study  was  to  be  performed  in  a  double-blind  manner.  There  was  an  external  Data  Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Statistical methods The primary analysis population for all non-inferiority and superiority tests of efficacy endpoints was the Intent-to-treat (ITT) ITT population. The secondary analysis population for all non-inferiority tests of efficacy endpoints was the Efficacy-evaluable (EE ) population. The Histological Response populations comprise all patients in the ITT population who had evaluable pre-treatment  liver  biopsies  =  the  modified  ITT  (mITT)  population  for  assessment  of  Histological Response. Patients from the EE population whose baseline liver biopsy had a Knodell HAI score &gt;3 = the modified EE (mEE) population for assessment of Histological Response. With  the  exception  of  the  criteria  for  treatment  discontinuation,  breakthrough,  HBV  resistance  and treatment failure, missing categorical data were to be excluded from the EE analyses (i.e., missing = missing)  and  treated  as  no  response  (i.e.,  missing  =  failure)  in  the  ITT  analyses.  For  the  efficacy parameters of virologic breakthrough, HBV resistance and treatment failure, the LOCF method was used for missing data in both the ITT and EE analysis. For missing continuous variables, the LOCF method was to be applied in the EE analysis and excluded in the ITT analysis. The primary analysis was to be conducted after all patients reached Week 52. There were no interim analyses planned or performed. A week 104 analysis will be used to assess longer-term efficacy. The  primary  efficacy  variable  (Therapeutic  Response)  and  the  key  secondary  efficacy  variable (Histological Response) were to be analysed according to a 3-step statistical procedure: 1)  Separate  statistical  analysis  performed  initially  for  both  HBeAg-positive  and  HBeAg-negative subpopulations Medicinal product no longer authorised

- 2) If statistical significance was not established within both the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg negative sub-populations,  statistical  test  treatment  group  interaction  between  the  two  HBeAg  subpopulations was performed

.

- 3) If there was no significant treatment interaction between the two subpopulations, a pooled statistical analysis for the overall population was performed. The procedure was to be used initially to test for non-inferiority. If this was successful it was to be repeated to test for superiority. A positive test for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

non-inferiority  required  the  confidence  interval  to  be  entirely  above  -15%.  A  positive  test  for superiority required the confidence interval to exclude 0%. The testing procedure outlined allows for an overall conclusion of non-inferiority or superiority but not for separate conclusions for each subpopulation.  The  non-inferiority  margin  of  15%  was  selected  by  referring  back  to  past  placebo controlled trials of lamivudine against placebo.

RESULTS At  the  time  of  the  submission  of  the  application,  52  weeks  results  were  provided  for  the  overall population as the basis for the efficacy assessment. Preliminary results at weeks 76 for a very limited proportion of the population enrolled were also submitted. Supplementary  data  on  the  long  term  efficacy  and  safety  (complete  76  weeks  results  as  well  as preliminary Week 104 results) were submitted, during the procedure. Participant flow Out  of  the  1367  patients  included  in  the  study,  the  ratio  was  approximately  70/30  %  in  favour  of HBeAg positive (921 randomised as HBeAg positive versus 446 as HBeAg negative). The disposition of patients is presented in table 5. Overall a large proportion of patients completed 52 weeks period. Of  the  37  ITT  patients  not  included  in  the  EE  population  (18  telbivudine  and  19  lamivudine)  the reasons were retrospective failure to meet the criteria for documented CHB, prior prohibited treatment for CHB, other causes of liver disease or non-compliance.

*Chinese, Korean, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Malay, and other Asian The vast majority of the population enrolled was Asian. Overall, 98 Caucasians patients included in the study have received telbivudine. With respect to HBV baseline characteristics, as expected in a majority of patients of Asian ethnicity, the majority of patients are infected with HBV genotypes B (26%) or C (51%). Within  each  of  the  HBeAg  positive  and  negative  groups  the  features  of  the  HBV-related  histories showed only minor differences between treatments. Most patients had an 'unknown' route of HBV transmission. HBeAg-positive  population  have  much  higher  pre-treatment  HBV  DNA  levels  than  the  HBeAgnegative population. Most  patients  enrolled  had  ALT  &gt;  2  x  ULN  but  almost  all  has  normal  albumin  and  bilirubin  at baseline. ALT data at baseline showed no notable differences between treatment of between HBeAg positive or negative. An overview of the baseline serologic markers and liver function parameters is presented in table 7. Medicinal product no longer authorised

the  lack  of  supporting  documentation  for  medical  histories  of  patients  (medical  history  were obtained by the patient verbal account). The number of patients who might potentially have not been naïve of antiviral is expected to be marginal since previously treated patients are expected to be well identified by the medical team. Moreover, since telbivudine monotherapy is not expected to  be  effective  in  resistant  patients,  this  is  not  expected  to  have  significantly  favoured  the telbivudine arm.

The number of patients with cirrhosis was low: 2.8% (37/1302) of patients enrolled with evaluable baseline  biopsy  had  cirrhosis  (Ishak  score  &gt;5).  Of  these,  21  patients  (3.2%;  21/651)  were  in  the lamivudine  treatment  arm,  and  16  patients  (2.5%;  16/651)  were  in  the  telbivudine  treatment  arm. When evaluated  by  HBeAg  status,  2.1%  (18/872)  of  HBeAg  positive  patients  had  cirrhosis,  while 4.4% (19/430) of HBeAg negative patients had cirrhosis. The majority of patients did not receive previous interferon therapy. Of the 5.9% of patients (HBeAgpositive) and 11.2% (HBeAg-negative) who were previously treated with interferon, most had failed on an efficacy basis, rather than an intolerance basis Recruitment Most  patients  were  enrolled  in  Asia  (62%),  North  America  (12%),  the  antipodes  (11%)  and  from Europe (15%). However, with 112 sites, the numbers enrolled by site were often very small (single digits). The largest contributors were China (27%), Hong Kong and Taiwan (both 8%). Conduct of the study There was no amendment to the protocol. Protocol deviations were infrequent (&lt;7%) across groups and generally similar between treatments except that four in the lamivudine group were censored after commencing adefovir. An inspection was performed at the EMEA request to assess the GCP standards in investigator sites in Thailand and China. This inspection was aimed at confirming the reliability of data in the submitted application for marketing authorisation. Overall, this inspection confirms that the study was performed in line with the GCP. Two significant issues were nevertheless detected: -the tendency of investigators to not notify the extreme value of laboratory abnormalities if they were not judged as clinically significant. However, given that Grade3/4 laboratory abnormalities were  recorded  and  discussed  in  the  CSR  (regardless  of  their  clinical  significance  and  their notification as an AE by the investigator) and given that both study arms were supposed to be similarly impacted due to the double blind design of the study, this could not be considered as a major issue in the interpretation of the safety results.

## Outcomes and estimation

The statistical  significance  for  therapeutic  response  at  week  52  was  not  established  in  both  HBeAg positive  and  HBeAg  negatives  subpopulation  so  the  statistical  test  for  treatment  group  interaction between both subpopulations was performed. The HBeAg  status interaction precluded any investigation of the efficacy results with a pooled analysis as planned in the protocol. The efficacy analyses  were  consequently  displayed  for  the  HBeAg-positive  and  HBeAg-negative  populations respectively as if two distinct studies had been performed. This is acceptable since HBeAg subgroups have now been established as 2 distinct disease entities.

Primary endpoint Week  52  results  on  the  primary  endpoint  displayed  in  table  9  showed  whatever  the  population analysed (ITT or EE), the non-inferiority of telbivudine over lamivudine, both for HBeAg- positive and -negative patients. When  testing  for  superiority,  results  showed  the  superiority  of  telbivudine  treatment  only  in  the HBeAg-positive group. Table 9: Primary efficacy endpoint (therapeutic response at week 52) *LdT was superior to LAM **Adjusted for multiple comparisons Across  ITT  and  EE,  analysis  results  confirmed  that  therapeutic  response  was  in  favour  of telbivudine  whatever  the  strata  (ALT&lt;2.5  and  ALT ≥ 2.5x  ULN)  although  it  appeared  somewhat better for patients in the high ALT/HBeAg positive and high ALT/HBeAg negative strata. Key secondary endpoints When  considering  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (virological,  biochemical  and  histological), consistent results were observed through the analyses that demonstrated either the non-inferiority of  telbivudine  versus  lamivudine  (with  a  trend  in  favour  of  telbivudine)  or  the  superiority  of telbivudine at week 52. Telbivudine achieved better histologic response than lamivudine as shown in table 10. Medicinal product no longer authorised

HBeg responses The better virological response is not translated into a higher rate of HBe seroconversion as compared with lamivudine as shown in table 13. Table 13: HBeAg loss and seroconversion at week 52 - ITT population *Treatment group differences controlled for randomization strata: difference between proportions When HBeAg loss by Week 52 is analysed by the degree of viral load reduction achieved, there is a clear association between greater suppression of viral load and likelihood of HBeAg loss. Almost half of the patients who achieved a viral load of &lt;300 copies/ml (undetectable per the assay used) achieved HBeAg loss compared to 3% of those with &gt; 4 log10 copies/ml at Week 52. Change in serum ALT There  was  no  statistical  difference  across  treatment  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  ALT normalisation (table 14) . Table 14: ALT normalisation - ITT population n/N (%) *Treatment group differences controlled for randomisation strata. **Patients with ALT &lt;1 x ULN at Baseline excluded from analysis Long term efficacy Analysis of maintained on-treatment response up to week 104 was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, therapeutic response, and for key secondary efficacy endpoints of HBV DNA undetectable, ALT  normalisation  and  HBeAg  loss.  Preliminary  results  showed  that  telbivudine  treated  patients exhibited higher degree of maintained responses on all the key efficacy measures examined (table 15) .

There are currently no sufficient data to allow assessment of the durability of off-treatment efficacy responses of telbivudine.

Ethnicity The influence of ethnicity on telbivudine pharmacokinetics was assessed in the population pharmacokinetic analysis already described in section II.1. Of the 363 subjects that provided data for the final model, 126 (34.7%) were Caucasian, 41 (11.3%) were of African descent, 105 (28.9%) were Hispanic/Latino, 66 (18.2%) were Chinese, 24 (6.61%) were Japanese and 1 (0.28%) was American Indian. The estimates of oral clearances (mean ± SD; l/hr) were 17.8 for Caucasians, 18.8 for those of African descendent, 20.9 for the Hispanic/Latinos, 17.8 for the Chinese, 17.4 for the Japanese and 19.4 for the American Indians. The applicant concluded that the pharmacokinetic variability of telbivudine was small and that the pharmacokinetic differences due to the ethnic and racial effects were relatively minor and not clinically relevant. The clinical pharmacology of telbivudine has been demonstrated to be ethnically insensitive, with comparable levels of systemic exposure at comparable dosing levels, in Asian  and  Caucasian  patients.  In  line  with  the  ICH  E5  guideline  pertaining  to  foreign  data,  the applicant concluded that telbivudine meets the ICH criteria for lack of ethnic sensitivity. Although quite large, the study NV-02B-007 was not statistically powered to assess treatment effects with patient subgroups such as ethnic subgroups. There was a concern that the clinical data derived from European/Caucasian patients were currently too  limited  (n=98  patients  treated  with  telbivudine)  to  properly  assess  the  benefit/risk  in  this population.  There  was  also  a  concern  that,  especially  for  HBeAg  negative  patients,  the  risk/benefit relationship might favour use of lamivudine over telbivudine. Within the HBeAg positive Caucasian patients,  therapeutic  response  in  the  lamivudine  group  (55.5%)  was  quite  similar  to  the  telbivudine group (59.5%) (difference 4% ; p=0.6735). However, in the HBeAg negative population, results for therapeutic response were close to statistical significance in favour of lamivudine (78.7%) compared with telbivudine (63.0%) (difference -15.8% ; p=0.0804) To provide further reassurance with regard to efficacy in HBeAg negative Caucasians preliminary 104 weeks results were submitted (table 16). The trend towards a lower therapeutic response observed in the 52 weeks report in the subgroup of HBeAg negative Caucasian patients was no longer apparent with the 104 weeks results. In line with the results on the overall population, the apparent superiority of telbivudine over lamivudine has also become true in this subgroup. As explained by the applicant, such a change was mainly driven by the results on ALT normalisation. Indeed, within the 52 weeks results, an unexpectedly high rate of ALT normalisation  was  observed  in  the  lamivudine  arm,  leading  to  a  superior  (composite)  therapeutic response in this arm, despite the better virologic response in the telbivudine arm. At week 104, the reverse was observed as regards the ALT normalisation, and as a consequence the superiority of telbivudine over lamivudine was achieved.

Finally it was observed that the therapeutic response for both telbivudine and lamivudine was lower in Caucasian patients than in Asian patients.

HBV genotype Genotypes B and mainly C are preponderant in Asian patients while genotype A, which is the more frequent in Europe, is included within the 'other' HBV genotype category. Table 17: Proportion of patients with results by genotype- ITT Population Week 52 HBV genotype  comparisons  showed  that  rates  for  therapeutic  and  histological  responses  and  ALT normalisation  were  similar  or  at  least  numerically  better  with  telbivudine  within  all  three  HBV genotype  groups  (B,  C  and  other)  in  the  HBeAg  positive  population  but  there  were  inconsistent patterns seen between treatments in the HBeAg negative group. Percentages achieving undetectable HBV DNA were consistently higher with telbivudine regardless of HBeAg status. The  CHMP  considered  that  the  limited  number  of  European/Caucasian  patients  was  a  concern  as regard to the under-representativity of 'European' genotypes such as A. Other analyses At the request of the CHMP, the applicant submitted the results using for the primary efficacy variable a  'Combined  Response'  endpoint  comprising  ALT  normalisation  (for  those  patients  with  elevated pretreatment  ALT),  loss  of  HBeAg  in  HBeAg-positive  patients  or  a  decrease  in  HBV  DNA  to  &lt;5 log10  copies/ml,  and  histologic  improvement  (defined  as  a  two  point  or  greater  improvement  in Knodell necroinflammatory score with no worsening in fibrosis) as now recommended in the CHMP 'Guideline for the Clinical Evaluation of Medicinal Products Intended for Treatment of Hepatitis B,'.

The  re-analysis  showed  that  telbivudine  retained  superiority  over  lamivudine  in  HBeAg-positive patients and non-inferiority in HBeAg-negative patients as shown in the table 18.

mEE 180/386 (46.4%) *Combined response rate is defined as ALT normalization and Histologic Response with either HBeAg loss or suppression of HBV DNA &lt;5 log10 copies/ml **missing data treated as failure Further  analyses  were  undertaken  using  the  EMEA  defined  Combined  Response  but  adjusting  the HBV DNA threshold to &lt;4, &lt;3 log10 copies/ml and &lt;300 copies/ml (undetectable), respectively. In HBeAg-positive patients, the difference in response rates between the two treatment arms widened as the threshold for HBV DNA reduction was lowered while always remaining statistically significant, demonstrating  the  superiority  of  telbivudine  over  lamivudine.  In  HBeAg-negative  patients,  the difference  between  the  two  treatment  arms  was  gradually  obliterated  as  the  HBV  DNA  criterion became more restrictive and the p value nears 1, showing that the two treatments are equally effective. The  results  of  the  logistic  multivariate  analysis  confirmed  the  predictive  relationships  of  baseline serum ALT and HBV DNA level and therapeutic response at week 52 in both HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients. For both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, greater reductions in HBV DNA (i.e. lower HBV DNA levels) at both Week 12 and Week 24 were highly predictive of increased likelihood of achieving Therapeutic Response at Week 52. HBeAg-positive patients who had achieved undetectable HBV DNA by Week 24 were approximately 18 times more likely to achieve Therapeutic Response than patients whose HBV DNA had not declined below 4 log10 copies/ml. Analysis using weeks 104 outcome demonstrated that week 24 remained a viable time point for assessing whether treatment was suboptimal  using  criterion  HBV  DNA  &gt;  4  logs  at  week  24.  This  has  been  included  in  the  SPC although the relevance of such criterion in making decision in treatment discontinuation needs to be further evaluated post-authorisation. Predictor of HBeAg seroconversion Univariate analysis was performed in order to examine the predictive effect of HBV DNA level at baseline on HBeAg seroconversion. This analysis showed that patients treated with telbivudine who had  a  baseline  HBV  DNA  level  &lt;10 8 copies/ml  had  a significantly  higher  rate  of  HBeAg seroconversion at week 52 compared to those patients who at baseline had an HBV DNA level &gt;10 10 copies/ml: 37.5% vs. 14.4%, respectively. Additionally, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to further examine the predictive effect of baseline HBV DNA on HBeAg seroconversion in  the  telbivudine  treatment  group.  The  logistic  regression  model  included,  in  addition  to  baseline HBV DNA, the following covariates: age, race, gender, weight, BMI, genotype, baseline serum ALT and  baseline  HAI  score  in  a  stepwise  selection  procedure  with  p=0.10  to  enter  and  stay.  Results showed baseline HBV DNA level and serum ALT to be the only significant (p&lt;0.01) predictors of HBeAg seroconversion, and HBV DNA &lt; 8 logs copies/ml to be the strongest predictor of response (odds  ratio=  4.65  vs  HBV  DNA  &gt;=  10  logs  copies/ml).  The  analysis  was  repeated  with  a  further refinement of cut off. Lower baseline HBV DNA level (&lt;9 log10 copies/ml) was again shown to be a strong  predictor  of  HBeAg  seroconversion  at  week  52  and  104.  The  odds  ratios  for  baseline  HBV DNA level &lt; 9 log10 copies/ml vs. ≥ 9  log10  copies/ml are 2.24 (p=0.0022) and 2.16 (p=0.0022) for week 52 and 104 respectively.

For baseline ALT level &lt;2 and 2-5 times ULN vs. &gt;5 times ULN, odds ratio was 0.222 and 0.494 respectively.

## Other populations

There are currently no available data on the efficacy of telbivudine in HIV co-infected patients, HCV or HDV co-infected patients, liver transplant recipients or children

## Clinical safety

Available  safety  data  were  collected  from  the  Phase  I/II  a  dose  finding  trial  (NV-02B-001),  the international  Phase  IIb  trial  (NV-02B-003),  and  the  follow-on  (NV-02B-010),  the  global  Phase  III (NV-02B-007 also called Globe. During the procedure, updates were submitted to provide additional safety data on telbivudine at the recommended dose of 600mg. · Patient exposure Safety  analyses  were  initially  based  on  data  from  1491  patients  treated  with  at  least  one  dose  of telbivudine.  Approximately  760  patients  were  treated  at  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of telbivudine (600mg/day). Overall, 743 patients were exposed to telbivudine 600mg once daily more than 52 weeks, 268 patients were exposed more than 76 weeks and 64 patients were exposed more than 104 weeks. Considering that 92% of the patients derived from the main study NV-02B-007 study and only 5% from  the  smaller  Phase  IIb  study  NV-02B-003  and  extension  phase  NV-02B-010,  the  applicant presented separately the data from these studies in order not to loose data from smaller studies. Safety updates included complete data up to week 76 (n=1243 patients) and additional partial data up to Week 104 (n=341 patients) for study NV-02B-007 as well as limited longer-term exposure data up to Week 156 for study NV-02B-003/NV-02B-010 (n=58). The applicant has also presented pooled data for week 52 data from the phase III Chinese study NV02B-015 in 336 patients. These did not raise any new concern and are not discussed here. Overall, up to  the  data  cut-off  of  this  safety  update  (i.e  1 st November  2005),  898  patients  were  exposed  to telbivudine 600mg once daily more than 52 weeks, 686 patients were exposed more than 76 weeks, 218 patients were exposed more than 104 weeks and 26 patients were exposed more than 156 weeks. Overall, the safety population included mostly Asian male patients. HBe Ag positive represent 65.4 % of patients in the telbivudine group and 66 % of patients in the lamivudine group. Caucasian patients represent only 15% of the main study population. · Adverse events Incidences  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  treatment-related  AE,  severe  Grade  3-4  AE,  death  and  serious adverse events (SAE) reported in the study NV-02B-007 from baseline to week 52, baseline to week 76  and  from  week  52  to  week  104  as  well  as  the  data  reported  during  study  NV-02B-003  (from baseline to week 52) and after week 52 in study NV-02B-010 (extension of the NV-02B-003 study) are presented in the tables below.

Only one death was reported in both studies and the number of patients with serious or severe adverse events  in  telbivudine  arm  remained  low  here  was  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  treatment-related adverse events in the telbivudine arm compared to the lamivudine arm. These data were confirmed by the complete week 76 data where a trend toward a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

telbivudine arm was also observed. In the lamivudine + telbivudine combination arm of study NV02B-003,  the  incidence  and  the  severity  of  adverse  events  were  not  increased  compared  to  the administration of both compounds separately.

## From week 52 to week 104 (second year of treatment):

In  pivotal  study,  the  incidence  of  any  adverse  event  reported  was  again  comparable  between  both treatment groups. There was a smaller rate of adverse events reported overall during the second year of treatment (around 40%) than the first year (around 70%) due to the decreasing number of patients with available data over the second year preventing from drawing reliable comparison of the safety profile between  the  one-year  period  and  the  second-year  period  of  the  study,  as  the  denominator  was  not adjusted over time. When comparing with data derived from the first year of treatment, a higher proportion of patients with  serious  adverse  event  was  reported  in  telbivudine-treated  patients  compared  to  lamivudinetreated patients although the absolute number remained low in both treatment groups. These data are in line with those reported during study NV-02B-003 (from baseline to week 52) and after  week  52  in  study  NV-02B-010 (extension of the NV-02B-003 study). Fewer patients reported AEs  in  the  third  year  of  treatment  than  in  previous  years  since  fewer  patients  contributed  to  data during the period. From baseline to week 52, AEs most commonly reported in the telbivudine treated patients were in the following system class categories infections and infestations (35%), gastrointestinal disorders (28 %) and general disorders and administration site conditions (19%). These findings are confirmed by final week 76 data. In  the  telbivudine  600mg  arm  of  study  NV-02B-003,  results  by  system  organ  class  were  overall similar  to  those  observed  in  main  study:  adverse  events  in  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders, infections  and  infestations  and  nervous  systems  disorders  were  the  more  commonly  reported  with percentages of 32%, 27% and 27% respectively. Interim long term data: ¾ From Week 52 to Week 104 Study NV-02B-007: Again, the most frequently reported adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection (6.0% in the telbivudine arm and 4.5% in the lamivudine arm) and blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) increased (3.8%  in  telbivudine  arm  and  3.1%  in  lamivudine  arm).  All  adverse  events  were  well-balanced between both treatment groups and were in line with the distribution of adverse events reported during the  first  year  of  study.  However,  as  already  mentioned  these  data  do  not  concern  the  totality  of included patients and should therefore be taken with caution. Study NV-0B-010: The nature of AEs that were observed in the second year of Phase II treatment was similar to that observed  in  the  first  year  of  treatment.  One  patient  in  the  telbivudine  group  and  2  patients  in  the combination group experienced blood CK increased compared to none in lamivudine group. ¾ After week 104 Medicinal product no longer authorised

From  limited  data  derived  from  nominal  week  104  to  nominal  week  156  of  study  NV-02B-010,  a higher proportion of patients experienced adverse events in telbivudine treatment arm (36.4%) versus in the LAM treatment arm (15.8%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequent adverse events  occurring  in  greater  than  1%  of  telbivudine-treated  patients  with investigator attributability of treatment from baseline to Week 52 is displayed in table 21.

Table 21

Up to week 76 safety data confirmed the baseline to week 52 safety (notably, CK increased related to treatment were again twice reported in telbivudine group compared to lamivudine group (6.3% versus 3.6% respectively). From  week  52  to  week  104,  9.4%  of  telbivudine  patients  and  8.9%  of  lamivudine  treated  patients experienced  adverse  events  possibly  or  reasonably  related  to  treatment  by  investigator.  Treatmentrelated blood CK increased were reported in 3.1% of patients in telbivudine group (n=21) and in 1.9% of patients in lamivudine group (n=13). ¾ Study NV-02B-003 The  adverse  events  most  frequently  attributed  to  telbivudine  600mg  in  study  NV-02B-003  were fatigue (9.1%), headache (13.6%) and dyspepsia (4.5%) ¾ Study NV-02B-010 The  adverse  events  more  frequently  related  to  telbivudine  600mg  in  study  NV-02B-010  (nominal week 104 to nominal week 156) were ALAT increased (4.5%, n=2), ASAT increased (2.3%, n=1); HBV DNA increased (2.3%, n=1) and exacerbation of hepatitis B (2.3%, n=1) A preliminary analysis did not show any relation-ship between dose or duration of telbivudine therapy and an increase of incidence of adverse events. The data derived from the second year of the pivotal study and data from studies NV-02B-003 and NV-02B-010 confirmed these findings. In relation to demographic characteristics, adverse events were proportionally higher with older age, among women and in Caucasian patient compared to Asian patients. Moreover, prior Week 24 ALT Flares are more common in HbeAg-positive patients than in HbeAgnegative patients. A  more  detailed  analysis  showed  that  the  differences  observed  in  terms  of  incidence  of  AEs  in telbivudine  arm  between  Caucasian  and  Asian  people  are  mainly  related  to  the  following  adverse events: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In study NV-02B-007 baseline to week 52, serious adverse events were attributed to treatment in only four  patients  =  1  patient  in  lamivudine  group  (grade  2  urticarial  rash)  and  3  patients  in  telbivudine group concerning musculoskeletal disorders and have led to study drug discontinuation or interruption (a grade 2 myopathy, a Grade 1 elevated CK and a Grade 3 elevated CK).

-

In study NV-02B-003, there was one case of possible treatment-related neuropathy with asymptomatic CK elevation in the telbivudine 600mg + lamivudine group leading to treatment discontinuation. Longer-term data after 52 weeks from both studies did not show an increase of incidence of serious adverse events with telbivudine. Overall, no relationship of SAE or other significant adverse events to dose, duration of therapy with telbivudine or lamivudine was evident. There were some differences in frequency of adverse events in function of HBeAg status (SAE being slightly more frequent in the BeAg-negative patients (6% in LAM group and 3.8% in LdT group in HbeAg-negative patients compared to 4.2% in LAM group and 2.0% in LdT group in HBeAg-positive patients)).  Caucasians  had  higher  incidence  rates  of  SAEs  than  Asians.  In  addition  there  were proportionally more adverse events in women than men in the main study. So far no death has been attributed to telbivudine. Two events of special interest have been identified in the telbivudine development programme: -ALT  flares since  these  phenomena  are  a  well-recognized  complication  of  all  HBV  antiviral agents and represent an important safety issue in the management of chronic HBV infection -CK  elevations since  these  abnormal  laboratory  values  were  more  commonly  reported  in telbivudine arm than in lamivudine arm. ALT flares: Overall, up to Week 52, ALT flares occurred in about 13% of patients during study NV-02B-007 and were  globally  more  frequently  reported  in  lamivudine  treated  patients  than  in  telbivudine-treated patients (13.1% versus 10.3%). The results showed that: -ALT flares occurred more frequently in HBeAg-positive patients than HBeAg-negative patients whatever the treatment assignment and they occurred predominantly during the first 24 weeks of the study. -None of ALT  flares occurring before Week  24 was associated with sign of hepatic decompensation (such as bilirubin elevations). -There was a slight trend toward a higher percentage of ALT flares in telbivudine arm during this period but this was mainly related to mild-to moderate ALT flares. -The Grade 3 or 4 ALT flares during the first 24 weeks of the study appeared to be correlated to high post baseline HBV DNA reductions (&gt;4 log10 copies/ml or reduced to PCR-non detectable levels) Between the  second  period,  from  week  24  to  week  52,  ALT  flares  occurred  predominantly  in lamivudine treated patient whatever the HBeAg status. The number of patients under LdT therapy experiencing an ALT flares during this period remained low (n=4). -Three  patients  in  lamivudine  group  had  severe  ALT  flares  associated  with  bilirubin  elevations during this period Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -Overall, the majority of patients with grade 3 or 4 ALT flares occurring after the first six months of treatment failed to achieve PCR non- detectable HBV DNA levels or HbeAg loss at week 52 or had virologic breakthrough.

A time to onset of 4-5 weeks for the occurrence of on-treatment ALT flares was identified

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From  week  52  to  week  76,  the  incidence  of  ALT  flares  was  still  higher  in  lamivudine  recipients (3.9%) compared to telbivudine recipients (2.6%) but the difference tended to be reduced, mainly in HBeAg-positive  patients.  Two  HBeAg-positive  patient  in  telbivudine  arm  experienced  ALT  flares associated with bilirubin elevations, a marker of hepatic decompensation.

During the second year of treatment (week 52 to 104) based on November 11, 2006 cut-off, the rate of patients who experienced ALT flares (Grade 1-4) became lower in the telbivudine group compared to lamivudine group: 29 (6.5%) versus 39 (8.6%) in HBeAg positive patients and 5 (2.1 %) versus 20 (8.6 %) in HBeAg negative patients.

An analysis of the relationship between on-treatment ALT flares at year 2 and breakthrough/resistance in HBeAg positive patients indicates that: -At year 2, approximately 19% (and 20%) of LdT-treated patients had resistance to telbivudine (or virological breakthrough) compared to 31% (and 33%) in the lamivudine group. -Among  patients  who  had  resistance  and/or  virological  breakthrough,  an  ALT  flare  was developed  by  approximately  23  -25%  of  LdT-treated  patients  compared  to  16  -17%  of lamivudine-treated patients. Data derived from Study NV-02-010 support a higher incidence of ALT flares in lamivudine-treated patients and a small number of patients who developed these phenomena among patients receiving telbivudine. In the telbivudine monotherapy arm in this study, a total of 5 among 44 patients (11%) experienced ALT flares from baseline to Week 104 versus 6 patients among 19 in the lamivudine arm (31.5%). Overall, three patients discontinued study treatment due to ALT flares (2 LAM patient and 1 LdT patient). After week 104, 5 out of 31 patients in the telbivudine arm (16.1%) versus 1 out of 7 patients in the lamivudine  arm  (14.3%)  had  an  on-treatment  ALT  flares.  None  was  associated  with  bilirubin elevations.  Although  the  comparison  should  be  made  with  particular  caution  due  to  the  limited number  of  patients  in  lamivudine,  these  findings  are  overall  in  line  with  those  observed  from  the Globe  study  i.e.  there  is  a  trend  toward  an  increase  in  ALT  flares  in  the  HbeAg-positive  patients receiving  telbivudine  during  the  second  year  of  the  study.  This  should  be  confirmed  when  the complete week 156 of study NV-02B-010 and complete week 104 of study NV-02B-007 will become available. Off-treatment or post-treatment ALT flares were reported in 8 patients on telbivudine in studies NV02B-007, NV-02B-003/010 compared to 5 patients in lamivudine group. The telbivudine-treated patient with off-treatment ALT flare had a time-to onset of three months and a half.  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  off-treatment  ALT  flares,  it  remains  difficult  to estimate a delay for the occurrence of off-treatment ALT flares. Overall,  the  majority  of  off-treatment  and  post-treatment  ALT  flares  occurred  in  HbeAg-positive patients and were not associated with criteria of severity. CK elevations: A higher incidence of CK elevations in telbivudine-treated patients was consistently reported across studies and in particular in the pivotal study NV-02B-007.

With respect to clinical feature, the majority of patients with Grade 3-4 or Grade 1-2 CK elevations were  asymptomatic  with  no  particular  clinical  symptoms  reported.  However,  fatigue  appeared  the more commonly reported adverse among patients experiencing CK increased. Moreover, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia and neck pain were all more frequently reported in patients with Grade 3 or 4 CK elevations  than  in  patients  without  Grade  3-4  CK  elevations.  After  week  52  to  week  104,  these findings were confirmed. Although CK elevations were often reported without any specific symptoms, there was one case of a possible telbivudine-induced-myopathy.

Although there was high inter and intra variability in  baseline  CK  levels,  the  higher  incidence  and severity of CK elevations in telbivudine group observed in this study were of concern. Table 23 1 On-treatment value worsened from baseline to Grade 1 to 4 during therapy up to Week 52 2 Grading system corresponds to the 2004 version of the DAIDS AE grading table. *Two patients on telbivudine had study drug interrupted, while three patients had study drug discontinued Although  a  re-analysis  of  the  Treatment-Emergent  CK  Abnormalities  in  Patients  with  Chronic Hepatitis  B  by  Week  52  using  the  updated  DAIDS  Toxicity  Scale  defining  Grade  1  to  4  for  CK elevations (December 2004 instead 1992 in the initial application), showed that the number of Grade ¾  CK  elevations  appears  less  important  in  both  treatment  groups,  the  results  confirmed  that  these events occurred more frequently in the telbivudine arm. Data  from  supportive  study  NV-02B-003  support  these  findings  with  higher  median  CK  levels  at Week 52 in telbivudine arm or LdT+LAM combination arm. Post-week 104 to week 156 data from study  NV-02B-010  were  also  in  line  with  those  previously  discussed.  Three  patients  in  LdT  arm versus  none  in  LAM arm  experienced  a Grade 3-4 CK elevations after week 104 in this study (17 patients (38.6%) and 1 patient (5.3%) respectively for Grade 1-2 CK elevations). These are incomplete data  precluding  to  draw  final  conclusion  on  the  safety  profile  of  telbivudine  in  the  third  year  of therapy. With respect to time to onset, these CK elevations occurred predominantly after six months of therapy and appeared to generally decrease spontaneously despite the treatment continuation. After 52 weeks, there was a slight decrease of incidence of CK increased followed by a stabilisation period up to week 104. Based on baseline to week 52 data, Grade 3 or 4 CK elevations of 14% of patients in telbivudine arm were not resolved up to week 52 and 54.4% were only decreased to grade 1-2. This was confirmed by post  week  52  data  where  60%  of  telbivudine  patients  who  experienced  Grade  3-4  CK  increase returned to Grade 1-2. Only 14% resolved to normal value.

Another  serious  case  of  polymyositis  attributed  to  telbivudine  in  study  NV-02B-015  (Phase  III  in Chinese patients).

The possible mechanism behind CK elevations and muscular toxicity related to telbivudine has not been  elucidated.  According  to  data  up  to  week  52  from  the  pivotal  study,  patients  treated  with telbivudine are at 2.29 times (95% CI, 1.34, 3.92) greater risk for Grade 3/4 CK elevations compared to those patients treated with lamivudine. A preliminary analysis of risk factors for Grade 3-4 creatine kinase  elevations  by  logistic  regression  showed  higher  baseline  CK,  younger  age,  and  non-Asian ethnicity were associated with a higher risk of a Grade 3/4 CK elevation. The influence of Caucasian race was observed however in both treatment groups.

In  study  NV-02B-007, 27.6% of telbivudine treated patients had grade 1-4 amylase elevations, and 21.5% had grade 1-4 lipase elevations. Of these, only a small percent were grade 3/4, namely 0.3% for amylase and 1.9% for lipase. A higher percent of patients in lamivudine group than telbivudine group reported grade 1-4 amylase elevations, 29% and grade 1-4 lipase elevations, 25.0%. Of the amylase elevations  in  lamivudine  group,  0.4%  were  grade  3/4  and  3.8%  of  lipase  elevations  were  grade  ¾.

With  respect  to  class  effects  of  nucleoside  analogues,  so  far  no  case  of  lactic  acidosis  has  been observed with telbivudine, only one patient in NV-02B-003 receiving telbivudine in combination with lamivudine discontinued the treatment due to possible drug-induced neuropathy of mild intensity and one serious adverse event of pancreatitis was reported in the telbivudine arm. Patients in the telbivudine treatment group (n=55, 8.1%) and lamivudine treatment group (n=47, 6.8%) developed  on-treatment  adverse  events  that could  represent manifestations of hypersensitivity reactions.  In  the  telbivudine  treatment  arm,  there  were  72  (8.1%  of  patients)  treatment-emergent adverse  events  that  might  have  represented  hypersensitivity  reactions.  The  majority  of  these  AEs manifested as rash (n=36) and urticaria (n=7). A  clinical  pharmacology  study  (NV-02B-024)  evaluated  the  effects  of  telbivudine  at  clinical (600 mg/day)  and  supra-therapeutic  (1800 mg/day)  telbivudine  doses  on  cardiac  safety.  No  safety concern has been identified. · Other laboratory findings Overall,  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  52  of  all  measured  haematology  parameters  in  study NV-02B-007  were  limited  and  no  noticeable  differences  between  lamivudine  and  telbivudine treatment groups were observed. Hematology parameters from study NV-02B-003 confirm the data of the pivotal study. The clinical chemistries abnormalities are summarised in the table 24: Table 24: Clinical chemistries - change from baseline to Week 52- Nv-02B-007 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Elevations of amylase and lipase were not associated with clinical pancreatitis, except in one patient, in whom the mild pancreatitis was thought to be unrelated to treatment.

Grade 3 AST or ALT elevations were defined as &gt; 3-10 x the baseline value and a grade 4 elevation as &gt;10 x the baseline value.  As requested by CHMP, the applicant reanalysed data on AST and ALT definitions  using  the  AIDS  table  for  grading  severity  of  these  laboratory  values  (i.e.,  Grade  3  is defined as &gt;5 but &lt;10 x ULN and Grade 4 is defined as &gt;10 x ULN). These data showed that, from baseline to week 52, Grade ¾ ALT abnormalities (11.6% for LAM arm and 11.2% for LdT arm) and AST abnormalities (6.0% for LAM arm and 4.6% for LdT arm) were observed in similar frequency in both treatment groups.

## Risk Management Plan

· Safety in special populations There are no safety data pertaining to the use of telbivudine neither in paediatric nor in elderly. This is adequately reflected in the SPC. In patients with renal impairment no specific safety concerns emerged attributed to telbivudine. In patients with hepatic, impairment, no specific safety concerns emerged. The safety of telbivudine in patients with decompensated liver disease is currently unknown as well as in HIV co-infected patients, and liver transplant recipients. · Pregnancy Twenty  pregnancies  have  been  reported  in  female  patients  in  the  clinical  trials  (12  patients  were included in the pivotal study NV-02B-007) and 24 pregnancies have been reported in partners of male patients (15 from pivotal study). From the exposed pregnancies for which an outcome is available, no pregnancy in the telbivudine groups has resulted in a congenital abnormality. No conclusion can be drawn on the safety of telbivudine in pregnant female patients or in partners of male patients based on the available data. · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions An analysis of adverse events for the most commonly prescribed concomitant medications reported in patients taking these medications in study NV-02B-007 did not raise any particular concern. · Discontinuation due to adverse events In study NV-02B-007, the incidence of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was low and comparable between both telbivudine and lamivudine treatment group (2.8% in each group); the most common AE leading to discontinuation or interruption in the LdT group was blood creatine phophokinase increased with a total of five patients who stopped study drug due to this adverse event. 5.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory  way.  At  the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a few minor unresolved quality issues, which do not have any impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. These will be addressed as part of the followup measures to be addressed post-authorisation.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Telbivudine is a nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV polymerase. Telbivudine showed an antiviral  activity  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  models  compatible  with  clinical  use  for  the  treatment  of hepatitis B. Safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any effect of telbivudine on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems. The  toxico-pharmacokinetics  of  telbivudine  has  been  adequately  studied.  At  high  oral  doses, toxicokinetic results showed a non-linear relationship between the dose and the exposure suggesting that it would have been difficult to obtain animal exposures higher than the one obtained in the studies. From  a  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view  the  results  from  non-clinical  studies  may  therefore  be considered valuable. The  toxicity  of  telbivudine  was  correctly  evaluated  in  standard  toxicological  studies.  Telbivudine produced  little  or  no  toxicity  and  no  target  organ  could  be  clearly  identified.  Telbivudine  was  not genotoxic in appropriate models and telbivudine did not show any carcinogenic potential. Telbivudine crossed the placenta in rats and was found in milk of lactating animals. No evidence of a direct toxic effect of telbivudine was seen in standard tests of reproduction toxicology. Considering these  data  and  the  lack  of  data  in  pregnant  women  and  on  excretion  in  human  milk,  the  SPC recommends that telbivudine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and that women should not breastfeed. Telbivudine did not induce cytotoxicity; myelosuppression, mitochondrial toxicity have all produced negative  results.  Additionally,  LdT  triphosphate  was  shown  to  have  low  affinity  for  human  DNA polymerase α , β and γ . Telbivudine represents a low environmental risk. Efficacy The  pharmacokinetics  profile  of  telbivudine  is  characterised  by  a  rapid  absorption,  low  binding  to plasma  proteins,  excretion  primarily  via  renal  route. There  is  no  food  effect  on  telbivudine bioavailability  and  therefore  telbivudine  can  be  taken  regardless  of  food  intake.  Although  the pharmacokinetics profile of telbivudine in hepatitis B infected patients does not seem to differ from healthy  volunteers,  patients  did  not  receive  the  recommended  dose.  Further  data  will  therefore  be provided post-authorisation to further substantiate the steady state pharmacokinetics in patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Because  telbivudine  is primarily renally excreted  unchanged,  renal  impairment  may  increase telbivudine  exposure.  Therefore  for  patients  with  moderate  (creatinine  clearance  30-49  ml/min)  or severe renal impairment (Crcl&lt; 30 (not requiring dialysis) or end stage renal disease), dose adjustment through extending dosing interval is necessary as reflected in the SPC. Because the recommendations are not based on results from patients with impaired renal function receiving 600 mg dose, a warning has been included in the SPC to closely monitor virological response in patients with renal impairment receiving telbivudine with increased dosage interval. The  applicant committed  to pursue its exploration  for  a  daily  dose  adjustment  with  an  oral  solution  under  development.  No  dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment. The use of telbivudine in patients with hepatic  impairment  will  be  further  substantiated  by  the  planned  phase  III  study  in  patients  with decompensated liver disease, the results of which will be provided post-authorization.

Since telbivudine is not a substrate, inducer and inhibitor of CYP450 isoenzymes or other transported, the interaction potential is low. No interaction was observed with lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir and an experimental nucleoside analogue (valtorcitabine) all excreted renally via active tubular secretion, nonetheless  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  there  may  be  interaction  with  other  substances  undergoing active  renal  secretion  as  highlighted  in  the  SPC.  Although  no  significant  interaction  was  evidenced between  telbivudine  and  pegylated  interferon-alfa  2a,  the  high  inter-individual  variability  of  the pegylated interferon pharmacokinetics makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusion in this field and further  data  derived  from  the  clinical  study  investigating  the  combination  therapy  will  be  provided post-authorisation. Although there was no significant interaction between telbivudine and cyclosporin, given the potential toxicity of telbivudine and cyclosporin on the muscle, a warning has been included in the SPC.

The  re-analysis  of  the  efficacy  data  using  the  endpoint  recommended  in  the  CHMP  Guideline confirmed  the  results.  Nonetheless  the  superiority  of  telbivudine  did  not  translate  into  higher seroconversion in HBeAg positive patients. Baseline ALT&gt; 2ULN and baseline HBVDNA &lt; 9 log copies/ml were associated with higher rates of seroconversion.

The  choice  of  the  600  mg  dose  recommendation  based  on  dose  finding  studies  and  modeling  is considered acceptable. Although the clinical programme has been initiated prior to the CHMP guideline on anti-hepatitis B therapy, it is in line with the spirit of the guideline. The  demonstration  of  the  efficacy  of  telbivudine  relies  mainly  on  study  NV-02-B007  (also  called Globe) an ongoing 104-week, phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, international clinical trial  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  telbivudine  (600  mg/day)  to  lamivudine  (100 mg/day).  This  study  is  performed  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  compensated  liver disease who had no prior nucleoside/nucleotide analogue therapy and had received no interferon alfa or other immunomodulators for at least one year. The study included both HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients, which are now considered as 2 distinct  disease  entities,  but  a  stratification  by  HBeAg  status  was  planned  and  study  results  were finally  analysed  separately  in  each  population  subgroups.  The  randomisation  was  also  stratified  by ALT level (&lt; or &gt; 2.5XULN) known to have an impact on treatment response. Week 52 results on the primary combined endpoint [virological (HBV DNA &lt; 5 log10 copies/ml) and serological (HBeAg loss) or biochemical response (ALT normalisation)] demonstrated: -the  superiority  of  telbivudine  treatment  in  the  HBeAg-positive  group  (ITT  analysis  75.3  % versus  67  %  CI95.68%  =  [2.4%;  14.2%],  p=0.0047  and  EE  analysis  77  %  versus  67.1  % CI95.68% = [4.0% ; 15.9%], p=0.007) --and the non-inferiority (point estimate in favour of telbivudine) of telbivudine treatment in the  HBeAg negative group compared to lamivudine treatment (ITT analysis 75.2 % versus 77.2%    CI95.68%  =  [-10.2%  ;  6.1%],  p=0.6187  and  EE  analysis  76.3  %  versus  80.8  % CI95.68% = [-12.3% ; 3.3%], p=0.2461). With respect to the main secondary endpoint, histological response defined as &gt; 2 point decrease in the Knodell  Necroinflammatory  score  from  baseline  with  no  worsening  of  the  Knodell  Fibrosis  score, telbivudine was superior to lamivudine in HBeAg positive patients (71% versus 61%) and non-inferior in HBeAg negative patients (71 % versus 70 %). When considering the other secondary efficacy endpoints (virological, biochemical and histological), consistent results were observed through the analyses that demonstrated either the non-inferiority of telbivudine versus lamivudine or the superiority of telbivudine at week 52.

Preliminary  104  weeks  results  showed  that  telbivudine  treated  patients  exhibited  higher  degree  of maintained responses on all the key efficacy measures examined in both HBeAg positive and negative patient populations.

The  population  enrolled  in  this  study  mainly  consists  of  Asian  patients.  The  European/Caucasian population was limited (98 patients exposed to telbivudine). Based on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the drug, telbivudine did not display ethnic sensitivity according to the ICH-E5 guideline on foreign data. However there was a concern that in the sub-group of European/Caucasian HBe Ag negative patients the efficacy results suggested that it would be better for these patients to receive lamivudine than telbivudine. In addition the CHMP considered that the limited number of European/Caucasian patients was a concern as regard to the under-representativity of  'European' genotypes such as A. Additional 104 weeks results showed that the trend towards a lower  therapeutic  response  observed  in  the  52  weeks  report  in  the  sub-group  of  Hbe  Ag  negative Caucasian  patients  was  no  longer  apparent.  In  line  with  the  results  on  the  overall  population,  the apparent superiority of telbivudine over lamivudine became also true in this sub-group. Such a change was mainly driven by the results on ALT normalisation.

There are currently no data to support the use of telbivudine in children but the applicant undertook to complete the development programme in this population.

Although such a concern was solved, it remained that the data to support the use of telbivudine in European/Caucasian patients were limited at this stage. The population enrolled was mostly of Asian origin and the 'European' HBV genotypes were under-represented (most commonly HBV genotypes were B (26%) and C (51%)). The applicant was therefore requested to further substantiate the efficacy of telbivudine in Caucasians/Europeans by conducting a clinical study, for which the proposed design is to be validated by the CHMP before the study initiation. The  study  enrolled  only  a  limited  number  of  patients  with  cirrhosis  (3  %)  and  therefore  adequate warnings for the use of telbivudine in these patients have been introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics. With respect to resistance in vitro data and data from the main study identified M204I mutation as the key  determinant  behind  telbivudine  resistance.  Cross-resistance  has  been  observed  with  anti-HBV nucleoside analogue. Virological breakthrough (confirmed &gt; 1 log 10 copies/ml increase from nadir PCR assay at  week  48)  accounted  for  5.9  %  in  telbivudine  versus  15.3  %  in  lamivudine  group  in HBeAg positive and 2.3 % versus 12.5 % in HBeAg negative respectively. HBV resistance at week 48 accounted for 5 % for telbivudine versus 11 % for lamivudine in HBeAg positive and 2.3 % and 11.2 % in HBeAg negative patients respectively. The applicant undertook to provide further resistance/cross-resistance data as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled post-authorisation. The  optimal  treatment  duration  is  currently  unknown.  Patients  who  achieved  HBV  DNA  &lt;  3  logs copies/ml  by  week  24  had  optimal  responses  to  treatment.  The  applicant  committed  to  provide additional data from ongoing/planned studies, as part of the follow-up measures to be fulfilled postauthorisation, looking particularly at the some efficacy issues such as baseline predictors of favourable response,  baseline  predictor  of  HBeAg  seroconversion,  predictive  efficacy  outcome  by  HBV  DNA level at week 24 to detect suboptimal responders, durability of HBeAg-seroconverters off treatment. Currently the demonstration of efficacy of telbivudine is limited to HBeAg positive and negative adult patients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. To address for the deficiencies of the evaluation  of  efficacy  of  telbivudine  in  wide  range  of  populations  as  recommended  in  the  CHMP Guideline, the applicant committed to provide post-authorisation results of planned or ongoing studies in other populations such as HIV-HCV co-infected, patients with decompensated liver disease. In addition in order to better evaluate the optimal use of telbivudine, the applicant will provide postauthorisation studies looking at comparing its efficacy with newer anti-HBV treatment (e.g adefovir dipivoxil  and  entecavir)  at  its  use  in  combination  therapy  (e.g  adefovir,  lamivudine,  pegylated interferon alfa2a) and switching from lamivudine to telbivudine.

## Safety

Safety analyses are based on data on over 1,500 patients who have received the recommended dose of telbivudine. The main data derived from study NV-02B-007 and the majority of patients are Asian and HBeAg-positive male patients. Caucasian subjects represent only 15% of the key study population . The most commonly adverse reactions associated with telbivudine reported in Globe study were blood creatine phosphokinase increased, fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, diarrhoea, rash, ALAT/ASAT increased, blood amylase and lipase increased.

Caucasian  patients  and  other  ethnicities  were  more  at  risk  to  develop  adverse  events  and  serious adverse  events  than  Asian  patients,  especially  fatigue,  headache  and  blood  creatine  kinase  (CK) elevations. With respect to CK elevations: Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4 CK increased were reported in 60.1% and 7.5% of patients in the telbivudine arm versus 36.1% and 3.1% in the lamivudine arm from baseline to week 52. Complete week 76 data and interim week 104 data supported these observations. These CK elevations  occurred  predominantly  after  six  months  of  therapy  and  appeared  to  generally  decrease spontaneously despite the treatment continuation. However, up to week 52, a percentage of 14% with Grade 3-4 CK elevations did not resolve at the time of the last visit recorded. After week 52, there was a trend toward a stabilisation of incidence of CK elevations. There is a lack of association between a CK  elevation  and  specific  clinical  symptoms.  High  baseline  CK  level  and  Caucasian  race  were identified as potential predictor of CK grade 3 or 4 elevations. A warning has been included in the SCP to recommend a close monitoring of muscle related adverse events and the applicant committed to further investigate the mechanism behind CK elevations. With  respect  to  ALT  flares,  on-treatment  ALT  flares  were  observed  less  frequently  in  telbivudinetreated subjects (10.3%) compared with lamivudine-treated subjects (13.1%). These on-treatment ALT flares occurred more frequently in HBeAg-positive patients than HBeAg-negative patients whatever the  treatment  assignment  and  they  occurred  predominantly  during  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study. Before week 24, they appeared to be correlated to high post baseline HBV DNA reductions and no sign of hepatic decompensation was reported. During the 2 nd year  of  treatment, (week 52-0104), 29 (6.5 %) telbivudine treated HBeAg positive patients experienced ALT flares (Grade 1-4) compared to 39 (8.6 %) with lamivudine. For HBeAg negative patients these figures accounted for 5 (2.1%) versus 20 (8.6%) respectively. Virological breakthrough was associated with a slightly greater proportion of ALT flares in telbivudine treated patients compared to lamivudine. The number of patients who experienced off-treatment and post-treatment ALT flares is too limited to draw  any  conclusion  however  a  warning  on  the  monitoring  of  the  hepatic  function  after  stopping treatment has been included. Regarding  pregnancy,  given  the  potential  for  foetal  exposure  the  applicant  committed  to  register telbivudine  into  the  Antiretroviral  pregnancy  registry  to  identify  proactively  the  safety  profile  of telbivudine in pregnancy. From the safety database adverse reactions reported with telbivudine in the clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. All the information has been appropriately translated into the package leaflet for which a user test has been adequately performed. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.1 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical experience is limited to nucleosi(ti)de-naïve HBeAg positive and negative adult patients with compensated liver disease, mostly patients of Asians origin and infected with HBV genotypes B and C.

Based on the clinical efficacy, safety and resistance data of telbivudine, which were overall superior in HBeAg positive and comparable in HBeAg negative patients to lamivudine, the benefit risk ratio of telbivudine  is  considered  positive.  As  the  experience  in  Caucasian  is  very  limited,  the  applicant committed  to  conduct  a  study  comparing  telbivudine  to  adefovir  in  HBeAg-negative  Caucasian patients to reinforce the benefit/risk in this population. In addition the applicant committed to provide additional  data  post-authorisation  to  address a number  of  clinical  questions  related  to  the  use  of telbivudine in the management of hepatitis B infected patients (e.g baseline predictors of favourable response,  combination  therapy,  durability,  resistance  emergence)  and  in  certain  populations  (e.g HIV/HBO co-infected patients, decompensated patients, children). The chronic nature of hepatitis B virus therapy and long-term disease outcomes are such that clinical trials do not fully address longterm risk of HBV  therapy. A  Risk Management  Plan  was  submitted and includes agreed pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance to investigate further some  of  the  safety  concerns.  The  main  safety  concern  associated  with  telbivudine  is  creatine phosphokinase elevations requiring a close monitoring of muscle related adverse events as recommended in the SPC. Due to the nature of the disease, telbivudine therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Sebivo  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  in  adult  patients  with  compensated  liver  disease  and evidence  of  viral  replication,  persistently  elevated  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis. See section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics for details of the study and specific patient characteristics on which this indication is based.'
