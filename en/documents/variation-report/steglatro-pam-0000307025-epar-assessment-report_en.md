## 1. Introduction

On 15 October 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Steglatro (MK-8835P059/B1521066), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The MAH informed the EMA that, further to this Article 46 submission, a separate Type II variation application is planned to update the product information based on the results of study MK-8835P059/B1521066 (also known as P059) to expand the indication of ertugliflozin to children 10 years of age and older.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study MK-8835-P059/B1521066 (also known as P059): 'A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in Paediatric Participants (ages 10 to 17 years, inclusive) with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus' is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

No new study formulation was developed or used for P059. Paediatric participants received ertugliflozin for investigational use, which is identical in formulation to the commercially available ertugliflozin for adults.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

In accordance with Article 46 of Commission Regulation (EC) NO 1901/2006, the MAH is submitting herewith a final study report summarizing the results of paediatric study MK-8835-059 (also known as P059) for Steglatro (ertugliflozin) 5 mg and 15 mg, film-coated tablets.

In the EU, ertugliflozin is approved for adults for T2DM. Study P059 is a Phase 3, multicenter, doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in paediatric participants with T2DM on a stable dose of metformin ≥1500 mg/day with or without stable insulin. Study P059 was performed to evaluate ertugliflozin as an alternative therapeutic treatment option for paediatric patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control on metformin with or without insulin. Study P059 was part of the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for Steglatro.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

MK-8835-059 - A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in Paediatric Participants (ages 10 to 17 years, inclusive) with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

## Description

Study MK-8835-P059/B1521066 (also known as P059) was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in pediatric participants from 10 years and above, with T2DM on a stable dose of metformin ≥1500 mg/day with or without stable insulin.

A total of 166 pediatric participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either ertugliflozin 5 mg or placebo. At Week 12, participants in the ertugliflozin 5mg group whose A1C was ≥7.0% (or A1C ≥7.0% and FFSG ≥110 mg/dL if on 5 mg ertugliflozin + insulin) were rerandomized 1:1 to either continue ertugliflozin 5 mg or uptitrate directly to ertugliflozin 15 mg. Participants in the placebo group were mock titrated maintain the blind. See Figure 1.

The primary efficacy objective was to compare the effect of ertugliflozin with placebo on the change from baseline in A1C at Week 24. The primary safety objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin over 24 and 54 weeks. General safety and tolerability assessments were conducted including prespecified AEs of interest (e.g. symptomatic hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, genital mycotic infections (gender specific), and UTIs). Sparse sampling to assess PK of ertugliflozin and confirm exposure were also performed.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The overall study design and the duration of the study are considered adequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

The study included pediatric participants 10 years and above, with a diagnosis of T2DM for ≥ 2 years or for &lt;2 years with a fasting Cpeptide value &gt;0.6 ng/mL; A1C ≥6.5% and ≤10.0%; BMI ≥85th percentile; who were on a stable dose of metformin with or without insulin for ≥8 weeks.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are overall considered adequate for recruiting a study population representative for the patient population and for a possible future treatment population. It is noted that according to inclusion criteria, all participants had background medication. For adults, ertugliflozin is indicated for treatment as monotherapy and as addition to other diabetes medications. If a blood glucose lowering effect of treatment with ertugliflozin as monotherapy in the future can be assumed for children will be a matter of the indication which will be applied for in, and the assessment of, the future Type II variation envisaged to be submitted by the MAH.

## Treatments

## Investigational product

At Day 1/Randomisation, all qualified participants were randomized to receive 2 tablets per day, of either:

- Ertugliflozin 5 mg and placebo matching ertugliflozin 15 mg OR -
- Placebo matching ertugliflozin 5 mg and placebo matching ertugliflozin 15 mg

At week 12 a second randomisation took place. Eligible participants in the ertugliflozin 5-mg group t reated with ertugliflozin 5 mg: FS A1C ≥7.0% (53 mmol/mol) or treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg and insulin: FS A1C ≥7.0% (53 mmol/mol) an d FFSG ≥110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) were randomised to receive 2 tablets per day of either:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Ertugliflozin 5 mg and placebo matching ertugliflozin 15 mg OR -
- Ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo matching ertugliflozin 5 mg.

Eligible participants in the placebo group underwent a mock second randomization to maintain blinding, with no change in study medication. Participants who did not meet the threshold(s) for a second randomisation continued ertugliflozin 5 mg/placebo.

If a participant discontinued study medication before Visit 5/Week 12, the second randomisation was not performed.

## Prior and concomitant medication

Metformin (as background) and insulin (as background or rescue/intensification therapy when appropriate) are the only AHAs permitted in the study. Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria, such as medications for weight loss and hyperthyroidism or other SGLT2 inhibitors, were not allowed during the study.

## Rescue medication and glycemic intensification during Phases A and B of the study

Criteria for initiation of rescue medication in Phase A is presented in Table 1. Insulin was used as rescue. Participants on metformin alone who meet glycemic rescue criteria should initiate insulin glargine (dose at the investigator's discretion based on accepted local, national or international guidelines). Participants already on insulin (i.e. on metformin + insulin) should increase the insulin dose by ≥15%.

Table 1 Criteria for initiation of rescue medication in Phase A

| Time in Study                 | FFSG Thresholds for Rescue   | FPG Thresholds1.2         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Day 1 through Week 6          | >240 mg/dL (13.33 mmol/L)    | >240 mg/dL (13.33 mmol/L) |
| After Week 6 through Week 12  | >225 mg/dL (12.50 mmol/L)    | >225 mg/dL (12.50 mmol/L) |
| After Week 12 through Week 18 | >200 mg/dL (11.11 mmol/L)    | >200 mg/dL (11.11 mmol/L) |
| After Week 18 through Week 24 | >180 mg/dL (10.00 mmol/L)    | >180 mg/dL (10.00 mmol/L) |

FFSG = fasting fingerstick glucose; FPG = fasting plasma glucose.

The initial FFSG value will trigger a repeat FFSG measurement(s). An FPG measurement will be triggered when FFSG values meet rescue criteria for 3 consecutive days, and rescue will be initiated if the FPG is above threshold

Perform confirmatory FPG (central and local lab) if FFSG value is greater than the defined threshold on 3 consecutive days (after assessing for study medication compliance).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For patients not rescued in Phase A, there is an option of intensifying glycemic control in Phase B if high blood glucose levels. Glycemic intensification criteria are shown in Table 2.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The rescue criteria, and the use of insulin as rescue medication are acknowledged.

## Objectives

The primary efficacy objective of the study was to compare the addition of ertugliflozin with the addition of placebo on the change from baseline in A1C at 24 weeks. For safety investigation, the primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin over 24 weeks and 54 weeks.

## The secondary objectives included

## Rapporteur's comment:

The primary efficacy endpoint was c hange from baseline in A1C at 24 weeks between ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) and placebo.

Primary safety endpoint consisted of Safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin over 24 weeks and 54 weeks measured as AEs and discontinuation of study medication due to AEs.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on FPG at Week 24 for ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) versus placebo and changes from baseline within-group (ertugliflozin and placebo) on HbA1c and FPG at week 54.

The endpoints are acknowledged as clinically relevant.

## Sample size

The actual study size was 166 participants randomised, 111 for ertugliflozin and 55 for placebo. When planning the study, sample size was originally planned to be approximately 150 participants with 50 participants in the placebo group and 100 participants in the ertugliflozin group (ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups combined). Assuming that 90% of participants will have data at Week 24 on study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

medication, the sample size would provide at least 84% power to detect a between-group difference in A1C change from baseline at Week 24 of 0.6% given a standard deviation of 1.1% under the TP estimand with RD imputation given a 2-sided alpha=0.05. Under the TE estimand using the cLDA method, the planned sample size provides 82% power assuming the difference in A1C change from baseline at Week 24 is 0.6% using a standard deviation of 1.1% and missing data due to discontinuation from study medication or censoring due to initiation of glycemic rescue or intensification is at most 20%. According to the supplemental statistical analysis plan, the study size was revised to 165 participants, with 55 in the placebo group and 110 participants in the ertugliflozin group.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

After screening at visit 1, a screening period between visits 1 and 2, and an approximately 1 w singleblind placebo run-in period between visits 2 and 3, the eligible participants were, at visit 3, randomised 2:1 to receive oral, double-blind 5 mg ertugliflozin or placebo. Randomisation was stratified according to the following factors collected at Screening Visit/Visit 1:

1. Age: 10 to 14 years of age OR 15 to 17 years of age
2. Insulin use: Yes OR No

At Visit 5/Week 12, eligible participants in the ertugliflozin 5 mg treatment group underwent a second randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on ertugliflozin 5 mg or up-titrate to ertugliflozin 15 mg. Similarly, eligible participants in the placebo group will be mock-titrated to maintain the blind.

Eligibility for the second randomization was defined as having a:

- finger-stick A1C ≥7.0% (53 mmol/mol) for participants treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg or
- finger-stick A1C ≥7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and FFSG ≥110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) for participants treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg and insulin.

Randomisation at Visit 5/Week 12 was stratified according to Insulin use: Yes OR No .

Participants who do not meet the threshold(s) for a second randomization will continue on ertugliflozin 5 mg/placebo. Also, to maintain the blind, all participants were treated with a placebo matching the 15 mg ertugliflozin tablet from start, which at w 12 was changed for ertugliflozin 15 mg or kept, according to the second randomization.

If a participant discontinues study medication before Visit 5/Week 12, the second randomization was not performed.

## Statistical Methods

For the primary hypothesis, analyses were made both using treatment policy (TP) estimand (estimating the difference in change from baseline comparing the effect of being randomized to ertugliflozin versus placebo) and Treatment Effect (TE) estimand (estimating the effect of being treated with ertugliflozin versus placebo).

Efficacy analyses were performed in the Full analysis set (FAS) population, defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. All 166 randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study medication and no participants were excluded from the FAS population. The primary analysis approach for the TP estimand evaluated the treatment difference via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with missing Week 24 A1C data imputed using a retrieved dropout (RD)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approach. The primary analysis approach for the TE estimand evaluated the treatment difference via a constrained longitudinal analysis model.

Tippning point sensitivity analysis and subgroup analyses were made of the primary endpoint change from baseline in A1C (%).

The key secondary hypotheses were assessed only under the TP estimand and tested in accordance with the multiplicity strategy. All other secondary and tertiary endpoints were assessed only under the TE estimand.

For multiplicity the following was stipulated: if the success criterion for the primary hypothesis (H1) is met under the TP estimand, then hypotheses H2 will be tested at alpha = 0.05. If H2 is successful then H3 will be tested at alpha = 0.05. The type 1 error rate for the Bayesian methodology addressing the primary hypothesis under the TP estimand was estimated via simulation to be 0.10.

Safety analyses were based on the All patients as treated (APaT) population, which included all 166 randomised participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication.

The primary approach for all efficacy and safety analyses will pool participants from both ertugliflozin dose groups (5 mg and 15 mg) for comparison with placebo. In addition, A1C change from Baseline at Week 24 will be compared for 2 treatment strategies, (1) dose- optimized ertugliflozin versus placebo and (2) ertugliflozin 5 mg versus placebo. Dose- optimized ertugliflozin consists of participants who were randomized to ertugliflozin and either did not meet the re-randomization criterion at Week 12 or who met the re- randomization criterion and were re-randomized to ertugliflozin 15 mg. Descriptive statistics will be used for efficacy and safety endpoints to summarize ertugliflozin data by dose group and by combined doses. Descriptive statistics will also be used to summarize the individual ertugliflozin dose arms in the subset of participants who were re-randomized at Visit 5/Week 12.

## Pharmacokinetics

Sparse predose PK samples were collected at 3 protocol-specified visits (Visit 4/Week 6, Visit 5/Week 12, and Visit 6/Week 24) to assess ertugliflozin exposure. To support the second randomization at Visit 5/Week 12, which allowed eligible participants to increase their dose from 5 to 15 mg, a protocol specified interim analysis (IA) for PK data was conducted. The IA was performed by an unblinded PK analyst external to the Sponsor after 35 participants received study medication (23 on ertugliflozin and 12 on placebo) and results were provided to the eDMC. The median dose-normalized predose exposures observed in the PK population were evaluated against the predefined threshold of 2 ng/mL/mg. Based on this evaluation, the eDMC concluded that the second randomization was appropriate and supported dose escalation to 15 mg for eligible participants.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 273 participants were screened and 166 were randomised. The majority of non-randomized participants were screen failures, with non-eligible A1C values being the most common reason for screen failure For participant disposition, see Table 4. In brief:

- Ertugliflozin: 111 treated, 105 completed treatment, 6 discontinued treatment, 106 completed study, 5 discontinued study

- b Up-titration is applicable only to the ertugliflozin 5 mg group from the original randomization (participants randomized to placebo do not get re-randomized at Week 12, regardless of their FS AlC).
- c Per the protocol, participants with FS A1C &lt;7.0% at Week 12 were not eligible for re-randomization.
- d This participant's FS A1C was collected 8 days prior to the re-randomization date, which was outside the window used for this table.
- c This participant's FS AlC result was not captured in InForm.
- f Includes one participant whose Week 12 FS A1C was incorrectly entered as mmol/mol instead of % with a numericalvaluemeetingtheAlCcriterionforup-titration.

## Rapporetur's comment:

111 participants were randomised to the active treatment group. At week 12, 51 participants met the FS A1C criterion for possible uptitration (≥7.0%) , of which 25 were re-randomised to uptitration and 26 were re-randomised to stay on the 5 mg treatment. In the placebo group 36 participants had A1C ≥7.0% but according to the protocol, they were mock-randomised to maintain the blind.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted at 104 centers in 22 countries ( Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudia Arabia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the US). The first participant´s first visit was on 08 -OCT -2019 and last participant´s last visit on 11-APR-2025.

## Baseline data

Demographic and patient and disease baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the ertugliflozin and placebo groups. See Table 6 and Table 7.

A total of 41% of participants were male, the most commonly reported race was white (59.6%), and 43.4% of participants were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age of participants was 14.8 years old; 41.4% were ≤14 years old. The population was obese (mean BMI 31 .5 kg/m2, mean BMI percentile 95.6%) with central obesity. At screening, all participants were taking metformin with a mean dose of 1717.4 mg; 44.0% were on metformin + insulin. The mean A1C was 8.0% and mean FPG was ~144 mg/dL at baseline in both groups. The majority of participants in both groups had T2DM for ≥1 year. See Table 7.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Subjects in the active treatment (ertugliflozin) group and the placebo group had a median age of 14,7 years and 15,1 years, respectively (1017 years). Mean BMI at screening was 31,3 and 31,7, respectively ( 18,2 - 64,0) kg/m 2 in the active treatment group and the placebo group, respectively. The groups are considered well balanced with respect to age and BMI. The percentage of females were slightly higher in the active treatment (ertugliflozin) group (61,3) than in the placebo group (54,5). This is not considered to have an impact on study results.

The active treatment group had a mean duration of disease (T2DM) of 2,5 (0,3-9,1) years and a median duration of 1,9 years. The placebo group had slightly higher mean duration of 2,8 (0,1 -14,0) years and median duration 2,4 years. The mean A1c at screening was well balanced between the groups: the ertugliflozin group, 8,0 ( 6,1 to 11,2) %, compared to the placebo group 8 ,0 (6,3 to 10,6) %. In both groups, 44 % of the participants had insulin treatment in addition to metformin at screening.

Overall, the ertugliflozin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to demographic and disease characteristics, reflecting a possible future intended population.

## Number analysed

A total of 273 participants were screened and 166 were randomized: 111 for ertugliflozin and 55 for placebo. See Table 2. All randomised participants received at least one dose of study drug. The Full analysis set (FAS) population, defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication, therefore consisted of all randomised participants. The All patients as treated (APaT) population also included all 166 randomised participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication.

## PK results

Sparse predose PK samples were collected to assess ertugliflozin exposure and to support the study design of uptitrating eligible participants to 15 mg during the second randomization at Week 12. An interim PK analysis was performed after 35 participants received study medication (23 on ertugliflozin and 12 on placebo). The median dose-normalized predose ertugliflozin concentration was 0.92 ng/mL/mg across all visits, which was below the predefined threshold of ≤2 ng/mL/mg. Consequently, the decision was made by eDMC to proceed with the second randomization and increase the ertugliflozin dose to 15 mg for eligible participants.

Across treatment groups, predose ertugliflozin plasma concentrations showed dose- dependent increases and remained stable over visits, indicating steady-state was reached by Week 6. Median concentrations for the 5mg group were 5.11, 5.23, and 7.09 ng/mL a t Weeks 6, 12, and 24, respectively, while the 15mg group had a median concentration of 17.49 ng/mL at Week 24, approximately 3 -fold higher than the 5-mg group at the same time, see Table 8 .

The median dose-normalized plasma concentrations were consistent across Weeks 6, 12, and 24 for the 5-mg group (1.02, 1.05, and 1.42 ng/mL/mg, respectively) and were largely similar at Week 24 for the 15mg group (1.17 ng/mL/mg). The dose -normalized median predose values at each visit are shown in Figure 2. Taken together, these results indicate linear PK in pediatric participants with T2DM.

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy endpoint

Success criteria for the primary hypothesis tests were achieved for both the TP and TE estimands at Week 24. Under the TE estimand: The LS mean reduction from baseline A1C at Week 24 was significantly greater in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group (0.68%, p =0.007). See Table 9.

Results from the tipping point sensitivity analysis of the change from baseline in A1C (%) support the results of the primary analysis based on the TP estimand. The results of the post hoc frequentist sensitivity analysis of LS mean change from baseline in A1C using only the data from this study showed a similar treatment effect mean estimate and interval bounds as the tipping point approach (0.76%, p=0.003). See Table 13.

Results from sub-group analyses (baseline A1C, gender, race, ethnicity, age, insulin use, and geographic region) of A1C change from baseline at Week 24 for TP and TE were generally consistent with those from the primary analyses by estimand. See Figure 4.  A summary of the sub-group analysis results at Week 54 is provided in Table 14.

## Rapporteur's comment

Primary endpoint was met. The LS mean reduction from baseline A1C at Week 24 was significantly greater in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group (0.68%, p =0.007) . Sensitivity analyses supported the primary endpoints. The participants were stratified based on Age: 10 to 14 years of age OR 15 to 17 years of age and based on Insulin use: Yes OR No .

Sub-group analyses showed greater reduction in A1C for the sub-group of participants 1517 years than for the younger group. Participants with insulin use at screening showed greater A1C reduction than those without. These findings seem in line with what would be expected since patients with insulin and older patients are assumed to have more advanced diabetes and thereby possibly more easily gain from treatment with ertugliflozin.

## Key secondary endpoint

Key secondary efficacy hypotheses were assessed only under the TP estimand and tested in accordance with the multiplicity strategy. All other secondary and tertiary endpoints were assessed only under the TE estimand. Under the TP estimand, the LS mean reduction from baseline in A1C at Week 24 was significantly greater in the dose-optimized ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.66%, p=0.021). See Table 15.

Under the TP estimand, the LS mean reduction from baseline in A1C at Week 24 was significantly greater in the ertugliflozin 5-mg group than in the placebo group (0.86%, p=0.001). See Table 16.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 54

The treatment effect observed for the combined ertugliflozin group relative to the placebo group in A1C at Week 24 persisted at Week 54 (treatment difference: 1.03%, p=0.003). See Table 17 and Figure 5. Results of analyses of change from baseline over time and summary descriptions of change from baseline in A1C at Week 54 were similar to A1C results at Week 24.

Analyses of change from baseline over time and summary descriptions of change from baseline in FPG at Week 54 were similar to FPG results at Week 24.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Key secondary endpoints consisted of change from baseline in A1C for the dose-optimized ertugliflozin group and for the ertugliflozin 5-mg group, respectively, compared to placebo. Both groups showed significantly greater reduction from baseline in A1C than placebo at week 24, thus supporting the results of the primary endpoint.

For the other secondary endpoints, results also supported the primary endpoint results. The c hange from baseline on A1C at week 54, FPG at Week 24 and FPG at Week 54 for ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) showed greater reduction than the placebo group.

As the MAH has informed that a type II variation application for extension of indication is planned to be submitted, explorative endpoints will be assessed and discussed in this future Type II variation report.

## Safety results

Safety analyses were performed on the All participants as treated (APaT) population, which consisted of all 166 participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Safety analyses were performed in weeks 24 and 54. All analyses used the combined ertugliflozin group (5 mg and 15 mg) compared with the placebo group, with the exception of adjudicated ketoacidosis, which was reported by treatment arm.

The mean duration of exposure to ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg was 300.6 and 266.8 days, respectively. The mean duration of exposure to placebo was 346.2 days. The mean duration of exposure in the individual ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo group reflects the re-randomization from ertugliflozin 5 to 15 mg at Week 12 for participants who met glycemic criteria.

The incidences of AEs were generally comparable across treatment groups through Week 54, see Table 20.

AEs were reported for 64.0% of participants in the combined ertugliflozin group and 76.4% in the placebo group. Drugrelated AEs were reported in 11.7% of participants in the combined ertugliflozin group and 3.6% in the placebo group. SAEs were reported fo r 4 participants (all in the combined ertugliflozin group). No SAEs were considered to be drug-related by the investigator. One participant, in the placebo group, discontinued study medication due to an AE. No participants died. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were in the ertugliflozin 5-mg dose group. No meaningful

differences in AE summary measures were observed through Week 54 relative to Week 24. No AEs related to acceptability or palatability with study medication were reported in the study.

## Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events

The incidence of AEs by SOC were generally similar in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups at Week 54, see Table 21 . The 95% CIs for the between -group differences in incidences of AEs included 0 for all SOCs, see Figure 6. The incidences of specific AEs were generally similar in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups. The most frequently reported (≥10%) AE in both treatment groups was hypoglycemia at Week 54. At Week 54, pyrexia was the only specific AE that occurred at a higher incidence (95% CI for the between -group difference in the incidence excluded 0) in the combined ertugliflozin group (7.2%) than in the placebo group (0.0%). Headache, polyurea, gastritis, and rash were also reported more frequently in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group, but the 95% CIs for the between -group differences included 0. The specific AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (95% CI for the between -group difference in the incidence excluded 0) in the placebo group were musculoskeletal chest pain and anxiety. The results were similar for AEs at Week 24 and Week 54.

## Serious Adverse Events and Other Clinically Meaningful Adverse Events

There were no deaths due to AEs reported in this study. SAEs were reported for 4 participants in the combined ertugliflozin group and none in the placebo group through Week 54, see Table 23. The SAEs reported were COVID-19 pneumonia, post procedural infection and foot and tibia fracture (in the same participant), hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia. None of these SAEs were considered related to study medication by the investigator. The foot fracture was the only SAE that was reported through Week 24.

## Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events

One AE, in the placebo group, led to discontinuation of study medication through Week 54 and none at Week 24.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's comment:

The AE profile, in terms of overall frequency and incidence and types of AEs, was similar in the combined ertugliflozin group and the placebo group through Week 54. AEs were reported for 64.0% of participants in the combined ertugliflozin and 76.4% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported AEs (≥10.0%) in both groups were hypoglycemia and upper respiratory tract infection. Pyrexia was the only specific AE that occurred at a higher incidence in the combined ertugliflozin group (7.2%) versus the plac ebo group.

For the combined ertugliflozin group, a higher incidence of AEs considered drug-related by the investigator. The most frequently (&gt;2.0%) reported drug -related AEs in the combined ertugliflozin group were hypoglycemia (2.7%) and polyurea (2.7%).

Four SAEs were reported for the combined ertugliflozin group, compared to zero for placebo. None of the SAEs were considered drug-related by the investigator. One participant in the placebo group discontinued study medication due to an AE. No deaths were reported.

In general, the AE information does not give rise to safety concerns in the population studied.

It was however considered worth looking into the fact that the SAEs hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were considered not related to study medication. Narratives for these two cases were assessed and brief information as follows:

Hypoglycaemia case: A female participant on insulin and metformin at study start. At day 10 a nonserious mild hypoglycaemia caused by skipped, delayed, or small meal/snack. Background insulin dose was adjusted multiple times during the study. Study medication was uptitrated to 15 mg at day 86. Day 189 metformin was increased from 1000 mg daily to 1500 mg. On Day 262 the participant was hospitalised due to severe hypoglycaemia, presenting with altered consciousness and a home glucometer reading of 55 mg/dL. No preci pitating factors were identified by the investigator. The participant was treated with glucose. The investigator considered hypoglycaemia not related to study medication. Hypoglycemia resolved after 12 hours with no new episodes of hypoglycaemia during hospitalization. On Day 263 insulin doses were reduced, and the participant was discharged. No action was taken with study medication in response to the event. Repeated events (14 events) of moderate hypoglycaemia (nonserious), which were treated with glucose or no treatment reported, occurred from day 265 to day 287. During this period, insulin and metformin doses were adjusted. For some of these events precipitating factor was reported as insulin use. On Day 288 study medication was discontinued due to the hypoglycaemia discontinuation criteria, with the last dose administered on Day 276. The participant agreed to continue in the study off study medication.

Events of hypoglycaemia were reported on 8 separate days from day 289 to day 321, i.e. after having stopped study medication.

Hyperglycaemia case: A male participant not on insulin at study start. On Day 232 the participant experienced polyuria, polydipsia, and weakness; no change in compliance or the dose of metformin or study medication was reported. On Day 233 the participant was admitted to the hospital due to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

moderate dehydration. Laboratory test results showed increased glucose, while other parameters were unremarkable. A urinalysis also showed increased glucose (4+). The participant was diagnosed with severe hyperglycaemia, which was probably caused by dietary factors. Treatment included human insulin and IV fluids (sodium chloride). On Day 234 a urinalysis showed persistent increased glucose (4+) and in addition ketones (1+) were detected. The investigator considered hyperglycaemia not related to study medication. On Day 235 glucose levels remained increased in the morning and insulin glargine was added to the treatment regimen. Hyperglycaemia resolved, and the participant was discharged. No action was taken with study medication in response to the event. Although the presentation of this event was unlikely ketoacidosis, it was adjudicated as an unclassifiable diagnosis of ketoacidosis due to the absence of laboratory data for acid/base status. Another hyperglycaemia episode occurred during which the participant was unaffected. At Day 241, glucose levels had gradually improved but remained increased and treatment with insulin glargine and metformin continued.

It is concluded that for the participant with hypoglycaemia some of the hypoglycaemia episodes were not associated with the study medication. The numerous episodes post-study medication indicate that the participant had problems with glycemic control not related to study drug. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that all of the hypoglycaemia episodes, including the serious one, were not associated with the study medication. This issue is not considered to impact the overall benefit-risk balance in adolescents. Therefore, no further investigation is deemed necessary.

For the hyperglycaemia case, it is agreed with the investigator that the participant´s hyperglycaemia episodes were most probably not related to the study drug.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)

The protocol prespecified (Tier 1) AEs were symptomatic hypoglycemia, AEs associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), genital mycotic infections (females), and hypovolemia. See Table 24. Through Week 54, the incidence of AEs of symptomatic hypoglycemia was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. UTIs were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. The incidence of genital mycotic infections in female participants was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were no AEs of genital mycotic infections reported in male participants. No meaningful differences in Tier 1 AEs were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

## Hypoglycemia

Through Week 54, in participants on background insulin therapy, the incidences of overall hypoglycemia, documented hypoglycemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, and asymptomatic hypoglycemia were comparable in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups. The number of hypoglycemic (symptomatic or asymptomatic) episodes was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group (102 episodes) than in the placebo group (15 episodes). In the combined ertugliflozin group, more episodes of hypoglycemia were symptomatic (58 episodes) than asymptomatic (44 episodes). The number of symptomatic (7 episodes) and asymptomatic (8 episodes) episodes was similar in the placebo group. No meaningful differences in the occurrence of hypoglycemia were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

Through Week 54, in participants not on background insulin therapy, the incidence of overall hypoglycemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, and asymptomatic hypoglycemia was comparable in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups. Documented hypoglycemia with blood glucose values ≥54 mg/dL (≥3.0 mmol/L) and ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) were less frequent in the combined ertugliflozin group (12.9%) than in the placebo group (22.6%). Documented hypoglycemia with blood glucose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

values &lt;54 mg/dL (&lt;3.0 mmol/L) occurred only in the combined ertugliflozin group (6.5%). No events of severe hypoglycemia were reported for either group. The number of hypoglycemic episodes was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group (91 episodes) than in the placebo group (21 episodes). In the combined ertugliflozin group, fewer episodes of hypoglycemia were symptomatic (4 episodes) than asymptomatic (87 episodes) (documented hypoglycemia). In the placebo group, only 1 episode of hypoglycemia was symptomatic. No meaningful differences in the occurrence of hypoglycemia were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

## Urinary Tract Infections

The incidence of UTIs was low and comparable in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. All reported UTIs were classified as mild in severity, with no serious UTIs reported. No meaningful differences in the occurrence of UTIs were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

## Genital Mycotic Infections

The incidence of genital mycotic infections in female participants was low and comparable in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. All genital mycotic infections in female participants were classified as mild in severity, with no serious events reported. There were no genital mycotic infections in male participants. No meaningful differences in the occurrence of genital mycotic infections in female participants were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

## Hypovolemia

Through Week 54, 1 participant, in the combined ertugliflozin group, had an AE of hypovolemia. This event was severe, non-serious, considered not related to study medication, and did not lead to discontinuation of study medication.

## Rapporteur's comment:

The protocol prespecified AEs of special interest were symptomatic hypoglycemia, AEs associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), genital mycotic infections (females), and hypovolemia. The choice of these conditions and groups of diseases is acknowledged given the method of action of ertugliflozin. No imbalances were observed in these AESIs that gave rise to safety concerns.

## Events of Clinical Interest and other safety topics of Interest

No participant met the biochemical criteria for DILI as defined in the protocol.

Through Week 54, the incidence of renal-related AEs was comparable in the combined ertugliflozin (5.4%) and placebo (3.6%) groups. The renal -related AE of increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio was in both treatment groups (3 participants on ertugliflozin; 2 participants on placebo), and microalbuminuria (2 participants) and hematuria (1 participant) in the combined ertugliflozin group.

renal-related AEs were mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, and none led to discontinuation of study medication. No differences in the incidence of renal-related AEs were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

Nephrocalcinosis was evaluated by abdominal ultrasounds. An independent reviewer assessed all ultrasounds for nephrocalcinosis. In the evaluation of n ephrocalcinosis, approximately 52% of participants in the ertugliflozin group and 55% in the placebo group had evidence of nephrocalcinosis in 1 or both kidneys at baseline. Most participants in both groups (74.8% combined ertugliflozin, 83.6% placebo) exhibited no change from baseline in kidney status. The proportion of participants who had a 1-grade change from baseline in nephrocalcinosis in either kidney was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group (18.9%) than in the placebo group (9.1%) at Week 54. The proportion of participants who had a 2-grade change from baseline in nephrocalcinosis in either kidney was low and similar in both treatment groups at Week 54 (≤2.7%) . There were no AEs of nephrocalcinosis reported. One participant in each group had an AE of nephrolithiasis that was mild in severity, nonserious, and did not lead to discontinuation of study medication.

Through Week 54, the incidence of hypersensitivity AEs was comparable in the combined ertugliflozin (5.4%) and placebo (3.6%) groups. All potential hypersensitivity AEs were mild in severity, nonserious, and none led to discontinuation of study medication. No differences in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions were observed at Week 24 relative to Week 54.

No AEs associated with pancreatitis were reported.

Through Week 54, 2 participants in the combined ertugliflozin group and none in the placebo group had AEs of bone fracture. One participant had serious AEs of foot and tibia fracture from a sports injury considered not related to study medication by the investigator. A nonserious AE of upper limb fracture caused by trauma was considered related to study medication by the investigator.

Through Week 54, 2 participants treated with ertugliflozin had potential AEs of ketoacidosis adjudicated by the CAC. The event for the participant in the ertugliflozin 5-mg group was unclassifiable and the event for the participant in the ertugliflozin 5/15-mg group was considered unlikely to be ketoacidosis. One participant, in the placebo group, had ketonuria that was reported as mild and nonserious and did not meet the criteria for adjudication.

There were no events of amputation, diabetic foot syndrome, or Fournier's gangrene.

One participant, in the placebo group, became pregnant during the study.

## Rapporteur's comment:

No participant met the criteria for DILI. The incidences for renal -related AEs and for hypersensitivity were comparable for both groups. The data of nephrocalcinosis are not considered alarming. No cases of ketoacidosis were clearly identified. There were no reports of potential pancreatitis, amputations, diabetic foot syndrome, or Fournier's gangrene for either group.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Small mean increases from baseline in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in the combined ertugliflozin group, while mean values remained unchanged in the placebo group. These results are consistent with the higher proportion of participants with a BUN value that met pre-defined limits of change ( PDLC ertugliflozin group (12 [10.9%]) than in the placebo group (0 [0.0%]) had 1 BUN value with an increase from baseline of ≥50% to a value &gt; ULN . Of the 12 participants in the combined ertugliflozin For the other 6 participants, the last measurement continued to meet the criteria. In all 12 participants, creatinine levels were stable, and the changes observed in hemoglobin levels supported differences in chemistry parameters were observed.

Nephrocalcinosis was evaluated by abdominal ultrasounds at the visits indicated in the SoA. An independent reviewer assessed all ultrasounds for nephrocalcinosis. In the evaluation of nephrocalcinosis in this study, approximately 52% of participants in the in both groups (74.8% combined ertugliflozin, 83.6% placebo) exhibited no change from baseline in kidney status.

) criteria for BUN. Through Week 54, a higher proportion of participants in the combined group who met these criteria, 6 had subsequent measurements that no longer met the PDLC criterion. dehydration as the cause of the mild elevation of BUN (1 to 5 mg/dL above the ULN). No other notable Small mean increases from baseline in hemoglobin (0.6 g/dL) and hematocrit (1.1%) were observed in the combined ertugliflozin group, while mean values for both parameters nearly unchanged in the placebo group. No other notable differences in hematology parameters were observed. In male participants, there was a decrease over time in the urine NTx-creatinine ratio in both treatment groups. Notably, both groups exhibited a decrease in their respective ratios at Week 54 and at Week 24. In female participants, there was a decrease over time in the urine NTx-creatinine ratio in both treatment groups at Week 54, and an increase over time at Week 24. The change from baseline in urine NTx-creatinine ratio was comparable in both treatment groups at Week 24 and Week 54. Both male and female participants in the combined ertugliflozin group had a decrease in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) levels from baseline to Week 54. The biomarker of bone turnover was consistent with changes in growth parameters. No other notable changes in bone biomarkers were observed. Lipids Change from baseline in lipid endpoints were comparable between the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. These changes were consistent with lipid changes noted in adult study with add-on metformin. Small mean decreases from baseline in eGFR were observed in both treatment groups and the magnitude of the changes (~5 to 6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was consistent at Weeks 24 and 54. ertugliflozin group and 55% in the placebo group had evidence of nephrocalcinosis in 1 or both kidneys at baseline. Most participants

## Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and Other Observations Related to Safety

Clinically meaningful abnormalities in vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs were reported as AEs. There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs measurements in this study. Change from baseline in heart rate were comparable between ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. Change from baseline in height and growth velocity were comparable in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tanner Staging

Mean changes from baseline in Tanner Stage results in female participants were comparable between the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. Mean changes from baseline in Tanner Stage results in male participants were comparable between the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Small mean increases from baseline in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in the combined ertugliflozin group, while mean values remained unchanged in the placebo group. Mild dehydration was considered to be the cause behind the BUN elevation. Other than this, no clinically relevant differences between the ertugliflozin group and the placebo group in results of laboratory safety endpoints, vital signs, or growth and development endpoints were observed . No DILI events were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's comment:

According to the applicant, no notable differences were observed for the incidences of AEs overall, AEs by SOC, and specific AEs. Incidences of hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or asymptomatic) were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, regardless of background insulin status. Severe hypoglycaemia was uncommon in both groups. More episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group.

As earlier observed in the adult population with T2DM, treatment with ertugliflozin, and other SGLT2s, is associated with genital mycotic infections (in both males and females), UTIs, and hypovolemia. In this study in paediatric participants, these events were few, and not remarkably higher in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group.

The incidences of renal-related events, fractures, and hypersensitivity reactions were similar in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. No clinically relevant differences between groups were observed in results of laboratory safety endpoints, vital signs, or growth and development endpoints. No DILI events were reported.

Approximately 50% of all participants had nephrocalcinosis in 1 or both kidneys at baseline. The proportion of participants with treatment-emergent nephrocalcinosis or worsening of pre-existing nephrocalcinosis at Week 54 was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group.

Relevant parameters for investigating general safety and tolerability were identified and studied. These included AEs, AESIs, vital signs, laboratory safety studies, renal-related events, nephrocalcinosis evaluations, and assessment of growth and development, and safety topics of interest such as ketoacidosis, volume depletion, hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, bone fractures, bone turnover biomarkers, amputations, diabetic foot syndrome, and Fournier's gangrene.

No alarming imbalances or occurrence of DILI or pancreatitis were observed. The assessor agrees that ertugliflozin seems well tolerated in the population studied aged 10-17 years. No alarming safety issues have appeared, and the safety profile resembles the already known safety profile of the adult population. The MAH plans to further investigate the nephrocalcinosis data, as treatmentemergent nephrocalcinosis or worsening of pre-existing nephrocalcinosis at Week 54 was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group. This is acknowledged.

Narratives were provided for all participants who experienced any event of clinical interest, Tier 1 safety events, safety topic of interest events, pregnancy, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication, but not assessed as part of this P46 procedure.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In the EU, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) is authorised for treatment of T2DM for adults. The paediatric study MK-8835-059 (referred to as P059) was performed to evaluate ertugliflozin for paediatric patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control on metformin with or without insulin. The study is part of the paediatric development program described in the last approved PIP (EMEA-001533-PIP01-13-M03).

P059 was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in pediatric participants (ages 10 to 17 years, inclusive) with T2DM on a stable dose of metformin ≥1500 mg/day with or without stable insulin. The overall study design and the duration of the study are considered adequate.

A total of 166 pediatric participants were randomised. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate for recruiting a study population representative for the patient population and for a possible future treatment population. It is noted that according to inclusion criteria, all participants had background medication. For adults, ertugliflozin is indicated for treatment as monotherapy and as addition to other diabetes medications. The blood glucose lowering effect in children of treatment with ertugliflozin as monotherapy, will be assessed in the future Type II variation application envisaged to be submitted by the MAH.

Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either ertugliflozin 5 mg or placebo. At Week 12, participants in the ertugliflozin 5mg group according to specified criteria, e.g. whose A1C was ≥7.0%, were rerandomized 1:1 to either continue on ertugliflozin 5 mg or uptitrate directly to ertugliflozin 15 mg. The randomisation and blinding procedures are considered adequate. Overall, the ertugliflozin and placebo groups were comparable with respect to demographic and disease characteristics, reflecting a possible future intended population. The rescue criteria and the use of insulin as rescue medication are acknowledged.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in A1C at 24 weeks between ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) and placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on FPG at Week 24 for ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) versus placebo and changes from baseline within-group (ertugliflozin and placebo) on HbA1c and FPG at week 54. Primary safety endpoint consisted of Safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin over 24 weeks and 54 weeks measured as AEs and discontinuation of study medication due to AEs. The endpoints are acknowledged as clinically relevant.

The primary endpoint was met. The LS mean reduction from baseline A1C at Week 24 was significantly greater in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group (0.68%, p =0.007). Sensitivity analyses supported the primary endpoints. The participants were stratified based on Age: 10 to 14 years of age OR 15 to 17 years of age and based on Insulin use: Yes OR No.

Sub-group analyses showed greater reduction in A1C for the sub-group of participants 15-17 years than for the younger group. Participants with insulin use at screening showed greater A1C reduction than those without. These findings seem in line with what would be expected since patients with insulin and older patients are assumed to have more advanced diabetes and thereby possibly more easily gain from treatment with ertugliflozin.

Key secondary endpoints consisted of change from baseline in A1C for the dose-optimized ertugliflozin group and for the ertugliflozin 5-mg group, respectively, compared to placebo. Both groups showed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significantly greater reduction from baseline in A1C than placebo at week 24, thus supporting the results of the primary endpoint. For the other secondary endpoints, results also supported the primary endpoint results. The change from baseline on A1C at week 54, FPG at Week 24 and FPG at Week 54 for ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg, all doses combined) showed greater reduction than the placebo group. As no changes to the SmPC are proposed by the MAH within this procedure and the MAH has informed that a type II variation for extension of indication is planned to be submitted, the validity of the MAH conclusions of efficacy results of the P059 study should not be considered as finally assessed within this procedure. In general, the efficacy results indicate a benefit of treatment with ertugliflozin in children aged 10-17 years. Explorative endpoints will be assessed and discussed in the future Type II variation report. For this procedure, it is considered of great importance to investigate whether the safety results from the use in the paediatric population in the P059 study, support the current use in the approved adult population with T2DM, or if new safety issues appeared in children with possible implications for adults. No notable differences were observed for the incidences of AEs overall, AEs by SOC, and specific AEs. Incidences of hypoglycaemia (symptomatic or asymptomatic) were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, regardless of background insulin status. Severe hypoglycaemia was uncommon in both groups. More episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group. Events of genital mycotic infections, UTIs, and hypovolemia were few, and not remarkably higher in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group. The incidences of renal-related events and hypersensitivity reactions were similar in the combined ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 54. No clinically relevant differences between groups were observed in results of laboratory safety endpoints, vital signs, or growth and development endpoints. No DILI events were reported. The proportion of participants with treatment -emergent nephrocalcinosis or worsening of pre-existing nephrocalcinosis at Week 54 was higher in the combined ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group. In conclusion, relevant parameters for investigating general safety and tolerability were identified and studied. Ertugliflozin seems well tolerated in the study population aged 10-17 years. No alarming safety issues have appeared, and the safety profile resembles the already known safety profile of the adult population. The MAH plans to further investigate the nephrocalcinosis data, which is considered adequate, since treatment-emergent nephrocalcinosis or worsening of pre-existing nephrocalcinosis at Week 54 was higher in the ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group. No new safety issues are identified for the studied paediatric population, therefore the safety in adults is considered unchanged. The overall benefit-risk balance for the use of ertugliflozin in the adult population according to approved label is positive.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The results from study P059 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant change in A1C from baseline to week 24 for subjects aged 10-17 years with T2DM treated with ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg [doses combined]) compared to subjects treated with placebo. Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with ertugliflozin is generally well-tolerated in children and adolescents aged 10-17 years, with an acceptable safety profile. Safety results were overall in line with the known safety profile for ertugliflozin in adults. The study results support a remained positive B/R for use of ertugliflozin in adults.
