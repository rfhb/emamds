## INTRODUCTION

On  3  October  2008,  the  MAH  submitted  the  clinical  overview  and  report  on study  PACTG Protocol  1052 for  Ziagen  ( Abacavir  pharmacokinetics  during  chronic  therapy  in  HIVinfected  adolescent  and  young  adults ),  in  accordance  with  Article  45  of  the  Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.

Study PACTG P1052 was a phase I, open-label, age-stratified pharmacokinetic study of a single oral  300  mg  dose  of  abacavir  administered  to  HIV-infected  adolescents  aged ≥ 13  to  &lt;18 (stratum 1) and young adults aged ≥ 18 to &lt; 25 years (stratum 2).

The  MAH  has  reviewed  the  results  of  this  study  and  has  concluded  that  they  are  in accordance  with  the  approved  Global  Data  Sheet  and  that  no  changes  to  the  Product Information are considered necessary.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

As  a  reminder,  Ziagen  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children  from  3  months  of  age.  The recommended dose in children aged 12 years and more is the adult dose i.e. 600 mg daily given as 300 mg BID or 600 mg QD.

For children less than 12 years, a dosing according to weight bands is recommended for Ziagen tablets and a dosing of 8 mg/kg BID (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) is recommended for Ziagen oral solution.

Results from a previous study PACTG P1018 (a single dose PK study of an 8 mg/kg dose in children and adolescents 9 to &lt;19 years of age) showed that the PK parameters in adolescents were more similar to children than to adults, indicating that using a 300 mg dose in adolescents may results in under-dosing.

Study  PACTG P1052 was designed to address the question whether adolescents and young adults being given adult doses were achieving adequate plasma concentrations.

## 2. Clinical study(ies)

## /head2right Description

Study PACTG P1052 was a phase I, open-label, age-stratified pharmacokinetic study of a single oral  300  mg  dose  of  abacavir  administered  to  HIV-infected  adolescents  aged ≥ 13  to  &lt;18 (stratum 1) and young adults aged ≥ 18 to &lt; 25 years (stratum 2).

## /head2right Methods

- Objective(s)

Primary objective:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To determine ABC PK parameters in a cohort of HIV-1 infected adolescents and young adults receiving  the  current  recommended  dose  for  comparison  with  previously  published  data  for young children and adults

## Secondary objective:

To  examine  the  possible  relationships between  subject  characteristics (age, body  size, race/ethnicity and gender) and ABC PK parameters (oral clearance, AUC and half-life).

## · Study design

Open-label, single-dose, PK study.

Enrolment was stratified by age (&gt; 13 to &lt;18 years and &gt; 18 to &lt; 25 years).

## · Study population /Sample size

Patients who had participated in P1018 were not eligible.

HIV-1 infected patients should have CD4&gt;100 cells/mm 3 and viral load &lt; 100 000 cp/mL. Patients had to be on abacavir for at least 8 weeks.

## · Treatments

Subjects  were  given  an  observed  300  mg  dose  of  ABC  prescribed  as  part  of  the  subject's current ARV treatment regimen.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

PK  parameters  were  assessed  for  Abacavir,  its  carboxylate  metabolite  and  its  glucuronide metabolite.

## · PK modelling

Blood samples for PK parameters were drawn at pre dose, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 hours post-dose. Additional blood was drawn at pre dose and 4.0 hours post dose for assessing PK phenotype.

Blood samples were shipped from each site to St.Jude Core Pharmacology Laboratory for processing. One compartment absorption models were fit to each subject's data. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood with variance model parameters consistent with the variability of the assay allowing for measurable concentrations in pre dose samples. AUCs for abacavir estimated from the models were used for analysis.AUCs for abacavir metabolites were calculated using a trapezoidal rule.

## · Statistical Methods

Because a number of the distributions of the PK parameters were skewed, medians and inter-quartile ranges and non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare distributions by age stratum, gender and race/ethnicity (reduced to two categories because of small numbers). Spearman correlations based on ranks were used to calculate correlations. Some comparisons with previously published data were done using means and standard deviations.

Median regression (least absolute residuals) lines were superimposed on scatter plots as visual summaries rather than normal linear regression lines as this technique is less sensitive to outliers. The multiple regression models were fit using linear regression, carefully checking residual plots to ensure no violation of assumptions.

## /head2right Results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

15 subjects were enrolled into each stratum at 10 sites between August 2004 and December 2004. All 30 subjects completed the one day study and had evaluable PK data for analysis.

## · Baseline data

53% of patients were male. 57% of patients were Black, non Hispanic.

Median CD4 count was 565 cells/mm3 and median CD4% was 27%.

52% of patients had CV &lt; 400 cp/mL.

The majority of patients (n=24) received Trizivir alone (n=15) or with another ARV drug (n=9).

Predoseabacavirconcentrations were undetectable in 11 subjects, &lt;1000 r mg/ml in 18 subjects, and 1230 mg/ml in one subject. Eight (8) s subjects reached their maximum postdose concentration by 0.5 hours, 9 by 1 hour, 9 by 2 hours and 4 by 3 hours. The distribution of Ka (the first order absorption rate constant) from the first order model is summarized in Table11.

Summary statistics for PK parameters are shown overall in the table 12 (appendix).

Summary statistics for PK parameters by age group, gender and race are given in tables 13 to 15 (appendix). The last column in the tables shows the significance values for Wilcoxon rank sum  tests  comparing  distributions  in  the  2  groups. There  were  no  statistically  significant differences in any of the PK parameters by age group or gender. Hispanics had marginally higher median glucuronide AUCs than Blacks (p=0.044).

Spearman correlations (based on the ranks) of the PK parameters with age (years), weight (kg), weight-for-age-and-gender Z-scores, height (cm), height z-scores, BMI, BMI z-scores, body surface area (BSA) and dose adjusted for weight and surface area are shown in Table 17, with significance values for testing the hypothesis that the correlations are equal to O in Table 18 (starred values show correlations statistically significant at the p=0.05 level).Although there were no statistically significant differences in any PK outcomes by age group, abacavir volume of distribution adjusted for weight or BSA were significantly negatively correlated was also significantly negatively correlated with weight, BMI, BSA and positively correlated withdoseadjustedforweightorBSA.

## Rapporteur's comment:

There is no statistically significant difference in abacavir PK parameters between patients aged &gt; 13 to &lt;18 years and those aged &gt; 18 to &lt; 25 years. Therefore, there is no concerning signal suggesting  that  adolescents  might  be  under-dosed  compared  to  adults  with  the  currently recommended dose of abacavir.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Based on historical comparison, abacavir Cmac and AUC were similar in patients from study P1052 than in adult patients receiving the same dose of 300 mg. Therefore, there is no trend indicating a decrease in abacavir PK parameters in adolescents compared to adults.
