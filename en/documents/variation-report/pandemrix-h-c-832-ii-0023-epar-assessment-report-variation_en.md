## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisation in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  phase  6  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  original  design  of  this  study  was  amended  when  the  first  results  of  study  H1N1-021  became available (for further details of this study, please refer to the Scientific Discussion of the pandemic strain variation PU-17). Thus, instead of administering two doses to all subjects in each age stratum one  cohort  will  receive  two  doses  as  planned  and  the  other  will  receive  only  a  single  dose.  Both cohorts will then be followed up serologically at M6 and at M12 to determine whether there is any advantage for two doses over a single dose in the longer term.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The vaccine also contains the marketing authorisation holder's (MAH's) proprietary adjuvant AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix H1N1 to reflect newly available results from a clinical study in adults 18-60 years of age and above (D-PAN-H1N1-008, called 'H1N1-008' in this report ). In  support  of  this  variation  the  MAH  has  submitted  a  synoptic  report  of  day  21  (D21)  safety  and immunogenicity data (HI only) from study H1N1-008 This  variation  has  been  submitted  to  fulfil  the  specific  obligation  SOB  051  for  which  the  MAH committed to provide the post-dose 1 HI immunogenicity data (uncleaned) from this study to CHMP. Further data will be submitted from this study at intervals as committed in the Letter of Undertaking for the pandemic strain variation (PU-017) and described in Annex II to the Opinion. 1.2 Clinical aspects H1N1-008 This is a phase II, randomised, open-label, single centre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1 following administration of one or two doses to healthy adults aged from the age of 18 years onwards. Study Design and objectives Medicinal product no longer authorised

The study was initiated in September 2009 and is ongoing. Currently only the data obtained up to D21 after a single dose of Pandemrix H1N1 are available. The MAH provides an abridged study report that covers  the  post-dose  I  immunogenicity  results  (i.e.  at  D21)  after  a  single  dose  of  3.75  µg/AS03 A together with data on reactogenicity, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

The complete list of objectives for study D-Pan-H1N1-008 is detailed below. However, only the post Dose 1 (Day 21) results are available at this point.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The primary objective is:

- To  demonstrate  that  vaccination  with  one  dose  of  the  H1N1  vaccine  (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain) containing 3.75 µ g of HA adjuvanted with AS03A results in an HI immune response  to  the  vaccine-homologous  virus  that  meets  or  exceeds  the  EMEA  (CHMP)  guidance targets for pandemic vaccine seroconversion rate (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR), and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) at 21 days after the vaccination in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata.

## The secondary objectives are:

· To  evaluate  the  HI  immune  response  to  the  vaccine-homologous  virus  in  terms  of  the  EMEA (CHMP) guidance targets for pandemic vaccine at 21 days after the first  dose  of  vaccine, as a function of the pre-vaccination serostatus, in each age stratum. · To  assess  whether  vaccination  with  two  doses  of  the  H1N1  vaccine  (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain) containing 3.75 µ g of HA adjuvanted with AS03A results in an HI immune response  to  the  vaccine-homologous  virus  that  meets  or  exceeds  the  EMEA  (CHMP)  guidance targets for pandemic vaccine seroconversion rate (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR), and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) at 21 days after the second dose of H1N1 vaccine in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata. · To describe (based on point estimates and 95% CIs) the persistence of the HI vaccine-homologous response  against  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v-like  antigen  at  Days  42,  182  and  364  after  one dose of H1N1 vaccine and at Days 182 and 364 after two doses of H1N1 vaccine in adults within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata. · To describe (based on point estimates and 95% CIs) the immunogenicity to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen at Day 0, 21, 42, 182 and 364 in terms of neutralizing antibodies in adults in a subset of subjects within the 18 to 60 years and above 60 years age strata. · To describe the safety of the vaccine regimens in terms of solicited adverse events (AEs), 7 days post-vaccination; unsolicited AEs, 21 or 84 days post-dose 1 and 63 days post-dose 2; AEs of specific interest (AESIs) for the entire study period, serious adverse events (SAEs) for the entire study period and biochemical parameters at Day 0, 21, 42, 182 and 364. The study planned to enrol 240 subjects aged at least 18 years with allocation to two parallel vaccine groups (one or two doses) with a ratio of 1:1. The primary analysis was done on the total vaccinated cohort for each age stratum and overall. The analysis of immunogenicity was done as a descriptive analysis of the humoral immune response overall and within each age stratum. Results Medicinal product no longer authorised

As was planned, the study enrolled 240 subjects, including 120 aged 18-60 years and 120 aged &gt; 60 years.  Since  all  subjects  received  the  first  dose  the  total  on  which  post-vaccination  safety  and immunogenicity data are reported at D21 is 240.

In the four age strata there were 59 aged 18-40 years, 61 aged 41-60, 75 aged 61-70 and 45 aged &gt;70. The results have been shown according to these age groups and not according to the pre-defined strata at the time of randomisation. The age range per stratum was from 19-40 years, 42-60, 61 to 70 and 71 to 85 years. Within each cohort the percentage of each gender was variable but all values fell within 43-57%. All subjects were Caucasian.

As shown in the table, no subject had received vaccination for the 2009/10 season before study entry but the rate of prior vaccination on the two previous seasons increased with age. As expected, over 85% of those aged &gt; 60 years had been vaccinated at least once since 2007.

· As shown below between 29-44% of subjects per age stratum were seropositive before the first dose  but  only  3-14%  of  subjects  were  seroprotected.  There  was  no  clear  trend  to  increasing baseline seropositivity or seroprotection with age. · At Day 21, all except two subjects aged 61-70 years were seropositive. · The D21 GMT was significantly higher in subjects aged 18-40 compared to the older age strata. In  the  three  older  strata the  GMT  was numerically highest for those aged 41-60  years  with no appreciable difference for the two cohorts aged &gt; 60 years. · The D21 seroprotection rates showed a trend to decrease with increasing age but the 95% CI all overlapped and the lowest rate observed exceeded 86%. · Similarly the D21 seroconversion rates showed a trend to decrease with increasing age but the 95% CI all overlapped and the lowest rate observed exceeded 77%. · The seroconversion factors decreased very markedly with increasing age with no overlap of 95% CI between the 18-40 and 41-60 years strata and no overlap in 95% CI between the 41-60 years and the two older strata. However, there was no appreciable difference between subjects in the 61-70 and &gt;70 years strata. The lowest SCF exceeded 13.

The MAH also provided an overview of HI responses according to baseline serostatus in various age sub-groups:

## 18-40 years

In  this  age  group  33/59  subjects  were  seronegative at baseline. The D21 GMT was nearly two-fold higher in the subgroup that was seropositive at baseline but the SCF was about one third of that in the baseline  seronegative  subjects.  SCRs  were  &gt;  90%  regardless  of  baseline  serostatus  and  only  1/59 subjects was not seroprotected after a single dose.

## 41-60 years

The data do not show an important effect of prior seasonal vaccination on HI responses at D21 after a single dose. However, those who were seronegative at baseline and had received seasonal vaccination had the lowest GMT and SPR at D21. It was therefore considered that some subjects in this sub-group do not respond so well in terms of HI to influenza vaccines. Nevertheless, the SPR was 93% in this sub-group.

In this age group 43/61 subjects were seronegative at baseline. The D21 GMT was &gt;2-fold higher in the subgroup seropositive at baseline but the SCF was lower than that in the baseline seronegatives. SCRs were &gt; 90% regardless of baseline serostatus and only 2/61 subjects were not seroprotected after a single dose. 61-70 years In  this  age  group  43/75  subjects  were  seronegative  at  baseline.  The D21 GMT  was  close  to  2-fold higher  in  the  subgroup  seropositive  at  baseline  but  the  SCF  was  lower  than  that  in  the  baseline seronegatives.  SCRs  were  ~80%  regardless  of  baseline  serostatus.  In  baseline  seronegatives  35/43 (81%) were seroprotected after a single dose compared to 31/32 (97%) of the baseline seropositives. 71-80 years In this age group 23/40 subjects were seronegative at baseline. The D21 GMT was ~2.5-fold higher in the  subgroup  seropositive  at  baseline  but  the  SCF  was  about  one-third  of  that  in  the  baseline seronegatives. SCRs were &gt; 70% regardless of baseline serostatus. The D21 seroprotection rates were 19/23 (83%) for those seronegative at baseline and 16/17 (94%) for those seropositive at baseline. &gt;80 years There were only five subjects in this age group, of which three were seronegative at baseline. The D21 GMT was  &gt;3-fold  higher  in  the  subgroup  seropositive  at  baseline  but  the  SCFs  were  comparable between  subgroups.  Overall  4/5  seroconverted.  None  of  the  five  subjects  was  seroprotected  before vaccination but 4/5 reached this cut-off (i.e. 80%) at D21. The MAH further provided immunogenicity results for subjects aged &lt; and &gt; 60 years according to prior  seasonal  vaccination  history    (according  to  vaccination  status  and,  for  GMTs  and  SPRs,  for baseline serostatus) as described below: 18-60 years Medicinal product no longer authorised

## &gt; 60 years

The  data  show  the  same  pattern  as  for  the  younger  cohort,  including  in  the  sub-group  that  was seronegative at baseline but had received prior seasonal vaccination. Nevertheless, the SPR in this subgroup was 79%.

## Clinical safety

The  safety analysis  was  performed  on  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  of  240  subjects,  for  which  all returned the symptom records.

As shown below, for total, general and local symptoms the reporting rates per subject decreased with increasing age and with no overlap of 95% between the youngest and the oldest strata. Almost all of these symptoms were considered to be related to vaccination.

Few symptoms were of Grade 3 and all of these were general symptoms (no local Grade 3 symptoms were reported in any age stratum). These also showed a trend to decrease with increasing age. Incidence and nature of grade 3 symptoms by age strata As in other studies local pain was by far the most common solicited symptom, affecting almost all of the youngest cohort and more than half in all other cohorts but showing a decrease in incidence with increasing age. The vast majority of reports of pain were of grade 1 and none was Grade 3. Redness and swelling were each reported by &lt; 12% of subjects per age cohort. Local symptoms lasted for a mean/median of 1-3 days. Solicited local symptoms reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-dose 1 vaccination period (Total vaccinated cohort) Medicinal product no longer authorised

The analysis  of  solicited  general  symptoms  is  shown  by  the  two  major  age  strata  below,  including Grade 3 report and vaccine-related reports. The MAH also provided similar analyses in the four age categories as above, which demonstrated a general decrease in incidence with increasing age. Fatigue,  headache  and  muscle  aches  predominated  as  in  previous  studies  and  in  the  H5N1  studies. Documented fever in these adults was reported by very few subjects. In general, the rates observed were also very much in keeping with those observed in the H5N1 studies in comparable age groups. General symptoms lasted for a mean/median of 1-3 days. Solicited general symptoms reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-dose 1 (Total vaccinated cohort) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Unsolicited AEs were reported by 44% of subjects aged &lt; 60 years and by 26% aged &gt; 60 years with corresponding rates for vaccine-related AEs of 20% and 12%. These were very mixed in nature and the majority were reported by only one or two subjects. The notable exception was nasopharyngitis, reported by 15 and 3 in respective age groups. Pruritus was reported by two subjects and two reported rash, none of which was Grade 3 and one of each was considered vaccine-related. Lymphadenopathy does not appear to have been reported by any subject after the first dose. Ten subjects aged &lt; 60 years and one aged &gt; 60 years reported a Grade 3 unsolicited AE. These were mixed in nature and there was no discernable pattern. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No SAEs were reported up to D21 in this study.

The incidence of taking concomitant medications and of taking any antipyretic medication decreased with age across the four strata. It seems likely that most of the medications with an antipyretic effect were most likely taken for their analgesic effects (i.e. due to local pain, headaches and muscle aches) given the very low rates of fever.

## II. Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment

This  initial  and  abridged  study  report  describes  the  preliminary  safety  and  immunogenicity  results following vaccination with Pandemrix (i.e. 3.75 µg HA +AS03A) in adults aged from 18-60 years and over 60 years, with a good representation of subjects aged &gt; 60 years (120) of which 45 were &gt; 70 years although only five of these 45 subjects were aged &gt; 80 years. Based on the HI data at baseline the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates and seroprotection rates were in  keeping with those observed in studies 021 and 007 in subjects aged 18-60 years. There was no clear trend to higher baseline rates with increasing age. The CHMP criteria for HI responses were met in the initial analysis in the strata &lt; 60 and &gt; 60 years. The additional analyses by baseline serostatus, prior seasonal vaccination and detailed age strata that were provided by the MAH on request of the assessor also showed that in each analysis the three criteria  were  comfortably  met,  including  the  five  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years,  three  of  whom  were seronegative at baseline. The safety profile of Pandemrix H1N1 appears to be as seen with previously assessed studies (H1N1 021, H1N1-007) generally comparable with that reported with Pandemrix H5N1 in adults aged 18-60 years and in older subjects, in whom reporting rates were generally lower than in the younger cohort. There were no new safety issues raised by these data. The CHMP considered that these preliminary data do not affect the current wording regarding use in subjects aged 18-60 years but the data could now be described as limited rather than very limited in the PI. The new data in the elderly merit a cautious reflection in the SPC to allow the option of a single dose. It  remains to be confirmed if it is possible to allow this even in those aged &gt; 80 years based on the very limited data in this age group. It is clear from the data that GMTs decreased with age, as observed on previous studies with H5N1 and within the 18-60 years cohort with H1N1v versions of Pandemrix. However, and in contrast to  the  experience  in  this  age  group  with  H5N1  vaccine,  all  five  subjects mounted  an  immune  response.  None  of  the  five  was  seroprotected  at  baseline,  although  two  were seropositive, but all were seropositive at D21 and four of the five were seroprotected. On this basis there does not seem to be any justification for setting an upper limit on the age at which a single dose may be an option although the limitations of the data must be clearly reflected in section 5.1.

Nevertheless, the CHMP reiterated that it remains possible that advantages for a second dose could exist. Even if the immediate HI response to Pandemrix is highly satisfactory in adults, including the elderly, there could be advantages for a second dose in terms of antibody persistence and also in terms of antibody against drifted variants. Indeed, the H5N1 data would suggest that this might be the case. Therefore  the  outstanding  post-dose  1  NA  data,  the  post-dose  2  HI  and  NA  data  and  the  antibody persistence data are still considered to be very important.

Submission of the further data from this study is included in the list of Specific Obligations and will be dealt with in sequential assessment reports.

## 1.4 Changes to the Product Information

The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SPC/Annex II/ /PL attached to this report.

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH.

## SPC section 4.2 -Posology and method of administration

The introductory paragraph was shortened and changed to be more concise. The sub-sections on adults and elderly were merged into one sub-section and revised to reflect that Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Pandemrix (H1N1) in clinical studies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and the second dose.

SPC section 4.4 -Special warnings and precautions for use This section  was  revised  to  reflect  that  limited  data  available  from  clinical  studies  with  Pandemrix (H1N1) in adults aged over 60 years and very limited data with Pandemrix (H1N1) or with a version of the vaccine containing H5N1 antigens in adults aged over 80 years. SPC section 4.8 - Undesirable effects A  section  was  added  to  describe  the  safety  data  especially  in  adults  &gt;60  years  of  age  from  study H1N1-008 SPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties This section was further revised to include data from study H1N1- 007 and H1N1-008 in a single table for  adults  aged  18-60  years.  The  study  008  data  in  subjects  aged  60-71,  71-80  and  80+  years  was included (by baseline serostatus) to show how many subjects were in each age stratum and a statement was included highlighting that no data are currently available on the neutralising antibody response. SPC section 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling The  text  proposed  by  the  MAH  was  considered  acceptable.  Further  changes  to  the  handling instructions have been assessed within variation II-25 adopted in parallel to this procedure. The PL was updated accordingly. Medicinal product no longer authorised
