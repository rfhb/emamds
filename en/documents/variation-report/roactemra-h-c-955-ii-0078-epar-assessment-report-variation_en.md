## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## About the product

Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanised anti-human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the  interleukin-6  receptor  (IL-6R)  that  binds  specifically  to  both  soluble  and  membrane-bound  IL-6R, thereby inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6), the ligand of IL-6R, is a cytokine produced by a wide variety of cells in the human body.  Its  normal  role  is  primarily  to  regulate  hematopoiesis,  to  stimulate  immune  responses,  and  to mediate  acute  phase  reactions.  Consequently,  excessive  production  of  IL-6  can  be  implicated  in  the pathogenesis  of  several  diseases  involved  with  these  functions,  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA), multiple myeloma and Castleman's Disease. IL-6 exerts its biological effects through both the membrane bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R), and the soluble form of the receptor (sIL-6R). TCZ binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. TCZ has been shown to inhibit the biological activities of IL-6 in vitro  and  in  vivo,  and  to  suppress  the  development  of  arthritis  and  C-reactive  protein  synthesis  in  a collagen induced arthritis model in cynomolgus monkey.

TCZ is available in  2 different  pharmaceutical  forms  to  allow  either  administration  by intravenous  (IV) infusion or by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Both pharmaceutical forms of TCZ are approved in the EU, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis  (RA)  in  adults,  for  the  treatment  of  juvenile  idiopathic  polyarthritis  (pJIA;  rheumatoid  factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis). The SC formulation of TCZ is also approved in the EU for the treatment Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients. The IV formulation of TCZ is also approved in the EU for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of age and older.

## Problem statement

Cytokine release syndrome has been identified as a potentially life-threatening significant on-target sideeffect  of  cancer  immunotherapies  designed  to  stimulate  the  immune  system  to  attack  tumour  cells, including T-cell-recruiting agents such as the CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapies axicabtagene ailoleucel and tisagenlecleucel-T. The reported incidence of CRS following CAR T-cell therapy ranges from 50% to 100% (any CTCAE grade), with 10% to 65% of patients experiencing severe or life threatening CRS.

## Cytokine release syndrome

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is caused by the excessive release of cytokines by immune effector or target  cells  during  an  exaggerated  immune  response.  CRS  can  be  triggered  by  infections  or  by therapeutic  interventions,  which  activate  the  immune  response,  with  the  severity  of  CRS  most  likely related to the degree and duration of immune activation.

The  reported  incidence  of  CRS  following  CAR  T-cell  therapy  ranges  from  50%  to  100%  (any  CTCAE grade),  with  10%  to  65%  of  patients  experiencing severe  or  life  threatening  CRS.  CRS  has  also  been associated with the CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody blinatumomab (Blincyto SmPC), and also nonspecific Tcell agonists such as TGN1412 targeting CD28 and OKT3 targeting CD3. Cancer immunotherapy driven CRS may also result from lysis of tumour cells (e.g., rituximab, obinutuzumab), which clinically manifests as infusion reactions. Finally, therapies that block inhibitory signals to T-cells (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) could also theoretically result in CRS or could exacerbate CRS if given in combination with other cancer immunotherapies.  The  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  CRS  following  cancer  immunotherapy  can  vary across  patients  but  are  similar  regardless  of  the  inciting  agent.  Most  patients  present  with  mild  or moderate  flu-like  symptoms,  including  fever,  nausea,  headache,  chills,  and  myalgia,  which  are  easily managed.  However,  some  patients  experience  more  severe,  life-threatening  signs  and  symptoms, including  hypotension,  tachycardia,  dyspnoea,  vascular  leak,  pulmonary  oedema,  and  disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, as a result of massive cytokine release. Such severe reactions are marked by their rapid onset and require emergency treatment to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure.

- a Pulmonary edema can also occur.

The  severity  of  CRS  has  been  defined  by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  grading  system  based  on  the  requirement  for  and  response  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment (Table 2). This grading system applies to all CRS events regardless of inciting agent but was based  on  grading  of  acute  infusion-related  toxicities  caused  by  monoclonal  antibodies  and  is  not necessarily  applicable  for  CRS  events  arising  with  cancer  immunotherapy  (Recombinant  DNA  Advisory Committee Meeting, 2015). Revised grading systems have been proposed for CRS occurring in the setting of cancer immunotherapy.

## Management of CRS

Prophylaxis to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS is recommended prior to administration of some medications,  including  blinatumomab  (Blincyto)  muronomab-CD3  (Orthoclone  OKT3)  and  rituximab (MabThera). Premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines and acetaminophen, in addition to other measures, such as slowing down the infusion and fractionated dosing, can help manage events (Bugelski et  al.  2009).  However,  severe  and  life-threatening  CRS  can  still  occur  even  after  these  precautionary measures have been taken. In addition, in some circumstances, premedication is not favoured due to concerns  it  may  reduce  the  efficacy  of  the  primary  medication,  for  example,  administration  of corticosteroids that can have deleterious effects on immune cell function (Davila et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014a).

Treatment of CRS primarily focuses on rapidly reducing the excessive inflammatory response by use of IV corticosteroids and antihistamines, and treating the individual signs and symptoms of CRS, for example, by  administering  analgesics  for  headache,  vasopressors  and  IV  fluids  for  hypotension,  and  supportive care with oxygen, and using intubation/mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress. There is currently no authorised medicine available in the EU specifically for the treatment of CAR-T cell-induced CRS.

Severe  or  life-threatening  CRS  is  a  medical  emergency  and  if  unsuccessfully  managed,  can  result  in significant  morbidity  or  mortality.  However,  treatment  of  these  events  is  challenging,  as  they  do  not always respond to conventional treatment, especially in the case of late intervention. As such, there is a high unmet medical need for a more effective treatment to manage CRS, particularly the more severe reactions. As CRS is associated with excessive levels of circulating cytokines, anti-cytokine therapy has been investigated as a potential treatment for CRS, particularly for severe or life-threatening reactions. Published small series or case reports of several anti-cytokine therapies to treat CRS have yielded mixed results (Grupp et al. 2013, 2015; Bruck et al. 2011; Kelly and Ramanan 2008; Pachlopnik, Schmid et al. 2009).

There has been an increase in reports of TCZ being used by physicians to successfully treat severe or lifethreatening CRS, and it has been authorised in the US for this purpose (Le et al. 2018).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Emerging evidence suggests that the cytokine IL-6 is the central mediator of toxicity in CRS, and IL-6R blockade  using  TCZ  has  been  shown  to  be  highly  effective  in  treating  patients  with  severe  or  lifethreatening  CRS,  particularly  in  patients  treated  with  immune  agonist  anti-cancer  therapy  including agents designed to recruit T-cells to tumours. Specifically, as a result of published data demonstrating the efficacy  of  TCZ  to  treat  severe  CRS  following  administration  of  T-cells  engineered  to  express  chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), TCZ is being increasingly used by physicians to treat CRS caused by immunedirected therapies and is becoming standard medical practice in many institutions (Lee et al. 2014a).

## CRS in CAR-t therapies

CRS has been identified as a significant on-target side-effect of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, including T-cell-recruiting agents such as the CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapies axicabtagene ciloleucel  (Yescarta/KTE-C19)  and  tisagenlecleucel  (Kymriah/CTL019),  which  have  been  subject  to assessment by the CHMP for the treatment of haematological malignancies. Scientific literature suggests that Tocilizumab has been successfully used to treat patients who developed CRS in those studies (Grupp et al. 2016; Locke et al. 2017).

The proposed extension of indication aims to include the indication 'treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older' for the RoActemra 20mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion.

The recommended posology for treatment of CRS given as a 60-minute intravenous infusion is 8 mg/kg in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg in patients weighing less than 30 kg. RoActemra can be given alone or in combination with corticosteroids.

If no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of CRS occurs after the first dose, up to 3 additional doses of RoActemra may be administered. The interval between consecutive doses should be at least 8 hours. Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in CRS patients.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

As tocilizumab is a protein it is unlikely to pose any environmental risk therefore ERA studies for tocilizumab are exempted in accordance with the ERA guideline EMA/CPMP/SWP/4447/00.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.1. Introduction

This  application  for  this  Type  II  variation  rests  on  the  clinical  data  relevant  to  patients  treated  with tocilizumab  following  the  administration  of  CAR-T  cell  therapies.  The  current  application  is  further substantiated  on  the  basis  of  published  data  (either  full-text  manuscripts  or  conference  abstracts) describing the effectiveness of tocilizumab in treating severe or life-threatening CRS.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

Based  on  the  analysis  of  TCZ/CRS  data  from  the  CAR  T-cell  trials,  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  data  were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ. The PK population included 15 male and 12 female patients of median age 12 years (range, 4-23 years). The geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T-cell-induced, severe or life-threatening CRS was 99.5 µ g/mL (36.8%) after the first infusion and 160.7 µ g/mL (113.8%) after the  second infusion.  Using  a  refined population  PK  model,  simulations  were performed by  FDA  for  the recommended TCZ dose given every 8, 12, or 24 hours.

Free  tocilizumab  (not  complexed  to  endogenous  IL-6R)  in  human  serum  samples  from  Novartis  Trial ELIANA was determined by electro-chemiluminescence assay (ECLA). Tocilizumab samples were collected at pre-specified time-points (5-15 minutes, 24 hours ± 2 hours, and 48 hours ± 4 hours from first and second infusions) and quantified using validated ECLA assay in Novartis Trial ELIANA. The second dose of ACTEMRA was administered 2 days (min 0.5 day, max 4 days) after the first dose. Novartis submitted the preliminary, non-validated PK data from 27 patients in Trial ELIANA, and performed an exploratory noncompartmental analysis to determine the Cmax. Other PK parameters could not be reliably generated due to the sparse PK sampling schedule.

Tocilizumab  PK  concentration-time  profiles  for  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  CAR  T  cell  induced severe or life -threatening CRS are depicted below.

As the proposed dose level for patients with CRS is 12 mg/kg for patients less than 30 kg weight or 8 mg per kg for patients at or above 30 kg weight, which is the same as the approved dose for patients with SJIA, the tocilizumab Cmax was compared between these two patient populations. The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax in patients with CRS in Novartis Trial ELIANA was 99.5 μg/mL (36.8%) following the first IV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infusion dose (n = 27) and 161 μg/mL (114%) following the second dose (n = 8), which is lower than observed  geometric  mean  (%  CV)  Cmax  of  157  μg/mL  (74.2%)  after  the  first  dose  and  262  μg/mL (29.6%) at steady state in 75 paediatric patients with SJIA.

The following  population  PK  modelling  and  simulation  analyses  to  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  the proposed dosing regimen for tocilizumab in patients with CRS were conducted. The previous population PK model developed using PK data from paediatric and young adult patients with SJIA in a European Trial LRO320 and a Japanese Trial MRA326 was applied to predict the PK data from patients with CRS. The previous  population  PK  model  was  then  refined  to  re-estimate  linear  clearance  (CL)  and  volume  of distribution in central compartment (VC) using PK data from patients with CRS in Novartis Trial ELIANA. All  the  other  parameters  including  inter-individual  variabilities  (IIV)  of  CL  and  VC,  as  well  as  residual errors, were fixed to the previous PK parameters given the limited sparse PK observations from a small sample size of patients with CRS. The GOF and VPC assessments, decrease in objective function value (OFV), and the precision (% CV) of the parameter estimates were used for the model comparison and evaluation.

Time

The figure below shows the median tendencies and the corresponding 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of simulated PK time profiles after four tocilizumab doses of 12 mg/kg (&lt;30 kg weight) or 8 mg/kg (≥ 30 kg weight) via IV infusion over 1 hour every 24 hours, 12 hours or 8 hours in adult and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older with CAR T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS. Tocilizumab serum concentrations tend to accumulate more quickly with the increasing dosing frequency for a total of four doses given the nonlinear PK characteristics of tocilizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The simulated median (2.5th, 97.5th percentiles) of tocilizumab Cmax was 259 μg/mL (131 μg/mL, 495 μg/mL) after four IV infusion doses administered every 24 hours, 295 μg/mL (144 μg/mL, 567 μg/mL) every 12 hours, and 312 μg/mL (151 μg/mL, 606 μg/mL) every 8 hours in 200 virtual patients with CRS. Overall, the simulated tocilizumab concentrations after four IV infusion doses, whether the doses were administered every 24 hours, 12 hours or 8 hours, were generally below the observed highest Cmax of 649 μg/mL in five healthy subjects after a single dose of 28 mg/kg in Trial BP19461.

Study BP19461 (evaluation of the safety of supra-therapeutic doses of RoActemra)

<!-- image -->

Study BP19461 consisted of a Part 1 (an evaluation of the safety of supra-therapeutic doses following single doses in healthy subjects) and a Part 2 (an evaluation of the effect on QT interval following single doses  in  healthy  subjects)  and  aimed  to  investigate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  tocilizumab  at supra-therapeutic doses in healthy subjects in order to support the dose selection for part 2 of the study (thorough  QT  study)  and  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  tocilizumab  at  supra-therapeutic doses in healthy subjects.

The  PK  of  tocilizumab  was  characterised  by  nonlinear  kinetics  over  the  dose  range  tested.  CL  was concentration-dependent. There was no deviation from a dose proportional increase for Cmax (p = 0.168 for deviation from dose proportionality); and a more than dose proportional increase in AUCinf after doses of 2 to 28 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.0001 for deviation from dose proportionality). The over-proportional increase in AUCinf with increasing dose seemed more pronounced between the 2 and 10 mg/kg doses than between the higher doses (10, 20 and 28 mg/kg). The highest systemic exposures to tocilizumab were achieved with  the  28  mg/kg  dose,  with  mean  AUCinf  and  Cmax  values  of  147000  h*μg/mL  and  558  μg/mL, respectively.  Mean  CL  was  estimated  as  0.609  mL/h/kg  for  the  2  mg/kg  dose  and  decreased  with increasing doses to 0.192 mL/h/kg for the highest dose of 28 mg/kg. Mean t1/2 ranged from 54 hours after 2 mg/kg to 293 hours after 28 mg/kg. Mean Vss ranged from 50.0 (2 mg/kg) to 85.7 mL/kg (20 mg/kg). Median tmax was between 3 and 4 hours for all doses investigated.

Single doses of 2, 10, 20 and 28 mg/kg of tocilizumab were well tolerated. No unexpected safety findings were  observed.  Although  the  28  mg/kg  dose  was  associated  with  no  immediate  safety  issues,  the potential implications of decreases in neutrophils over a prolonged period of time with this dose precluded

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

its selection for part 2 of the study. The 20 mg/kg dose was considered the highest safe and tolerable dose to be administered to a large group of healthy volunteers in the thorough QT part of the study.

- Neutropenia: TQT study (Report 1028608).

The most common marked laboratory abnormality in the TQT study (BP19461) was low neutrophil counts (defined as an absolute value below 1.5 x 10 9 /L and a decrease of 20% below baseline). In Part 1 of the study (Report 1025632), there was a dose-dependent increase in incidence of low neutrophil counts with 5/5 subjects with TCZ 28 mg/kg. Three of these five subjects had infection-related AEs of mild nasal congestion, mild mouth ulceration, mild vaginal candidiasis and mild herpes simplex. The remaining two subjects did not report infection-related AEs. In Part 2 (Report 1028608), the markedly low neutrophil counts were observed in 3/29 subjects in the placebo group,18/30 in the TCZ 10 mg/kg group, 23/31 subjects in the TCZ 20 mg/kg group and 2/31 in the moxifloxacin 400 mg group. Of the 46 subjects with markedly low neutrophil counts, 14 also had markedly low WBCs (defined as an absolute value below 3.0 x 10 9 /L and a decrease of 30% below baseline). Decreases were observed in mean neutrophil counts following single doses of TCZ over the first 2 days post-treatment, reaching a maximum at approximately 24 hours after the infusion (i.e., Day 2). The mean minimum value for neutrophil counts (NTTmin) for subjects who received TCZ was similar: 1.42 x 10 9 /L after 10 mg/kg and 1.31 x 10 9 /L after 20 mg/kg; low neutrophil count recovered faster in subjects who received TCZ 10 mg/kg compared with subjects who received TCZ 20 mg/kg. There was no reduction in neutrophil count with placebo. The period of low neutrophil counts following either dose was not accompanied by an increase in immature neutrophils.

Although the observed incidence of marked decreases in neutrophil counts increased with the higher dose of tocilizumab (23/31 subjects in the tocilizumab 20 mg/kg group and 18/30 in the tocilizumab 10 mg/kg group), there did not appear to be a corresponding increase in the observed incidence of AEs, specifically the incidence of infections.

- Neutropenia: Population PK-PD based approach in a large RA patient database

A popPK-PD based approach (SCP for IV BLA) was taken to evaluate the correlation between TCZ levels and neutropenia (as an AE or lab abnormality) using pooled data from the two adult Phase III studies (WA17822 and WA18063) with a total of 16623 neutrophil values from 1702 RA patients based on mostly on IV doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg given every 4 weeks (Q4W). The model predictive performance was subsequently evaluated using internal and external validation, the latter with the data from study WA18062 (4285 neutrophil values from 444 patients).

There was a clear exposure-response relationship for neutrophil count. Neutrophil count decreased with increasing exposure. The stimulation of the loss rate of neutrophils from the blood compartment by TCZ (Kout) was best described by a sigmoid Emax relationship in the indirect response model. The typical serum TCZ concentration at which 50% of the maximum effect (EC50) is reached, was 7.42 µg/mL (betweenpatient variability of 79%). The maximum effect of TCZ on the stimulation of neutrophil loss from the blood compartment (Emax) was estimated at 0.792 (between-patient variability of 39%), translating into a mean maximum decrease of circulating neutrophils of 44%. The hill coefficient above unity (2.16) indicated a relatively steep relationship between exposure and circulating neutrophils.

Within a dosing interval, Emax is reached with concentrations for both 4 and 8 mg/kg. However, for 8 mg/kg, the concentrations stay at Emax for a longer period of time. This does not lead to a worsening of neutrophil decline but only to less fluctuation between infusions for this dose. Neutrophil time courses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were simulated for the 4 and 8 mg/kg doses using the above model. At 8 mg/kg, fluctuations in neutrophil count were less pronounced than at 4 mg/kg as the TCZ effect on the neutrophil decrease was close to its maximum effect, suggesting that with higher TCZ exposures, neutrophil count reaches a plateau with no further decrease.

The above model was also used to calculate the percentage of patients with Grade 1 to 4 AEs of neutropenia (Table 5). The exposure-dependent effect on neutrophil decreases did not result in an increased incidence of Grade 4 (&lt; 0.5*10 9 /L) neutropenia. This is consistent with results observed in the Phase III studies.

## Paediatric patients

In paediatric patients, Cmax has also been characterised. The highest model predicted concentrations are in the systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) population with values ranging from 109-382 µg/ml (mean 245 µg/ml). TCZ administered to paediatric patients with sJIA induces a decline in circulating neutrophil counts. PopPK-PD model was used to describe the relationship between TCZ concentrations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and the time course of neutrophil decline. EC50 value was 6.38 µg/mL (%RSE 15.8%), a value very similar to EC50 of 7.49 µg/mL (%RSE 2.2%) estimated for the adult patients. The Emax value of 0.724 (%RSE 14.8%) was also similar to Emax of 0.788 (%RSE 2.4%) in adult patients.

## Exposure-safety analysis

Study WA18221 was a phase III study investigating the efficacy and safety of TCZ in the treatment of sJIA using the same TCZ IV doses proposed for CRS (i.e. 12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg, 8 mg/kg for patients ≥ 30 kg) but given in a chronic use setting every 2 weeks for up to 5 years. The study comprised an initial randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled period of 12 weeks duration, followed by an openlabel extension where all patients received IV TCZ. This response focuses on the results obtained in the study up to Week 12 (included in variation EMEA/H/C/000955/II/015).

The safety profile in study WA18221 was consistent with the well-established safety profile of TCZ. The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, reversible, and not treatment-limiting, and were mostly infections, driven by upper respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis and gastroenteritis. There were few SAEs, no deaths, and no withdrawals due to laboratory abnormalities. There were no sustained significant laboratory changes from baseline, including in lipids, liver enzymes, renal function, haemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelets.

The incidence of infections was higher in the &lt; 30 kg body weight group who received 12 mg/kg IV TCZ Q2W compared to the ≥ 30 kg group who received 8 mg/kg IV TCZ Q2W. However, several factors could have contributed to this finding. Patients weighing &lt; 30 kg were younger, and upper respiratory infections are seen frequently and are typical in young children. In addition, a higher proportion of patients weighing &lt; 30 kg were receiving concomitant MTX and corticosteroids at baseline compared to the ≥ 30 kg group (MTX 81.6% vs 56.8%, and CS ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/d; 74% vs 24%, respectively).

The results of exposure-safety analyses were consistent with those obtained in the adult RA clinical trial program. A summary of percentages of patients reporting AEs and SAEs by body system and preferred term to Week 12 was performed by AUC2weeks, Cmax and Cmin exposure quartiles. When comparing AEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles, there was no trend towards an increased incidence in the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE with increasing TCZ exposure in the infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, or respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders system organ classes. Other AEs occurred at a low incidence across exposure quartiles. When comparing SAEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles, most SAEs occurred in patients in the first exposure quartile (Q1) and, therefore, there was no trend toward an increased incidence in percentage of patients with SAEs with increasing TCZ exposure.

An analysis of low neutrophil counts by PK exposure quartiles (AUC2weeks, Cmin, Cmax) showed a trend towards more severe neutropenia with higher TCZ exposures, as mean exposures (AUC2weeks, Cmin, Cmax)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were similar between patients with grade 0 (n=59) and grade 2 low neutrophil counts (n=10), whereas patients with CTC grade 3 events (n=5) had higher TCZ exposures (Table 9). These findings were consistent with those observed in adult RA.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Emerging evidence suggests that IL-6 is the cytokine that is the central mediator of toxicity in CRS. IL-6 is  produced  by  a  wide  variety  of  cell  types,  including  T-cells,  B-cells,  monocytes,  macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic and endothelial cells. IL-6 also acts on a wide variety of cell types and is involved in T-cell differentiation and activation, B-cell maturation, neutrophil trafficking.

CRS is associated with high IL-6 levels (Panelli et al. 2004; Doessegger and Longauer Banholzer, 2015; Lee et al. 2014a). For patients treated with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, IL-6 may correlate with the severity of CRS, with patients who experience severe or life-threatening CRS (CTCAE Grades 4 or 5) having much higher IL-6 levels compared to their counterparts who do not experience CRS or who experience milder CRS reactions (CTCAE Grades 0-3; Chen et al. 2016). IL-6 levels during a CRS episode are highly elevated, to the ng/mL range, which given the known biology of IL-6 would cause significant IL-6 transsignalling and a marked inflammatory response.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

Although the plasma levels of tocilizumab in the approved indications and dose regiments is much lower, e.g.  pJIA  and  sJIA  (see  tables  below),  the  maximum  observed  Cmax  was  649 μg/mL  in  five  healthy subjects  after  a  single  dose  of  28  mg/kg  tocilizumab  during  a  study  to  evaluate  of  the  safety  of supratherapeutic doses following single doses in healthy subjects. Tocilizumab doses of 2, 10, 20 and 28 mg/kg  were  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  over  a  1  hour  period.  The  highest  systemic exposures to tocilizumab were achieved with the 28 mg/kg dose, with mean AUCinf and Cmax values of 147000  h*μg/mL  and  558  μg/mL,  respectively.  Mean  CL  was  estimated  as  0.609  mL/h/kg  for  the  2 mg/kg dose and decreased with increasing doses to 0.192 mL/h/kg for the highest dose of 28 mg/kg. Mean t1/2 ranged from 54 hours after 2 mg/kg to 293 hours after 28 mg/kg. Mean Vss ranged from 50.0 (2 mg/kg) to 85.7 mL/kg (20 mg/kg). Median tmax was between 3 and 4 hours for all doses investigated.

Single doses of 2, 10, 20 and 28 mg/kg of tocilizumab were well tolerated. No unexpected safety findings were observed. Of note is that although the 28 mg/kg dose was associated with no immediate safety issues, the potential implications of decreases in neutrophils over a prolonged period of time with this dose, precluded its selection for part 2 of the study. The 20 mg/kg dose was considered the highest safe

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and tolerable dose to be administered to a large group of healthy volunteers in the thorough QT part of this study. This dose resulted in mean Cmax of 410 µg/mL.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics (PK) data from the CAR T-cell trials were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ. The PK population included 15 male and 12 female patients  of  median  age  12  years  (range,  4-23  years).  The  geometric  mean  (%  CV)  maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T-cell-induced, severe or life-threatening CRS was 99.5 µ g/mL  (36.8%)  after  the  first  infusion  and  160.7 µ g/mL  (113.8%)  after  the  second  infusion.  The population PK model developed in paediatric patients with SJIA over-predicted the PK data from patients with  CRS,  thus  the  population  PK  model  was  refined  with  higher  linear  clearance  (CL)  of  0.50  L/day (relative standard error, RSE = 10.8%) and volume of distribution in central compartment (VC) of 1.8 L (RSE = 11.2%) using PK data from patients with CRS. Simulations were thereafter conducted using the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

refined  PK  model  to  simulate  the  PK  profiles  of  tocilizumab  in  patients  with  CRS  after  four  doses  of tocilizumab every 24 hours, 12 hours or 8 hours. As the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in previous  trials  for  tocilizumab,  the  'safety  threshold'  from  previous  clinical  experience  was  used  to determine the acceptable dosage regimen for patients with CRS. The maximum observed Cmax at steady state  was  547  μg/mL  and  no  trend  was  observed  towards  increased  incidence  in  AEs  or  SAEs  with increasing  tocilizumab  exposure  in  122  patients.  The  simulated  median  (2.5th,  97.5th  percentiles)  of tocilizumab Cmax was 259 μg/mL (131 μg/mL, 495 μg/mL) after four IV infusion doses administered every 24 hours, 295 μg/mL (144 μg/mL, 567 μg/mL) every 12 hours, and 312 μg/mL (151 μg/mL, 606 μg/mL) every 8 hours in 200 virtual patients with CRS.

The scientific rationale for the mechanism of action, i.e. blocking the pro-inflammatory action of IL-6 using the anti-IL-6R antibody is already established.

Overall, it is expected that Cmax of tocilizumab after administration of 2 doses separated by at least 8 hours would be comparable to the concentrations reached in other approved indications (e.g. pJIA, sJIA; see tables above). An exposure- safety analysis is presented to resolve any uncertainty about the tocilizumab exposure that might be reached after up to 4 doses; these data revealed no significant clinical findings (see discussion on clinical safety).

According to PK modelling conducted, the estimated median Cmax in patients with CRS treated with 4 doses tocilizumab separated by 8 hours is 312 μg/mL (2.5th, 97.5th percentiles: 151 μg/mL, 606 μg/mL) and therefore higher than the exposure of the presently approved posology. PK data from subjects that have been exposed to comparable tocilizumab concentrations (up to the maximum estimated Cmax of 606 µg/mL) in the overall tocilizumab clinical development program were provided; a summary of IV TCZ studies and associated Cmax in adults and paediatrics was presented. Comparable maximum TCZ concentrations that are expected to be reached after 4 doses separated by 8 hours (312 μg/mL; 151 μg/mL - 606 μg/mL) have solely been observed in 5 healthy adult subjects treated with 28 mg/kg TCZ in study BP19461.

In paediatrics, the highest Cmax were observed in the sJIA study WA18221 (245 ± 57.2 µg/mL). The intended posology in CRS is expected to lead to significantly higher exposure in paediatrics. A comparison of AEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles in Study WA18221 revealed no trend towards an increased incidence in the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE with increasing TCZ exposure. When comparing SAEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles most SAEs occurred in the first exposure quartile indicating that there was no trend towards an increased incidence in percentage of patients with SAEs with increasing TCZ exposure.

Independent of age (adults vs. paediatrics), a relationship between higher TCZ exposure and lower neutrophil count, is well studied however there was no correlation to any increase in the incidence of AEs, particularly infections (see discussion on Clinical Safety), therefore the CHMP did not raise any concern.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The clinical pharmacology data available are sufficient to support the role of RoActemra in CRS related to CAR-T therapy and the recommended posology.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

No dose response study was conducted.

The intended posology of tocilizumab in treatment of CAR T cell induced CRS is 8 mg/kg IV for subjects weighing ≥ 30 kg and 12 mg/kg IV for subjects weighing less than 30 kg, which corresponds to the IV dosing regimen in sJIA patients. Depending on the response, up to 4 doses of tocilizumab may be administered, separated by at least 8 hours.

## 2.4.2. Main studies Published retrospective analysis (Le et al, 2018)

This is a retrospective analysis of TCZ/CRS data from the CAR T-cell trials (Le et al. 2018).

## Methods

The clinical trials included 5 studies of CTL019 (A2201, B2101J, B2102J, B2202, B2205J) and 4 studies of KTE-C19 (101, 102, 103 and 104).

## Study participants

The patient population was restricted to patients with Grade 3 or 4 CRS and who had been treated using intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt;30 kg); this is the recommended dose approved for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

Treatment with tocilizumab was pre-specified in each protocol, but the exact dose, frequency and criteria for treatment varied. The efficacy-evaluable population was limited to patients who had been treated using intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg).

## Objectives

The primary objective was to characterise resolution of CRS which was defined as the patient having absence of fever and being off vasopressors for at least 24h.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Patients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, if no more than 2 doses of TCZ were needed, and if no drugs other than TCZ and corticosteroids were used for treatment.

Response after 2, 7, and 21 days was also assessed.

The majority of patients who achieved a response did so within the first 7 days (n = 8, 53.3%).

## Sample size

This was a retrospective analysis; no sample size calculations were performed.

## Randomisation

N/A

## Blinding (masking)

## Statistical methods

All results were reported descriptively. There was no inferential testing planned.

## Numbers analysed

The patient population was restricted to patients with Grade 3 or 4 CRS and who had been treated using intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt;30 kg); this is the recommended dose approved for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).

Of the 58 patients in CTL019 series treated with tocilizumab 45 subjects fulfilled these criteria.

Of the 76 patients treated with tocilizumab in KTE-C19 studies only 15 subjects fulfilled criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes and estimation

Eight patients (53%) with ALL, DLBCL or PMBCL from the KTE-C19 studies achieved a response within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, and the median time from the first dose of TCZ to response was 4.5 days (range, 2-7 days). The response rates were reported to be largely consistent among subgroups such as age group, sex, race, ethnicity, grade of CRS at first dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.

Thirty-one patients (69%) with ALL from the CTL-019 series achieved a response within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, and the median time from the first dose of TCZ to response was 4 days (range, 1-12 days). The response rates were reported to be largely consistent among subgroups such as age group, sex, race, ethnicity, grade of CRS at first dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.

Response after 2, 7, and 21 days was also assessed. The majority of patients who achieved a response did so within the first 7 days (n = 26, 57.8%).

## Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma- Study C2201

The application for the DLBCL indication is primarily based on one phase II, open-label, single arm trial in adult patients with r/r DLBCL (after ≥ 2 lines of chemotherapy and not eligible for SCT) (C2201/Juliet). All patients had to have a life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks, ECOG PS 0-1 and adequate organ function.

The  clinical  development  program  of  tisagenlecleucel  includes  one  Phase  II,  multi-centre,  single-arm study  to  evaluate  the  clinical  efficacy,  safety  and  cellular  kinetics  of  tisagenlecleucel  in  the  target population of r/r DLBCL.

Data from CTL019 treated patients experiencing CRS show marked elevations in IL-6, IFN-g, and less intensely TNF. The symptoms occur in 1-14 days after cell infusion and may include high fevers, rigors, myalgia/arthralgia, nausea/vomiting/anorexia, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypotension, dyspnoea,  tachypnoea  and  hypoxia.  Supportive  care  and  tocilizumab  have  been  used  for  effective management  of  CRS.  Prompt  responses  to  tocilizumab  have  been  seen  in  most  patients;  however, several patients with a suboptimal response to the first dose of tocilizumab have received a second dose of tocilizumab (within 3-5 days) with CRS resolution.

A  detailed  treatment  algorithm  has  been  established  with  clear  criteria  for  CRS  management  and guidance  on  when  to  administer  tocilizumab.  This  approach  was  designed  to  avoid  life-threatening toxicities, while attempting to allow the CTL019 transduced cells to establish a proliferative phase which appears to correlate with tumour response.

A modification of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) CRS grading scale has also been established to better reflect CTL019-therapy-associated CRS.

## Table 16: CAR-T therapy associated grading for CRS; The Penn Grading Scale for CRS (PGSCRS)

- Marked elevations in IL-6, interferon gamma and less intensely TNF
- Symptoms occur 1 to 14 days after cell infusion
- Symptoms may inelude: high fever, rigors, myalgia, aithralgia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, headache, hypotension, encephalopathy, dyspnea, tachypnea and hypoxia

## Adverse events of CRS

58% of patients with DLBCL experienced an AE of CRS. One patient (1.0%) was reported with histiocytosis hematophagy in addition to CRS. SAEs of CRS were reported in 29 patients (29.3%), and grade 3/4 events were reported in 23 patients (23.2%). There were no deaths due to CRS. CRS was graded according to the modified Penn grading system (Porter et al 2015), which is more conservative than the Lee grading scale (Lee et al 2014).

Events of CRS (n=57) were reported over a range of severities in the majority of patients treated with tisagenlecleucel and CRS was the most frequent SAE associated with tisagenlecleucel therapy.

## Management of CRS

Patients were treated up to the highest dose of 6.0×108 CAR+ viable T cells. CRS was generally manageable with supportive care and anti-IL6 cytokine directed therapy. Of the 57 patients with CRS:

- -43.9% were admitted to the ICU (within a median time to admission of 5 days) as a consequence of CRS, where they stayed for median (maximum) duration of 6 days (34 days).
- -42.1% required oxygen supplementation, and 14.0% needed mechanical ventilation. Four patients (7.0%) required renal dialysis, and parenteral nutrition during CRS was required by 5 patients (8.8%).
- -28.1% received systemic anti-cytokine therapy. Tocilizumab was administered in 26.3% patients. Eight of these patients had grade 4, 6 had grade 3, and one patient had grade 1/2 CRS.
- -Infections concurrent with CRS were reported in 12.3% patients.

Four patients (7.0%) required ICU admission due to CRS-related infections (lung infection, facial wound, GI infection (clostridium difficile) and infection in multiple sites (catheter tip, blood, GI, urine)).

Anti-IL-6 based therapies such as tocilizumab were administered for moderate or severe CRS associated with tisagenlecleucel. Tocilizumab was administered at doses that have been shown to be pharmacodynamically active and safe in approved indications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Systemic anti-cytokine therapy was given to 16 of the 57 patients (28.1%) who presented with CRS. Consistent with the protocol-defined management of CRS, 15 of the 16 patients treated with anti-cytokine therapy (26.3% of patients with CRS) received tocilizumab treatment (1 dose in 6 patients, 2 doses in 9 patients). Corticosteroids were used in 19.3% of patients with CRS.

Among the 15 patients who received tocilizumab, 6 patients presented with CRS of grade 3 severity and 8 patients with grade 4 CRS

The safety evaluation is based primarily on the pooled data from the single-arm, multicentre Studies CTL019B2202 (n=75) and CTL019B2205J (n=29), in which 104 paediatric and young adult patients (aged ≥ 3 years at screening to aged ≤ 21 years at the time of initial diagnosis) with r/r B-cell ALL were treated with a single tisagenlecleucel infusion. Pooling of Studies CTL019B2202 and CTL019B2205J is supported by the nearly identical study designs, and enrolled identical patient populations.

AEs suspected to be related to study drug were reported in 95.2% of patients. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported as the maximum grade in 26.0% and 48.1% patients respectively, any time post infusion. CRS was always considered to be related to study drug.

Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion SAEs were reported in 77.9% of infused patients; this high frequency is primarily due to the proportion of patients with CRS (64.4%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 25 (24%) patients; grade 3 in 24 (23.1%) patients and grade 4 in 1 patient. Grade 3/4 hypotension was reported in 12 (13.2%) patients, and is a known consequence of CRS.

CRS was the most frequently reported AESI within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (80.8%) (all events suspected to be study drug related), with no CRS events occurring &gt;8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion.

CRS events were reported with PTs of CRS (n=84) and histiocytosis hematophagic (n=5). Grade 3/4 events were reported in 46 (44.2%) patients. No patients died due to CRS.

CRS events occurred in median of 3.0 days (1-22 days) post-tisagenlecleucel infusion and the median duration was 8.0 days (range 1-36 days). Grade 3/4 events occurred at a median of 6.0 days (range 2-33 days) post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (Table 5-3).

The time course of onset of CRS after tisagenlecleucel infusion is reflected by the rise of inflammatory and cytokine parameters. Of note, all percentages are based on the number of patients with CRS. Only the first CRS episode is summarised for each patient.

Anti-cytokine therapy was received by 35 (41.7%) of the patients with CRS, tocilizumab was administered to all 35 patients; 19 of whom required only 1 dose of tocilizumab. Five patients (6%) received siltuximab and 19 patients (23%) had treatment with corticosteroids in addition to other anticytokine drugs.

## Study Zuma-1

ZUMA-1 is a Phase 1/2 multicentre, open-label study that has evaluated the safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with refractory aggressive NHL.

Cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS)  is  a  symptom  complex  associated  with  adoptive  cell  therapies  that activate lymphocytes. The goal of CRS management in anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is to prevent lifethreatening conditions while preserving the benefits of antitumor effects. In grading CRS, a CRS severity scale  associated  with  antibody therapeutics  was  published  by  NCI  investigators.  Appreciating  the  scale needed  to  be  adapted  for  other  therapeutics  to  define  mild,  moderate,  severe,  and  life-threatening events;  account  for  overlapping  symptoms;  and  guide  treatment  recommendations,  a  CRS  revised grading system was created by Lee et al. (2014).

All safety analyses were conducted using the safety analysis set. Amongst others, demographic and baseline disease characteristics, and levels of serum cytokines were analysed. AEs events of interest included identified risks (cytokine release syndrome [CRS]; neurologic AEs; cytopenias, including febrile neutropenia; and infection).

Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in 13% of subjects. All events had an onset within 2 weeks after the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel and all resolved, with the exception of the 2 Grade 5 events, both of which followed ongoing CRS events that started within the first week after the cell infusion.

Rates of Grade 3 or higher CRS decreased over the course of the study the incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS was 18% among the 62 subjects analysed at the second interim analysis and 5% among the 39 subjects enrolled afterwards. The rates of severe adverse reactions decreased over the course of the trial and were managed with supportive care, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids.

Individual symptoms of CRS were graded per CTCAE v4.01. Ninety-four subjects (93%) experienced CRS. The majority of subjects (81%) who experienced CRS had Grade 1 or Grade 2 CRS. Nine subjects (9%) had worst Grade 3 CRS, 3 subjects (3%) had worst Grade 4 CRS, and 1 subject (1%) had a Grade 5 CRS.

The most common CRS symptom of any grade was pyrexia (76%), followed by hypotension (41%), hypoxia (22%), tachycardia (21%), and chills (20%). Most of these events were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The most common Grade 3 or higher CRS events were pyrexia (11%), hypotension (9%), and hypoxia (9%).

Among the 93 subjects whose symptoms resolved, the median time to resolution of CRS symptoms was 8 days.

As of the data cut-off date (27 Jan 2017), CRS events had resolved in 98% of subjects, with the exceptions of HLH and anoxic brain injury in the setting of CRS, both of which resulted in the subject's death.

(1) CRS syndrome was graded based on the revised grading system of Lee et al, 2014. Individual symptoms (MedDRA Version 19.0 preferred terms) are graded per CICAE 4.03.

## ZUMA-1 and ZUMA-2 with supportive data from ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4

Among all 119 subjects, 110 subjects (92%) had CRS. Worst Grade 1 or Grade 2 CRS was observed in 94 subjects (79%); worst Grade 3 CRS was observed in 11 subjects (9%); worst Grade 4 CRS was observed in 4 subjects (3%), and a Grade 5 CRS (HLH) was observed in 1 subject. Overall, 16 subjects (13%) had Grade ≥ 3 CRS.

Grade 3 or higher CRS symptoms reported in ≥10% of subjects were pyrexia (15 subjects, 13%), hypotension (12 subjects, 10%), and hypoxia (13 subjects, 11%). No subject had new onset CRS that started &gt; 14 days after the cell infusion. Two subjects, 1 with anoxic brain injury and 1 with HLH, died after Day 30 due to events that occurred in the setting of CRS.

Starting from CRS Grade 2, tocilizumab was recommended to be administered at a dose of 8 mg/kg infused IV over 1 hour (dose should not exceed 800 mg) and repeated every 4-6 hours, as needed based on response, up to 3 doses in a 24hr period. If there was no significant improvement with tocilizumab (e.g. no change in grade of CRS), corticosteroids should be administered (e.g. methylprednisolone 1mg/kg BID or dexamethasone 10mg every 6 hours). High doses of corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 1g/day x3 followed by a rapid taper, based on response, consisting of 250mg BID x2 days, then 125mg BID x2 days and then 60mg BID x2 days) should be considered for life-threatening CRS.

Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in 13% of subjects. All events had an onset within 2 weeks after the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel and all resolved, with the exception of the 2 Grade 5 events, both of which followed ongoing CRS events that started within the first week after the cell infusion. Cardiac rhythm and cardiac failure disorders were observed in the setting of CRS. All cardiac events in the setting of CRS resolved.

## Supportive studies: Literature Search

The first report of TCZ being used successfully to treat CRS involved a 7-year-old female patient with ALL, who experienced severe CRS after receiving CTL019, an investigational second-generation CD19 CAR Tcell therapy (Grupp et al. 2013). Cytokine blockade with TCZ and etanercept resulted in a marked decrease in elevated cytokine and cytokine receptor levels and was effective in rapidly reversing severe/life-threatening CRS without affecting expansion of CAR T-cells or reducing anti-leukemic efficacy.

Another report appeared of a patient successfully treated with TCZ for CRS, this time a 7-year-old male patient with B-ALL who developed CRS/HLH following blinatumomab therapy (Teachey et al. 2013).

At least 55 patients reported in the literature to have received TCZ for the treatment of CRS following either CAR T-cell therapy (54 patients) or bispecific T-cell-engaging therapy (blinatumomab, 1 patient) (Table 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

A comprehensive search using PubMed was conducted by the MAH to identify publications on the use of TCZ for the treatment of CRS. Only those publications in which TCZ was stated to have been used (successfully or unsuccessfully) as a treatment for CRS were included. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov and NIH GeMCRIS database were searched for clinical trials investigating TCZ for the treatment of CRS, and reviewed the transcript and video of the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee symposium on Cytokine Release Syndrome after T-cell Immunotherapy held on June 10, 2015 (Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Meeting, 2015).

The literature search was conducted in June 2016. This search strategy yielded 22 publications, 20 of which originated from the US (7 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 13 meeting abstracts) and 2 from China (2 meeting abstracts).

From these publications, at least 55 patients had been treated with TCZ for CRS, of which at least 50 patients had been treated successfully (see figure below).

The presentations from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting held in December 2016 and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) held in April 2017 were reviewed to update the literature search with results from two recently completed phase II trials, namely the pivotal ELIANA study evaluating tisagenlecleucel-T (CTL019; Grupp et al. 2016), and the pivotal ZUMA-1 study evaluating axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19; Locke et al. 2017).

## Treatments

The marketed IV formulation of TCZ (Actemra/RoActemra solution for infusion) from commercial sources was used in the literature reports describing use of TCZ as a treatment for CRS.

Davila et al. reported that administration of tocilizumab as a first-line therapy for sCRS in patients MSKALL13, MSK-ALL14, and MSK-ALL17 similarly reduced fevers and ameliorated clinical symptoms without apparent effect on 19-28z CAR-T cell expansion and persistence. However, a decrease in CAR-T cells was also observed in some patients.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The proposed indication is supported by the clinical data relevant to patients treated with tocilizumab following the administration of CAR-T cell therapies. It is further substantiated by published data (either full-text manuscripts or conference abstracts) describing the effectiveness of tocilizumab in treating severe or life-threatening CRS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The efficacy of RoActemra for the treatment of CRS was assessed in a retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapies (tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel) for haematological malignancies. Evaluable patients had been treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS; only the first episode of CRS was included in the analysis. The efficacy population for the tisagenlecleucel cohort included 28 males and 23 females (total 51 patients) of median age 17 years (range, 3-68 years). The median time from start of CRS to first dose of tocilizumab was 3 days (range, 0-18 days). Resolution of CRS was defined as lack of fever and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours. Patients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of tocilizumab, if no more than 2 doses of RoActemra were needed, and no drugs other than RoActemra and corticosteroids were used for treatment. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%; 95% CI: 62.5%-87.2%) achieved a response with no more than 2 doses of TCZ. In an independent cohort of 15 patients (range: 9-75 years old) with axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced CRS, 53% responded with no more than 2 doses of TCZ.

The studies evaluating CAR-T treatments were not planned for the evaluation of the effect of tocilizumab on  CRS  and  no  direct  comparisons  can  be  made.  Furthermore,  co-medication  with  corticosteroids  was allowed,  and  no  subgroup  analysis  for  patients  treated  with  /  without  corticosteroids  was  foreseen. However, the observations of rapid effects on objective early endpoints, such as vital signs (Fitzgerald et al 2017; Brudno et al 2016; Davila et al 2014) provided significant evidence on the role of tocilizumab in the resolution of this life threatening adverse event.

Overall, data indicate that following a treatment guidance algorithm for CRS management CRS can be resolved. These algorithms included vigilant supportive care, including empiric treatment of concurrent bacterial  infections  and  maintenance  of  adequate  hydration  and  blood  pressure.  This  standard  therapy was recommended for every grade of CRS. Additional treatment specifically directed to resolving the CRS (e.g. corticosteroids or tocilizumab) was to be given for higher grades of CRS.

Using the approved dose regimens in adults (RA) and children (sJIA and pJIA) as a guide, the MAH proposes a posology for treatment of CRS given as a 60-minute intravenous infusion is 8 mg/kg in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg in patients weighing less than 30 kg - with an option to repeat for up to 3 additional doses if clinical improvement did not occur within 24 to 48 h. RoActemra can be given alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The interval between consecutive doses should be at least 8 hours. Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in CRS patients.

Further discussion is needed to explore the possibility of collecting and sharing data on the use of tocilizumab (such as data from registries) across actual- and future- MAH of CAR-T cell products - in the context of the next revision of the RMP.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy.

Data submitted demonstrate efficacy of tocilizumab in the resolution of CRS due to CAR-T therapy. The proposed posology is based on the previously observed safe blood concentrations in clinical studies in the clinical development program for TCZ. In higher grade CRS, co-administration with corticosteroids and other concomitant medication might be needed.

Discussion focusing on the possibility of collecting and sharing data on the use of tocilizumab in the management of CRS due to CAR-T therapy - across MAHs for the respective products will be addressed in the next RMP revision (due 22.08.18 - either within a parallel variation or as a standalone submission).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety of tocilizumab has been well characterised in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). The safety of tocilizumab in the proposed CRS indication is evaluated based on observed safe blood concentrations in pharmacology studies in connection with the known safety profile of tocilizumab.

## Patient exposure

See clinical efficacy section for available data on patient exposure from published literature.

## Adverse events

Discussion on exposure-safety relationship focusses on neutropenia. Additionally, exposure relationships were investigated for SAEs and AEs by system organ class (see Clinical Pharmacology section).

No additional safety concerns for patients receiving TCZ in the treatment are anticipated.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

See discussion on exposure - safety relationship (Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Safety).

## Laboratory findings

The following safety laboratory parameters were investigated in the context of exposure - safety analyses: For haematology: haemoglobin, white blood cells, neutrophil, eosinophil and lymphocyte counts, platelets. For biochemistry: alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, cholesterol-HDL, cholesterol-LDL, triglycerides.

No new findings in terms of laboratory investigations specific to tocilizumab were observed.

## Safety in special populations

See discussion on the paediatric population under Clinical pharmacology.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No specific DDI studies have been conducted

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

No data on discontinuation of tocilizumab due to adverse events were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Post marketing experience

Not applicable.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety of tocilizumab has been well characterised in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in adults and paediatric populations above the age of 2 years. The safety of tocilizumab in the proposed CRS indication and posology can solely be evaluated based on previously observed safe blood concentrations and the known safety profile of tocilizumab.

From the CAR T-cell trials the pharmacokinetics (PK) data were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ. The PK population included 15 male and 12 female patients of median age 12 years (range, 4-23 years). The geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T-cell-induced, severe or life-threatening CRS was 99.5 µ g/mL (36.8%) after the first infusion and 160.7 µ g/mL (113.8%) after the second infusion.

The results of the simulations suggested that TCZ concentrations after up to 4 doses given 8 hours apart would remain within the bounds of previously observed safe blood concentrations, e.g. clinical studies in the clinical development program for TCZ (see also Clinical Pharmacology). A comparison of AEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles in Study WA18221 revealed no trend towards an increased incidence in the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE with increasing TCZ exposure. When comparing SAEs across AUC2weeks exposure quartiles most SAEs occurred in the first exposure quartile indicating that there was no trend towards an increased incidence in percentage of patients with SAEs with increasing TCZ exposure. With respect to neutropenia, more severe neutropenia was observed with higher TCZ exposures. However, this finding as well as the overall paediatric safety profile was consistent with the known TCZ safety profile in the adult population and thus, the same conclusion may be drawn.

No reports on adverse drug reactions due to tocilizumab administration were received in the context of the trials reviewed. Since there was no way to differentiate between adverse events caused by CAR-T cell therapies from any adverse events potentially caused by tocilizumab, the following statement has been included in section 4.8 of the RoActemra IV SmPC as follows:

'The safety of tocilizumab in CRS has been evaluated in a retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials, where 51 patients were treated with intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients less than 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CAR T-cellinduced CRS. A median of 1 dose of tocilizumab (range, 1-4 doses) was administered'.

A discussion on the possibility of collecting and sharing safety data with the use of tocilizumab (such as spontaneous reports to the MAH and data from registries) across actual- and future- MAH of CAR-T cell products, will be included in the next revision of the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of tocilizumab is well known. No new safety findings have been reported.

Given the low number of patients exposed to higher doses the applicant is asked to further characterise the safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome post authorisation. Data on the timing of tocilizumab administration relative to the nature and onset of adverse events should be collected.

The MAH will include proposed relevant measures in the upcoming RMP revision either within a parallel variation or as a standalone submission).

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

No risk management plan was submitted. The risk management plan version is being revised in the context of the ongoing procedure II/76.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Cytokine release syndrome is an expected AE in patients infused with tisagenlecleucel or axicabtagene ciloleucel as a class-effect of T-cell directed therapies and an on-target effect related to the mechanism of action.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

CAR-T therapy is an emerging promising option in oncology patients -with the most serious safety concern being the risk of developing CRS. Treatment of cytokine release syndrome as an ADR of CAR-T cell therapies is based on a severity grading scale and a specific algorithm. Multiple approaches have been used to treat low grade CRS, however severe CRS is a medical emergency and requires prompt and effective treatment to avoid serious complications or fatal outcome. There is therefore a high unmet medical need for an effective treatment for severe or life-threatening CRS following CAR-T cell therapy, to ensure safe use of this novel treatment in oncology patients.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

A retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapies (tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel) for haematological malignancies was performed. Evaluable patients had been treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS; only the first episode of CRS was included in the analysis.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The efficacy population for the tisagenlecleucel cohort included 28 males and 23 females (total 51 patients) of median age 17 years (range, 3-68 years). The median time from start of CRS to first dose of tocilizumab was 3 days (range, 0-18 days). Resolution of CRS was defined as lack of fever and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours. Patients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of tocilizumab, if no more than 2 doses of RoActemra were needed, and no drugs other than RoActemra and corticosteroids were used for treatment. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%; 95% CI: 62.5%87.2%) achieved a response. In an independent cohort of 15 patients (range: 9-75 years old) with axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced CRS, 53% responded.

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

There are no uncertainties about the favourable effects of tocilizumab in the resolution of CRS due to CAR-T therapy.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

No new unfavourable effects have been reported.

## 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

There were no specific assessments for the safety of tocilizumab in these settings. However, there were no reports of adverse reactions to tocilizumab in patients studied. Further collection of data will be addressed in the next revision of the RMP.

Given the low number of patients exposed to higher doses the applicant is asked to further characterise the safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome post authorisation. Data on the timing of tocilizumab administration relative to the nature and onset of adverse events should be collected.

## 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Severe or life-threatening CRS following CAR-T cell therapy is a medical emergency, and requires prompt and effective treatment to avoid serious complications or a fatal outcome. There is therefore a high unmet medical need for an effective treatment for CRS, to avoid limiting the use of this emerging, novel and important treatment option. Given the curative potential of CAR-T therapy in oncology patients with limited options and the need to effectively manage the CRS side effect, the favourable effects of tocilizumab largely outweigh the currently known safety profile and any uncertainties.

The proposed posology is based on the previously observed safe blood concentrations in clinical studies in the clinical development program for tocilizumab. In higher grade CRS, co-administration with corticosteroids and other concomitant medication might be needed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

Treatment of CRS with tocilizumab as anti-cytokine therapy is effective and can be safely administered in the already approved doses due to the well-known general safety profile of TCZ.

The proposed TCZ dose of 8 mg/kg IV (12 mg/kg IV for patients &lt; 30 kg) administered up to 4 times at least 8 hours apart to be medically justified, and have an appropriate benefit-risk profile.

## 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable.

## 3.8. Conclusions

The overall B/R of RoActemra is positive in the indication 'treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older'.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include 'treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older' for the RoActemra 20mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk management plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

At the request of the European Medicines Agency;

Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

An updated RMP shall be submitted by 22 nd  August, either within a parallel variation or as a standalone submission.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0181/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of indication to include 'treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older' for the RoActemra 20mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion.
