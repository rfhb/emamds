## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

The radionuclide generator contains germanium ( 68 Ge) as mother nuclide which decays to the daughter nuclide gallium ( 68 Ga). The germanium ( 68 Ge) used for the production of the ( 68 Ge/ 68 Ga) generator is no carrier added. The total radioactivity due to germanium ( 68 Ge) and gamma-ray-emitting impurities in the eluate is not more than 0.001%.

The GalenVita 0.74 -3.70 GBq radionuclide generator is a system for the elution of sterile gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2464. This solution is eluted from a column on which the mother nuclide germanium ( 68 Ge), parent of gallium ( 68 Ga), is fixed. The system is shielded. Physical characteristics of both mother and daughter nuclides are summarised in table 1.

Data derived from nudat (www.nndc.bnl.gov)

4 ml of the eluate from the radionuclide generator with highest strength (3.70 GBq) contains a potential maximum of 3700 MBq of  68 Ga and 37.0 kBq of  68 Ge (0.001 % breakthrough in the eluate). This corresponds to 2.4 ng of gallium and 0.14 ng of germanium.

The quantity of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling Ph. Eur. that may be eluted from the radionuclide generator is dependent on the quantity of germanium ( 68 Ge) present on the date/time of elution, the volume of eluent used (typically 4 ml) and the elapsed time since the previous elution. If

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mother and daughter nuclides are in equilibrium, more than 55 % of the present gallium ( 68 Ga) activity can be eluted.

Table 2 summarises the activity on the radionuclide generator, the minimum activities obtained by elution at the start of the shelf-life and at the end of the shelf-life as well as the potential maxima of 68 Ga and  68 Ge in the eluate.

The radionuclide generator provides after elution a sterile gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling. The solution is clear and colourless.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1. Therapeutic indications

This radionuclide generator is not intended for direct use in patients.

The sterile eluate (gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution) from the radionuclide generator GalenVita is indicated for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation developed and approved for radiolabelling with such eluate, to be used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

## 4.2. Posology and method of administration

This medicinal product is for use in designated nuclear medicine facilities only and should only be handled by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling.

## Posology

The quantity of the eluate gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution required for radiolabelling and the quantity of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical that is subsequently administered will depend on the kit that is to be radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Paediatric population

Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled with 68 Ga for more information concerning its paediatric use.

## Method of administration

The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is not intended for direct use in patients but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation. The route of administration of the 68 Galabelled radiopharmaceutical is defined in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the respective kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation and should be adhered to.

For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

## 4.3. Contraindications

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution should not be administered directly to the patient.

The use of 68 Ga-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

For information on contraindications to particular 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals prepared by radiolabelling with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4. Special warnings and precautions for use

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling is not to be administered directly to the patient but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation.

Unintended direct administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may lead to increased radiation exposure to patients (see sections 4.9, 5.2, and 11). Accidental administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling containing 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid may also cause local venous irritation and, in case of paravenous injection, tissue necrosis. The catheter or affected area should be irrigated with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection.

Safe handling of GalenVita and its eluate in accordance with the instructions in this document should be permanently ensured to protect patients and healthcare professionals from unintentional excess radiation exposure (see sections 6 and 12).

68 Ge breakthrough can increase in the eluate above 0.001 % if the radionuclide generator is not eluted for several days (see section 12). All instructions provided in section 12 should be strictly followed to avoid the risk of excess exposure to 68 Ge.

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The radioactivity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required information.

## General warnings

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

Precautions with respect to environmental hazard are included in section 6.6.

## 4.5. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies of the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling with other medicinal products have been performed, because it is used for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products.

For information concerning interactions associated with the use of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 4.6. Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

When administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is important to determine whether she is pregnant or not. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

Radionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. Only essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit far exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

Before administering a radiopharmaceutical to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breast-feeding. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be interrupted, and the expressed feeds discarded.

Further information concerning the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical in pregnancy and breastfeeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Fertility

Further information concerning the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical concerning fertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

## 4.7. Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Effects on ability to drive and use machines following administration of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 4.8. Undesirable effects

Possible adverse reactions following the use of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical will be dependent on the specific kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9. Overdose

Excess radiation exposure may occur if higher than recommended activity of a 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical is administered to a patient. For further information refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

No toxic effects are to be expected from the free 68 Ga after an inadvertent administration of the eluate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The administered free 68 Ga decays almost completely to stable 68 Zn within a short time (97 % are decayed in 6 hours). During this time, 68 Ga is mainly concentrated in the blood/plasma (bound to transferrin) and in the urine. The patient should be hydrated to increase the excretion of the 68 Ga. Forced diuresis as well as frequent bladder voiding is recommended.

Human radiation dose in case of an inadvertent administration of the eluate should be estimated using the information given in section 11.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V09X.

The pharmacodynamic properties of  68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical prepared by radiolabelling with the radionuclide generator eluate prior to administration will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product (carrier molecule) to be labelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with GalenVita radionuclide generator in all subsets of the paediatric population as it is a radiolabelling agent. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

## 5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is not intended for direct use in patients but is used for in vitro radiolabelling of various kits for radiopharmaceutical preparation. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals will depend on the nature of carrier molecules to be radiolabelled.

The absorption, distribution, and excretion of free 68 Ga following direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution were investigated in rats. The rat study has shown that following direct intravenous administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, 68 Ga is slowly cleared from the blood with a biological half-life of 188 h in male and 254 h in female rats. This is because free Ga 3+ likely behaves in a similar way as Fe 3+ . However, as the biological half-life of 68 Ga is much longer than its physical half-life (67.71 min), at 188 h or 254 h almost all 68 Ga anyway decays to inactive 68 Zn. Already in 6 h approx. 97 % of the initial 68 Ga disappear via decay to 68 Zn.

In rats, 68 Ga was excreted predominantly into the urine, with some retention in the liver and kidneys. The organs with the highest 68 Ga activity, other than blood, plasma, and urine, were liver, lungs, spleen, and bones. In female rats, the 68 Ga activity in female genital organs, i.e., uterus and ovaries, was comparable to that seen in the lungs. 68 Ga activity in the testes was very low.

According to the dose estimates based on rat data, the sex-averaged effective dose for adults is 0.035 mSv/MBq. This is equal to the effective dose of 8.75 mSv from an accidental injection of a typical radiopharmaceutical activity of 250 MBq (see section 11 for more details).

The activity resulting from 68 Ge breakthrough in the rat study was extremely low and is not of clinical importance.

## 5.3. Preclinical safety data

The toxicological properties of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals prepared by in vitro radiolabelling with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution will depend on the nature of the kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled.

## 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

## 6.1 List of excipients

Column matrix

Titanium dioxide

Solution for elution

0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

Radiolabelling of carrier molecules with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.

It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acids should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.

It is recommended not to use uncoated chlorobutyl stoppers for the elution vial as they may contain considerable amounts of zinc that is extracted by the acidic eluate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Warm temperatures substantially exceeding 25 °C can reversibly reduce the yield of 68 Ga in the eluate to below 55 %. Therefore, to obtain optimal elution yield (≥ 55 %), the radionuclide generator should be operated at temperatures not exceeding 25 °C. If the radionuclide generator is routinely stored at higher temperatures, make sure to equilibrate it at &lt; 25 °C for several hours before elution. Elutions at temperatures above 25 °C are nevertheless possible and will not harm the radionuclide generator or have an impact on the quality of the eluate except for the possibly reduced yield of 68 Ga.

Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulations on radioactive materials.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use

The generator consists of a PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) column and PEEK upper and bottom caps which are attached to PEEK inlet and outlet lines via HPLC-style finger tight fittings. These lines are connected to two unions that pass through the outer case of the GalenVita generator. The column is contained within the radiation shield assembly.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## General warnings

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used, and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

The radionuclide generator must not be disassembled for any reason as this may damage the internal components and possibly lead to a leak of radioactive material. Also, disassembly of the outer case will expose the radiation shielding to the operator.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.

The residual activity of the radionuclide generator must be estimated before disposal.

Any unused gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution for radiolabelling or radiolabelled medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

The radiation dose received by the various organs following intravenous administration of a 68 Garadiolabelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation being radiolabelled. Information on radiation dosimetry of each different 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical following its administration will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the particular kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation.

The dosimetry table 3 is presented in order to support the assessment of the contribution by unbound 68 Ga to the radiation dose following the administration of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceutical or of the radiation dose resulting from an inadvertent intravenous injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

The dosimetry estimates were based on a rat distribution study. Time points for measurements were 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes and 180 minutes.

Sex-averaged effective dose resulting from an inadvertently intravenously injected gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, calculated according to the 103 ICRP publication, is 0.035 mSv/MBq.

The sex-averaged effective dose for adults is 0.035 mSv/MBq. Following accidental administration of 250 MBq of 68GaCl₃, the effective dose is 8.75 mSv in adults.

Effective doses from an accidental injection of a typical radiopharmaceutical activity of 3.76 MBq/kg BW in paediatric patients are as follows: 4.336 mSv in newborn, 5.602 mSv in 1 year, 5.312 mSv in 5 years, 5.793 mSv in 10 years, 6.394 mSv in 15 years.

## External radiation exposure

The average surface or contact radiation for the radionuclide generator is less than 0.09 µSv/h per MBq of 68Ge, but local hot spots of higher radiation can occur. Nevertheless, a 3.70 GBq radionuclide generator will reach an overall average surface dose rate of approx. 337 µSv/h. It is generally recommended that the radionuclide generator is stored within auxiliary shielding to minimise dose to operating personnel.

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Elution of the radionuclide generator must be performed in premises complying with the national regulations concerning the safety of use of radioactive products.

Maximum cumulative number of elutions over the shelf-life: 1000

The general handling, the attachment of tubing, the exchange of the sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid container, the elution of the generator and other activities potentially exposing the generator to the environment should be undertaken using aseptic techniques in an appropriate clean environment according to current national legislation.

## Preparation

Unpacking of the radionuclide generator:

1. Check outer shipping package for shipping damage. If damaged, perform radiation wipe survey of the damaged area. If counts exceed 40 counts per second per 100 cm 2 , notify your Radiation Safety Officer.
2. Cut security seal on the lock of the shipping package and open the lid.

3. Carefully remove radionuclide generator using the handles. CAUTION: Drop hazard: The radionuclide generator weighs approx. 14 kg. Handle with care to avoid potential injuries. If radionuclide generator is dropped or if shipping damage extends into the shipping package, check for leaks and perform a wipe survey of the radionuclide generator. Also check for internal damage by slowly tilting the radionuclide generator 90°. Listen for broken/loose parts.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4. Perform wipe survey of shipping package foam inserts and radionuclide generator outer surface. If wipes exceed 40 counts per second per 100 cm 2 , notify your Radiation Safety Officer.
5. Check sealed inlet and outlet ports for damage. Do not remove the port plugs before the elution lines are prepared and ready for installation.

## Optimal positioning

1. When installing the radionuclide generator in its final position, i.e., with a synthesis device or for manual elutions, it is recommended to keep the outlet line as short as possible as the length of this tubing may influence the yield in the receiving/reaction vial.
2. Local auxiliary shielding is recommended when positioning the radionuclide generator. Please note: Moving the radionuclide generator after installation in its final position should be avoided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## First Manual Elution Procedure

Before first elution be sure the assembly steps completed.

## 1. Required Materials and Equipment:

- o Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Elutions must be performed wearing appropriate eye protection, hand protection, and laboratory attire.
- o Syringe: A minimum 10 ml sterile syringe is required. Two-piece syringes are preferred; syringes with rubber plungers should be avoided.
- o Receiving Vial: A shielded receiving vial or vessel with a minimum volume of 10 ml. Uncoated stoppers must be avoided due to the potential for zinc extraction by the acidic eluate.
2. Eluent Preparation and Syringe Filling: The syringe shall be attached to the upper side port of the stopcock manifold (2 nd port). The valve is to be turned to the position indicated in Fig 25 . Subsequently, 10 ml of sterile, ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid shall be drawn from the PPcontainer into the syringe. Introduction of air into the syringe must be strictly avoided.

## 3. Connection of Receiving

Vessel:

The shielded receiving vessel shall be connected to the outlet line using the appropriate connector. The vessel must possess sufficient capacity to accommodate the volume. Metal syringe needles are not to be used for this connection.

4. Elution Procedure: 2 nd and 3 rd valves of the stopcock manifold shall be turned towards the inlet port of the radionuclide generator. Turn the 1 st valve 180° counterclockwise to the closed position.  The 10 ml of sterile, ultrapure 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid shall then be passed through the generator at a flow rate not exceeding 2 ml/minute (refer to Fig 26 ).
2. o Flow Rate Adherence: Exceeding the specified flow rate may reduce the operational lifespan of the radionuclide generator.
3. o Elution Volume: While 4 ml of eluent is generally sufficient for complete elution of the radionuclide generator, for the initial elution, a volume of 10 ml is recommended.

Fig. 26 This figure is referenced in step 4, \"Elution Procedure,\" and likely illustrates the setup or process for passing the hydrochloric acid through the generator.

<!-- image -->

Fig. 25 This figure is referenced in step 2, \"Eluent Preparation and Syringe Filling,\" and shows the valve position for drawing eluent into the syringe'

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Resistance Monitoring: Should high resistance be encountered during elution, the solution must not be forced into the radionuclide generator. If a peristaltic pump is employed for elution, it must be set to a flow rate not exceeding 2 ml/minute. The operator must verify that the eluent is flowing without unusual resistance; elution must be discontinued if high resistance is observed.

## Critical Operational Considerations:

- o The eluent must be introduced exclusively through the designated inlet port . Elution of the radionuclide generator in the reverse direction is prohibited.
- o Introduction of air into the radionuclide generator column may result in reduced elution efficiency (⁶⁸Ga yield).
5. Eluate Collection and Activity Measurement: The eluate shall be collected in the shielded receiving vessel. The activity of the collected solution must be measured using a calibrated dose calibrator to determine the ⁶⁸Ga yield.
- o If the collected eluate volume is less than 4 ml, the activity measurement may not accurately represent the total potential yield of the radionuclide generator.
- o The measured activity must be decay-corrected to the start time of the elution.
- o To optimize the yield from the radionuclide generator in its final configuration, determination of the elution peak by collecting small fractions (e.g., 0.5 ml) is recommended.
6. Management of the First Eluate: The first eluate obtained from the generator must be discarded . This is mandated due to the potential for ⁶⁸Ge (Germanium-68) breakthrough in this initial fraction. It is recommended that subsequent eluates be tested for ⁶⁸Ge breakthrough by comparing the activity levels of ⁶⁸Ga and ⁶⁸Ge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Routine Elution

- a) Remove the cap from the second port of the stopcock manifold (4). (See Fig. 27.)
- b) Connect a sterile syringe with a LUER connection to the second port of the stopcock manifold (4).
- Securely attach the syringe to ensure a leak-free connection for fluid transfer.

(See Fig. 28.)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- c)  Rotate  the  'Off'  position  of  the  first  valve  of  the manifold  (4)  to  align  with  the  inlet  extension  line  (5), allowing flow from the HCl bag to the syringe.
- This valve adjustment opens the pathway for the hydrochloric acid solution to fill the syringe. (See Fig. 29.)
- d) Fill the syringe with 4 ml of sterile hydrochloric acid by pulling back the plunger, ensuring no air is drawn into the syringe.
- Slowly  draw  the  solution  to  avoid  air  bubbles, filling the syringe to the required volume.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- e) Ensure the 'Off' positions of the second and third valves are aligned with the third and fourth ports of the manifold, then rotate the 'Off' position of the first valve to align with the B-safe spike (2).
- This  reconfiguration  directs  the  flow  from  the syringe to the generator for elution.

(See Fig. 31.)

- f)  Push  the  plunger  to  start  the  elution,  controlling  the flow rate to not exceed 2 ml per minute.
- Gently depress the plunger to elute the generator, maintaining the recommended  flow  rate for optimal performance.
- The  eluate  shall  be  collected  in  the  shielded receiving  vessel.  The  activity  of  the  collected solution  must  be  measured  using  a  calibrated dose calibrator.

## Replacing the Hydrochloric Acid Bag

## CAUTION:

Aseptic technique is critical for maintenance of sterility and must be used during the exchange procedure. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, eye protection, and a laboratory coat.

1. When the sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid bag is almost empty, it can be replaced with a new sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid bag.

## CAUTION:

No air should enter the radionuclide generator. Introducing air can compromise sterility and affect generator performance. Before disconnecting the empty bag:

- a) Rotate the 'Off' position of the first valve of the stopcock manifold (4) to align with the B-safe spike (2). This closes the flow path from the hydrochloric acid bag, preventing any solution or air from entering or exiting during the replacement process. (See Fig. 33.)
- b) Disassemble the B-safe spike (2) from the empty hydrochloric acid bag (1). (See Fig. 34.)

Fig 33 Rotating the first valve to the OFF position to isolate the acid bag.

<!-- image -->

Fig 34 Removing the B-safe spike (2) from the empty acid bag (1).

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. It is recommended to replace the B-safe spike with a new sterile B-safe spike supplied with each new hydrochloric acid bag to maintain sterility.
- c) Attach the new B-Safe spike (2) to the new 220 ml sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid bag (1).
3. Reconnect the system:
- d) Assemble the B-safe spike (2) to the first port of the stopcock manifold (4).
- e) Hang the new hydrochloric acid bag close to the inlet port above the radionuclide generator.
4. Prepare the system for elution:

Carefully check for air bubbles in the stopcock manifold and attached lines. Slowly remove all air from the stopcock manifold using the valves. It is not necessary to detach the inlet extension line (5) from the radionuclide generator or from the stopcock manifold.

## CAUTION:

Entering air into the radionuclide generator should be avoided to maintain its proper function and sterility.

5. When the stopcock manifold is filled and free of air, close the valves to stop the flow.

The radionuclide generator is now ready for elution again. Proceed with your standard elution protocol, ensuring all safety measures and procedural guidelines are followed

## Continuous routine elution:

1. Repeat the steps of the first elution but use only 4 ml for the continuous routine elution. The GalenVita generator is designed to elute all of the available 68 Ga activity in a volume of 4 ml.
2. Elute the GalenVita radionuclide generator at every working day with 4 ml sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid.
3. The solution eluted is a clear, sterile and colourless gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, with a pH between 0.5 and 2.0 and a radiochemical purity greater than 95 %. Check the clarity of the eluate before use and discard it if the solution is not clear.
4. If the generator has not been used for a period of 3 days or more, free 68 Ge ions accumulate within the column over time. Therefore, it is recommended that the column is eluted once at least 7 - 24 hours prior to eluting for labelling. This elution should be done using 10 ml of sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid to fully wash the impurities from the column.
5. The eluate should be tested for 68 Ge breakthrough before the radionuclide generator comes into routine use and then at least once in a month during routine elutions by comparing the activity level of the 68 Ga and the 68 Ge. For further details please refer to Ph. Eur. Monograph 2464.

## CAUTION:

If fluid leaks are observed at any time, immediately stop eluting and attempt to contain the leaking fluid.

The  68 Ge/ 68 Ga-generator is supplied with 220 ml of sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid. This amount is usually sufficient for at least 50 elutions. The 68 Ge/ 68 Ga-generator should only be eluted with sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid supplied by the marketing authorization holder.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additional containers may be purchased as consumables from the marketing authorisation holder.

## Radionuclide generator elution yield:

The activity stated on the label of the radionuclide generator is expressed in 68 Ge available at the calibration date (hh:00). The available 68 Ga activity depends on the 68 Ge activity at the time of elution and the elapsed time since the previous elution.

A radionuclide generator in full equilibrium yields more than 55 % of 68 Ga using an elution volume of 4 ml sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid. Since the elution yield may vary, the activity of 68Ga in the eluate should always be measured before subsequent use.

The output will decrease with decay of the parent nuclide 68 Ge over time. For example, after 9 months' decay (39 weeks), the 68 Ge will be reduced by 50 % (see Table 4). To calculate the current 68 Ge activity, multiply the 68 Ge activity at calibration date with the respective decay factor of the corresponding elapsed time in weeks.

After elution, the 68 Ga will be built up by the continuous decay of the parent 68 Ge. The radionuclide generator requires at least 7 hours to achieve almost full yield after being eluted, but in practice it is also possible to elute the radionuclide generator earlier, depending on its strength and the activity required for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

radiolabelling. Table 5 shows the build-up factor of 68 Ga activity over time, up to 410 minutes after an elution.

## Quality control

If possible, clarity of the solution, pH and the radioactivity should be checked before radiolabelling.

## 68 Ge breakthrough

A small amount of  68 Ge is washed from the radionuclide generator column with each elution. 68 Ge breakthrough is expressed as a percentage of total 68 Ga activity eluted from the column, corrected for decay, and does not exceed 0.001 % of the eluted 68 Ga activity. 68 Ge breakthrough can, however, increase above 0.001 % if the radionuclide generator is not eluted for several days. Therefore, if the radionuclide generator has not been eluted for 72 hours or more, it should be pre-eluted with 10 ml of sterile 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid at least 7 hours prior to the intended use (the time between the pre-elution and the elution for radiolabelling can be reduced if the intended radiolabelling procedure does not require maximum achievable eluate activity). When this instruction is followed, the 68 Ge breakthrough should constantly stay below 0.001 % in eluates obtained for radiolabelling. To keep the breakthrough low, the generator should be eluted at least once per working day. When used according to these instructions, the breakthrough should stay below 0.001 % for 12 months. For testing the 68 Ge breakthrough, the activity levels of the 68 Ga and  68 Ge in the eluate should be compared. For further details please refer to Ph. Eur. monograph 2464.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## GalenVita 0.74 GBq radionuclide generator

Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What GalenVita is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used
3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used
4. Possible side effects
5. How GalenVita is stored
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What GalenVita is and what it is used for

GalenVita is a germanium ( 68 Ge) / gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here 68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita must not be used

- -if you are allergic to gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a 68 Ga-labelled medicine, you should read information on contraindications in the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Warnings and precautions

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Children and adolescents

Please speak to your nuclear medicine doctor if you or your child are under 18 years old.

## Other medicines and gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images by your doctor.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

The nuclear medicine doctor will only administer a 68 Ga-labelled medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.

## If you are breast-feeding

You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines. Please read the Package Leaflets of these medicines carefully.

## 3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling, and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. GalenVita will only be used in special controlled areas. The production of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, radiolabelling of a specific carrier medicine, as well as administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicine to you, will only be handled by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome.

## Administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution and conduct of the procedure

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## After the medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution has been given

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 68 Ga-labelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution than you should, or have received direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution inadvertently An overdose, or inadvertent direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is unlikely, because you will only receive the 68 Ga-labelled medicine precisely controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, or inadvertent direct injection you will receive the appropriate care.

Should you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

After the 68 Ga-labelled medicine is administered, it will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation with the least risk of cancer and hereditary abnormalities.

For more information about possible side effects, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Reporting of side effects

## 1. What GalenVita is and what it is used for

GalenVita is a germanium ( 68 Ge) / gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here 68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita must not be used

- -if you are allergic to gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a 68 Ga-labelled medicine, you should read information on contraindications in the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Warnings and precautions

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Children and adolescents

Please speak to your nuclear medicine doctor if you or your child are under 18 years old.

## Other medicines and gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images by your doctor.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

The nuclear medicine doctor will only administer a 68 Ga-labelled medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.

## If you are breast-feeding

You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines. Please read the Package Leaflets of these medicines carefully.

## 3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling, and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. GalenVita will only be used in special controlled areas. The production of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, radiolabelling of a specific carrier medicine, as well as administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicine to you, will only be handled by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome.

## Administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution and conduct of the procedure

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## After the medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution has been given

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 68 Ga-labelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

## If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution than you should, or have received direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution inadvertently Ga) chloride solution is unlikely, because you

An overdose, or inadvertent direct injection of gallium ( 68 will only receive the 68 Ga-labelled medicine precisely controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, or inadvertent direct injection you will receive the appropriate care.

Should you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

After the 68 Ga-labelled medicine is administered, it will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation with the least risk of cancer and hereditary abnormalities.

For more information about possible side effects, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.

## 1. What GalenVita is and what it is used for

GalenVita is a germanium ( 68 Ge) / gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here 68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita must not be used

- -if you are allergic to gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a 68 Ga-labelled medicine, you should read information on contraindications in the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Warnings and precautions

For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.

## Children and adolescents

Please speak to your nuclear medicine doctor if you or your child are under 18 years old.

## Other medicines and gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution

Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images by your doctor.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

The nuclear medicine doctor will only administer a 68 Ga-labelled medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.

## If you are breast-feeding

You will be asked to stop breast-feeding. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines. Please read the Package Leaflets of these medicines carefully.

## 3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling, and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. GalenVita will only be used in special controlled areas. The production of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, radiolabelling of a specific carrier medicine, as well as administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicine to you, will only be handled by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome.

## Administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution and conduct of the procedure

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## After the medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution has been given

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 68 Ga-labelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution than you should, or have received direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution inadvertently An overdose, or inadvertent direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is unlikely, because you will only receive the 68 Ga-labelled medicine precisely controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, or inadvertent direct injection you will receive the appropriate care.

Should you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

After the 68 Ga-labelled medicine is administered, it will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation with the least risk of cancer and hereditary abnormalities.

For more information about possible side effects, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

It is not known whether gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution may interact with other medicines as specified studies have not been carried out. You will not receive an injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride, but a medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga.

For information concerning other medicines in combination with the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given 68 Ga-labelled medicines.

You must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicines if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding.

When in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.

## If you are pregnant

The nuclear medicine doctor will only administer a 68 Ga-labelled medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected which would outweigh the risks.

There could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the use of 68 Ga-labelled medicines. Please read the Package Leaflets of these medicines carefully.

## 3. How gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

There are strict laws on the use, handling, and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. GalenVita will only be used in special controlled areas. The production of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, radiolabelling of a specific carrier medicine, as well as administration of 68 Ga-labelled medicine to you, will only be handled by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. They will take special care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of medicine radiolabelled with 68 Ga to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to achieve the appropriate outcome.

## Administration of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution and conduct of the procedure

You will not be given the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution, but another medicine which has been combined (radiolabelled) with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution.

## Duration of the procedure

Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure with a 68 Galabelled medicine. For more information, please read the Package Leaflet of the radiolabelled medicine.

## After the medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution has been given

The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving the 68 Ga-labelled medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

If you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution than you should, or have received direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution inadvertently An overdose, or inadvertent direct injection of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution is unlikely, because you will only receive the 68 Ga-labelled medicine precisely controlled by the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, or inadvertent direct injection you will receive the appropriate care.

Should you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure.

## 1. What GalenVita is and what it is used for

GalenVita is a germanium ( 68 Ge) / gallium ( 68 Ga) radionuclide generator, a device used to obtain a solution of gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is a radioactive substance that is handled by specialised doctors (nuclear medicine doctors) and pharmacists trained to work with radioactive materials. Gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride is not intended for direct use in patients, but is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a radioactive compound, here 68 Ga.

Only medicines that have been specifically developed and approved for radiolabelling with 68 Ga undergo the radiolabelling procedure with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride. These radiolabelled medicines can recognise and attach to particular types of cells in the body and take the radioactive 68 Ga to these cells in your body. The low amount of radioactivity present in the 68 Ga-labelled medicine can be detected from outside of the body by special cameras. This may help your doctor with the diagnosis. Please refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride for more information.

The nuclear medicine doctor will explain to you in more detail what type of examination will be performed.

The use of a 68 Ga-labelled medicine does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the 68 Ga-labelled medicine overcomes the risk due to radiation.

## 2. What you need to know before the gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita is used

## The gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride solution obtained with GalenVita must not be used

- -if you are allergic to gallium ( 68 Ga) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are using a 68 Ga-labelled medicine, you should read information on contraindications in the Package Leaflet of the medicine to be radiolabelled.
