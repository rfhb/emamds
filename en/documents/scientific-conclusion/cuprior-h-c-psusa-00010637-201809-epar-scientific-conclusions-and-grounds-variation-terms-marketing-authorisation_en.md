## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trientine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

A review of the published literature by Hashim &amp; Parnell identified a third overdose case with trientine. This case refers to a large overdose of trientine (300 tablets, total dose 60 g of trientine dihydrochloride salt, equivalent to 40 g of trientine base) resulting in self-limiting dizziness during the first day and nausea and vomiting on day 2. All symptoms were self-limiting and resolved within 48 hours of the overdose. Due to the pharmacological effects of trientine, the patient had a low serum copper level and elevated urinary copper. There were mild biochemical abnormalities (slight decrease in serum zinc and phosphate, slight increase in serum creatinine) that resolved spontaneously and/or with administration of fluids. It is known that  there  is  no  antidote  for  trientine.  However,  whenever  available,  symptoms,  signs,  and  potential sequelae of high doses of the medicinal product should be described in section 4.9 to allow the best diagnosis and management of an overdose. In addition overdose cases should refer to the amount of trientine base to avoid confusion since the salts, dosage and pharmaceutical forms are different across the two products. The wording was also simplified to outline that up to 20g no apparent adverse effects reported. Therefore, the rapporteur considers the SmPC should be updated to include this information.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trientine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trientine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
