## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. Therefore, consent from the MAH of the Celvapan application, which had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing access to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved at the time of the submission of the informed consent  application.  The  application  for  PANDEMIC  INFLUENZA  VACCINE  H5N1  BAXTER consists only of Module 1 information. As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER medicinal product are identical to the quality, safety and efficacy profile of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER at the time  of  the  submission  of  the  informed  consent application. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Celvapan CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). Celvapan  is  a  whole  virion  inactivated  influenza  vaccine,  which  is  produced  in  Vero  cells  and employing a wild type virus H5N1strain. The final vaccine comprises 7.5µg of HA antigen of strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (or A/Indonesia/05/2005) per 0.5 ml dose and is presented in a 10-dose vial with no preservative added. Celvapan  is  indicated  for  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. Future pandemics might not be caused by a H5N1 virus but will be due to another subtype of influenza virus (e.g. with haemagglutinin of type H1, H2, H7 or H9). In line with the core dossier concept, a variation  would  therefore  have  to  be  submitted  to  introduce  the  WHO/EU  recommended  strain, prepared from the influenza virus causing the pandemic, prior to use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER in a pandemic. PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is not indicated for prophylactic use during the prepandemic period. 2.2 Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Celvapan application, the quality data in support of the PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER application are identical to the quality data  of  the  Celvapan  dossier  which  have  been  assessed  and  approved (including  all  post-marketing procedures finalised at the time of the submission of the informed consent application). 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Celvapan  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support of the PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER application are identical to the non-clinical data of the Celvapan dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all postmarketing procedures finalised at the time of the submission of the informed consent application).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

<!-- image -->

Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant,  which  is identical to that of the authorised product Celvapan, fulfilled the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The risk management plan, which is identical to that of the authorised product Celvapan, was drafted in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  core  RMP  for  vaccines  intended  for  use  in  a  pandemic  declared situation. The applicant committed to update the RMP for the current application in line with the outcome of the assessment of the RMP submitted on 14 August 2008 for Celvapan, if required. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Since this application is an informed consent of the Celvapan application, the CHMP considered that the  risk-benefit  balance  of  PANDEMIC  INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for the following indication: 'Prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation.  Pandemic  influenza  vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance. PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER has been evaluated in adults 18-59 years of age and in elderly 60 years of age and above.' Medicinal product no longer authorised
