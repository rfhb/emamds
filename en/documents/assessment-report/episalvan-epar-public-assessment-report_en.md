The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 February 2014. The applicant applied for the following indication: Treatment in adults for accelerated healing of partial thickness wounds. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that Birch bark extract from Betula pendula Roth, Betula pubescens Ehrh. as well as hybrids of both species with n-heptane as extraction solvent was considered to be a new active substance. The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) P/0156/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0156/2013 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity Similarity Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Human skin consists of three layers, epidermis, dermis and subcutis. Epidermis and dermis are separated by a thin sheet of fibres called the basement membrane. Above the basement membrane basal keratinocytes of the stratum basale are located which continuously regenerate the epidermis. Based on their prominent abundance in the epidermis keratinocytes are of paramount importance for the re-epithelialisation of partial thickness wounds.

A skin wound is a type of injury in which skin is torn, cut or punctured, or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion. Generally, wounds can be classified according to their depth based on the skin layers involved: · Partial thickness wounds: o Superficial partial thickness wounds involve loss of epidermis and extend into the dermis. The basement membrane is lost, but skin adnexae remain. o Deep partial thickness wounds (also termed: deep-dermal wounds) involve a near-complete loss of dermis and are associated with a reduced number of skin adnexae. · Full thickness wounds involve the entire dermis, extend into the subcutis and are not able to heal spontaneously within 3 weeks. Full thickness wounds typically receive surgical intervention (skin grafting) to avoid excessive scarring and to promote a timely wound closure (Wolfe, Roi et al. 1983; Black and Black 2012). Partial thickness wounds are able to regenerate the epidermis and (depending on wound depth) to heal within 1 to 3 weeks with minimal or no scarring. Partial thickness wounds can have an iatrogenic cause (e.g., split-thickness skin grafting) or can be caused by accident (e.g., burns, abrasions, contusions). Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wounds Split-thickness skin grafting is the transplantation of a patient's own cutaneous tissue harvested from an area of normal healthy skin, used to replace an area of skin loss or injury and is one of the most commonly performed operations in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The partial thickness wound of the STSG graft donor site heals by re-epithelialisation. Often the graft donor site is slow to heal, and it is the source of most postoperative pain. The STSG donor site, as an iatrogenic partial thickness wound created in a surgical setting, represents a highly standardised, homogeneous and clean wound. It is therefore considered a model wound for partial thickness wounds of all types. Consequently, STSG donor sites can be used in clinical studies to generate insights into wound healing which are of relevance to all partial thickness wounds. Burn wounds Medicinal product no longer authorised

Burn injury can lead to severe morbidity and significant mortality and also has a considerable healtheconomic impact. Burns are classified according to the depth of injury into 1st degree (epidermal with redness and erythema), Grade 2a (superficial partial thickness extending to dermis), Grade 2b (deep partial thickness extending to dermis, and unable to regenerate epidermis within 3 weeks), 3rd degree (full thickness, extending through entire dermis) and 4th degree (charred). Epithelialisation and wound closure for Grade 2a burns generally occurs within 7 to 17 days. The current standard of care for Grade 2a burn wounds

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is that the wound is either covered with an alloplastic epidermal substitute without need for dressing changes (which may disrupt the healing process) or with antiseptics (e.g., octenidine, polyhexanide) and fatty gauze or other dressings which enables evaluation of the wound at regular changes of the wound dressing.

Despite major advances in recent decades in the understanding of the mechanism of wound healing on a molecular level, treatment options remain limited. Standard of care for treatment of partial thickness wounds is dominated by medical devices, mostly different types of wound dressing. These aim to protect the wound, to provide an optimal environment for endogenous wound healing, and to reduce the risk of complications (e.g. infections).

Episalvan, a sterile gel, is a herbal medicinal product consisting of the herbal preparation dry extract from Betulae cortex as active substance and sunflower oil as excipient. The extract with the oil forms a colourless to slightly yellowish, opalescent gel without any further ingredients.

Partial thickness wounds are very painful, much more so than deep wounds, because sensory nerve endings are abundant in the remaining dermal tissue in the wound bed. Besides being very painful, there is an increased risk of infection due to the compromised skin barrier. Thus, any acceleration in wound healing would meet an important medical need. An accelerated rate of wound healing would also be expected to be associated with a lower risk of scarring and hypopigmentation, which are common features of delayed wound healing. About the product Episalvan gel contains dry extract from Betulae cortex (birch bark). The patient population studied with Episalvan gel included patients with treatment of partial thickness wounds, including both superficial partial thickness and deep partial thickness wounds: split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wounds and Grade 2a burn wounds. Indication and dosage The initially proposed indication was 'Treatment in adults for accelerated healing of partial thickness wounds'. The recommend indication is treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults (see SmPC sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1). The gel should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of approximately 1 mm and covered by sterile wound dressing. The gel should be re-applied at each wound dressing change, until the wound is healed, for up to 4 weeks (see SmPC section 4.2). 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

## Herbal substance (crude birch bark)

General information of the herbal substance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The definition of the herbal substance is the fine cut and sieved particles (crude birch bark) forming the starting point for the herbal preparation dry extract of birch bark from Betula pendula Roth (silver birch), Betula pubescens Ehrh. (white birch) and hybrids of both species. The birch is growing in the wild in Northern Europe and cut and transported to factories where birch bark is processed to fine particles.

The part of the birch used is the white part of the bark, Betula cork (phellem), which is the outer part of the bark, produced by the cork cambium (phellogen) in woody plants. It is confirmed that the herbal substance complies with the guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) for starting material of herbal origin. The main constituents in the bark of birch are pentacyclic triterpenes that comprises of three major triterpene groups, (1) lupane, (2) oleanane and (3) ursane (Figure 1 and Table 1). The most interesting and major compound in birch bark is betulin and its derivative betulinic acid. Other quantified triterpene compounds that are of interest are oleanolic acid, erythrodiol and lupeol. In order to definitely assure correct birch species, the collected birch trees are compared to a certified herbarium specimen.

Prior to manufacturing, the birch is stored outside as wet stocks and watered before stripping of the cork from the logs is performed. The cork is then dried and reduced in size and sieved until specified fine particles size is reached. A QP declaration confirming GMP compliance of the herbal substance manufacturer where fine particles &lt; 1.25 mm are obtained has been provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Complete information about the botanical classification is given. Macroscopic and microscopic characterization as well as phytochemical characterization of the herbal substance is provided.

## Specification of Herbal substance

The specification includes critical tests that ensure the identity and the quality of the herbal substance. For example, macro- and microscopic identification test for Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh, test of fine particle size (&lt;1.25 mm), assay of triterpenes, pesticides, microbiological quality, aflatoxins, heavy metals, loss of drying, total ash, foreign matter and fingerprint chromatogram.

Drug substance herbal preparation (dry extract from birch bark) General information of the herbal preparation (drug substance) The herbal preparation, i.e. the drug substance, is the dry extract of birch bark. It is declared as a refined 'quantified extract' as defined in the EMA 'Guideline on declaration of herbal substances and herbal preparations in herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal medicinal products' (EMA/HMPC/CHMP/CVMP/287539/2005/rev 1). The quantification is determined with respect to the betulin content, which is determined to 72-88 % (w/w) and with a DER value of 5-10:1. Besides betulin, other four major triterpenes: betulin acid, oleanolic acid, erythrodiol and lupeol are present in the herbal preparation. n-Heptane is used as extraction solvent. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls of the herbal preparation (drug substance) Manufacture of dry extract is performed in accordance with GMP. The extraction process is considered as a standard process hence validation of the process is not required. Nonetheless, detailed description and validation of extraction, crystallisation and drying process were provided with justification for the designated process parameters. The developed manufacturing process is able to refine the dry extract in term of characterised constituents with target quality. The physicochemical and rheological properties of the dry extract are controlled using suitable tests, e.g. particle surface area. Information regarding phytochemical composition of the herbal preparation obtained with the manufacturing process is provided. Possible presence of impurities was sufficiently discussed and supportive data was presented. Specification of herbal preparation (drug substance) Release- and shelf-life specification includes critical tests that control the quality and the identity of the herbal preparation. The specification includes such parameters as visual description, identification by GC-FID fingerprints and HPLC-fingerprints, GC-FID assay of 5 major triperpenes and total triterpenoids, amount of Cr and Ni (ICP-OES), residual solvent n-heptane, consistency test, oil segregation test, specific surface area and microbiological contamination limits.

Reference standards of purified triterpenes have been established in accordance with Ph.Eur. 5.12.

Batch analysis demonstrated that the quality of the drug substance is satisfactory and comply with set acceptance limits.

## Stability of the herbal preparation (drug substance)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three production scale batches have been tested at long-term (25°C/60% RH) for 36 months and at accelerated condition (40°C/75% RH) for 6 months. However, data from these batches could not be accounted for assigning a re-test period for the drug substances due to critical tests (e.g. bioburden and specific surface area) were not tested during the stability studies. The proposed re-test period for the drug substance is 36 months when stored below 30 ° C.

New stability data of 9 months was appended for three production scale batches that include tests in accordance to amended specification.

The development of the manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The effects of the sterilisation process on the chemical, physicochemical and rheological properties were studied and elaborated discussions of the matter were provided together with experimental data. Thus, it is concluded that sterilisation is sufficient to guarantee sterility of the product at production scale. The potential for syneresis occurring after irradiation and on storage was investigated and results showed no syneresis potential. Furthermore, the product is proven to be non-hygroscopic. Due to this characteristic a low bioburden of the finished product was demonstrated.

Photostability studies and stability studies were conducted according to ICH guidelines. It is demonstrated that the finished product is not light sensitive. Based on the overall data, the re-test period for the drug substance (e.g. herbal preparation) is assigned to 15 months when stored below 30 ° C. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Description of the product and pharmaceutical development The dosage form of the finished product is a semi-solid preparation, which is an oleogel; a lipophilic gel for cutaneous application. The finished product is a colorless to slightly yellowish, opalescent, gel. The finished product is packed and stored in white 25 ml collapsible aluminum tubes, with a sealing compound in the fold, closed by an aluminum membrane (i.e. tamper evident) and a white PP screw cap. The development of the formulation provides the justification to the selection of the final composition. During the early stage of the development formulations with oil and water were investigated. Water-free formulation was chosen for further development work where different concentrations were investigated with regard to such quality attributes as segregation of oil and consistency of the gel. Content of 10 % of dry extract was chosen for the final composition. Compatibility studies between the product formulation and several wound dressing materials were investigated. All of the dressing evaluated reported no incompatibility with regard to efficacy and safety of the product. Moreover, there were no detrimental effects observed on the dressing material in contact with the finished product. The choice of primary packaging is justified. The container closure system for the finished product is an aluminum tube with protective internal and external lacquer. Sufficient documentations were provided and the container closure system for the finished product is judged to be acceptable and complies with Ph. Eur. and with foodstuff legislation of EU. No risk for BSE and TSE were found. The finished product is packed in a single dose container, which is tamper-evident. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Manufacture of the finished product and process controls

The manufacturing process of the finished product is relatively simple where the API, i.e. the dry extract from birch bark, is mixed with sunflower oil. The bulk gel is filled into the aluminium tubes, labelled and packed into folding boxes and shipping cartons. Bioburden is controlled prior to sterilisation.

The manufacturing process has been thoroughly assessed: a developed process and control strategy ensures appropriate quality level of the finished product. Adequate IPCs are presented for the manufacturing process.

The validation of the manufacturing process was performed on three consecutive production scale batches. Process validation protocol and reports were submitted and the validation performed was found acceptable. Product specification The release- and shelf-life specification for the finished product was revised with relevant tests; assay of betulin and amount of dry extract, sterility, acid value, peroxide value, fineness of grind, viscosity, thixotropy, segregation of oil and consistency. The product is tested for sterility (e.g. Ph. Eur. 2.61.) at release and at start and end of stability study. Stability of the finished product Stability data (e.g. long-term-, intermediate- and accelerated condition) that covered a period of 12 months and 6 months was appended and tests were performed in accordance to amended specification. The analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating. The presented results were all within acceptance limits. Photostability studies showed that the finished product is not light sensitive. Thus, according to ICH Q1E Evaluation of stability data a shelf-life of 24 months when stored below 30°C as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 2.2.4. Discussion on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. During the procedure, new and updated information has been provided. GMP compliance of the manufacturer of the birch bark has been discussed throughout the procedure. It was concluded that the manufacturing process of grinding bark into fine particles (&lt;1.25 mm) must indisputably be conducted under GMP conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction The cellular and molecular process involved in initiation, maintenance, and completion of epithelialisation are essential for wound closure. Wound healing is a complex process that can be roughly divided into the following overlapping phases: · Inflammatory phase · New tissue forming phase · Remodelling phase The major cellular components of the epidermis are the keratinocytes. The different stages of wound healing include induction of pro-inflammatory mediators, proliferation, cell-migration and differentiation of keratinocytes. During epithelialisation, keratinocytes become activated, and the activation process is achieved by expression of several cytokines and growth factors. The activated phenotype is marked by changes in the cytoskeleton network and cell surface receptors, allowing keratinocytes to migrate into the wound to fill the defect (Pastar et al ., 2014). To study the wound healing properties of Episalvan gel (also referred throughout this report as Oleogel-S10) and triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE), the Applicant performed a variety of in vitro and ex vivo studies. For example, the porcine ex vivo wound healing model (WHM) was used, considered to mimic the clinical situation in treatment of partial thickness wounds of patients. In the porcine ex vivo wound healing model, punch biopsies were taken from the plicae of pig ears, with the epidermis being removed from a central area. Directly after wounding, test compounds were applied into the wound. Furthermore, the in vitro wound scratch test using human primary keratinocytes was used as a model to study re-epithelialisation. Safety pharmacology studies were performed in dogs via intraduodenal administration and in mice and rats via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Isolated ileum from guinea pig was also used in an in vitro safety pharmacology study. The safety pharmacology studies were completed in accordance with the relevant International Conference on Harmonization / Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (ICH/CPMP) Note for Guidance. No specific in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) due to low absorption following dermal administration. However, plasma levels of betulin and betulinic acid were analysed as part of toxicity studies in rats, dogs and minipigs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Toxicity studies of TE were performed in mice and rats via intraperitoneal and subcutaneous route of administration. In pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies rats, Beagle dogs and minipigs were administered TE via intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and topical route of administration, respectively.

As for genotoxicity studies, triterpene dry extract was studied in Ames test, chromosomal aberration test and in vivo micronucleus test.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been performed due to low dermal absorption and low systemic exposure.

Evaluation of toxicokinetic data has been included in 2 pivotal studies in Beagle dogs (s.c.) and minipigs (dermal administration).

Local tolerance has been assessed in guinea-pigs in a test model according to Magnusson and Kligman consisting of intracutaneous and topical rote of administration.

All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in line with GLP requirements as claimed by the Applicant. 2.3.2. Pharmacology The main constituent of triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) is betulin (72-88 % W/W of the dry extract). Other constituents are betulinic acid, lupeol, oleanolic acid, and erythrodiol.

The half-life of IL-6 mRNA was lower than the control. In the literature, p38 mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been reported to be involved in COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA stability. Another mRNA stabilizing factor, HuR, was also studied. TE enhanced cytosolic levels of HuR. No change in nuclear HuR-level was observed. It is speculated if TE is involved in the stabilizing effect of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA. longer |

| In vitro / human primary keratinocytes Woelfle et al . 2010 | TE (10 µg/ml)              | Different types of keratinocytes (proliferating, early and late confluent as well as senescent hPK) were incubated with TE for 24 h and apoptosis was measured. TE-induced apoptosis in all types of hPK in a dose- dependent manner. Senescent hPK were most susceptible to apoptosis induced by TE. In all further experiments, hPK between the proliferating and early confluent stage (subconfluent or 70 %confluent cells) were used. The differentiation-promoting effect of TE was investigated by incubating subconfluent hPK with 10 mg/ml TE for 24 h. 2mM calcium, referred to as high [Ca 2+ ]ex was used as positive control. Gene expression was investigated in hPK for the early differentiation markers involucrin (INV) and keratin 10 (KRT10) as well as the late differentiation marker transglutaminase (TGM). KRT10, INV, and TGM mRNA levels were increased in cells cultured in the presence of either high [Ca 2+ ]ex or TE TE caused induction of the transient receptor potential superfamily of cation channel 6 (TRPC6) expression on mRNA and protein level in hPK 24 hours post treatment, thus leading to increased calcium influx. authorised |

No specific in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) due to low absorption following dermal administration. However, plasma levels of betulin, the main component of TE, were evaluated as part of the 4-week repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Plasma levels of betulin and betulinic acid were analysed as part of the 4-week repeated dose local tolerance and toxicity study in mini-pigs.

Safety pharmacology studies with triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) in sesame oil were performed in dogs via intra-duodenal administration and in mice and rats via intraperitoneal administration. Isolated ileum from guinea pig was also used in an in vitro safety pharmacology study. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were studied at doses of up to 300 mg of TE/kg in beagle dogs, central nervous parameters at doses of up to 300 mg TE/kg in mice, gastrointestinal parameters at doses of up to 300 mg of TE/kg in mice and renal parameters at doses of up to 500 mg TE/kg in rats. No test item related effects have been observed. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. This was considered acceptable given the low systemic exposure from topical application of Episalvan to patients. 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Four single toxicity studies, two in mice and two in rats were performed. These are summarised in Table 4 .

One single toxicity study with intraperitoneal route of administration was performed in each species: mouse (13597/00) and rat (13598/00). Doses of 250, 500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg of triterpene dry extract (TE) were administered. In both studies all animals showed white, coarse deposits in the abdominal cavity at dose 250 mg/kg or higher and organs adhered at dose 500 mg/kg or higher. As for adverse clinical signs, all animals showed reduced motility, ataxia, dyspnoea and reduced muscle tone at dose 500 mg/kg or higher. No lethality occurred in any of these studies.

In the rat study, there were no major clinical observations but macroscopic pathology examination revealed whitish-yellow oily aqueous liquid in the abdominal cavity in the animals of the control group and of all dose groups. In addition, disperse areas with whitish deposits were noted in all test substance-treated groups. Furthermore, in all test substance groups discolorations and adhesions in various abdominal organs were observed.

The pivotal study in rats monitored toxicity after intraperitoneal administration of the triterpene dry extract (TE) and the subcutaneous route of administration was applied in the pivotal study in dogs. These studies are summarised in Table 5. Table 5. Pivotal repeat-dose studies in rats and dogs Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inflammation in the abdominal cavity of all rats of the high dose group correlated with the results of macroscopic post mortem examinations. Similar changes, though less pronounced, were noted in the control group.

Subcutaneous administration in dogs resulted in a pronounced inflammatory, granulomatous reaction at the injection site, which was considered to be related to the insolubility of the triterpenes. Other findings in this study, including increased cellularity in the spleen and bone marrow, were also considered to be likely indirect effects from the inflammatory reaction. There were no findings indicating systemic toxicity in the 4week dog study

Pivotal repeat-dose study in mini-pigs Mini-pig was the only species to receive TE via the same route of administration as is intended for human use. To characterise the local and systemic toxicity of Oleogel-S10 (10 % TE in sunflower oil) following repeated dermal administration on the intact and abraded skin over 4 weeks. In addition, the reversibility of any effect after a recovery period of 14 days was evaluated. Mini-pigs were randomised in three treatment groups to be applied either 150 mg/kg TE (2.25 g/250 cm²) on intact skin, 150 mg/kg TE (2.25 g/250 cm²) on abraded skin-graft excised skin, or foam-bandage Mepilex (control, 0 g/kg) on abraded skin (skin graftexcised) ( Table 6 ).

## Treatment area:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To approximately 12.5 x 20 cm = 250 cm² per animal (corresponding to approximately 5 % of the total body surface area), 1 mm thick layer of Oleogel-S10 was applied. To allow for treated and untreated skin localizations the right shoulder of the scheduled animals (groups 2 and 3) was shaven. Additionally, a separate split-thickness skin graft was excised (untreated abraded skin, not covered).

## Additional treatment:

Before the split-thickness skin graft, the mini-pigs were anaesthetized using 0.2 ml/kg Ursotamin® and 0.05 ml/kg Stresnil®, intramuscularly.

Oleogel-S10 treated intact and abraded skin areas were examined histologically after preparation of paraffin sections and haematoxylin-eosin staining and compared with foam-bandage covered abraded skin areas and untreated abraded and intact skin areas.

To prevent or mitigate pain the analgesic Metamizol was given directly after dermatome treatment at a dosage of 1 ml/10 kg intramuscularly. If necessary, the analgesia regimen was prolonged. Animals of groups 2 and 3 were treated for 4 consecutive days with Metamizol after the skin abrasion. If necessary, the analgesia regimen was prolonged. If appropriate, the mini-pigs were treated with the antibiotic Duphamox at a dose of 1 ml/10 kg, intramuscularly. Methodology: Clinical signs, body weight, food and drinking water consumption, laboratory examinations, haematology, coagulation, clinical biochemistry, urinalysis, organ weight and ophthalmological and auditory examinations were included as parameters in this study. Macroscopic skin reactions, i.e. signs of erythema, eschar formation and oedema, were scored as described in Table 7 (based on DRAIZE, Appraisal of the Safety of Chemicals in Food, Drugs and Cosmetics, Association of Food and Drug Officials of the United States, Austin, Texas, 1959) on the administration days and on test day 30, daily during recovery period and on test day 44 and 45.

Furthermore, immune histochemical examinations for cell proliferation in the skin using the Ki67 marker were performed in 3 male animal and 3 female animals of group 3. Five serial sections from each of the skin areas (treated abraded, untreated abraded, untreated intact skin) per animal and positive control sections from duodenum, jejunum and ileum were examined. The examination of cell proliferation showed no test item

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related influence on cell proliferation in the epidermis and corium. The positive reaction of some nuclei in the epidermis of the skin was considered to reflect a normal cell proliferation. There was no difference between the treated and untreated skin localizations. The CHMP however considered that the cell proliferation assay using Ki67 as a marker was not performed according to commonly accepted standards.

The Applicant also submitted a computerised re-evaluation of the Ki67 cell proliferation data at the request of the CHMP which did not however show any differences compared to the primary analysis.

Systemic exposure: In all plasma samples from group 3 betulin and betulinic acid concentrations were below LLOQ (5 ng/ml). When Oleogel-S10 was applied to intact skin of mini-pigs, betulinic acid was detected in 3 out of 12 animals (4 / 216 samples on day 1 and day 29; 5.68, 6.42, 8.15 and 6.8 ng/ml). Measurable betulin concentrations were detected in single animals (7 out of 12 animals) at single time points: 33 out of 216 samples were above 5 ng/ml. All values were below 40 ng/ml; with 15/216 samples showing a concentration of &gt;10 ng/ml. The results suggested a tendency of increasing plasma levels with treatment duration. Major findings: Local tolerance (macroscopy): 150 mg/kg of TE did not cause any local intolerance reactions to the intact skin. At the end of the recovery period, erythema and eschar formation due to the healing process of the skin wound was still observed for both male animals treated previously with foam-bandage control (abraded skin) and one of two female animals treated previously with 150 mg/kg of TE (abraded skin). No erythema and eschar formation was noted at the end of the recovery period in both male animals treated previously with 150 mg/kg of TE (abraded skin) and one of two females treated previously with foam-bandage control (abraded skin). As requested by the CHMP, the applicant submitted additional evaluations of the safety study in mini-pigs, i.e. histopathological examination of all preserved organs and tissues in accordance with the EU repeat-dose toxicity guideline (CPMP/SWP/1042/99), peer-review of the histopathology report, including skin sections and samples of all organs according to (CPMP/SWP/1042/99) and a re-evaluation of Ki67 using a computerized image analysis. The histopathological evaluation of internal organs and tissues (skin samples excluded) did not reveal any findings related to Oleogel-S10 treatment. The observed organ weight changes are not considered to be associated with Oleogel-S10 treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the histopathological evaluation of skin samples, there were some histopathological differences between untreated intact skin and Oleogel-S10-treated intact skin in females, e.g. presence of epithelial hyperplasia in Oleogel-S10 treated intact skin both during the treatment period and after recovery (group 1). The applicant concludes that these findings are not associated with Oleogel-S10 treatment. It is agreed with the applicant that the histopathological findings in Oleogel-S10-treated intact skin in female mini-pigs are comparable to the background findings observed in female mini-pigs presented by Jeppesen and Skydsgaard, 2015. In addition, there are no findings in the pharmacological studies (e.g. the evaluation of the proliferation marker Ki67) that raise safety concerns related to the presence of epithelial hyperplasia in Oleogel-S10-treated intact skin.

In the histopathological evaluation of skin samples, there was also an increased incidence and severity of lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell infiltration in association with the presence of multinucleate giant cells in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Oleogel-S10 treated abraded skin (group 3). It is agreed with the applicant that the inflammatory reactions in Oleogel-S10 treated abraded skin in mini-pigs could be caused by the presence of low soluble test item material. It is also agreed with the applicant that these reactions could persist for a few weeks but then resolve. The increased incidence and severity of lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell infiltration in OleogelS10 treated abraded sites in mini-pigs is not considered a safety issue to patients.

In the chromosomal aberration test in vitro , the test result was negative up to the test concentration of 500 μg/ml TE. In the test without metabolic activation the mean incidence of chromosomal aberrations ranged from 1.5-3.9 %. The background data on incidence of chromosomal aberrations of the negative controls ranged from 0-5.0 % for the last 30 experiments. At the highest concentration of 1000 μg/ml only an increase in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations was noted to 8.7 % at 24 h exposure. Concentrationrelated cytotoxicity was observed in the experiments without metabolic activation. In the presence of metabolic activation no cytotoxicity was observed ant the mean incidence of chromosomal aberrations ranged from 1.0-2.5 %. In the in vivo micronucleus test, the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg i.p resulted in no increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE). In this study, betulin plasma levels have not been determined in mice following intraperitoneal administration of TE. Thus, the validity of the in vivo genotoxicity study could be debated. However, it was recognized that the product is intended for local use with negligible or no systemic absorption. From this perspective, i.e. with focus on local effects in the skin, the negative results of the two in vitro genotoxicity studies were reassuring and considered sufficient to cover the use of TE in the applied indication. No genotoxic / mutagenic effects are published in the public domain for betulin, betulin acid, lupeol, oleanolic acid and erythrodiol. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies were submitted.

The potential of triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) to provoke skin sensitisation reactions in 20 male guinea-pigs was studied in a test model according to Magnusson and Kligman (Maximisation test). A 0.01 % concentration of TE in sesame oil chosen for the 1st (intracutaneous) induction stage produced a discrete or patchy to moderate and confluent erythema in all animals. Two ml of a 15 % concentration of TE in sesame oil chosen for stage 2 (topical) induction was not irritating to the skin. Hence, the skin was coated with sodium laurylsulfate on the day before stage 2 induction (day 7 after the first induction) in order to induce a local irritation. A 15 % concentration of TE in sesame oil was the highest technical possible suspension.

The maximal dose level in clinical use is calculated to 155 mg/kg triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) per day (assuming a maximal treatment area of 1 000 cm 2  at a maximal single dose of 93 g Oleogel-S10 and a mean body weight of 60 kg). Table 9. Toxicokinetic results from studies 13904/01and 26742 Local Tolerance Medicinal product no longer authorised

The challenge on day 21 with a 15 % suspension in sesame oil revealed no sensitizing properties for the depilated skin. The vehicle employed and the 15 % birch bark extract concentration employed during the challenge stage 3 revealed no skin reactions per se. As a positive control animals of this strain were treated

with benzocaine and exhibited a sensitising reaction.

## Other toxicity studies

## Phototoxicity in vitro (Balb/c 3T3 cells)

Triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE) was assayed in a 3T3 NRU in vitro phototoxicity test. The cytotoxicity was studied in the presence and absence of exposure to a non-cytotoxic dose of UVA/VIS light. The test concentrations ranged from 0.0078-1.0 μg/ml (with and without UV irradiation). The selected test concentrations were based on the preliminary test resulting in pronounced cytotoxicity at concentrations from 3 μg/ml. No signs of cytotoxicity were observed up to the top concentration of 1.0 μg.

The applicant performed a variety of in vitro and ex vivo studies to evaluate the wound healing properties of the triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE). There were no safety concerns raised from the assessment of the pharmacological data.

Criteria for the choice of an appropriate light source included the essential requirement that the light source emits wavelengths absorbed by the test item and that the dose of light (achievable in a reasonable time) was sufficient for the detection of known photo-sensitisers. At UVA (= 5 J/cm2; UVB =0.79 mW/cm2), exposure time 9.18 minutes, the EC50 (-UV) and EC50 (+UV) could not be calculated and TE was considered to be not phototoxic. Chlorpromazine was used as the positive reference. In the presence of UVA/vis light an EC50 value of 0.75 μg/ml was calculated. In the absence of UVA/vis light an EC50 value of 7.2 μg/ml was calculated. Hence, a photo-irritationfactor of PIF = 9.6 was calculated. Photosensitisation female guinea-pig In the photosensitisation assay in guinea-pigs with and without UV irradiation, Oleogel-S10 (10 % dry extract from birch bark in sunflower oil) was studied. The dose level was 48 mg triterpene dry extract from birch bark (TE). TE did not show phototoxic properties in the 3T3 NRU in vitro phototoxicity assay. Photosensitisation was studied in guinea-pigs and the skin reactions erythema, eschar and oedema formation were evaluated. In this study, TE revealed no photosensitising properties. However it is not known whether these results can be used to predict photo-allergy in humans. 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment In accordance with the 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) the Applicant provided a justification for not submitting environmental risk assessment studies due to the nature of the constituents of this product. 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pharmacokinetic studies were not performed and this was considered acceptable due to the negligible systemic exposure following topical application of the product.

The pivotal 4-week local tolerance and subchronic toxicity study in mini-pigs via dermal administration is considered central for the non-clinical safety assessment of Episalvan gel. The histopathological evaluation of internal organs and tissues (skin samples excluded) did not reveal any findings related to Episalvan gel

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment.  However, in the histopathological evaluation of skin samples, there were some histopathological differences between untreated intact skin and Episalvan gel-treated intact skin in females, e.g. presence of epithelial hyperplasia in Episalvan gel treated intact skin both during the treatment period and after recovery. The CHMP considered that the histopathological findings in Episalvan gel-treated intact skin in female minipigs were comparable to the background incidence rates observed in female mini-pigs as reported in the scientific literature (Jeppesen and Skydsgaard, 2015) and were not associated with Episalvan gel treatment.

In the histopathological evaluation of skin samples, there was also an increased incidence and severity of lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell infiltration in association with the presence of multinucleate giant cells in Episalvan gel treated abraded skin. The CHMP considered that that the inflammatory reactions observed were most likely associated with foreign body reactions and considered to be caused by the presence of low soluble test item material or wound dressing. The CHMP therefore concluded that the increased incidence and severity of lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell infiltration in Episalvan gel-treated abraded skin in mini-pigs does not translate to a safety issue for patients. The histopathological evaluation of internal organs did not reveal any findings related to the test item Oleogel-S10 or the procedure itself in any internal organs examined microscopically. Small differences in organ weight changes were observed in animals which had received treatment on abraded skin and this finding was considered be caused by the technical procedure to produce skin graft-excised areas on the skin using a dermatome. The genotoxicity potential of TE was studied in in vitro mutagenicity assays (Ames test and chromosome aberrations test in human lymphocytes). Episalvan gel was non-genotoxic . An in vivo micronucleus test in mice was negative as well; however, betulin plasma levels were not determined in this study. Since the product is intended for local use with negligible or no systemic absorption, the negative results of the two in vitro genotoxicity studies are considered sufficient to cover the use of TE in the present indication. In vivo tests are not expected to yield useful information considering the low systemic exposure (EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008). Carcinogenicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not submitted. This was acceptable considering to the low systemic exposure of betulin following topical application of Episalvan gel. The potential of TE to provoke skin sensitisation reactions was studied in a test model in guinea-pigs and in the 3T3 NRU in vitro phototoxicity assay. In these experiments TE did not reveal any photosensitising or skin sensitisation properties. No studies addressing pharmacological effects on targets other than the skin were submitted. This was considered acceptable given the negligible systemic exposure following dermal application of Episalvan to patients . 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The non-clinical program conducted for TE was not exhaustive and this was considered acceptable, due to the limited systemic exposure, following Episalvan gel application. The CHMP considered that the provided information was sufficient to support the use of the product in the treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults and that there are no specific non-clinical issues that require further action post-marketing. Nevertheless, Section 5.3 of the SmPC states that repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance have been studied for up to 4 weeks to reflect the limited duration of the studies in the non-clinical program.

Patient base: all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics As plasma sampling for bioanalysis of the major component of the extract, betulin, revealed low and sporadic levels were found, it was concluded that the systemic absorption was minimal. Therefore no further studies on the distribution, elimination, dose-proportionality, time dependencies, potential drug-drug interactions of betulin or in special populations were performed. Bioavailability In three clinical studies, plasma sampling was performed before treatment and at certain time-points during treatment, to measure the systemic concentration of betulin ( Table 10 ). In studies BSH-12 and BSG-12, sampling was performed on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and at end of treatment, in study BBW-11, on days 0, 7, 14 and at end of treatment. In total, 929 plasma samples were taken. Of the 929 plasma samples, 37 (4%) had quantifiable betulin concentrations, 14 of these were pre-dose samples and 23 during the treatment period. Table 10.

The applicant noted that some common nutrients such as lingonberries, olives and apples contain betulin, and considered that they could be a source of measurable betulin plasma levels and also explain the positive pre-dose samples.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Primary pharmacology No clinical studies investigating the pharmacodynamic effects of Episalvan gel were submitted. Secondary pharmacology No information on secondary pharmacology is available. Considering the insolubility of the active ingredient TE in water and the topical route of administration, this was considered acceptable. 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology Application of  Episalvan gel to STSG donor site wounds and Grade 2a burn wounds did not lead to plasma levels of betulin higher than natural background levels originating e.g. from nutritional sources such as olive oil, based on 929 plasma samples from 280 patients in studies BSH-12, BSG-12 and BBW-11. As betulin is the major component of Episalvan gel, and the systemic uptake of this component seems to be very limited, measurement of betulin only in plasma was considered acceptable. Occasional samples with measurable concentrations of betulin were found both pre- and post-dose, and all reported positive samples had betulin levels in the range of 1-70 ng/ml.  Plasma levels resulting from topical treatment of Episalvan were not higher than natural background levels originating from nutritional sources, such as lingonberries, olives and apples which are known to contain betulin. The CHMP noted that in the studies where pharmacokinetic data were collected, the treated wound area was limited in size. However, as the the two patients with the largest wound areas in the clinical studies had plasma betulin levels below the LLOQ, and preclinical data suggested that larger wound areas (5% of body surface) in mini-pigs did not result in detectable betulin levels, the CHMP considered that it was unlikely that application of Episalvan gel on larger wound areas would result in significant increases to systemic exposure. Nevertheless, the limited wound sizes that have been studied in the clinical program are reflected in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, which specifically states that the median wound size treated with Episalvan in clinical studies in split thickness donor site wounds was  67.5 cm² (range 8-300 cm²) and 85 cm² (range 23-395 cm²) in the Grade 2a burn wound study.

No further studies on the on the distribution, elimination, dose-proportionality, time dependencies, potential drug-drug interactions of betulin or in special populations were submitted, and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

No clinical studies investigating the pharmacodynamic effects of Episalvan gel were submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  The Applicant referred to published literature on the primary pharmacology of betulin which comprised approximately 72-88% of the dry extract from Betula cortex, which have suggested a number of plausible mechanisms of action for betulin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Several in vitro and ex vivo experimental approaches have been employed in these studies to demonstrate that TE and its main compound, betulin, has an effect on skin wound healing. These effects could be mediated by different mechanisms, including the modulation of several pro-inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, IL-6 and IL-8 during the inflammatory phase, enhanced migration of keratinocytes and promotion of keratinocyte differentiation and neo-formation of the epithelium.

The CHMP considered that evidence from the published literature they provide plausible explanations in support of an effect of betulin in the wound healing process.

2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology Systemic absorption of betulin following Episalvan gel application on wounds is not different to background plasma levels following nutritional exposure to products which contain betulin. Therefore, the CHMP considered that there was no need to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of Episalvan gel, further to the information provided by the Applicant. The pharmacology of Episalvan gel was considered sufficiently characterised. 2.5. Clinical efficacy 2.5.1. Dose response studies No conventional dose-response studies were performed. Episalvan gel contains 10% dry extract from Betula cortex (birch bark) and 90% sunflower oil. The product is an oleogel, meaning that blending of the dry Betula cortex extract with an oil results in the formation of a gel. The API concentration of 10% W/W provides for good physical properties of the formulation, being a thick gel that allows for good coverage of the wound. In the clinical development program the 10% concentration was selected for the partial thickness wound clinical development programme, which was initiated with two Phase II studies: the STSG donor site wound study BSH-10 and the Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) study BEB-10. The performed Phase II studies in 24 patients with STSG donor site wounds and in 10 patients with EB lesions are assessed as small but give some support for the clinical development of the product. The CHMP considered that the provided information was sufficient for the selection of the chosen concentration, as the systemic exposure of Episalvan is very low and does not allow for conventional dose response studies. 2.5.2.

## Treatments

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The test treatment was Oleogel-S10, which was applied at every change of wound dressing. The duration of treatment period was until full wound closure of both wound halves, but no longer than 28 days after the start of study treatment.

About 1 cm of Oleogel-S10 string (approximately 100 mg) per cm² (i.e. approximately 1 mm thick) was applied to one half of STSG donor site by applying it onto the wound-facing side of the wound dressing.

The reference treatment was non-adhesive wound dressing alone applied at every change of wound dressing.

The study treatment period was 28 days based on previous studies showing that STSG donor sites take approximately two to three weeks to heal. If full wound closure was not achieved within 28 days, study participation ended, and the investigator decided how to continue treatment. Two follow-up visits were scheduled 3 and 12 months after the skin graft for evaluation of the cosmetic outcome. The schedule of planned assessments is provided in Table 11 . Concomitant therapy Any medication considered necessary for the patient's welfare, and not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study medication, was given at the discretion of the investigator. All treatments given in addition to study medication were to be recorded in the eCRF together with the indication, quantity or dose administered, dates, and time of administration. Table 11 .

## Objectives

The objectives of the study was to compare intra-individually the efficacy and tolerability of Oleogel-S10 versus wound dressing alone in accelerating the wound healing of STSG donor sites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints Primary efficacy endpoint

- Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) between wound halves either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with nonadhesive wound dressing alone, based on photo evaluation by three independent, blinded experts.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

· Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) between wound halves either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with nonadhesive wound dressing alone, separately for each of the three independent, blinded experts; · Time from surgery until wound closure is achieved, separately for wound halves treated with OleogelS10 and non-adhesive wound dressing versus non-adhesive wound dressing alone; · Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound area treated with Oleogel-S10 compared to nonadhesive wound dressing alone; · Percentage of patients with wound closure at different time points; · Percentage of wound epithelialisation at different time points as assessed by a study team member during wound dressing change; · Assessment of efficacy (evaluated by investigators and patients). Further efficacy parameters · Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 compared to nonadhesive wound dressing alone, as evaluated by the unanimous decision of the three independent, blinded experts; · Relative intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves; · Additional analyses specified after unblinding in an Addendum to the statistical analysis plan included absolute and relative intra-individual difference in time to wound closure based on the investigator assessment, and time from surgery until wound closure based on the investigator assessment. Sample size It was assumed that enrolling 105 patients would result in a width of the confidence interval (CI) of 1.722 days: it was further assumed that with a sample size of 105 patients, a two-sided 95% CI for the difference in paired means extends 0.861 from the observed mean, assuming a standard deviation of 4.500 and a CI based on the large sample z statistic. A sample size of N =105 patients was also deemed sufficient to allow for substantial identification and reporting of AEs with the probability of observing at least one event of 0.95 when the probability of an event was 0.028.

## Randomisation

## Method of assigning wound halves to treatment

With the treatment open to investigators and patients, special emphasis was placed on a tamper-proof randomisation method. Before the STSG surgery the designated donor site was divided into two areas of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

equal size and marked as proximal and distal half or left and right half, depending on the location of the wound in regard to the centre of the body. After STSG harvest and complete marking of the two wound halves an overview photo was taken, which showed the complete STSG donor site wound area with markings of the wound halves and the location on the patient's body as illustrated in Figure 2 . The overview photo was uploaded to the eCRF for randomisation by IWRS. An automatic check validated that the photo had been taken the same day the photo was uploaded for randomisation. The investigator then received the randomised allocated treatment for the two wound halves from the IWRS. This procedure precluded any investigator bias in the assignment of treatment to wound halves. For all randomisation pictures it was subsequently verified that they showed the wound which received treatment with the study medication, that the STSG had been harvested, and that the division into two wound halves had been marked on the skin.

Assessment of efficacy was primarily based on blinded photo evaluation. Special care was taken with a quality control check of photographs to ensure blinding of evaluators. Blinded reader assessment results were used as source data for calculation of the primary endpoint and several secondary endpoints. In addition, other secondary endpoints were based on direct investigator assessment or questionnaire-based patient responses. Those were performed open-label.

Figure 2. Skin grafting, wound half assessment, randomisation, photo documentation and treatment in Study BSH-12 Blinding (masking) Although the treatment was open to patients and investigators, the evaluation of the clinical efficacy was performed in a blinded manner. Photographs of the treated wound halves taken by the site staff were evaluated by three independent wound healing experts having no information about the treatment regimen of any of the photographed wounds for an unbiased, blinded judgement. Observer-blinded assessment of wound healing based on photographs Medicinal product no longer authorised

The baseline photo was taken on Day 0 before treatment. At each wound dressing change, the wound was cleaned, photographed and the photo uploaded to the eCRF for the blinded read.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The treatment period (and thus photo documentation) lasted until wound closure was determined by the investigator for both wound halves but no longer than 28 days after start of study treatment.

## Preparation of photographs for blinded read

Two parties were involved in preparing the photographs for the blinded read. The eCRF provider (first party) removed markings as well as a 1 cm wide middle section and provided one separate image per wound half. These images were then controlled by an unblinded expert at FGK Clinical Research GmbH (second party) for any signs that could interfere with blinding, e.g. visible residual markings or gel residues.

If it was not possible to remove signs that could interfere with blinding, both images (of the Oleogel-S10 treated and of the corresponding standard of care treated wound half) were excluded from the blinded read even if one of the two images was 'clean'. An example for an 'interfering sign' is the characteristic residue of Oleogel-S10 gel on the wound. If only a Day 0 photo was available or remained after the quality control process described above, this patient was entirely excluded from the subsequent blinded read - thus no photos from this patient were presented to the blinded experts ('patient excluded from blinded read'). All photographs of a wound half which had passed the quality control process were assembled to photo series and a unique ID number per expert were assigned for the blinded read. Photo evaluation by blinded experts Photographs eligible for the blinded read were independently evaluated by each of the three wound healing experts. All available photos from one wound half (Oleogel-S10 treated or standard of care treated) comprising a 'photo series' were presented to the blinded expert with no information on the treatment and in randomised order of the photo series. Photos were presented in chronological order but with no information on the specific treatment day at which the respective photo was taken. With a zoom view, the blinded experts were able to magnify areas of interest to the full resolution of the original macro photograph. The blinded experts provided the following assessments: · Rate the photograph quality and decide whether the photograph series of the respective wound half is evaluable. If due to the quality of the presented photographs a decision is not possible whether a photograph in the series had reached wound closure (defined as at least 95% epithelialisation) or not, rate the photo series as 'not evaluable'. · If 'evaluable', determine which photograph is the first to show wound closure (epithelialisation of at least 95% of the wound area) or whether wound closure is not detectable in any of the photos. Separate photo series of both wound halves for each patient were assessed independently by the three blinded readers as described, with the exception of those patients for whom the series had been excluded from the blinded read.

## Statistical methods

The primary endpoint, difference in time to wound closure between wound sites (Oleogel-S10 treated minus standard of care treated half), was tested using a two-sided paired t-test. For censored observations (wound closure not observed), it was assumed that wounds were closed +1 day after the last observation. Such an approach would be appropriately conservative and likely to not introduce a bias in favour of Oleogel if the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

number of wounds not closed at the end of observation was lower in the Oleogel treated group The ITT analysis set i.e. all patients who had been treated at least once with Oleogel-S10 was the primary analysis set.

Secondary time-to-event analyses were performed as described for the primary analysis. For time from surgery until wound closure Kaplan-Meier analyses were additionally performed. For the percentage of patients with earlier healing a non-parametric Sign-test was used. The differences in percentage of wound epithelialisation was analysed by a t-test and Sign-test. For all tests, a two-sided significance level of 5% was applied. All secondary endpoints and safety analyses were generally done descriptively. The percentage of patients with application site reactions was compared between the two treatment regimens using McNemar's test.

Results Participant flow A total of 111 patients were enrolled at 18 centres in six countries: Germany (8 centres), Czech Republic (2 centres), Poland (1 centre), Finland (1 centre), Austria (2 centres), and Bulgaria (4 centres). Of the 111 enrolled patients, 107 patients received treatment with Oleogel-S10 plus wound dressing and wound dressing alone (standard of care). A total of 82 (77%) patients completed the treatment period as scheduled and achieved full wound closure. Of the 25 patients who did not achieve wound closure in the treatment period, 15 patients completed treatment and did not achieve full wound closure until Day 28 and 10 patients were prematurely discontinued. Of the 15 patients not achieving full wound closure, for 10 patients both halves were not fully closed, for 4 patients only the Oleogel-S10 treated wound half was fully closed, and for 1 patient only the wound half treated with standard of care was fully closed.

In study BSH-12, for 70 patients (65%) some photos were found in quality control to be not amenable to blinding (e.g. due to gel residues) and were excluded from the blinded read. For these patients, the mean proportion of excluded photos was 29%. Due to the large number of excluded photos the CHMP requested a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

re-evaluation of the photo series with all photos included even if the blinding would be difficult to maintain. In addition, the applicant was requested to provide a table showing the number of excluded photos in which: a) wound on the active side was closed, b) wound on the control side was closed, c) both were closed and d) both were open. In addition, the applicant was asked to provide a statistical analysis on the difference between the two treatment groups in the proportion of patients with wound closure at the pre-specified time points. This request extended to all the clinical studies which were considered during the evaluation of this application and are therefore presented in the 'Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and metaanalysis)' section of this report.

Baseline data The demographic characteristics of patients in study BSH-12 are summarised in Table 14 . Table 14. Demographics, baseline and skin characteristics BSH-12 (SAF, N=107) Baseline characteristics of STSG donor sites Characteristics of the STSG donor sites are summarised in Table 15 . The majority of STSG donor sites were located on the legs, with 52% on the right leg, and 36% on the left leg. The median wound size was 58 cm² ranging from 20 cm² to 600 cm². Table 15.

## Outcomes and estimation

Patients with major protocol deviations were excluded from the 'Per protocol' (PP) analysis set. Major protocol deviations included issues related to the photos. After database lock, but before communication of study results to the sponsor, a 'treatment-PP'(TPP) analysis set was defined because the initially defined criteria for the PP set excluded about 70% of patients from the analysis mainly due to issues related to photos. This TPP analysis set included all patients who were treated according to protocol without consideration of issues concerning photo documentation for the blinded read. Thus the TPP dataset reflects protocol adherence by investigators and patients, while the PP dataset reflects full completeness of the photo documentation for the blinded read.  These analysis sets are described in Figure 4 . Figure 4. Analysis sets in Study BSH-12 Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study BSH-12 Primary analysis

The mean, based on photo evaluation by three independent and blinded experts, intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves (Oleogel-S10 and wound dressing minus standard of care) was -1.4 days, i.e. smaller than zero, indicating that wound halves healed faster with Oleogel-S10 treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

regimen than with standard of care ( Table 16 ). The between-treatment difference was statistically significant (p &lt;0.0001, two-sided paired t-test, see table below).

Table 16. Difference in time to wound closure in Study BSH 12- mean blinded expert evaluation (ITT, N = 107)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Wound closure could not be determined for all photo series by the blinded experts. If wound closure was not observed in one or both photo series for a patient, no definite time to calculate a difference in wound healing time was available ('censored values') and certain assumptions had to be made to calculate the intraindividual difference in time to wound closure. If wound closure had not been observed for one of the two wound halves, the time to wound closure for the unknown half was set to the day of the last photo +1 day. By using this 'day of last photo +1' approach, the time difference to wound closure of the other wound half, and thus the treatment effect size, was very likely underestimated. The number of patients for whom derivations of censored values were to be made to calculate the intra-individual time difference in wound closure are summarised in Table 18 based on the data available after the blinded read.

The time from surgery to wound closure and the difference in time to wound closure can be seen in Table 17 . Table 17.

## Sensitivity analysis

Because of the high proportion of censored values in the calculation of the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses were done to assess whether the size of treatment effect was truly reflected in the primary endpoint. In the primary analysis, one day was added to the day of the last photograph available for the assessment of time to wound closure in cases in which wound healing was not observed. However, as wound dressings were changed every three to four days, three to four days would be the minimal duration for which healing would have been observed in the study, a much longer interval than one day used in the primary analysis. Thus in the sensitivity analysis, different intervals (+2 days, +3 days, +4 days, +7 days, and +MTWDC) were added to the last day for which a photo was available ( Table 20 ).

|----------|

The mean time from skin grafting surgery (Day 0) to wound closure for Oleogel-S10 treated wound halves was shorter than that for wound halves treated with wound dressing alone (15.5 days versus 17.1 days). The corresponding expert opinions, investigator assessments, and the centre-, country-stratified analyses showed similar results.

Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound area treated with Oleogel-S10 compared to nonadhesive wound dressing alone

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of patients showing faster healing of the Oleogel-S10 treated wound half was higher than the percentage of patients showing faster healing of the wound half treated with standard of care (61.7% versus 7.5%). For 31% of patients no difference in wound healing was observed, photographs were not evaluable, or none of the wound areas achieved complete wound closure.

## Percentage of patients with wound closure at different time points

According to the mean expert evaluation, the percentage of wound halves achieving full wound closure was higher for the Oleogel-S10 treated wound halves than the standard of care wound halves on Day 10 (25.5% and 15.7% of patients, respectively), Day 14 (49.0% and 37.3%, respectively), Day 18 (70.6% and 61.8%, respectively), Day 21 (77.5% and 71.6%, respectively) and Day 28 (94.1% and 90.2%, respectively). Similar results were observed in the analyses based on individual expert assessment. Further efficacy endpoints Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half with Oleogel ˗ S10 compared to non-adhesive wound dressing alone, as evaluated by the unanimous decision of the blinded experts According to the unanimous decision of the blinded experts, 100% of patients for whom a between-treatment difference in wound healing was observed (n = 16) showed earlier healing of their wound halves treated with the Oleogel-S10 regimen while none of the wound halves treated with the standard of care showed an earlier healing. For 91 out of 107 patients no difference in wound healing was observed, photographs were not evaluable, or no unanimous decision could be reached. Study BSG-12 An open, blindly evaluated, prospective, controlled, randomised, multicentre, phase III clinical trial to compare intra-individually the efficacy and tolerance of Oleogel-S10 versus standard of care in accelerating the wound healing of split-thickness skin graft donor sites. Methods The design of this study was identical to Study BSH-12. Results Participant flow A total of 113 patients were screened and enrolled at 14 centres in 4 countries: Spain (6 centres), Greece (3 centres), Latvia (2 centres) and France (3 centres). Of the 113 screened patients, 112 received treatment with Oleogel-S10 and wound dressing or standard of care. One patient was not treated with study medication, as the STSG surgery was cancelled.

A total of 92 patients completed the treatment period and achieved full wound closure by Day 28 or before as scheduled. Of the remaining 20 patients, 13 patients did not achieve full wound closure until Day 28 and 7 patients were prematurely discontinued. Of the 13 patients who did not achieve full wound closure by Day 28, both halves were not fully closed for 4 patients, only the Oleogel-S10 treated wound half was fully closed for 5 patients, and only the wound half treated with standard of care was fully closed for 4 patients.

## Outcomes and estimation Primary analysis

The mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves (Oleogel-S10 and wound dressing minus standard of care) was -0.8 days, i.e. smaller than zero, indicating that wound halves heal faster with Oleogel-S10 treatment regimen than with the standard of care. The between-treatment difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0232, two-sided paired t-test, Table 25 ).

As with Study BSH-12, wound closure could not be determined for all photo series by the blinded experts. If wound closure was not observed in one or both photo series for a patient, no definite time to calculate a difference in wound healing time was available ('censored values') and certain assumptions had to be made to calculate the intra-individual difference in time to wound closure. If wound closure had not been observed for one of the two wound halves, the time to wound closure for the unknown half was set to the day of the last photo +1 day ( Table 27 ).

By using this 'day of last photo +1' approach, the time difference to wound closure of the other wound half, and thus the treatment effect size, was very likely underestimated. The number of patients for whom

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

derivations of censored values were to be made to calculate the intra-individual time difference in wound closure are summarised in the table below by expert based on the data available after the blinded read.

Results of the primary endpoint for the completer, TPP, and PP analysis ( Table 28 ) confirmed the results of the ITT analysis showing quicker healing of wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 and wound dressing than the wound halves treated with the standard of care.

## Sensitivity analysis

Similar to Study BSH-12, due to the high proportion of censored values in the calculation of the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses were done to assess whether the size of treatment effect is truly reflected in the primary endpoint. In the primary analysis, one day was added to the day of the last photograph available for the assessment of time to wound closure in cases in which wound healing was not observed. However, as wound dressings were changed every three to four days, three to four days would be the minimal duration for which healing would have been observed in the study, a much longer interval than one day used in the primary analysis. Thus in the sensitivity analysis, different intervals (+2 days, +3 days, +4 days, +7 days, and +MTWDC) were added to the last day for which a photo was available.

The mean time from skin grafting surgery (Day 0) to wound closure for Oleogel-S10 treated wound halves was shorter than that for wound halves treated with wound dressing alone (15.1 days versus 16.0 days). The corresponding expert opinions, investigator assessments, and the centre-, country-stratified analyses showed similar results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of patients showing faster healing of the Oleogel-S10 treated wound half was higher than the percentage of patients showing faster healing of the wound half treated with standard of care (45.5% versus 30.0%). For about a quarter of patients (24.5%) no difference in wound healing was observed, photographs were not evaluable, patients were excluded from the blinded read, or none of the wound areas achieved complete wound closure in all 3 expert assessments.

According to the mean expert evaluation, the percentage of patients achieving full wound closure was higher for the Oleogel-S10 treated wound halves than for the standard of care wound halves on Day 10 (14.8% and 8.3% of patients, respectively), Day 18 (79.6% and 71.3%, respectively), Day 21 (86.1% and 80.6%, respectively) and Day 28 (96.3% and 91.7%, respectively). Further efficacy endpoints Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half with Oleogel ˗ S10 compared to non-adhesive wound dressing alone, as evaluated by the unanimous decision of the blinded experts According to the unanimous decision of the blinded experts, around 78% of patients for whom a betweentreatment difference in wound healing was observed (n =14) showed earlier healing of their wound halves treated with the Oleogel-S10 regimen while 22% of the wound halves treated with the standard of care showed an earlier healing. For 92 out of 110 patients, no difference in wound healing was observed, photographs were not evaluable, or no unanimous decision could be reached. BBW-11 Open, blindly evaluated, prospective, controlled, randomised, multicentre, phase III clinical trial to compare intra-individually the efficacy and tolerance of Oleogel-S10 versus standard of care in accelerating the healing of Grade 2a partial thickness burn wounds Methods This was an open, blindly evaluated, prospective, controlled, randomised, multicentre, phase III study enrolling patients with Grade 2a partial thickness burn wounds.

## Treatments

The Grade 2a burn wound (size at least 80 cm 2 ) was cleansed by disinfectant, e.g. octenidine solution or polyhexanide solution (silver sulfadiazine was not allowed as it obscures photobased evaluation of wounds). After cleaning, about 1 cm of gel string Oleogel-S10 (approximately 100 mg) per cm 2  (i.e. approximately 1 mm thick) was applied to one half of the burn wound according to the randomisation and covered with fatty

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

gauze as wound dressing. The other half of the wound was covered with Octenilin ® Wound Gel (a branded octenidine hydrogel) and fatty gauze as wound dressing.

To avoid confusion about which half has to be treated with Oleogel ˗ S10, the healthy skin next to the wound was marked with ink with 'V' for verum and '-' for the wound half treated with Octenilin® Wound Gel and fatty gauze as wound dressing.

Octenilin ® Wound Gel is a commercial medical device product of Schülke &amp; Mayr GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany, containing the antiseptic agent octenidine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Selection and timing of dose for each patient

Oleogel ˗ S10 and Octenilin® Wound Gel were applied at each change of wound dressing (at least every second day) until full wound closure was achieved. If one half or both halves of the wound were still open after Day 21, treatment was either terminated or still continued until the investigator decided to change medication and/or treatment. In case one wound half was closed earlier than the other, it was necessary to treat both wound halves with the assigned treatment regimen until both wound halves were closed or until the investigator decided to change medication and/or treatment (after Day 21).

Concomitant therapy Any medication considered necessary for the patient's welfare, and not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study medication, was given at the discretion of the investigator. All treatments given in addition to study medication were to be recorded in the eCRF together with the indication, quantity or dose administered, dates, and time of administration. Objectives To compare intra-individually the efficacy and tolerability of Oleogel ˗ S10 with fatty gauze as wound dressing versus standard of care (defined as Octenilin® Wound Gel) with fatty gauze as wound dressing in accelerating the healing of Grade 2a burns. Outcomes/endpoints Primary efficacy endpoint Percentage of patients with earlier healing (at least 95% epithelialisation) of the wound half treated with Oleogel ˗ S10 compared to standard of care (Octenilin® Wound Gel), as evaluated by the majority decision of three independent, blinded experts.

## Further efficacy parameters

- Percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half treated with Oleogel ˗ S10 compared to Octenilin® Wound Gel, as evaluated by the unanimous decision of the three independent, blinded experts;
- Relative intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves either treated with Oleogel ˗ S10 and fatty gauze as wound dressing or treated with Octenilin® Wound Gel and fatty gauze as wound dressing.

Sample size Assuming a proportion of patients who showed an earlier healing with Oleogel ˗ S10 for burn wounds ('winner') of 0.712 compared to patients who show an earlier healing with Octenilin® Wound Gel, and a power of 80% to reject the null-hypothesis, the sample size was calculated to be 45 patients. Assuming that for 25% of patients, no difference in wound healing can be evaluated by the majority of the blinded experts, a total of 66 patients were enrolled. Randomisation Method of assigning wound halves to treatment With the choice of study medication open to investigators and patients, special emphasis was placed on a tamper-proof randomisation method. Of the potentially multiple wounds of varying wound depth, a suitable study wound was selected and divided into two halves of equal size. In case of two separate wounds the investigator made sure that both halves were similar in size, depth, location (e.g. with regard to skin thickness or hairy versus hairless skin) and originated from the same accident. Due to the intra-individual comparison of two wound halves to be covered with either Oleogel ˗ S10 and fatty gauze or with Octenilin® Wound Gel and fatty gauze, one of these halves was closer to the centre of the body (proximal [p] wound half) than the other (distal [d] wound half). A skin compatible ink marker was used to clearly divide the wound into two halves. If the wound location and orientation was not appropriate to divide the wound area into proximal and distal treatment halves, the wound area was divided and marked into right [r] or left [l] halves. If, in very specific cases, this was also not appropriate, the wound area was then divided and marked into upper [u] or lower [l] halves. After complete marking of the two wound halves an overview photo was taken, which showed the complete wound area with markings of the wound halves and the location on the patient's body. The overview photo was uploaded to the eCRF for randomisation by IWRS. An automatic check validated that the photo had been taken the same day the photo was uploaded for randomisation. The eCRF acting as IWRS provided information on randomisation number for the individual patient, and the wound half that was to be treated with Oleogel ˗ S10. For all randomisation pictures it was subsequently verified that they showed the wound which received treatment with the study medication and that the division into two wound halves (or two comparable wounds) had been marked on the skin. In accordance to the randomisation, the investigator treated the patient's assigned wound halves. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Blinding (masking)

Although the treatment was open to patients and investigators, the evaluation of the clinical efficacy was performed in a blinded manner as outlined in the primary endpoint description.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Photographs of the treated wound halves taken by the site staff were evaluated by three independent wound healing experts having no information about the treatment regimen of any of the photographed wounds for an unbiased judgment.

## Statistical methods

The primary endpoint was tested using a one-sided, exact binomial test using a significance level of alpha = 0.025.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were generally evaluated two-sided using the exact binomial test for percentage of patients with earlier healing, a paired t-test for between treatment difference in time to wound closure, time from study start until wound closure, and percentage of wound epithelialisation. Time from study start until wound closure was also analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and percentage of wound epithelialisation additionally with a Sign test. Safety analyses were generally done descriptively. The percentage of patients with application site reactions was compared between the two treatment regimens - both overall and within each system organ class using McNemar's test. Results Participant flow Sixty-six (66) patients were enrolled at 10 centres in total, Germany (4 centres), Sweden (2 centres), Switzerland (1 centre) and the UK (3 centres). Of the enrolled 66 patients, 61 patients received treatment with both Oleogel ˗ S10 and Octenilin® Wound Gel and the 5 remaining patients did not receive any study treatment. A total of 50 (82%) patients completed the treatment period (full wound closure achieved) as scheduled. Eleven (11) patients discontinued treatment prematurely i.e. before full wound closure of both wound halves. Two of these patients however had full wound closure achieved for the Oleogel ˗ S10 treated wound half (as assessed by the investigator). Figure 7.

Table 31. Major Protocol Deviations in Study BBW-11(SAF, N = 61) Availability of wound photos for blinded evaluation For more than half of the patients (38, 67%) one or more photos had to be excluded from the blinded read. For these patients 36% of photos had to be excluded on average, in most cases due to gel residues. As mentioned previously the CHMP requested a re-evaluation of the photo series with all photos included even if the blinding would be difficult to maintain. In addition, the applicant was requested to provide a table showing the number of excluded photos in which: a) wound on the active side was closed, b) wound on the control side was closed, c) both were closed and d) both were open. In addition, the applicant was asked to provide a statistical analysis on the difference between the two treatment groups in the proportion of patients with wound closure at the pre-specified time points.

Outcomes and estimation Primary endpoint The results of the primary endpoint analysis based on blind photo evaluation are provided in the table below. The percentage of patients showing earlier healing of the Oleogel ˗ S10 treated wound half compared with the Octenilin® Wound Gel treated half was higher than the percentage of patients showing the opposite result i.e. faster healing of the Octenilin® Wound Gel treated wound half (85.7% versus 14.3%). The binomial test revealed that the rate of patients with earlier healing of their Oleogel ˗ S10 treated wound half, compared to their Octenilin® Wound Gel treated wound half, was significantly higher than 50% (p &lt;0.0001).

Twenty-two patients were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis because no between treatment difference was observed in the blinded read; seven had the photo series rated as 'not evaluable', seven had no complete wound closure observed in the blinded read, and eight had complete wound closure but no difference in wound healing between the Oleogel ˗ S10 site and control site.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Supportive analyses

Results of the PP and completer analysis confirmed the findings of the primary analysis with more patients showing faster healing of Oleogel ˗ S10 wound half than with Octenilin® Wound Gel treated wound half.

Subgroup analyses by gender and study centres

The results were consistent over gender and study centers.

Secondary variables: Percentage of patients showing earlier wound healing with Oleogel ˗ S10 than with Octenilin® Wound Gel based on all patients Including patients for whom no treatment differences in healing could be observed or for whom photographs were not evaluable or for whom no majority decision could be reached in the analysis, the binomial test demonstrated that the rate of patients showing earlier healing with Oleogel ˗ S10 treatment was no longer significantly different from 50%. According to the majority decision of the experts, 52.6% of patients showed earlier healing with Oleogel ˗ S10 compared to 8.8% of patients with Octenilin® Wound Gel, while in 38.6% of patients no difference between the treatments was observed. Intra-individual absolute and relative difference in time to wound closure between wound halves Based on the mean expert evaluation, the mean differences in time to wound closure between wound sites (Oleogel ˗ S10 treated minus Octenilin® Wound Gel treated) was approximately -1 day, i.e. smaller than zero, indicating faster wound healing with Oleogel-S10 treatment than with Octenilin® Wound Gel (p&lt;0.0001, twosided t-test). The relative intra-patient differences in time to wound closure (i.e. time to wound closure of Oleogel ˗ S10 treated minus Octenilin® Wound Gel treated, divided by Octenilin® Wound Gel treated wound half). The mean reader result for each patient averaged -11%, i.e. smaller than zero, also indicating faster wound healing with Oleogel ˗ S10 treatment than with Octenilin® Wound Gel. Time from study start after burn accident until wound closure Conservative estimation (first observation of wound closure = time of wound closure) According to the mean expert evaluation, the mean time from the burn accident to wound closure was 7.6 days for Oleogel ˗ S10 and 8.8 days for Octenilin® Wound Gel ( Table 34 ).

Most endpoints were analysed based on mean values from or the majority decision of the three blinded experts as well as by individual expert. The analyses by expert are not presented above but show similar results as the means or majority decision across experts. The results for all endpoints were similar in all analysis sets used. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) Pooled data were presented for studies BSH-12 and BSG-12, which were almost identical with regards to study design. The populations studied in this analysis are described in Table 38 . Table 38. Analysis Sets, BSH-12 and BSG-12 Pooled Analysis Medicinal product no longer authorised 吧

Treatment per protocol set (TPP): All patients in the ITT without any major protocol deviations (without consideration of photographs for the blinded read).

Per protocol set (PP): All patients of the TPP with *valid* blinded read assessments as defined by the BDRM.

The results from the primary endpoint in the pooled analysis across the two trials is presented in Table 39.

Blinded re-evaluation with all photos included Results of secondary blinded read in Studies BSH-12 and BSG-12 and BBW-11 To further investigate the impact of excluded photographs, the blinded photo evaluation was repeated with all photos included. The same experts as in the primary evaluation also conducted this secondary blinded read. The results showed a larger effect size compared to the primary evaluation ( Tables 40 and 41 ).

a Difference in time to wound closure was set to O for photo series rated as ^not evaluable'. If wound closure was not observed, it was calculated to have occurred one day after the last photograph in the series.

b Based on a two-sided paired t-test evaluating the mean difference as different from 0.

CI: confidence interval, ITT: intention-to-treat, Max: maximum, Min: minimum, N: number of patients in the analysis set, SD: standard deviation.

Statistical analysis on the difference between the two treatment groups in the proportion of patients with wound closure at pre-specified time points. A statistical analysis on the difference between the two treatment groups was conducted using Fisher's exact test following a request from the CHMP. The number of wound halves with wound closure was higher for the Episalvan gel-treated wound half compared to the standard of care treated wound half in the overall expert evaluation based on the majority of the three blinded experts ( Table 42 ). This was the case for all three studies at all-time points. For burn wound study BBW-11, the differences were most pronounced at the first pre-specified time point day 7. For the STSG studies, the differences between groups increased with time and reached statistical significance for day 10 through day 28 for study BSH-12 as well as for the pooled analysis of studies BSH-12 and BSG-12. Wound closure status and relevance of excluded photos using secondary blinded read data The observations of the secondary blinded reads were directly compared for several relevant groups of excluded photos. In this new analysis the wound closure status was derived from observation in the secondary blinded read, comparing the results for · all excluded photographs ( Table 43 ), · 'relevant' excluded photographs with possible impact on the result ( Table 44 ) and · 'relevant' excluded photographs with definite impact on the result ( Table 45 ).

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy of Episalvan gel is mainly supported by three clinical studies; two phase 3 studies (BSH-12 and BSG-12) performed in patients with split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites wounds and one phase 3 study (BBW-11) performed in patients with Grade 2a burn wounds. The studies are open, blindly evaluated, prospective, intra-individually controlled and randomised. The three pivotal phase 3 studies were performed in Europe.

The phase 3 studies enrolled male and female patients 18 years of age or above presenting an STSG donor site wound or acute Grade 2a burn wounds of certain sizes. There is no European guideline available for products indicated for treatment of wounds. Hence, efficacy end-points to be used are not clearly established. The primary efficacy end-point in the two pivotal studies BSH-12 and BSG-12 was the intra-individual difference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) between wound halves, either treated with Episalvan gel and non-adhesive wound dressing, or with non-adhesive wound dressing alone. In study BBW-11, the primary efficacy end-point was percentage of patients with earlier healing (at least 95% epithelialisation) of the wound half treated with Episalvan gel compared to standard of care (Octenilin® Wound Gel), as evaluated by the majority decision of three independent, blinded experts. Secondary and further efficacy end-points in studies BSH-12 and BSG-12 addressed intra-individual difference in time to wound closure, time from surgery until wound closure, percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound area treated with Episalvan gel compared to non-adhesive wound dressing alone and percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half treated with Episalvan gel compared to nonadhesive wound dressing alone, as evaluated by the unanimous decision and relative intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves. In study BBW-11, secondary and further efficacy end-points addressed percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half treated with Episalvan gel compared to Octenilin® Wound Gel, intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves and percentage of patients with earlier healing of wound half treated with Episalvan gel compared to Octenilin® Wound Gel, as evaluated by the unanimous decision of the three independent, blinded experts. Overall, the end-points used in the phase 3 studies were considered relevant. During the randomisation process, the wound was divided into two halves, one to be treated with Episalvan gel and one with standard dressing (BSH-12 and BSG-12) or with Episalvan gel and Octenilin treated wound half (BBW-11). The posology of Episalvan gel in studies BSH-12 and BSG-12 were 1 cm Episalvan gel (approximately 100 mg) per cm² (i.e. approximately 1 mm thick) which was applied to one half of STSG donor site by applying it onto the wound-facing side of the wound dressing. Since the design is intraindividual, the possibility of spill-over of active between the treatment halves could be of concern. However in these studies, where Episalvan gel was administered to the wound dressing and moreover, the allowance of a 1 cm wide middle section to provide separate images per wound half, spill-over was not considered to be a concern in assessing efficacy.

Episalvan gel was applied at every change of wound dressing, approximately every third day. The duration of treatment period was until full wound closure of both wound halves, but no longer than 28 days after the start of study treatment. In study BBW-11, after cleansing of the wound, about 1 cm of Episalvan gel (approximately 100 mg) per cm 2  was applied to one half of the burn at every change of wound dressing. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

other half of the wound was covered with Octenilin® Wound Gel and fatty gauze as wound dressing. The duration of treatment period was until full wound closure of both wound halves, but no longer than 21 days after the start of study treatment.

Although the treatment was open to patients and investigators, the evaluation of the clinical efficacy was performed in a blinded manner. Photographs of the treated wound halves taken by the site staff were evaluated by three independent wound healing experts having no information about the treatment regimen of any of the photographed wounds for an unbiased, blinded judgement. To ensure that the blinding procedure was maintained, a large proportion of the patients had one or more photos excluded from the blinded read in cases where there is residue of the gel in the active treated part of the wound. As a consequence, 65% of patients in study BSH-12 and 67% of patients in study BSG-12 had one or more photos excluded. For the ITT analysis, those patients were included with the remaining photos. However, those patients were completely excluded from the PP population. Therefore, the PP analysis set included only 31 and 37 subjects in studies BSH-12 and BSG-12, respectively. However, not all of the photos removed in the quality check were critical for the evaluation of the primary endpoint, e.g. if they affected photos early on. The removal of a photo would cause a blinded read evaluation to be not 'valid' according to the Blind data review meeting if a photo directly prior to the observed time point of wound closure was excluded, or if the last photo was excluded, and no wound healing was observed. Since gel residue was the main reason for exclusion of photos, there was a concern that wounds not closed on the side of active treatment could have been more difficult to clean and hence more likely to include gel residue and therefore to be excluded. If this had been the case, the bias introduced would favour Episalvan gel. To further investigate the impact of excluded photographs, the blinded photo evaluation was repeated with all photos included. The same experts as in the primary evaluation also conducted this secondary blinded read. These analyses showed a slightly larger effect size compared to the primary evaluation. The applicant also provided information on wound closure status for the excluded photos based on this secondary evaluation, showing that wounds not closed on the side of active treatment were not more likely to be excluded. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no significant bias favouring Episalvan gel was introduced by the exclusion of these photos to maintain the blinding of the evaluators. The statistical methods used in the phase 3 studies were considered adequate for the study design and endpoints. Efficacy data and additional analyses Treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (study BSH-12 and BSG-12) The majority of STSG donor sites were located on the legs. The median wound size was 58 cm² in study BSH-12 and 76 cm² in study BDG-12. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In both pivotal studies, Episalvan gel met the primary end-point and was significantly superior (p&lt;0.0001 study BSH-12; p&lt;0.00232 study BSG-12) compared to standard dressing. In study BSH-12, the mean time from surgery to wound closure was 17.1 days with standard of care treatment and 15.5 days when the wound was treated with Oloegel-S10. The mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves was -1.4 days, and this difference was statistically significant. The result in study BSG-12 is consistent with that of study BSH-12 albeit smaller. The mean time from surgery to wound closure is 16.0 days with standard dressing and 15.1 days when the wound was treated with Episalvan gel. The mean intraindividual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves was -0.8 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP noted that the effect size of Episalvan gel treatment appeared to be small, however also acknowledged that Episalvan gel has been developed for severe partial thickness wounds that require hospital treatment and that the length of hospitalisation is influenced by the progression of healing. The risk of healing delays and complications is directly correlated with time to wound closure. Therefore a difference of 1-2 days in the reduction of the wound closure which may appear small, could potentially determine the decision for or against a surgical procedure. Therefore any acceleration of wound healing of severe partial thickness wounds treated in the hospital should be considered as clinically relevant. The CHMP therefore considered that the clinical relevance of the observed effects had been adequately justified.

Wound closure could not be determined for all photo series by the blinded experts. If wound closure was not observed in one or both photo series for a patient, no definite time to calculate a difference in wound healing time was available ('censored values') and certain assumptions had to be made to calculate the intraindividual difference in time to wound closure. If wound closure had not been observed for one of the two wound halves, the time to wound closure for the unknown half was set to the day of the last photo +1 day. As substantially more wounds were closed in the Episalvan gel group, this provided reassurance to the CHMP that the proposed method of analysis was not biased in favour of Episalvan gel, the time difference to wound closure of the other wound half, and thus the treatment effect size, was likely underestimated. Because of the high proportion of censored values in the calculation of the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses were done to assess whether the size of treatment effect is truly reflected in the primary endpoint. However, as wound dressings were changed every three to four days, three to four days would be the minimal duration for which healing would have been observed in the study, a much longer interval than one day used in the primary analysis. Thus in the sensitivity analysis, different intervals (+2 days, +3 days, +4 days, +7 days, and +MTWDC) were added to the last day for which a photo was available. Of these MTWDC (mean time to wound dressing change), which is considered most relevant, indicated that Episalvan gel reduced time to healing with 2.0 and 1.1 days, respectively. Even if this analysis was conducted post-hoc, the CHMP agreed that the +1 assumption which was used probably underestimates the efficacy of Episalvan gel. Treatment of Grade 2a partial thickness burn wounds (study BBW-11) The study performed in patients with Grade 2a partial thickness burn wounds (BBW-11) enrolled 66 patients at 10 centres. The ITT group constituted of 57 patients and the PP group of 45 patients. The primary endpoint was percentage of patients showing earlier healing of the Oleogel ˗ S10 treated wound half compared with the Octenilin® Wound Gel treated half. 85.7% of patients showing a between-treatment difference in time to healing had faster healing with Oleogel-S10 (p&lt;0.0001). However, since 22/57 patients (39%) had no between-treatment difference, only 53% of all treated patients had faster healing with Oleogel-S10. Results of the PP and completer analysis confirmed the findings of the primary analysis with more patients showing faster healing of Episalvan gel wound half than with Octenilin® Wound Gel treated wound half.

The target population as specified by the proposed indication would include Grade 2b (deep partial thickness extending to dermis) which however were not studied in the clinical development program. The CHMP acknowledged that most patients from the Episalvan gel studies had superficial partial thickness wounds. However, deep partial thickness wounds were also present. In study BBW-11 in grade 2a burn wounds, 3 patients were enrolled with initial diagnosis of grade 2a that later were assessed as grade 2b and received STSG surgery. This was considered reflective of the difficulty to distinguish between 'superficial' and 'deep' partial thickness at initial wound diagnosis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Partial thickness burns (grade 2) often present with a continuum of different wound depths, changing gradually from grade 2a into grade 2b, and there may also be mixtures of different depths within the same wound. In clinical practice, the initial diagnosis of a grade 2a or 2b burn depth will frequently require revision as time progresses and repeated critical assessment of burn depth and healing progression is indicated (Papini, 2004). After 3 to 7 days post-injury, the assessment and estimate of wound healing time becomes more precise. Wounds judged to take more than 3 weeks to heal are indicated for transplantation with a STSG to reduce the risk of hypertrophic scarring. For grade 2b wounds, decision to transplant is typically taken one to two weeks post-injury.

Accidental wounds Accidental wounds are often of mixed depth, presenting a continuum of varying wound depths within the injured skin area. It is a treatment goal to preserve as much viable tissue as possible to reduce the need and the area for skin transplantation. Grade 2a burns represent accidental wounds and Episalvan gel showed efficacy in this wound type. For accidental wounds of other origins, after wound cleaning the STSG donor site wound is considered representative. Therefore the CHMP agreed that the proposed indication for Episalvan gel in the treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults adult was appropriate. The SmPC states that there is no clinical experience from use of Episalvan for the treatment of chronic wounds, e.g. diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers or wounds in patients with Epidermolysis bullosa and that there is no information available on clinical use of Episalvan for more than 4 weeks. 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy In clinical trials Episalvan gel was associated with faster healing in the order of 1-2 days out of 17 days associated with standard treatment in patients in healing of split-thickness wounds and by 1 day out of 9 days Grade 2a burn wounds. The secondary efficacy end-points and other endpoints supported the efficacy of Episalvan gel. These effects are considered to be of clinical relevance in conditions with limited treatment options. 2.6. Clinical safety Patient exposure In order to evaluate the safety of Episalvan gel, the Applicant conducted a pooled analysis of safety data which included patients from the Phase III studies BSG-12, BSH-12 and BBW-11. For this pooled analysis different conventions were used in the statistical analysis, compared to the analysis of the individual studies: · Only treatment-emergent AEs were considered in the pooled analysis whereas also AEs occurring outside the treatment period were considered in the analysis of the individual studies. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The classification of patients as 'completers', 'premature discontinuations due to AE' and 'premature discontinuations not due to AE' was only used in the pooled analysis, but not in the individual studies.

As a consequence of these different conventions discrepancies can be seen e.g. in the total numbers of AEs or the numbers of AEs leading to discontinuation between the pooled analysis and the individual studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 280 patients were included in the safety population for the Phase III studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 and BBW-11, and 253 (90.4%) patients completed the study. A total of 27 (9.6%) patients prematurely discontinued treatment, and for 10 (3.6%) of these patients, the primary reason for premature discontinuation was an AE ( Table 46 ).

The planned treatment was until wound closure or up to 28 days for the two skin graft wound studies (and until wound closure up to 21 days for the Grade 2a burn. The number of days on drug exposure is summarised in Table 47 .

The median size (range) of the treatment area was 33.8 cm 2  for studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 and 84.5 cm 2 for BBW-11, with an overall median (range) treatment area of 40 cm 2 . In study BBW-11, the large majority of patients (54, 88.5%) had one coherent wound area, whereas seven (11.5%) patients had two comparable separate wounds ( Table 48 ). Table 46.

Patient base: Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received at least a single application of Episalvan gel in the skin graft studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 or Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11). Other Studies with Clinical Safety Data In other studies which were not included in the pooled analysis of safety, 260 patients received at least one application of Episalvan gel (TE 10%) or TE 4%, and the study was completed by 249 (95.8%) patients. Two discontinuations were attributed to AEs, one in the actinic keratosis study BAK-08 and one in the psoriasis study BC-002. The CHMP considered that the safety assessment should be focused on the pooled analysis of data, as information from the studies would be of limited relevance as they concerned other types of lesions and/or used other treatment schedules and formulations/strengths of Episalvan gel. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics In the pooled analysis of safety, the majority (65%) were male patients, most patients (91%) were white, and most patients had a Fitzpatrick skin type of Grade II or III (77%). The mean age was around 50 years and approximately 25% of the patients were aged ≥ 65 years. The mean age in the burn wound study was lower compared with the STSG studies with only around 10% above 65 years ( Table 49 ). Adverse events For patients in the pooled analysis of safety, AEs were reported for 98 (35.0%) patients, related AEs were reported for 25 (8.9%) of patients, SAEs for 15 (5.4%) patients, and a related SAE for 1 (0.4%) patient ( Table 53 ). AEs that led to discontinuation were reported for 7 (2.5%) patients, and 1 (0.4%) patient had a related AE that led to discontinuation. In the analysis of adverse events, relationship was reported as related to study drug if it was assessed by investigator as remote/ unlikely, possible, probable or unknown. Common Adverse Events One or more AEs were reported for a total of 35% of patients. SOCs with highest incidence were infections and infestations (11.4%), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (8.2%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (10.4%). Most frequent AEs (by preferred term) comprised pyrexia and wound infection (3.9% of patients), skin infection (4.6%), pain of skin (5.4%) and pruritus (4.6%).

Application-site AEs were reported for the Episalvan gel treatment site for a total of 4 (1.4%) patients, the control (STC) site for 15 (5.4%) patients, and both treatment halves (meaning that the location of the AE could not be further differentiated ('location not further differentiated') for 36 (12.9%) patients (N=280) ( Table 53 ).

Patient base: Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received at least a single application of Oleogel-S10 in the skin graft studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 or Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11). Numbers in column skin graft wound were obtained by adding numbers for study BSG-12 and BSH-12. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If only the Episalvan gel treatment sites and the sites with 'location not further differentiated' were considered, a total of 40 (14.3%) patients had one or more application site AEs. Application site AEs reported for 2 (0.7%) or more patients in this category (Episalvan gel sites combined with the sites with 'location not further differentiated') comprised pain of skin (6 patients, 2.1%), wound infection (7 patients, 2.5%), skin infection (6 patients, 2.1%) and pruritus (6 patients, 2.1%); post procedural complication and wound

If only the Episalvan gel treatment sites and the sites with 'location not further differentiated' are considered, a total of 19 (6.8%) patients had one or more application site AEs. Related application site AEs reported for 2 (0.7%) or more patients in this category (Oleogel-S10 sites combined with the sites with 'location not further differentiated') comprised pain of skin (1.8% of patients), pruritus (1.4% of patients), post procedural complication (1.1%), and wound complication (1.1%).

Patient base: Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received at least a single application of Oleogel-S10 in the skin graft studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 or Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11). Frequently reported: 2 (0.7%) or more patients (preferred term) in the overall pooled analysis of safety in wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 (N=280).Wound half: Each patient received both Oleogel-S10 and standard of care.  The two different treatments were applied either to two halves of the same wound (BBW-11, BSH-12 and BSG-12) or to two non-contiguous wounds with equal treatment areas (BBW-11 only). Numbers in columns 'Oleogel-S10 or location not further differentiated' and column 'total' were obtained by adding numbers from relevant columns. Application-site AEs for which a relationship to treatment could not be ruled out were reported for the Episalvan gel treatment site for a total of 3 (1.1%) patients, the STC site for 6 (2.1%) patients, and both treatment halves ('location not further differentiated') for 16 (5.7%) patients ( Table 54 ).

Several terms in the previous table of adverse reactions related to complications, namely 'wound complication', 'post-procedural complication', 'wound secretion', 'impaired healing', or 'inflammation of wound'. The Applicant considered that these different terms represented the same phenomenon, and therefore proposed to group these in Section 4.8 of the SmPC as 'Wound complication', and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Patient base: Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received at least a single application of Oleogel-S10 in the skin graft studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 or Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11). Frequently reported: 2 (0.7%) or more patients (preferred term) in the overall pooled analysis of safety in wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 (N=280). Wound half: Each patient received both Episalvan gel and standard of care.  The two different treatments were applied either to two halves of the same wound (BBW-11, BSH-12 and BSG-12) or to two non-contiguous wounds with equal treatment areas (BBW-11 only). Numbers in columns 'Episalvan gel' or location not further differentiated' and column 'total' were obtained by adding numbers from relevant columns. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There were no deaths in the pooled analysis (study BSH-12, BSG-12 or BBW-12).

There were two deaths (0.8%) in the clinical studies not included in the pooled analysis (N=260). Neither death was considered to be related to treatment. In BSH-10, one patient died from progression of cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nearly 5 weeks after the 14-day treatment period. In the actinic keratosis study BAK-08, one patient died from cholangiocarcinoma 6 weeks after the last application of study medication.

There were a total of 15 (5.4%) patients who experienced one or more SAEs ( Table 55 ). The most frequently reported SAEs were wound infection, reported for 4 (1.4%) patients, and condition aggravated, reported for 2 (0.7%) patients (see table below). All other SAEs were reported for 1 (0.4%) patient each: pyrexia, bacteraemia, sepsis, soft tissue infection, postoperative wound complication, wound necrosis, tonsil cancer, mania, bronchospasm and diabetic foot.

There was one related (relationship reported as unknown) SAE in the pooled analysis (0.4%, N=280) for 'wound necrosis' which was experienced by a 79-year-old male patient in the Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11. The patient's hospital stay was prolonged because skin graft surgery was necessary. Both the wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 and STD alone had changed to Grade 2b and required skin grafting. The patient was prematurely discontinued from the study on Day 8 due to the SAE, two days after the last treatment with study medication.

Table 55. Incidence of serious adverse events by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, pooled analysis of safety Patient base: Safety Analysis Set (all patients who received at least a single application of Oleogel-S10 in the skin graft studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 or Grade 2a burn wound study BBW-11). Frequently reported: 2 (0.7%) or more patients (preferred term) in the overall pooled analysis of safety (N=280). Medicinal product no longer authorised

A change in burn wound depth from Grade 2a to Grade 2b is expected for up to 30% of patients in the study and skin grafting is the standard treatment for Grade 2b burn wounds. Based on the available information, the Applicant did not propose to include wound necrosis in the SmPC, and the CHMP agreed with this.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the studies not included in the pooled analysis (N=260), there were a total of 5 (1.9%) patients for whom SAEs were reported, none of which was considered related to study drug. All SAEs occurred in elderly individuals &gt;65 years of age in the actinic keratosis study BAK-08.

## Laboratory findings

Routine clinical laboratory assessments and measurement of vital signs were not done in the studies performed within the Episalvan gel clinical development program. In study BBW-11 microbial colonisation of the wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 or Octenilin was assessed by a local laboratory. This was done at Days 7 (±1 day), 14 (±1 day) and EoT. The difference in microbial colonisation of the two wound halves was assessed. If a clinically significant difference in microbial colonisation was found, the wound half showing more microbial colonisation was noted, as was the name of the germ mainly causing the difference and additional medical intervention required due to this microbial colonisation. For the majority of patients, no difference in microbial colonisation was noted between wound halves treated with the antiseptic Octenilin and Episalvan gel. Safety in special populations Adverse events by age group The nature and incidence of AEs for patients 18 to &lt;65 years of age compared to older patients ( Table 56 ), did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups.

## Use in Pregnancy and Lactation

There is no clinical experience of Episalvan gel in pregnant or lactating women. No effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to Episalvan is negligible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunological events

There were reports of allergic-like reactions, hypersensitivity, asthma and contact dermatitis reported in one patient each.

The case of asthma was reported in one the studies in AK. This case was considered to be unlikely related to treatment, as the risk for IgE mediated allergies due to Episalvan gel was deemed small.

The case of contact dermatitis originated from a publication (Meyer-Hoffert and Brasch, 2013), in which a 51year old male developed itchy erythema and papules on his hands and face 4 months after starting to use Imlan ®  Creme Pur cream (containing birch bark extract, jojoba oil, and water). It was later confirmed via patch tests that 10% birch bark extract in jojoba oil resulted in mild to moderate allergic reactions while 100% jojoba oil was negative. The authors concluded that as betulin is the major triterpene in Imlan ®  Creme Pur cream, it was suspected as the relevant allergen in this case, however, it cannot be excluded that another triterpene could have been the causative agent. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions No drug-drug interaction studies were included in the development program, due to the low systemic exposure, and no AEs related to interactions have been reported. Discontinuation due to adverse events There were 10 patients (3.6%) in the pooled safety database who discontinued the study due to AEs ( Table 57 ). The most frequently reported AE which led to discontinuation of treatment was wound infection (n=3; 1.1% of patients) (Table). All other AEs that led to discontinuation were reported for one (0.4%) patient each (soft tissue infection, post procedural complication, wound necrosis, and mania). Table 57.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The pooled safety data base for Episalvan gel consists of 280 patients in total, with the majority from the two STSG studies (n=219) and a smaller proportion from the Grade 2a burn wound study (n=61). The treatment duration differed for the different wound types with a mean ± SD treatment period of 18.5 ± 6.8 days for STSG and 10.4 ± 4.9 days for study BBW-11. The median size of the treatment area was smaller for studies BSG-12 and BSH-12 (34 cm2) in comparison with the burn wound study BBW-11 (85 cm2). Thus, even if it is agreed that the three studies may be combined, there are differences in duration and treated wound area. In order to address this, the Applicant presented the STSG and burn wound study results both combined and separately, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. In the studies not included in the pooled analysis of safety, 260 patients received at least one application of Episalvan gel (TE 10%) or TE 4%. The CHMP considered that data from these studies could only contribute supportive information, since they relate to other indications, other treatment schedules and other concentrations and formulations of Episalvan gel. In the pooled analysis of safety, one or more AEs were reported for a total of 35% of patients. The SOCs with highest incidence were infections and infestations (11%), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (8%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (10%). Most frequent AEs (by preferred term) comprised pyrexia and wound infection, skin infection, pain of skin and pruritus, each reported at a rate of 4 6%. Regarding AEs classified as related, this concerns a total of 25 (9%) patients, comprising pain of skin (2.9%), pruritus (1.4%), and a few patients with other AEs, e.g. wound complication and post procedural complications. Application-site AEs were reported separately for the Episalvan gel treatment site and the control (STC) site, however, in many cases it was classified as 'location not further differentiated'. Analyses have been presented for these separate categories as well as for the combined category 'Episalvan gel or location not further differentiated'. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP as it was expected that it would be difficult to distinguish between application-site adverse events for a wound divided in two halves, unless the effect was very pronounced. The rates of application-site adverse events were overall low and are adequately reflected in the SmPC. Regarding serious adverse events, the overall number of patients who experienced one or more SAEs in the pooled analysis of safety was low (15 or 5.4% of the patients). Wound infections were observed, however, none considered related to treatment.  For one of the SAE (wound necrosis) causality between treatment and event was reported as unknown by the investigator.  The CHMP agreed with the Applicant's response that the relationship between Episalvan and the reported event was not established based on the available information. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No deaths were reported in the studies in the pooled analysis and two deaths in the other clinical studies which however were considered not related to the treatment.

The number of patients in the pooled safety database who discontinued the study due to AEs was low (10 patients, 3.6%) and with the exception of the wound necrosis case, none of these was considered as related to treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With respect to immunological adverse events, the medicinal product contains an extract and not a single, defined active substance. Therefore, the possibility that the product does not contain constituents that may induce hypersensitivity reactions is difficult to be categorically excluded. Single cases of hypersensitivity, contact dermatitis and asthma have been reported with Episalvan gel.

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the excipient contained in the product are a contraindication for the use of Episalvan gel. In addtion, hypersensitivity and dermatitis are listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. It was considered however unlikely that Episalvan could have contributed to the single case of asthma case which has been reported.

## 2.7. Risk Management Plan

Episalvan gel is a locally applied, locally acting product with limited systemic absorption. Hence, no drug-drug interactions are expected. There is no information on the potential for interactions with other topically applied products and this is reflected in the SmPC. There were no major differences in the nature and incidence of AEs for patients aged less than 65 years compared with older patients, however, the number of patients aged 65 years and above was rather small (n=69). Even if slightly higher incidences of AEs were sometimes observed in elderly patients, the data gave no cause for concern, and no dose adjustment is required for use of Episalvan in the elderly. 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety Three studies are pivotal for assessment of the safety of Episalvan gel; all using an intra-individual, comparative design with the target wound area of each patient divided into two treatment areas or by selection of two comparable wounds (in the burn wound study only). The safety data presented did not give any major cause for concern with respect to all AEs, related AEs, SAEs, application site AEs or discontinuation due to AEs. Related AEs were reported in 9% of patients, with pain of skin (2.9%) and pruritus (1.4%) being the most common. Very few systemic AEs were reported, indicating a low risk for safety issues related to systemic absorption and causality in these reports was considered to be unlikely. Episalvan gel is not intended for long-term treatment and the recommended maximum treatment duration is 4 weeks. Therefore no long-term safety studies are required. Since the intended action of Episalvan gel is to promote wound healing, there is a potential proliferative and/or carcinogenic effect of the product, even if there is no evidence of such effects from the currently available data. However, as the product is only intended for short-term use, a proliferative effect is likely not to be an issue of clinical relevance. The safety profile of Episalvan gel is considered manageable, with the risk minimisation measures included in the SmPC and the RMP of the product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the pivotal study performed in patients with Grade 2a partial thickness burn wounds, the primary endpoint was percentage of patients showing earlier healing of the Episalvan gel treated wound half compared with the Octenilin ®  Wound Gel treated half. 53% of all treated patients had faster healing with Episalvan gel. According to the mean expert evaluation, the mean time from the burn accident to wound closure was 7.6 days for Episalvan gel and 8.8 days for Octenilin ®  Wound Gel.

2.9.2. Additional monitoring Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Episalvan gel is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance Benefits Beneficial effects The aim of Episalvan gel treatment is the healing of partial thickness wounds of different origin. The pivotal clinical studies were performed in patients with split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites wounds and in patients with Grade 2a burn wounds. The primary efficacy end-point in the two pivotal studies on STSG donor sites wounds were intra-individual difference in time to wound closure (at least 95% epithelialisation) between wound halves, either treated with Episalvan gel and non-adhesive wound dressing, or with non-adhesive wound dressing alone. In both pivotal studies, Episalvan gel met the primary end-point and was significantly superior in both studies compared to standard dressing. In the first study, the mean time from surgery to wound closure was 17.1 days with standard of care treatment and 15.5 days when the wound was treated with Episalvan gel. The mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves was -1.4 days. The difference was highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). The results in the second study were consistent with the first study. The mean time from surgery to wound closure was 16.0 days with standard dressing and 15.1 days when the wound was treated with Episalvan gel The mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves was -0.8 days and again statistically significant (p&lt;0.0232).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Methodological problems were encountered in evaluating efficacy in the STSG donor sites studies.  Many of the photographs of the treated wound halves taken by the site staff were excluded from the PP population in order to maintain the blinded read.

Therefore, in some cases no definite time to calculate a difference in wound healing time was available if wound closure was not observed in one or both photo series for a patient. Consequently, certain assumptions had to be made to calculate the intra-individual difference in time to wound closure. If wound closure had not been observed for one of the two wound halves, the time to wound closure for the unknown half was set to the day of the last photo +1 day. The CHMP agreed that this method of evaluation is likely to underestimate the effect size of the active treatment.

Due to the design of the studies was intra-individual, it was expected that it would be difficult to distinguish between application-site adverse events for a wound divided in two halves, unless the effect was very pronounced. However, the rates of application-site adverse events are overall low and did not appear to be of concern.

Episalvan gel has not been used for more than 28 days, thus, the clinical efficacy beyond this time frame is uncertain, which is clearly stated in the SmPC. Risks Unfavourable effects The most common adverse events which were considered as related to Episalvan gel concerned a total of 25 (9%) patients, comprising pain of skin (2.9%), pruritus (1.4%), and a few patients with other AEs, e.g. wound complication and post procedural complications. The safety profile of Episalvan gel was considered manageable, with the risk minimisation measures included in the SmPC and the RMP of the product. Due to the design of the studies was intra-individual, it was expected that it would be difficult to distinguish between application-site adverse events for a wound divided in two halves, unless the effect was very pronounced. However, the rates of application-site adverse events are overall low and did not appear to be of concern. Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects Although Episalvan gel is a local treatment and the systemic absorption is limited, systemic effects may not be completely ruled out. However, very few systemic AEs in the clinical program were reported and these were not considered related to the treatment. Furthermore, from available pharmacokinetic data it was concluded that betulin plasma levels resulting from topical treatment were not higher than natural background levels originating from nutritional sources. Although it cannot be excluded that treatment of larger wounds may result in higher systemic uptake of betulin, it seems unlikely that the plasma concentrations would reach levels with risk for systemic toxicity.

With respect to immunological adverse events, as the medicinal product contains an extract and not a single, defined active substance, there is a theoretical at least possibility that the product contains constituents that may induce hypersensitivity reactions. However, available data on this is limited and the issue will remain under review and is included in the RMP as an important identified risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Non-clinical and clinical data are only available up to 4 weeks use. Thus, safety data on long-term use are not available, however the proposed duration of use in the SmPC is up to 4 weeks.

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

A statistically significant efficacy for Episalvan gel compared to standard of care treatment was demonstrated for the primary endpoints, both in healing of split-thickness wounds and Grade 2a burn wounds. Even if the differences were in absolute terms small, they were considered of clinical significance. Wounds with difficulties to heal present with many challenges and there is an unmet medical need for products with wound healing properties.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Episalvan gel in the treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation circumstances subject to the following conditions:

The safety profile of Episalvan gel, due to its low absorption is limited to local reactions which are considered manageable with the routine risk minimisation measures included in the SmPC and the RMP. Benefit-risk balance The benefit-risk balance of Episalvan gel in the treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults is considered positive. Discussion on the benefit-risk balance Episalvan gel has demonstrated a statistical significant effect on shortening of time to wound healing of different wound origin. The shortened time to wound healing induced by Episalvan gel is considered clinically relevant in a condition with limited therapeutic alternatives. Furthermore Episalvan gel has a mild safety profile with adverse events limited to local application reactions which can be managed adequately with the routine risk minimisation measures described in the product's SmPC and RMP. 4. Recommendations Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Episalvan gel is not similar to Nexobrid of authorised orphan medicinal products within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.
