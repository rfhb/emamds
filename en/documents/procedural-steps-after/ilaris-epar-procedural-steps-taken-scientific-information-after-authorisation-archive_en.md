Also, the SJIA pooled dataset which supported the extension of the SJIA indication to include AOSD, submitted in Dec-2015, was updated with two recently completed studies. It can be concluded that the benefit-risk balance of canakinumab in the indication of Still´s disease is not altered even though this small investigator initiated study provides only limited but supportive assumptions. The results of the updated SJIA pooled dataset are comparable to the initially submitted dataset. Therefore, the updated pooled dataset is supportive and can confirm a comparable efficacy of canakinumab in SJIA patients across age groups. The overall safety profile of canakinumab in AOSD patients, as observed in the investigator-initiated trial GDE01T, was consistent with that observed in the updated SJIA pooled dataset and with that known for canakinumab in other   |

In view of the data submitted as part of the Annual Re- Assessment, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated with the results of study CACZ885D2401. This 6- year observational registry study was conducted to provide data on the long-term safety and effectiveness of Ilaris treatment in paediatric and adult CAPS patients in routine clinical practice. A total of 243 CAPS patients (85 paediatric patients aged ≥ 2 to ≤ 17 years and 158 adult patients aged ≥ 18 years) were treated with Ilaris in routine clinical practice (mean of 3.8 years of Ilaris exposure). The safety profile of Ilaris observed following long-term treatment in this setting was consistent with what has been observed in interventional studies in CAPS patients. Disease activity was rated as absent or mild/moderate in more than 90% of patients at all post-baseline time points in the study, and median serological markers of inflammation (CRP and SAA) were |

Although approximately 22% of patients receiving Ilaris required dose adjustment, only a small percentage of patients (1.2%) discontinued Ilaris due to lack of therapeutic effect. Further, the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet were updated to reflect the conversion of the MA from a MA under exceptional circumstances to a full MA and the consequential removal of Ilaris from the list of medicinal products that are subject to additional monitoring.   |
