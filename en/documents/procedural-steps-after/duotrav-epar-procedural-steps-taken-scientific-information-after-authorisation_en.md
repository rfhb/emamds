| II/0052            | Update of sections 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 'lid sulcus deepened' and 'iris hyperpigmentation' as new adverse drug reactions with frequency not known and to upgrade the frequency of 'skin hyperpigmentation (periocular)' from rare to uncommon based on the post-approval review of the safety data. In addition, section 4.8 of SmPC has been updated to align Adverse Drug Reactions table for the travoprost monotherapy. Based on the same safety review, section 4.6 of SmPC has been modified. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to align the Product information with the currently approved travoprost EU SmPC and QRD version 10 and to update the list of local representatives. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 15/02/2018 | 31/05/2018 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Following the cumulative review of relevant scientific and accumulated safety information, review of historical study reports and literature the section 4.8 is being updated to: - Add 'lid sulcus deepened' and 'iris hyperpigmentation' as new ADRs observed in post- marketing setting in section 4.8 with frequency 'not known'. - Change the frequency category of 'skin hyperpigmentation (periocular)' to uncommon, which was previously included as rare. - Update travoprost monocomponent ADRs table in section 4.8 in accordance with the current safety profile of Travatan (travoprost). Additionally, to avoid duplication, adverse reactions already listed within the combination therapy table were removed from the respective monocomponent tables. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. |

| II/0031     | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information in line with the latest Company Core Safety Information (CCSI) document. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 25/07/2013   | 21/03/2014 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | To reflect reviews mainly based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience carried out by the MAH, a safety update of the Product Information for DuoTrav was implemented. In particular, the MAH undertook a review of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) received from clinical trials and spontaneous post-marketing data up to December 2012. Nineteen clinical trials with DuoTrav Ophthalmic Solution (Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution) were identified. These 19 studies included DuoTrav preserved with benzalkonium chloride (DuoTrav BAK) or DuoTrav preserved with POLYQUAD (DuoTrav PQ or APS). Six of these studies were included in the Initial Marketing Authorisation Application (completed for DuoTrav in 2006, on 721 patients) and thirteen additional studies were completed subsequently (on 1449 patients). Thus, in the pooled studies, a total of 2170 patients had exposure to DuoTrav Ophthalmic Solution. This number enabled calculation of adverse events frequency for a number of events. Additionally, 5 new terms (eye irritation, dysphonia, hypertrichosis, trichiasis, distichiasis) were added to the safety information, based on analyses of these data from clinical studies. Three new terms (palpitations, oedema peripheral, dysgeusia) were also added to the safety information, based on review of post-marketing data. |

As other adverse reactions were also reported in PSURs to have been observed with Duotrav, consistently with the relocation of 'asthma' described above, the MAH made further changes to section 4.8 of the SPC. A number of other adverse reactions were relocated within the section, as they were observed during DuoTrav use. Namely: - 'Cardiac failure', 'cerebrovascular accident', 'syncope', 'paraesthesia', 'alopecia', 'chest pain' and 'depression'. Additionally, - 'Tachycardia', for which cases were reported in the 3rd PSUR, was included in section 4.8 of the SPC. - Section 4.8 of the SPC was modified to reflect the fact that the event 'iritis' had recently been reported during DuoTrav use. The corresponding changes to the PL were also implemented.   |

| II/0008 | Amendment of section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to replace some wording, as requested by the CHMP following assessment of the 2nd PSUR. Additional minor changes to section 4.8 have been made to reflect latest guidelines. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) has been amended accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, | 21/02/2008 | 31/03/2008 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Following assessment of the 2nd Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for DuoTrav eye drops, the CHMP recommended amendments to section 4.8 of the SPC. In particular, in order to make its section 4.8 as clear as possible to prescribers, the deletion of the following paragraph was requested: \"Travoprost: Additional undesirable treatment-related effects reported in clinical trials with concomitant therapy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These paragraphs were replaced with the sentence: \"Additional adverse events that have been seen with one of the components and may potentially occur with DuoTrav\". Additionally, 'macular oedema', 'corneal disorders', 'conjunctivitis', 'eyelid ptosis', 'rash' and 'arrhythmia' were moved from the sections on individual active ingredients, as applicable, to include them under the list of adverse reactions observed with DuoTrav use during post- marketing experience.   |
