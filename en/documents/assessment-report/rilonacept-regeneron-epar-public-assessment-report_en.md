## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Cryopyrin-associated  periodic  syndromes  (CAPS)  are  a  collection  of  hereditary  periodic  fever syndromes; inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with a sporadic or familial pattern and are associated with mutations in the CIAS1 gene resulting in an overproduction of IL-1 β .  They include Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) and Chronic Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, and Articular Syndrome (CINCA), also known as Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder (NOMID).

These conditions are very rare, and Orphan Designation was granted to Arcalyst (EU/3/07/456).

Medicinal product no longer authorised CIAS1 encodes  a  protein  called  cryopyrin  or  NALP3  that  is  a  component  of  the  inflammasome,  a protein complex that includes caspase-1 and controls activation of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL1 β (Agostini  2004).  CAPS  are  associated  with  features  of  localized  and  systemic  inflammation, including  overproduction  of  serum  amyloid  A  (SAA),  a  risk  factor  and  pathogenic  agent  for amyloidosis. Clinical symptoms and signs associated with FCAS, MWS, and CINCA form a spectrum and  vary  in  severity.  Common  characteristics  of  these  autoinflammatory  diseases  include  chronic inflammation with recurrent fever, cutaneous rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgias, fatigue, and polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with chemotaxis (e.g., migration into skin or CNS). Serious aspects of  CAPS  include  chronic  systemic  inflammation,  pain,  impairment  of  day  to  day  functioning,  and chronic  elevation  of  acute  phase  reactants,  including  SAA  and  the  associated  increased  risk  of amyloidosis, a severe complication of chronic inflammation in MWS. About the Product Arcalyst (rilonacept) is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the ligand-binding domains of the human cytokine  extracellular  portions  of  the  human  interleukin-1  receptor  component  (IL-1RI)  and  IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) linked in-line to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The pharmaceutical form is powder and solvent for solution for injection (80mg/ml) for subcutaneous use. ARCALYST is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) with severe symptoms, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 years and older. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction

Arcalyst is presented as a lyophilized powder in glass vials and is formulated as a powder and solvent for solution for injection (80mg/ml) for subcutaneous use. The drug product (powder for solution for injection)  is  supplied  in  a  20  mL  glass  vial  with  a  stopper  and  flip-off  aluminium  seal,  within  a thermoformed tray and an outer carton. The drug product is reconstituted before use with solvent for parenteral use (Sterilised Water for Injections), supplied in a 5 ml polyethylene ampoule.

## Active Substance

The  active  substance  of  Arcalyst,  rilonacept,  is  a  dimeric  fusion  protein  consisting  of  the  ligandbinding domains of the extracellular portions of the human interleukin-1 receptor component (IL-1RI) and  IL-1  receptor  accessory  protein  (IL-1RAcP),  linked  in-line  to  the  Fc  portion  of  human  IgG1. Rilonacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

The drug product is presented as a lyophilized powder in glass vials and is formulated as a powder and solvent  for  solution  for  injection  (80mg/ml).  The  proposed  route  of  administration  is  subcutaneous use.  The  drug  product  (powder  for  solution  for  injection)  is  supplied  in  a  20  mL  glass  vial  with  a stopper and flip-off aluminium seal, within a thermoformed tray and an outer carton. The drug product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is reconstituted before use with solvent for parenteral use (Sterilised Water for Injections), supplied in a 5 ml polyethylene ampoule.

The adult dose consists of 2 ml of reconstituted product containing 160 mg of rilonacept. The pack includes 4 single use vials per carton, 220 mg rilonacept per vial. Cartons also include 4 ampoules of solvent, 8 sterile, disposable 3 mL syringes and 8 sterile, disposable needles.

## Drug Substance

Rilonacept is a fusion protein consisting of human cytokine receptor extracellular domains and the Fc portion of human IgG1. Rilonacept incorporates in a single molecule the extracellular domains of both receptor  components  required  for  IL-1  signalling:  the  IL-1  Type  I  receptor  (IL-1RI)  and  the  IL-1 receptor accessory protein (AcP). Since it contains both receptor components, rilonacept binds IL-1 β and IL-1 α with picomolar affinity, while the IL-1RI domain alone in the absence of AcP binds to IL1 β with  ~1  nM  affinity.  Rilonacept  was created  by  fusing  the sequences  encoding  the  extracellular domains  of  the  IL-1R-AcP,  IL-1R  Type  I,  and  hIgG  Fc  in-line  without  any  intervening  linker sequences. Rilonacept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a total molecular weight of ~251 kDa, of which 80% is protein (201 kDa) and 20% is carbohydrate (50 kDa).

Medicinal product no longer authorised The dimer is covalently  linked  by  disulphide  bonds  in  the  Fc  region.  It  is  hypothesized  that  IL-1 β binds between the two chains as shown by the schematic in the below figure. The dimeric rilonacept binds a single molecule of IL-1 β with high affinity, which suggests that binding of a second molecule of  IL-1  is  sterically  unfavourable.  The  schematic  drawing  of  the  protein  is  provided  below  (Figure 3.2.S.1.2 1-1).

## · Manufacture

Rilonacept drug substance is manufactured by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, (Tarrytown, NY, USA) at the Regeneron facilities located at 81 Columbia Turnpike, Rensselaer, New York 12144-3423, USA, in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Quality Control testing is also performed at the Regeneron, Rensselaer site.

Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are used as the cell substrate for production of drug substance. CHO cells have been engineered to constitutively express rilonacept. Rilonacept is secreted into the culture  medium  and  subsequently  isolated  and  purified  using  chromatographic  and  membrane filtration  techniques.  Adequate  information  on  the  starting  materials  and  reagents  were  provided, including specifications, methods and validations. Specifications have been set for the intermediates,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

starting materials and reagents. The impurities are discussed. Methods and where relevant validations have been provided.

- Specification

In  general the specification provided for the drug substance and the proposed limits are acceptable. The  active  substance  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identification,  strength,  potency, purity and impurities. The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance and are adequately described.

Batch  analysis  showed  consistent  production  of  rilonacept,  for  the  conformance  batches  and  three further full-scale manufacturing batches. The proposed specifications are considered appropriate for rilonacept Drug Substance and the applicant has committed to revise the specification limits after a total of 15 batches are available. Some minor issues related to the specification, which do not have an impact  on  the  positive  risk-benefit  of  the  product,  remain  to  be  addressed  by  the  Applicant.  A corresponding commitment has been provided by the Applicant.

Rilonacept  drug  substance  is  formulated  in  an  aqueous  buffered  solution  containing  histidine, polyethylene  glycol  3350,  glycine,  arginine  and  sucrose.  Rilonacept  drug  substance  is  compounded with  the  formulation  buffer  to  obtain  formulated  drug  substance  which  is  filtered  into  vials  and lyophilized. In-process controls of the production process are considered satisfactory.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Stability The drug substance is not stored before formulation. Stability studies, mainly photostability and forced degradation studies, are described for the drug substance prior to formulation. The drug substance is formulated  immediately  prior  to  storage.  Data  to  support  the  storage  of  formulated  drug  substance have been provided. Medicinal Product Rilonacept  drug  product  (DP)  is  supplied  as  a  lyophilized  powder  in  a  20  mL  glass  vial  for reconstitution with 2.3 mL of sterile Water for Injection (WFI). After reconstitution of rilonacept with 2.3 mL of sterile WFI, the solution contains 80 mg/mL rilonacept in an aqueous buffered solution at containing histidine, polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350), glycine, L-arginine, and sucrose. The total volume of reconstituted rilonacept is 2.7 mL, which allows withdrawal of 2.0 mL (160 mg) for dosage of  the  patient. The  overage allows for losses in the large vials and handling of the viscous product (80mg/mL protein). · Pharmaceutical Development Adequate data on the formulation development, including the lyophilisation cycle have been provided by the Applicant. The choice and function of the excipients in the formulation were described. The  container  closure  systems  (1L  polycarbonate  bottle  for  formulated  drug  substance  and  20mm glass vial with stoppers and seals for drug product) are demonstrated to be suitable, with respect to compatibility and microbiological safety. · Manufacture of the Product

Process validation of the rilonacept formulation process at Regeneron included three consecutive full scale  batches.  Variations  between  the  formulation  step  described  in  the  validation  report  and  the commercial process have been clarified, with the validation report for the formulation step reflecting the current manufacturing process.

## · Product Specification

Specifications for the drug product are satisfactory on the whole, although the specifications should be reviewed  and  tightened  where  appropriate.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  revising  the  DP specifications after a specified number of commercial batches.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Batch analysis for the Drug Product batches have been provided and appear satisfactory.

- Stability of the Product

Stability  of  the  formulated  drug  substance  was  adequately  demonstrated.  The  real-time  data  for  24 months (one supporting lot + three conformance lots) supports the requested shelf-life of 18 months at the storage condition of ≤ -20°C. A commitment to revise the current limits in light of new stability data using commercial batches has been obtained from the Applicant and is considered acceptable.

Stability studies for the lyophilised drug product, with long-term stability at -80°C (6 months) and 5°C (up to 36 months) and accelerated/stress studies at 25°C/60% RH or 45°C/75% RH (up to 6 months), demonstrated acceptable stability under real time conditions of 2 to 8°C for up to 24 months. In-use stability for reconstituted rilonacept drug product was established up to 4 hours at 25°C.

Photostability  studies  demonstrated  significant  photosensitivity  of  the  liquid  (FDS)  as  well  as  the lyophilised product. Storage of the vials with the final drug product in the outer pack was considered to  be  suitable  for  light  protection  for  the  lyophilized  product.  Light  protection  for  formulated  drug substance storage has also been improved and is considered adequately addressed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Adventitious Agents Except  for  the  CHO  cell  line,  no  materials  of  animal  origin  are  used.  No  other  animal-derived materials are used in the preparation of the active substance or the excipients. Foetal bovine serum (FBS) was used in the preparation of the Research Cell Bank and an initial cell bank established for long-term storage. Certificates of Suitability have been provided for the FBS used in these cell banks. There was no direct use of animal-derived materials in the current Master Cell Bank or Working Cell Banks. Recombinant insulin is a constituent of the production media used in the rilonacept cell culture. The insulin  is  produced  using  materials  of  animal  origin  (peptone,  pepticase  and  beef  extract).  The applicant  has  confirmed  that  the  two  recombinant  insulin  products  are  pharmaceutical  grade recombinant,  human  insulin  that  complies  to  the  EP  and  USP  monographs.  Details  of  the  risk assessment and appropriate Certificates of Suitability for insulin have been provided. All  adventitious  agents  testing  for  unprocessed  bulk,  cells  at  the  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age,  and  cell banks  is  performed  according  to  ICH  Q5A,  Q5B,  and  Q5D  guidance  documents.  Test  results demonstrated that all test materials were free of detectable adventitious microbial and viral agents. The cells  were  shown to  contain  non-infectious,  retrovirus-like  particles  that  are  a  typical  feature  of  the parental CHO-K1 cell line. The  key  viral  clearing  steps  from  the  final  manufacturing  process  were  included  in  detailed  viral clearance studies. The data provided by the applicant provides reassurance that the key viral clearing steps are capable of effectively removing both enveloped and non-enveloped virus species. In  summary,  the  Applicant  has  provided  sufficient  information  to  conclude  that  the  TSE  and  viral safety of rilonacept has been assured. The risk of TSE transmission through Arcalyst can be excluded and hence the risk of transmitting TSE by Arcalyst is considered very remote.

## Water for injection (WFI), syringe and needles for drug product

The  manufacturer  of  the  WFI  is  B.  Braun,  Melsungen  AG,  Germany.  5  mL  plastic  ampoules (MiniPlasco) of sterile water for injection are supplied with the rilonacept Lyophilised Powder.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The applicant has conducted an acceptable programme of non-clinical studies for rilonacept, with the exception of the lack of information on placental transfer. The applicant has committed to conduct an additional  embryo-fetal  developmental toxicity study to investigate this  and  other aspects  of  effects during gestation as a follow-up measure (FUM).

## GLP

The  pivotal  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  all  reported  to  be  GLP-compliant.  Some  minor deviations from GLP have been documented but none is considered to be such as to invalidate the affected studies.

- Safety pharmacology programme

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics The  pharmacology  of  rilonacept  was  characterised  by  investigation  of  target  binding  interactions, species  cross-reactivity  and in  vivo activity  supporting  an  anti-inflammatory  indication.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were limited to investigation of the immunogenicity of rilonacept in rodents and determination of the rate at which antibodies were formed. Rilonacept was shown to have similar binding to human and cynomolgus macaque IL-1 β ,  IL-1 α and the endogenous receptor antagonist of IL-1 receptors, IL-1ra, but a lower affinity for murine IL-1 β , IL1 α and  IL-1ra.  A  murine  analogue  (mIL-1  Trap)  was  generated  and  engineered  using  murine  IL-1 receptor genes and Fc domain in a manner mimicking the design of the human version. The binding affinities of mIL-1 Trap for murine IL-1 cytokines were of a similar order to those of rilonacept for the human and monkey ligands. No  specific  binding  was  observed  for  any  of  a  standard  panel  of  human  or  monkey  tissues  upon visualisation with secondary reagents and chromogenic substrate. · Secondary pharmacodynamics In a mouse model, rilonacept blocked the production of IL-6 in response to human IL-1 β . mIL-1 Trap was active in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, in which it blocked the development of arthritic joints and prevented cartilage erosion in the hind limb joints. Neointimal hyperplasia, induced by ligation of a carotid artery in mice, was also prevented by mIL-1 Trap. Rilonacept was immunogenic in two strains of mice and one of rats. There  was  no  evidence  that  rilonacept  activates  complement-dependent  or  antibody-dependent cytotoxicity Fc effector functions.

No adverse effects of rilonacept were observed in safety pharmacology evaluations following repeated dosing of cynomolgus monkeys via intravenous or subcutaneous routes of administration at doses up to 60 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg respectively.

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Not investigated in animal models.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  rilonacept  were  investigated  in  mice,  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys following  single  subcutaneous  and  intravenous  administration  at  doses  between  0.3  and  10 mg/kg. Although  anti-IL-1  Trap  antibodies  eventually  developed  in  mice,  rats  and  monkeys,  they  did  not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

occur early enough to influence the conclusions from single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. Traditional absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  (ADME)  studies  were  not  performed,  which  is acceptable for a glycoprotein.

In rats, Cmax and  AUC  increased  approximately  proportionally  with  dose  after  a  single  SC administration. In monkeys, the AUC increased slightly more than proportionally with dose between 0.3 and 1 mg/kg then proportionally with dose up to 10 mg/kg. The bioavailability of approximately 60 and 70% following SC administration of rilonacept in rats and monkeys, respectively, supported the clinical use of this route of administration. After IV administration, the decline of the rilonacept in serum is biphasic. The terminal half-lives were 61, 38 - 57, and 64 hours in mice, rats and monkeys, respectively, compared with approximately 1 week in humans. The total serum clearance of rilonacept is as follows: mice, 1.6 mL/h/kg rats, 1.4 - 1.8 mL/h/kg and monkeys, 1.9 mL/h/kg. The pharmacokinetic  indices  of  mice,  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  similar  between  males  and females within a given species.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A study was conducted to investigate the distribution of radio-labelled rilonacept in rats, but the results were not  considered  informative  because the  radio-labelled  rilonacept  was  cleared  12.4  times  more rapidly than the unlabelled form. The study indicated that 125 I-labelled rilonacept distributes rapidly to highly perfused organs, such as liver, kidney, lung and spleen. No further distribution studies were performed. Clearance through the kidney was not expected or observed. Instead, increased levels of iodinated rilonacept were observed in the liver, which is a known target organ for protein elimination via proteolytic processing. Rilonacept  is  a glycoprotein  and  the  level  of sialylation  affects  the  pharmacokinetic  indices determined after SC administration to rats. The fractional content of sialic acid for a given preparation is  called  the  Z  number.  A  series  of  independent  experiments  revealed  increased  clearance  in manufactured  batches  or  purified  fractions  with  low  sialic  acid  content.  The  results  also  indicated increased clearance and lower Cmax and AUC in manufactured batches or purified fractions with low Z number,  although  there  is  substantial  variability  in  the  pharmacokinetic  values  observed  for  either duplicate PK analysis of a single batch, or between different batches with similar Z numbers. Based on a  linear  regression  analysis  of  the  results  obtained  for  Z  numbers  of  between  1.4  and  1.8,  the  95% confidence interval variability was 35% for AUCinf. Although the animal data suggest that there is an acceptable  range  of  pharmacokinetic  variability  in  rilonacept  batches  with  Z  numbers  in  the  upper range, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to predict pharmacokinetic behaviour quantitatively in humans. It is not established whether pharmacokinetics of rilonacept in rats is a valid predictor of the effect of sialylation in humans, and clearance of rilonacept is much slower in humans than in rodents. Rilonacept  was  not  found  in  the  amniotic  fluid  or  fetal  plasma  of  monkeys  but  the  samples  were collected  more  than  fifty  days  after  the  last  dose.  Antibodies  to  rilonacept  were  found  in  the  fetal serum  and  it  is  assumed  that  these  were  derived  from  the  maternal  circulation.  It  is  not  known  if rilonacept is excreted in the milk. Further investigations will be the subject of a FUM. Toxicology

The toxicity profile of IL-1 Trap was evaluated in subcutaneous (SC) repeat-dose studies in mice and monkeys,  intravenous  (IV)  repeat-dose  studies  in  monkeys,  and  developmental  and  reproductive toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  monkeys.  Because  of  the  potential  immunogenicity  issues  that  can develop when using a human recombinant protein in other species, a murine analogue of IL-1 Trap was used for the toxicology studies in mice.

The applicant stated that the material used for the pivotal toxicity studies was representative of that intended for marketing.

- Single-dose toxicity

Specific single-dose toxicology studies were not conducted and the CHMP accepted that they were not likely to contribute to the safety evaluation of rilonacept.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Repeat-dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The safety studies include repeated-dose toxicity with periods of recovery in cynomolgus monkeys, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys and mice; a number of non-pivotal studies was also conducted. The choice of the cynomolgus monkey was justified on the basis  of  a  tissue  cross-reactivity  study;  there  was  also  no  evidence  of  binding  to  either  monkey  or human tissues, indicating a low potential for off-target effects.

The most notable toxicological findings when rilonacept was administered SC in the 6-week and 3 month  toxicology  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  injection  site  reactions.  These  reactions, which are thought to be immune-mediated pathologic sequelae rather than a direct effect of the drug, largely  resolved  during  recovery  time  off  drug.  Clinically  relevant  drug  concentrations  were  not maintained over the course of these studies because of an anti-drug antibody response in over 90% of the monkeys that increased drug clearance. Therefore, higher dose and more frequent administration strategies were used in the 26-week studies to increase exposure.

The complex of IL-1 β and  rilonacept  was  also  detected  in  samples  from  the six-month SC monkey toxicology study using an optimised, but unvalidated assay in a non-GLP exploratory analysis. These data indicated that rilonacept bound endogenous monkey IL-1 β in the toxicology studies, as expected given the similar potency of binding to monkey and human cytokines.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Large but relatively infrequent IV doses were administered to achieve high Cmax concentrations with the recognition that drug levels would be low for much of the treatment period because of accelerated clearance.  In  a  second  study,  the  magnitude  of  SC  dose  and  frequency  of  administration  were increased to override the antibody response, resulting in sustained drug levels throughout the treatment period.  Increasing  the  dose  and  frequency  of  administration  carried the  recognised  risk  of  inducing toxicity from an immune response to the drug, as opposed to any direct effect of IL-1 blockade. In the 6-month IV study, doses up to 100 mg/kg once every two weeks, which was the highest dose tested, were administered without reaching the NOAEL, although one animal at 100 mg/kg was killed in extremis in week 26 following a urinary tract infection and a few animals had sporadic episodes of emesis. In  the  6-month  SC  study,  doses  between  15  and  60  mg/kg  were  administered  three  times  weekly. There  was  no  signal  of  an  increased  rate  of  infections  in  animals  treated  with  drug.  Drug administration  in  the  two  high  dose  groups  of  40  and  60  mg/kg  resulted  in  toxicity,  which  is considered to have resulted at least in part from an anti-drug immune response. The findings in the 15 and 25 mg/kg three times weekly groups did not preclude administration of drug up to these doses in humans. In the 25 mg/kg group of the 6-month SC toxicology study, mean peak plasma rilonacept levels 24 hours after the first and third doses within the first week were approximately 260 µg/mL and 620 µg/mL, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the last dose and in the presence of antibodies, the mean peak plasma level was approximately 200 µg/mL. Although there was a decrease in mean peak plasma level  between the third  and  the  last  doses  because  of  circulating  antibodies,  the  mean  peak plasma level of rilonacept in monkeys exceeds that of the human single-dose PK with a safety factor of around 4 - 8. Also, the dosage of 25 mg/kg three times per week administered SC (75 mg/kg/week), exceeds the currently planned weekly SC dose in humans for CAPS (160 mg/week or 3.2 mg/kg /week for a 50 kg human) with a margin of more than 20. There was no evidence of an effect on immune function or potential serum complement activation.

- Genotoxicity

No genotoxicity studies were conducted, and the CHMP considered this acceptable for a product of this  nature.    A  review  of  the  manufacturing  process  did  not  suggest  the  potential  presence  of  any impurities likely to be genotoxic.

- Carcinogenicity

The absence of carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable for recombinant therapeutic protein. The  applicant  also  noted  that  there  was  no  reason  to  suppose  that  rilonacept  is  likely  to  have proliferative or mitogenic properties. IL-1 Trap is not related to any growth hormone or other protein with potential proliferative activity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant has provided a discussion on IL-1 and tumourigenesis from peer reviewed publications: it  was  concluded  that  the  data  suggest  that  IL-1  is  involved  with  tumour  induction,  growth  and progression,  and  that  IL-1  blockade  via  naturally  occurring  or  engineered  molecules  can  suppress tumourigenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis in a variety of in vitro and in vivo settings.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Medicinal product no longer authorised A fertility study (Segment I) and pre- and post-natal development study (Segment III) were conducted in mice using mIL-1 Trap. mIL-1 Trap was administered SC at doses of 20 to 200 mg/kg. The low dose was chosen as it gives definitive activity in the CIA mouse model and the high dose was chosen as  ten  times  a  definitive  pharmacologically  active  dose  (the  highest  dose  is  approximately  6-fold higher than the 160 mg maintenance dose based on body surface area). There were no effects on the fertility  of  males  or  females  or  on  pre-  and  post-natal  development  at  does  up  to  200 mg/kg.  An embryo-fetal  development  study  (Segment  II)  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  was  performed using  rilonacept  at  doses  up  to  30 mg/kg  administered  twice  weekly.  There  were  decreases  in β -estradiol levels; there are no data to confirm whether this also occurs in humans. The applicant has committed to investigate this further in monkeys in an additional embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study as the FUM noted above. There were no effects on fetal weight, anatomic measurements or soft tissue  observations.  There  was  no  clear  increase  in  the  incidence  of  skeletal  malformations  or numerical bone counts. It is not known whether rilonacept crosses the placenta or is excreted in the milk; the latter point was covered in Section 4.6 of the SPC and the former will be investigated as part of the above-mentioned FUM. It  is  accepted  that  the  outcome  of  the  studies  conducted  using  mIL-1  Trap  is  limited  to  the identification  of  potential  hazards  through  blocking  IL1  and  is  not  a  definitive  estimate  of  risk  for rilonacept.  Studies  in  knockout  mice  where  IL-1 β or  IL-1 α were  deleted  indicated  no  effect  on reproduction (Dinarello, 2003). These strains reproduced normally. Also, mice deficient in the IL-1RI gene exhibited no overt phenotype and reproduced normally (Glaccum, 1997; Labow, 1997). These results suggest that blockade of IL-1 will not have an impact upon reproduction; however, experiments in animals might not be predictive of outcomes in humans. · Local tolerance Local  tolerance  was  assessed  by  evaluation  of  the  injection  site  responses  during  the  repeat-dose toxicity  studies.  Inflammatory  changes  were  seen  at  the  injection  sites  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity studies; during the recovery period, these changes were almost completely reversed. Additional studies of local tolerance were not considered necessary by the CHMP. · Other toxicity studies Immunotoxicity

Since blockade of IL-1 might potentially affect immune function, an assessment of immune function and  potential  serum  complement  activation  was  included  as  a  component  of  the  6-month  SC toxicology  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys:  the  NK  activity  of  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMC) was examined as a measure for assessing drug-induced immunotoxicity. Rilonacept did not appear to affect adversely or enhance NK activity.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The absence of a formal environmental risk assessment is acceptable as rilonacept is a protein and is therefore exempt from the requirement for an Environmental Risk Assessment. Other components of the drug product are widely used approved excipients in pharmaceutical products and are unlikely to result in any significant risk to the environment.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

In  addition  to  autoinflammatory  diseases  such  as  CAPS,  the  clinical  development  programme  for rilonacept has included investigations in a number of other inflammatory diseases, which are not the subject of this application.

Protocol Assistance was not requested to CHMP.

Arcalyst  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Cryopyrin-Associated  Periodic  Syndromes  (CAPS), including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS).

The  Company  applies  for  a  broad  indication  covering  all  clinical  situations.  So  far  there  is  no approved treatment for the described indication.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In the pivotal trial Arcalyst has been administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection at a dose of 160 mg in adults or 2.2 mg/kg in paediatric subjects. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  rilonacept  half-life  (t1/2),  apparent  total  body  clearance  (CLTB),  and  apparent  volume  of distribution at steady state (Vss) values all appeared to be independent of dose within the 100 mg to 2000 mg rilonacept dose range investigated. The t1/2 was long, at approximately 200 hours (range of means 187.5 hours to 253.7 hours), and both CLTB and Vss, were low, with CLTB at approximately 30 mL/hr (range of means 24.09 mL/hr to 33.28 mL/hr) and Vss, at approximately 6500 mL (range of means 5753.83 mL to 7468.17 mL), indicating that rilonacept is essentially confined to plasma. PK data  on  serum  levels  in  CAPS  subjects  on  long-term  treatment  was  provided  and  showed  that following steady state at 5-6 weeks, no further accumulation of rilonacept occurred up to week 88. One paediatric study and one study in RA patients were conducted using body weight adjusted dosing, in all other studies flat doses were applied. There has been no dose-finding study in CAPS patients, the rationale for the chosen dosing regimen for the intended indication (160 mg SC flat for adults and 2.2 mg/kg for children 5-17y) was based on results from ILIT-RA-0004 and from biopharmaceutics data showing that the binding of rilonacept to IL-1ß was not saturated at the 100mg weekly dose. Pharmacokinetics after repeated subcutaneous doses was assessed in four multiple dose studies (two in RA patients, one in paediatric patients (ongoing) and in 22 CAPS patients during the Phase III study pertinent to the claimed indication. In all multiple dose studies only sparse samples were collected for determination of Ctrough values. Mean steady state trough blood levels of total rilonacept following repeated administration of 160 mg weekly in CAPS patients during the relevant periods of drug dosing were calculated to be 23 µg/ml. Variability of measured Ctrough levels were high ranging from 0.68 to 43.4 µg/ml. Predicted steady-state Cmax, Ctrough, and Cmax/Ctrough for the CAPS population by population PK model estimation were 31.5 mg/L, 24.8 mg/L, and 1.27 mg/L correspondingly. Pharmacodynamics · Mechanism of action

Rilonacept is an in vivo inhibitor of IL-1, since binding of IL-1 by Rilonacept blocks the bioactivity of the  bound  cytokine.  Because  of  its  structure,  the  Fc  portion  of  rilonacept  provides  the  basis  for dimerization and a long circulating half-life. Rilonacept has a pharmacokinetic half-life of approximately seven days.

Free  cytokine  levels  have  not  been  measured  before  or  after  rilonacept  administration.  In  contrast, cytokine complexes with rilonacept, i.e. Il-1ß bound to rilonacept (IL-1ß complex levels) and total IL1ra levels (free and captured) were measured in four PD studies as well as in the pivotal CAPS study.

It  was  considered  plausible  that,  due  to  the  stochiometry  of  the  complexes,  total  IL-1ra  instead  of bound  IL-1ra  was  measured.  Unfortunately,  no  baseline  values  of  free  cytokines  before  treatment (neither IL-1ß nor IL-1ra) were measured in the studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Complexes with IL-1ra generally comprised less than 15% of the total during active dosing, while IL1 β complexes  comprised  considerably  less  than  1%  of  the  total.  Thus,  the  vast  majority  of  the rilonacept in serum is present as free rilonacept.

The  IL-1ß  complex  levels  were  in  the  range  of  1-4  pM  except  in  CAPS  patients  where  markedly higher levels of 19 pM (up to 66 pM) were measured. This was supposed to reflect the proposed IL-1 β overproduction resulting from the cryopyrin mutations underlying CAPS.

Total IL-1ra levels determined in different studies after rilonacept were in the range of 6.6 - 22.5 nM, which exceeds the IL-1 β complex levels in RA subjects by 1000-fold or more.

There was no evidence for a relationship  between  dose  (rilonacept  concentrations  at the  respective timepoints)  and  either  IL-1ß  complex  levels  or  total  IL-1ra  levels.  This  is  not  surprising  since  the rilonacept concentrations are at any time very high compared to the affinity to the cytokines so that it has to be assumed that the cytokines are almost completely bound at any time and dose. Therefore, the bound cytokine levels appear to reflect the total amount of cytokine present in serum at the respective time point and do not serve as a biomarker for the response.

Two  potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  were  identified:  Firstly,  it  is  known  from  experience with another drug that blocks IL-1 (anakinra) that concomitant administration with a TNF-blocking agent  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  and  an  increased  risk  of neutropenia. Thus, the concomitant administration of rilonacept with TNF-blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and should be avoided.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Primary and Secondary pharmacology Rilonacept  tended  to  normalize  the  levels  of  a  variety  of  different  acute  phase  markers  and hematological  measures  in  essentially  all  of  the  RA  studies.  In  one  study,  there  were  statistically significant decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cells, and there were trends to decrease platelets and rheumatoid factor (RF). Statistically significant decreases in CRP were evident in the 25 mg and 100 mg dose groups; administration of 50 mg also resulted in decreases that  were  numerically,  but  not  statistically,  significant.  There  was  no  conclusive  evidence  that administration of 100 mg rilonacept weekly gave a maximal response across all measured biomarkers. In  part  A  of  the  pivotal  CAPS  study  CRP  decreased  from  high  baseline  values  of  20.1  mg/l  to normalized mean values of 1.3 mg/l. Similarly, SAA levels decreased from high baseline values of 49.5 mg/l to normalized mean values of 2.5 mg/l. Immunogenicity (development of anti-rilonacept antibodies) appeared to be very high in the multiple dose studies performed. In two out of 17 pediatric patients treated antibodies were found accompanied by a considerable and (at least in one patient) persistent decrease in rilonacept serum concentrations. In the pivotal CAPS study, 43% of subjects (20 of 46) dosed with rilonacept for up to 24 weeks in Parts A and B of the study demonstrated a rilonacept-specific response in the anti-rilonacept antibody assay,  respectively.  The  treatment  profile  (sequence  of  placebo  and  drug)  of  the  patients  did  not determine  either  frequency  or  time  point  of  the  first  appearance  of  antibodies.  Of  the  56  samples tested, ten samples from seven subjects were positive for neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, five of the seven subjects who were positive for neutralizing antibodies tested negative for neutralization at a later timepoint. However, for safety considerations all (binding) antibodies are relevant, whereas the discrimination  between  binding  and  neutralising  antibodies  might  be  of  importance  in  terms  of efficacy  reduction.  Further  investigations  of  immunogenicity  in  patients  who  have  a  reduction  in efficacy are planned.

Secondly, the concomitant administration of rilonacept with other drugs that block IL-1 (anakinra) has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacologic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL-1ra, concomitant administration of rilonacept and other drugs that block IL-1 should be avoided.

Pharmacology studies were conducted to establish the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the IL-1 Trap, including  measuring  the  affinity  of  IL-1  Trap  toward  human,  monkey,  and  murine  IL-1  cytokines, evaluating  the  activity  of  the  human  and  murine  versions  of  the  IL-1  Trap  in  murine  models  of inflammation, and assessing the immunogenicity of the human IL-1 Trap and murine IL-1 Trap (mIL-

1 Trap) in animals. Binding studies demonstrated that IL-1 Trap potently binds IL-1 β and IL-1 α from both humans and monkeys. Rilonacept also binds IL-1ra but with a lower affinity than IL-1 β or IL-1 α .

Surface plasmon resonance technology (BiaCore) binding experiments were performed to measure the on and off rate constants, allowing calculation of the dissociation constants of IL-1 Trap to IL-1 β , IL1 α , and IL-1ra from humans, monkeys, and mice

## Clinical efficacy

Rilonacept  was  subject  to  clinical  investigations  in  a  number  of  rheumatic  related  indications  and healthy subjects. Only the trials pertinent to this application for CAPS are discussed here.

The clinical development involved one pivotal phase III study consisting of part A and B and one open label exploratory dose-finding pilot study.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Dose response studies There was no formal dose response study for the sought CAPS indication (a dose-response study was conducted in Rheumatoid arthritis). Dose escalation was performed in trial ILIT-AI  -0406, a shortterm  open  label  efficacy  study  of  rilonacept  as  treatment  for  autoinflammatory  diseases.  Ten  (10) subjects were enrolled (5 subjects with FCAS, 1 subject with FMF, and 4 subjects with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD)). All  subjects  received  a  300  mg  loading  dose,  and  all  but  one  FCAS  subject  (who  escalated  to  160 mg/week)  and  one  AOSD  subject  (who  received  300  mg/week)  escalated  to  320  mg/week  of rilonacept. The escalation in dose was based on patient symptoms and clinical decision. Treatment with a loading dose of 300 mg of rilonacept was associated with a significant reduction in mean subject key symptom score from Baseline to Day 10 for the FCAS subjects (Baseline mean, 1.1; Day 10 mean, 0.2, [0 to 4 scale]; mean percent change, -74% [p = 0.049]). Active disease symptoms eventually returned during the observation period after the initial rilonacept loading  regimen,  and  all  subjects  elected  to  reinstitute  dosing  of  rilonacept  in  the  1-year  extension phase. Continued dosing at 100, 160, or 320 mg per week of rilonacept resulted in marked decreases in acute phase reactants, CRP, SAA, and ESR over time (all subjects).

In  this  open-label  study,  overall,  rilonacept  was  well  tolerated.  Infections  were  the  most  commonly reported adverse events, but most were mild and resolved. One subject with AOSD was reported with a  localized  atypical  mycobacterial  infection  (severe)  for  which  he  was  hospitalized  (an  SAE).  The patient  was  on  chronic  glucocorticoid  treatment.  The  infection  occurred  after  an  intra-articular glucocorticoid injection into the olecranon bursa and subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of  mycobacteria.  The  patient  recovered  after  the  administration  of  the  appropriate  antimicrobial therapy and debridement. This event was reported as possibly related to rilonacept.

Compatible with a decrease in an overall state of systemic inflammation, mean WBCs, which were high  at  study  start  declined  with  treatment  (all  subjects)  and  mean  polymorphonuclear  leukocytes (neutrophils)  and  platelets,  which  were  high  at  study  start,  declined  to  within  normal  range  with treatment. There were increases in mean hemoglobin and hematocrit values thought to be compatible with amelioration of bone marrow suppression of chronic inflammatory disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results indicated that the dose of 160mg weekly after a loading dose of 300mg showed prolonged efficacy.

## Development of assessment tool for CAPS

## ILIT-AI-0507

The  pivotal  phase  3  study  in  CAPS  was  preceded  by  study  ILIT-AI-0507,  which  was  designed  to develop a reliable measure of disease activity in CAPS because no measurement instrument had yet been established for the assessment of CAPS symptoms, some of which could only be assessed by patient report (e.g., feeling of fever/chills, joint pain, eye redness/pain, fatigue).

In order to develop a measurable primary efficacy endpoint that assessed clinical disease-related signs and symptoms, the applicant conducted an observational (non-treatment) study (IL1T-AI-0507) which was initiated to define the natural history of CAPS, identify clinical endpoints relevant to treatment of CAPS,  and  design  a  Daily  Health  Assessment  Form  (DHAF)  for  assessment  of  patient-reported outcomes.

<!-- image -->

An example of the final DHAF used is given below

Medicinal product no longer authorised DHAFs  were  used  to  capture  daily  patient-reported  information  regarding  specific  disease-related symptoms, global assessments (such as overall levels of disease activity), and functional limitations. Phase 1 DHAFs asked subjects to report the severity of 11 CAPS related symptoms by using a VAS scale or categorical scale on alternating days. Data analyses from the archetype forms were used to revise the DHAF into a more streamlined form that queried five key symptoms of CAPS (rash, fever, joint  pain,  eye  redness/pain,  and  fatigue)  by  using  a  10-point  VAS  scale  with  half-unit  increments. This form was validated for internal consistency (Cronbach alpha reliability measure) and stability of scores over time (test-retest reliability) was demonstrated. Results Subjects (n = 48) completed enrolment forms and DHAFs including 21-point VAS (anchored at 0 and 10 with half-unit increments) on a daily basis. There were 38 subjects with FCAS and 4 subjects with MWS enrolled in Phase 1. Median age was 50.8 years of age (range 13 to 82 years); 70% of subjects were female and 100% were white. Aside from CAPS, medical histories were compatible with this general population. The most frequent concomitant medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Five subjects received the biological agent anakinra. Key symptom scores (KSSs) showed large day-to-day variability highlighting the intermittent nature of these conditions and indicating that multi-week assessment periods would be necessary to create a meaningful endpoint for a therapeutic clinical trial. Three-week average KSS values during Phase 1 and Phase 2) showed means of 1.63 and 2.8, respectively, on a 10-point VAS. The average KSS for the most severe symptom (KSSmax) was 6.31 for Phase 1 and 7.59 for Phase 2, but was reported as high as 10 in some subjects. In the optimized DHAF 3a form (Phase 2), KSS correlated strongly with subject daily global assessment (r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.0001) and limitation of daily activities (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.0001). C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) values were variable and frequently elevated, particularly in subjects with MWS.

- Main studies

Medicinal product no longer authorised Conclusions FCAS  and  MWS  are  diseases  with  significant  day-to-day  variability.  This  variability  pertains  to symptoms as well as laboratory markers of FCAS and MWS and, therefore, disease activity is most effectively  measured  over  multi-week  periods.  The  DHAF  form  is  an  appropriate  measurement instrument for the clinical evaluation of subjects with CAPS.

## Study IL1T-AI-0505

This  was  the  pivotal  study  in  CAPS,  a  multi-centre,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  the safety,  tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  rilonacept  (weekly  subcutaneous  (SC)  doses  of  160  mg  of rilonacept in subjects with CIAS1 -Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in two parts, A and B, of parallel group and randomized withdrawal design).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

After written informed consent was obtained, subjects who met the protocol eligibility criteria were enrolled at one of 27 study sites in the United States. The study consisted of

- a 3-week screening period which provided baseline data for the Part A analysis;
- a 6-week randomised double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (Part A);
- a 9-week single-blind active treatment period which provided baseline data for the Part B analysis;
- a 9-week double-blind randomised withdrawal phase (Part B);
- a 24-week open-label extension phase (OLE);
- a 64-week long-term open-label extension (LTOLE);

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the  mean  key symptom score (KSS). This was derived from the assessment of five key symptoms (rash, feeling of fever/chills,  joint  pain,  fatigue  and  eye  redness/pain)  recorded  daily  by  patients  on  the  daily  health assessment form (DHAF). Each symptom was assessed on a 21-point scale with 0.5-point intervals from 0=none to 10=very severe. For each day the mean of the 5 scores was calculated and the daily means were averaged over the number of days with recorded data in the 21-day observation period to provide a mean key symptom score for that period.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Amendments 4 and 6 allowed eligible adult and paediatric subjects to enrol directly into the open-label phases of the trial. Eligible adult patients with either FCAS or MWS were randomised into the initial 6-week treatment period  to  receive  weekly  subcutaneous  (sc)  injections  of  either  160mg  rilonacept  or  placebo  in approximately equal numbers. Patients were stratified according to disease activity recorded at the Part A baseline in the daily health assessment form (DHAF). Stratum 1 included patients with a score of three or more in at least one key diary symptom during the 21-day baseline period; Stratum 2 included all  patients  with  all  scores  less  than  3.  At  the  end  of  the  6-week  randomised  treatment  period,  all patients received rilonacept weekly for 9 weeks but remained blinded to treatment. Patients were then randomised again to receive either rilonacept or placebo weekly, again in a 1:1 ratio, for a further 9 weeks. Treatments There were no formal dose finding studies in CAPS and the dose chosen was based on a small phase II study and PK data in RA. Patients received subcutaneous (sc) injections of either 160mg rilonacept or placebo. Objectives The primary objective was to assess the effect of rilonacept on the clinical signs and symptoms of CAPS when used for chronic therapy. The secondary objectives were as follows:  To determine the safety and tolerability of rilonacept in subjects with CAPS  To assess the effect of rilonacept on laboratory measures of inflammation such as acute phase reactants Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was calculated for each randomised treatment period in Parts A and B. Baseline  values  for  this  variable  were  calculated  for  the  corresponding  21-day  period  immediately before randomisation for entry into each part of the study.

The  specification  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  as  the  change  from  baseline  in  the  mean  key symptom  score  over  a  period  of  21-days  was  based  on  the  investigation  of  data  recorded  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observational study (IL1T-AI-0507). The use of the 21-day period was shown to reduce variability and to improve the sensitivity of the measure

A number of secondary  and  tertiary  efficacy  variables  were  investigated.  An  analysis  of  the  mean change from baseline in the number of disease-flare days was conducted where a disease-flare day was defined as a day where the mean score exceeded 3 points. In addition the mean change in the number of  single-symptom disease-flare days was analysed. Patients were also categorised according to the percentage  improvement  in  the  mean  key  symptom  score. The  analysis  of  categories  of  responders was conducted using Fisher's exact test.

No adjustment of the significance level was required as multiplicity of the primary efficacy analyses for each randomised period was controlled by testing a conditional sequence of hypotheses. All tests were two-sided at a significance level of 5%.

No subgroup analyses were planned due to the overall small sample size. No interim analyses were conducted.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Sample size 47 cases with CAPS (3 MWS and 44 with FCAS) were included. In view of the rarity of CAPS this sample size is acceptable. Only  three  patients  included  in  the  study,  one  treated  with  rilonacept  and  two  with  placebo,  were diagnosed as having MWS with 44 diagnosed with FCAS. Randomisation Fifty adult subjects were to be randomized on Day 0 (Visit 2) in a 1:1 ratio to receive a loading dose of 320 mg of rilonacept or placebo, with subsequent weekly SC injections of 160 mg of rilonacept or placebo for a total of 6 doses. Following completion of the double-blind period, subjects were eligible to receive weekly single-blind SC injections of rilonacept for 9 weeks, and were then re-randomized at Week 15 (Visit 7) in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly SC injections of 160 mg of rilonacept or placebo for a  9-week  randomized  withdrawal  period.  Upon completion of this  phase  of  the  trial,  subjects  were eligible to receive weekly SC injections of 160 mg of rilonacept in the 24 week open-label extension phase, and then a 64-week long-term open-label extension; a second informed consent process was required prior to participation in the open-label extension phase of the study. A total of 60 subjects were planned to be screened at approximately 25 study centres in order to obtain 50 evaluable subjects for  participation  in  Parts  A  &amp;  B  of  the  study.  Approximately  35  additional  subjects,  including paediatric subjects aged 7 to 17, are to be screened for entry directly into the open-label extension of the study as a result of protocol Amendments 4 and 6.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Blinding (masking) The procedures for blinding were satisfactory. Statistical methods Two separate statistical analysis plans were planned for Part A and Part B of the study. In the protocol two populations were defined for the efficacy analysis of Part A. The full analysis set (FAS-A) would have included all randomised patients from Part A who were known to be genotype-positive for CAPS and who received at least one dose of study  medication. The per-protocol set (PPS-A) would have included all patients in FAS-A except those with significant protocol violations. Two corresponding populations (FAS-B and PPS-B) were defined for Part B. At the data review meetings held before the blind  was  broken  for  any  portion  of  the  study  it  was  determined  that  as  protocol  violations  were minimal no PPS would be specified. Therefore, as the FAS and PPS populations were almost identical, only one analysis set, FAS, was used for each part of the study. There were no concerns over this decision. The hierarchical testing scheme described is considered sufficient to control the Type I error for the primary analysis without further  adjustments  for  multiplicity.  The  ANCOVA  model  including  baseline  as  a  covariate  is appropriate for the analysis of the primary efficacy variable according to the guideline (CPMP/EWP/2863/99: Points to consider on adjustment for baseline covariates).

It  was accepted that the small sample size prevented any meaningful subgroup analyses for patients with two different diagnoses (MWS and FCAS).

## Conduct of the study

The conduct of the study was deemed satisfactory.

## Baseline data

All patients enrolled in Part A, the initial double-blind (DB) portion of the pivotal IL1T-AI-0505 study in CAPS, were white and predominantly female (66%). The racial and ethnic characteristics of study patients  lacked  diversity,  a  reflection  of  the  genetic  background  of  those  afflicted  with  these  rare genetic  syndromes,  where  exon  3  L353P  [L355P  according  to  NM\\_004895.3  cDNA  reference sequence] is the most common CIAS1 mutation in North America and is associated with a founder family that accounts for up to 90% of cases of FCAS worldwide (Hoffman, 2004). Age ranged from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

22  to  78  years.  Weight  ranged  from  50-119  kg.  Patients  randomized  to  placebo  had  similar demographic characteristics to those randomized to rilonacept.

Outcomes and estimation

## Efficacy results

There was a highly statistically significant difference between the change from baseline for the group randomised to rilonacept compared to that of the group randomised to placebo (p&lt;0.0001). This was confirmed in the sensitivity analyses where all models tested resulted in p&lt;0.0001. It was concluded that rilonacept was superior to placebo in reducing the mean key symptom score from baseline.

A summary of the primary efficacy analysis for Part A is provided in the table below.

Medicinal product no longer authorised At 9 weeks after cessation of therapy those on placebo have a lower score than at baseline. This raised the possibility of accumulation of rilonacept. However it was due to the fact that Part B of the study was  performed  in  the  summer  months  and  as  the  majority  of  patient  in  the  study  had  FCAS  their frequency of flares were less during the randomised withdrawal period of the study. A separate report was provided for the open label extension period from 24-48 weeks. This period of the trial included additional patients including 4 paediatric subjects. Efficacy was demonstrated in both symptom control and markers of inflammation over this prolonged extension phase.

Medicinal product no longer authorised · Clinical studies in special populations Paediatric population The fact that a limited number of paediatric patients were included in the clinical studies combined with the lack of data on the effect of long term IL-1ß suppression was of concern. The Applicant will need to propose a plan to collect data from the registry on safety and efficacy in children; particularly risk of infection and possible impairment of immune reactions such as response to vaccinations and growth. Additionally, further PK steady state exposure data (AUC, Cmax, cmin during steady state) for paediatric subjects is required. Clinical safety The pivotal clinical safety data supporting this application is derived from 1 controlled, double blind, international,  Phase  III  study  in  adolescent  and  adult  patients  with  Cryopyrin-Associated  Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS).

There were a total of 64 patients with CAPS included in the MAA Dataset.

During  the  course  of  the  procedure  further  safety  data  was  provided  by  the  applicant  from  an additional 45 subjects who entered directly into the OLE phase. For this Update, the cut-off date for data from clinical trials (the Update Dataset) is the date of last patient visit at the completion of the open label extension (OLE) of study IL1T-AI-0505 (approximately 5-May-2008). Four of these were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

children aged 12-17 years. As the SAE of bacterial meningitis in the OLE was presented in the initial application there were no further new safety signals from this additional data and infections were the commonest adverse event.

- Adverse events

Seventeen (74%) subjects treated with rilonacept and 13 (54%) subjects treated with placebo reported at least one TEAE during Part A of this study. The most commonly reported TEAE was injection site erythema,  reported  by  8  subjects  (rilonacept:  7;  placebo:  1).  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was reported  by  7  subjects  (rilonacept:  6;  placebo:  1).  Two  TEAEs  were  reported  by  4  subjects  each (diarrhoea, nausea).

Table 27 displays a summary of TEAEs reported by at least 2 subjects during Part A.

No  severe  adverse  events  were  reported  during  Part  A;  all  reported  TEAEs  were  assessed  by Investigators as mild or moderate in severity. One severe adverse event was reported during the Part B single-blind portion of the study; one subject with a history of migraines since 2004 reported a single incidence of migraine assessed as 'severe' by the Investigator. One severe adverse event was reported during the Part B randomized-withdrawal portion of the study; one subject allocated to the rilonacept group  reported  a  single  incidence  of  bronchitis  assessed  as  'severe'  by  the  Investigator.  All  other reported TEAEs were assessed by Investigators as mild to moderate.

There was one SAE reported during the course of the study; sciatica was reported by a 62-year-old white  female  treated  with  rilonacept,  with  a  prior  history  of  osteoarthritis  and  sciatica,  judged  not related  to  study  medication  by  the  Investigator.  There  was  one  withdrawal  from  the  study  due  to adverse events; one subject reported worsening of joint pain on left fifth finger and worsening of joint pain on left index finger considered by the Investigator to be moderate, not serious, and not related to study medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No SAEs were reported for the pivotal study, IL1T-AI-0505 Part A. No serious infections were reported.  Two  patients  treated  with  rilonacept  reported  a  total  of  4  SAEs  ( Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, and Pulmonary  embolism in  one  patient , and Sciatica in  another);  all  of  these events were assessed as not related with an outcome of 'resolved.'

There were no deaths during the Part A and B of the study nor in the 24 week OLE.

There were two deaths reported after the database in the long-term open label extension; one was a 71 year  old  woman  who  died  of  pneumococcal  meningitis  and  the  other  was  a  37  year  old  man  with untreated hypertension and hyperlipidaemia who died of a myocardial infarction with occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.

## Immunological events

| no   |
|------|

Medicinal product no longer authorised During  the  24  weeks  of  Parts  A  and  B,  subjects  were  dosed  weekly  and  serum  samples  for  antirilonacept antibody assays were collected at six time points (predose; Week 6, the last visit in the Part A double blind phase; Weeks 12 and 15 during the Part B single-blind rilonacept treatment phase; Weeks 21 and 24 during the Part B double blind randomized withdrawal phase). The evaluation for rilonacept-binding antibodies used a sensitive assay with a limit of detection of 300 ng/mL in which drug:antibody complexes are first dissociated with acid treatment before the sample is neutralized and evaluated for binding on a microplate coated with the rilonacept extracellular domain construct The Applicant stated that there was no evidence of any adverse effect of antibodies on the blood levels of rilonacept, or on clinical and laboratory measures of efficacy or safety. There was no indication that antibody-positive  subjects  had  lower  rilonacept  levels  than  subjects  that  were  antibody-negative. Examination  of  CRP  levels  for  individual  subjects  also  did  not  indicate  a  rebound  in  CRP  after development of an antibody positive response. Individual subject key symptom scores did not reveal an  exacerbation  of  CAPS  symptoms  that  correlated  with  development  of  binding  or  neutralizing antibodies

## · Laboratory findings

There  were  no  significant  haematology  laboratory  events  reported  during  Part  A.  Two  cases  of abnormal  clinical  chemistry  laboratory  events  reported  during  Part  A.  One  subject  randomized  to placebo, was reported with an AE of hypercholesterolemia. The second subject who was randomized to rilonacept treatment in Part A, was reported with an AE of hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 128 meq/L (reference range 133-145 meq/L) 6 weeks into the 9-week single-blind rilonacept treatment phase, with subsequent assessments within the reference range.

There  were  two  clinical  chemistry  events  assessed  by  Investigators  during  the  Part  B  single-blind phase as clinically significant. One subject, randomized to placebo in Part A, had an AE of increased blood uric acid levels from a sample drawn pre-dose on the day of the first Part B single-blind dose of rilonacept. The second subject (who was reported with an AE of hypercholesterolemia during Part A

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

when randomized to treatment with placebo), was also reported with an AE of hypercholesterolemia during the Part B single-blind rilonacept treatment phase, which was ongoing at the Week 24 visit.

## · Safety in special populations

A limited number of paediatric patients were included in the clinical studies and this fact, combined with the lack of data on the effect of long term IL-1ß suppression, is a concern. The Applicant was requested  to  propose  a  plan  to  collect  data  from  the  registry  on  safety  and  efficacy  in  children; particularly  risk  of  infection  and  possible  impairment  of  immune  reactions  such  as  response  to vaccinations and growth.

Also,  further  PK  steady  state  exposure  data  (AUC,  Cmax,  C min during  steady  state)  especially  for paediatric subjects were required.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

<!-- image -->

Medicinal product no longer authorised The known increase in infections following the addition to anti-TNF therapy to anti-IL1 therapy has prompted the warning in the SPC and PL. No  specific  drug  interaction  studies  were  carried  out.  However  because  the  formation  of  CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during chronic inflammation, it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the  dose  is  individually  adjusted  (e.g.  warfarin).  Upon  initiation  of  ARCALYST,  in  patients  being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or plasma levels should  be  performed  and  the  individual  dose  of  the  medicinal  product  may  need  to  be  adjusted  as needed. This warning has been added to the SPC. · Discontinuation due to adverse events There were no withdrawals due to TEAEs in IL1T-AI-0505 Part A. In ongoing studies of rilonacept, two additional withdrawals due to adverse events were reported through 31-March-2008. In the open label extension of IL1T-AI- 0505, one patient withdrew due to Chronic sinusitis assessed as mild in severity and not related to study medication. The event was noted as ongoing at the time the patient discontinued study participation. In IL1T-GA-0619 (study in gout patients) one patient withdrew due to Arthralgia assessed as moderate in  severity  and  related  to  study  medication.  The  event  resolved within 16 days of onset.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  side  effect  profile  of  rilonacept  was  mainly  restricted  to  injection  site  reactions  and  upper respiratory  tract  infection.  No  opportunistic  infection  or  development  of  autoimmunity  was  seen  in CAPS patients. The death from pneumococcal meningitis in the long-term open label extension period may have been related to treatment, but evidence of chronic sinusitis was present which may have been a pre-disposing factor. Overall the safety profile is limited (see below). From the Integrated analysis of safety performed Table 2.7.4-12 provides a summary of patients with treatment-related TEAEs occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of rilonacept patients with greater frequency than in placebo patients.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system has deficiencies that should be addressed as part of the follow up measures, as discussed below.

The Applicant did not provide a statement signed by Regeneron and the qualified person responsible for  pharmacovigilance  (QPPV),  indicating  that  the  Applicant  has  the  services  of  a  QPPV  and  the means for the  notification  of  any  adverse  reaction  occurring  either  in  the  Community  or  in  a  third country.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant clarified that they have the services of a QPPV, who resides in the Community (The Netherlands).

As the QPPV is not medically qualified, the Applicant should describe how they are able to obtain medical  input  from  a  trained  physician.  The  Applicant  provides  a  description  of  the  organisation, giving location of the pharmacovigilance database, and the names and addresses of the organisations and  locations  where  global  and  European  Economic  Area  (EEA)  pharmacovigilance  activities  are undertaken. Information flow of safety reports and main processes are also provided.

The Applicant provided reassurance regarding the overall pharmacovigilance organisation. However, organisational charts were not provided. The Applicant was asked to provide a high level organisation chart of the Regeneron group providing an overview of the global and EEA Pharmacovigilance units and organisations identified by the Applicant as to where pharmacovigilance activities are carried out and, illustrating the relationships between them, with affiliate/parent companies and contractors. The chart(s) should show the main reporting relationships with management and clearly show the position and reporting line of the EEA QPPV, within the organisation. Other departments in the Regeneron group  who  interface  with  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  i.e.  regulatory  affairs,  marketing,  sales, quality  assurance  and  audit  should  be  shown.  The  Applicant  should  state  who  has  access  to  the Pharmacovigilance data.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The Applicant provided a list of written procedures as specified in Volume 9A for both Regeneron and Vigilex.  There  does  not  appear  to  be  a  SOP  covering  'Meeting  commitments  to  Competent Authorities in relation to a marketing authorisation' for either Vigilex or Regeneron. The Applicant was asked to clarify whether a procedure is in place and if not should describe how this topic is dealt with in practice. In the chart detailing the flow of safety information from post-marketing sources to the Competent Authorities, the Applicant states that both Regeneron and Vigilex perform continuous monitoring,  risk  assessment  and  signal  detection  but  Regeneron  do  not  have  a  SOP  covering  these topics.  The  Applicant  is  asked  to  clarify  whether  they  have  a  SOP  and  if  not  describe  how  the procedures are carried out in practice. A  copy  of  the  registration  of  the  QPPV  with  the  EudraVigilance  system  and  identification  of  the process to be used for electronic reporting to the Agency and to the Competent Authorities is provided by the Applicant. The database is capable of electronic reporting but Regeneron Medical safety is not equipped to  make  such  submissions at this  time  so  EvWeb  is  utilised  for  electronic  reporting.  The Applicant should provide a statement regarding the validation status of the system and whether it is E2B compliant. The  information  provided  by  the  Applicant  is  generally  satisfactory,  however,  further  information stating  whether  pharmacovigilance training is  provided  to  medical/sales representatives, and  who  is responsible  is  required.  The  Applicant  should  describe  the  ongoing  quality  assurance  procedure  in place for day to day Pharmacovigilance activities and detail the persons/groups responsible. The Applicant should provide information regarding corrective procedures and preventative action as the result of the auditing and quality assurance process and who is responsible for overseeing them-is the QPPV involved in them.

Following assessment of the D121 responses the conclusions on the PhV system are:

Provided that the deficiencies are rectified prior to the Applicant placing the medicinal product on the market, the CHMP may consider that the Pharmacovigilance system will fulfil the requirements. The Applicant must ensure that the system of Pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

Serious, life threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients treated with ARCALYST compared with placebo. In an open-label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection. In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections.

| Drug interactions         | Medicinal product no Routine: post-marketing surveillance (PSURs in accordance with EMEA timetable, based on the EU approval date and/or International Birth Date). Additional: concomitant drug use will be recorded as part of the Global Patient Registry. | longer Routine: Proposed SPC section 4.5 contains the following warnings: No interaction studies have been performed. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with any TNF inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.4). The concomitant administration of rilonacept with other IL-1 inhibitors has not been studied and is therefore not recommended. The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g. warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or plasma levels should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed. |

Additional: Details of any pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes associated with rilonacept use will be collected as part of the Global Patient Registry. | no longer authorised Routine: Proposed SPC section 4.6. contains the following statements regarding use during pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate data from use of rilonacept in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted in animals (see section 5.3). The potenital risk for humans is unknown. ARCALYST should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. It is unknown whether rilonacept is secreted in human or animal breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with ARCALYST should be made taking into account the benefit of breast- feeding to the child and the benefit of ARCALYST therapy to the woman. Additional: The Alert Card advises patients to talk with their doctor if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant or if they are nursing and physician training will highlight the need to avoid becoming pregnant while on rilonacept unless clearly necessary.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The submitted dossier for Arcalyst is considered comprehensive and of good quality. A number of deficiencies  initially  identified  in  the  dossier  were  resolved  by  the  responses  submitted  by  the Company.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the Active Substance and Medicinal product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of the tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At  the  time  of  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  a  number  of  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no impact on the Risk-benefit balance of the product. The applicant provided a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as follow-up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The Applicant has conducted an acceptable programme of non-clinical studies for rilonacept. The answers to the non-clinical questions raised during the assessment of the product were considered acceptable and there were no unresolved issues. Report of an additional embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys to investigate placental transfer, exposure of the conceptus and measurement of hormonal levels in the adults will be provided when available. Efficacy CAPS is an orphan disease which is comprised of a spectrum of disorder ranging from FCAS (variable severity  and  commoner  in  the  USA  than  in  Europe)  to  a  more  severe  form;  MWS  which  is characterised  by  daily  symptoms,  to  NOMID  -  the  most  severe  form  complicated  by  amyloidosis growth abnormalities and limited life expectancy. CAPS has a high unmet medical need. Currently unlicensed medications for this indication are used but require daily injections. This is problematic particularly  in  view  of  injection  site  reactions  and  this  is  difficult  particularly  for  children.  The development of Arcalyst provides a substantial benefit for these rare patients, who without treatment have a poor quality of life. Safety From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and PSUR data from data from 27.2.2008- 26.5.2009 have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 2.5 adequately addressed these. Although the safety database is currently limited the development of a Global Registry will increase knowledge about the safety of this product. · User consultation

The small print size, length and problematic terms in the PL contributed to unsatisfactory results of the user testing.  The applicant was required to revise the PL to develop a patient friendly package leaflet. Afterwards, the amended and adopted version should be used for another user consultation.

This further readability testing should reflect more details on recruitment methodology, and a better definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

- Demonstrated benefits

The  benefits  of  treatment  with  a  once  weekly  SC  injection  of  rilonacept  relate  to  the  reduction  of inflammation in CAPS. Persistent uncontrolled inflammation in CAPS can lead to a poor quality of life and in the case of ~25% of MWS can result in amyloidosis with end-organ damage. This outcome is difficult to prevent currently as there are no licensed treatment options in this rare patient group. The other  treatments  used  (steroids,  colchicine,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs,  anti-IL1  therapy) are either not very effective (NSAIDs, colchicine), have an adverse safety profile (steroids) or lack randomised controlled trial evidence of efficacy in CAPS (e.g. daily Kineret). The introduction of a treatment  which  has  been  demonstrated in  the  pivotal  trial  to  reduce  the  severity  and  frequency  of clinical symptoms of inflammation in this patient group provides a better treatment option than those that are currently available off licence.

Treatment-related infections,  which  were  considered by  the  investigators  as  treatment-related,  were more  common  in  patients  treated  with  rilonacept  (9%)  than  in  patients  treated  with  placebo  (0%) during  Part  A  of  the  pivotal  CAPS  study.  In  Part  B  (randomized  withdrawal)  the  incidence  of infections  was  similar  between  the  rilonacept  (0%)  and  placebo-treated  (4%)  patient  groups.  This finding may be related to the fact that Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. There have been instances in which patients taking rilonacept have developed serious infections; one patient in the open label portion of the pivotal study in CAPS died after developing sinusitis and bacterial (streptococcus pneumonia) meningitis.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Subgroup  analyses  indicate  that  clinical  efficacy  is  seen  in  both  genders  and  in  younger  and  older adults. Although efficacy was also evident in four paediatric patients (13-16 years of age) treated with open label rilonacept the experience in the paediatric population is very limited. Importantly  rilonacept  has  been  shown  to  reduce  biomarkers  of  systemic  inflammation  (CRP  and SAA)  in  line  with  improvement  in  clinical  symptoms.  Persistently  elevated  SAA  levels  (above 50mg/L) are associated with a high risk of continued amyloid deposition in patients with amyloidosis. Amyloidosis leads to organ damage as a result of deposition of amyloid fibrils and occurs in up to 25%  of  MWS.  With  sustained  reduction  in  SAA  levels  this  adverse  outcome  of  prolonged inflammation  should  be  prevented  by  long-term  treatment  with  rilonacept.  The  introduction  of rilonacept for these cases is a major advance in therapeutic options currently available. · Uncertain benefits It is not known if the observed effect on disease symptoms and signs as well as laboratory parameters of inflammation will translate into a substantially different long-term prognosis and the prevention of secondary organ damage, e.g. kidney failure and arthropathy due to amyloidosis. However, given the important role of IL-1beta is appears likely that long-term inhibition will have a beneficial effect. Risks  Demonstrated risks Infections

## Local injection site reactions (ISR)

Injection  site  reactions  (Injection  and  infusion  site  reactions,  MedDRA  HLT)  were  the  most commonly  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  and  the  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related TEAEs that led to study withdrawal in all rilonacept studies. None of the ISRs were reported as an SAE.  However,  in  patients  with  CAPS  all  events  were  assessed  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity, resolved within 1-2 days, and none resulted in permanent withdrawal from the study.

## · Potential risks

## Malignancies

Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. While data collected so far in the rilonacept development program does not indicate an excess risk of neoplasm, the impact of treatment with rilonacept on the development of malignancies is not known.

Interleukin-1  blockade  may  interfere  with  immune  response  to  infections  and  normal  immune response to new antigens. No data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving rilonacept. No data are available  on  the  effectiveness  of  vaccination  with  inactivated  (killed)  antigens  in  patients  receiving rilonacept. The applicant has been requested to conduct an interventional vaccination study that will investigate  the  influence  of  Arcalyst  on  immunogenicity  and  the  potential  for  generalised  infection with live vaccination pathogens.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Immunogenicity Forty  percent  of  patients  during  the  48-week  course  of  the  CAPS  pivotal  trial  (24-week  blinded portion Parts A and B) tested positive on at least one occasion for a treatment-emergent rilonaceptspecific binding antibody. 24% tested positive during the 24 week open label extension. The impact on safety and efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated. Reproductive Toxicology Animal studies  that  were  conducted  to  assess  reproductive  toxicity  are  inconclusive  with  regard  to effects  on  the  fetus.  There  are  no  adequate  data  from  the  use  of  rilonacept  in  pregnant  women  in clinical studies of rilonacept. It is not known whether rilonacept is secreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Drug Interactions Formal  studies  have  not  been  conducted  to  examine  the  pharmacokinetics  of  SC  administration  of rilonacept in CAPS patients with hepatic impairment. The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1) during chronic inflammation. By reversing inflammation, it is possible that treatment with rilonacept could normalize  CYP450  enzymes,  which  could  be  relevant  for  CYP450  substrates  with  a  narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). There is a limited safety database available to date with rilonacept and no significant experience with long-term  (over  2  year)  continuous  use  in  the  indicated  population.  Two  deaths  in  the  long-term extension  phase  included  one  71  year  old  woman  with  pneumococcal  meningitis  and  evidence  of chronic sinusitis, and a 37 year old man with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease who died suddenly  from  a  myocardial  infarct.    The  risks  include  injection  site  reactions  and  infections (predominantly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections)  immunogenicity  and  possibly  malignancy  and neutropenia (as seen with other IL-1 blocking agents).

However the mechanisms of action are not the same in Kineret and rilonacept-- as rilonacept can bind endogenous  IL-1ra-  it  is  theoretically  possible  that  rilonacept  could  cause  inflammation  in  some disease states where endogenous IL1ra is high.  In addition because IL-1 has actions on diverse cells in the  body  (including  bone  marrow,  uterus,  CNS)  the  effects  of  long-term  treatment  are  difficult  to predict. This includes effects on pregnancy, for which there is insufficient pre-clinical data.  The risk in  this  group  can  be  minimised  by  prescription  being  limited  to  experts  in  the  diagnosis  and management of CAPS and treatment of patients who require systemic therapy.

Other risks relate to the unknown effects with long-term use and use in certain patients with CAPS (such as those with co-morbidities such as hepatic impairment, or those on concomitant medication although the potential danger of concomitant use with anti-TNFs is highlighted in section 4.4 of the SPC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  addition the  potential for  off  label  use  in  other  patient  groups  exists  and  the  Applicant  has  been requested to propose measures to asses the extent of this and will develop a Global Registry to address this.

A possible risk for those with FCAS is treatment at a time of year when their symptoms are minimal. In  the  summer  months  these  milder  cases  will  have  the  risks  of  treatment  without  the  benefit. Therefore restricting the indication to patients with severe disease minimises this.

An additional potential risk is blunting of the inflammatory response associated with an acute episode of  sepsis.  This  is  a  possibility  with  all  immunosuppressive  medication  and  the  restriction  of prescription of experts in this field and addition of a warning in the SPC addresses this.

Lack of sufficient data in children (efficacy safety and PK data) will also be addressed in the Global Registry (for  safety  and  efficacy)  and  as  an  interventional  study  (for  PK).  The  interventional  study constitutes a specific obligation.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Further potential risks such as development of anti-IL-1R antibodies causing immune complexes (by binding  soluble  IL-1R)  or  binding  to  IL-1R  on  cell  surfaces  (which  could  result  in  blocking  or stimulation) exist, but seem unlikely following assessment of the D121 responses. Balance Efficacy in both FCAS and MWS with confirmed CASI mutations was clearly demonstrated both by a reduction of the clinical symptoms associated with CAPS and by a reduction in inflammatory markers. The efficacy is maintained on prolonged treatment up to 48 weeks. The  short  term  safety  profile  of  rilonacept  is  favourable  in  this  population,  supporting  an  overall positive  benefit/risk  assessment  for  its  use  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  FCAS  and  MWS.  The longer term  safety  is  unknown.  Of  note  one  death  considered  probably  related  to  therapy  has  been observed. Because rilonacept blocks IL-1beta, there is an increased risk of infections during treatment. Serious infections, while rare, have occurred. However IL-1 blockade is associated with infections and the  requirement  for  use  of  the  minimally  effective  dose  is  important  when  long-term  treatment  is planned. The D121 responses have provided sufficient evidence to support the dosing schedule and dose proposed. Conclusions The overall benefit/risk  balance  of  Arcalyst  is  positive  as  the  applicant  has  undertaken  the  specific Obligations and FUMs. A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that: · pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. · the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.5.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Arcalyst in the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes  (CAPS)  with  severe  symptoms,  including  Familial  Cold  Autoinflammatory  Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children aged 12 years and older, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.
