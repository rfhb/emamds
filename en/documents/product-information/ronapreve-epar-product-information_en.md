## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Antiviral resistance

Casirivimab and imdevimab were developed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 prior to the emergence of omicron variants. Due to the reduction of in vitro neutralising activity, casirivimab and imdevimab are not anticipated to provide protection against infection with viral variants exhibiting mutations in the Spike Protein characteristic of omicron variants (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Decisions regarding the use of Ronapreve for treatment or prophylaxis should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or geographical differences and available information on Ronapreve susceptibility patterns. See section 5.1.

Patients who receive Ronapreve for prophylaxis should be informed of the potential for breakthrough infections to occur. If signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur (the most common symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, cough, tiredness, and new loss of taste or smell; the most serious symptoms include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, or confusion and chest pain), advise individuals to promptly seek medical attention.

## Subcutaneous administration for treatment of COVID-19

The clinical efficacy of Ronapreve when administered by the subcutaneous route for treatment of COVID-19 has not been evaluated in clinical trials (see section 5.1). The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in the first 48 hours after subcutaneous administration of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody indicate lower serum exposures compared to intravenous administration of the same dose. It is unknown whether differences in initial systemic exposure result in differences in clinical efficacy. It is recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment.

## Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of casirivimab and imdevimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Cases of convulsive syncope have been observed following intravenous and subcutaneous administration (see section 4.8). Convulsive syncope should be differentiated from seizures and managed as clinically indicated.

## Infusion related reactions

Infusion related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of casirivimab and imdevimab.

IRRs observed in clinical studies were mostly moderate in severity and were typically observed during or within 24 hours of infusion. The frequently reported signs and symptoms for these reactions included nausea, chills, dizziness (or syncope), rash, urticaria, pruritus, tachypnoea and flushing. However, infusion related reactions may present as severe or life-threatening events and may include other signs and symptoms.

If an IRR occurs, the infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped.

## Polysorbate

This medicine contains 2.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial of 300 mg / 2.5 mL casirivimab and 300 mg / 2.5 mL imdevimab which is equivalent to 1 mg / mL.  Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Patient's known allergies shall be taken into consideration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited data from the use of casirivimab and imdevimab in pregnant women. Data from pregnant women exposed to casirivimab and imdevimab from clinical studies, registry-based cohort, and post-marketing surveillance including a total of 364 exposed pregnant women, did not identify adverse effects associated with casirivimab and imdevimab use on pregnancy or on the health of the developing foetus. Animal studies have not been performed with respect to reproductive toxicity. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placenta. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing foetus. However, as casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARSCoV-2 and in view of lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or foetal tissues in the tissue cross reactivity studies, negative effects on developing foetus are not expected. Ronapreve should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the foetus considering all associated health factors. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, the individual should be informed that any potential risk to the foetus is unknown.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether casirivimab and imdevimab are excreted in human milk, but maternal IgG is known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth. As casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and in view of low systemic absorption after oral ingestion of antibodies, administration of Ronapreve whilst breast-feeding can be considered when clinically indicated.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been performed.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ronapreve has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Overall, 8 796 subjects (6 373 via intravenous administration and 2 423 via subcutaneous administration) have been treated with casirivimab and imdevimab in clinical trials.

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, which include infusion related reactions (IRRs) and injection site reactions (ISRs).

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions in Table 5 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), Very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

## Paediatric population

## Intravenous administration

In study COV-2067, 98 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old and 102 children ≥ 2 and &lt; 12 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. In the RECOVERY study, 4 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. The safety profile observed across these studies was similar to that in adult patients.

## Subcutaneous administration

In study COV-2069, 66 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. The safety profile observed was similar to that in adult patients.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses up to 4 000 mg each of casirivimab and imdevimab have been administered in clinical trials. No data are available beyond this dose.

There is no known specific antidote for casirivimab and imdevimab overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: J06BD07

## Mechanism of action

Casirivimab (IgG1κ) and imdevimab (IgG1λ) are two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies which are unmodified in the Fc regions. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This prevents RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor, so preventing virus entry into cells.

## In-vitro antiviral activity

In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay in Vero E6 cells, casirivimab, imdevimab, and casirivimab and imdevimab together neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 values of 37.4 pM (0.006 μg/mL), 42.1 pM (0.006 μg/mL), and 31.0 pM (0.005 μg/mL) respectively.

## Resistance

There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together.

The neutralising activity of casirivimab, imdevimab and casirivimab and imdevimab together was assessed against S protein variants, including known Variants of Concern/Interest, variants identified in in vitro escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome data obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Casirivimab and imdevimab neutralising activity against the Variants of Concern/Interest are shown in Table 6.

## Clinical efficacy

Treatment of COVID-19

## COV-2067 - Adult cohort (≥ 18 years old)

COV-2067 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of subjects with COVID-19 (symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-qPCR]) who did not require supplemental oxygen and were at increased risk of progression to severe disease.

In Phase 3 Cohort 1 of this trial, subjects not previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were randomised within 7 days of symptom onset to a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab (n = 1 347), 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n = 2 036) or placebo (n = 2 009).

Subjects in Phase 3 Cohort 1 had at least one protocol-listed risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 (these included age &gt; 50 years, obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , cardiovascular disease including hypertension, chronic lung disease including asthma, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease including those on dialysis, chronic liver disease, pregnancy and immunosuppressed).

The median age was 50 years (with 13.1% of subjects aged 65 years or older) and 51.4% of the subjects were female. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 COVID-19-related hospitalisation or allcause death through Day 29.

mFAS: modified full analysis set included those subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab at randomisation, and with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.

The median time to symptom resolution, as recorded in a trial-specific daily symptom diary, was reduced from 13 days with placebo to 10 days with both doses of casirivimab and imdevimab (p&lt;0.0001).

## COV-2067 - Paediatric cohort (&lt; 18 years old)

In cohort 2 of this trial, 206 subjects less than 18 years old with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 were randomised to a single intravenous infusion of casirivimab and imdevimab at a 1 200 mg dose (or body weight equivalent dose; n=129), casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg dose (or body weight equivalent dose; n=75) or placebo (n=2). Following the pre-specified interim analysis in adult patients the placebo arm was removed.

The median age was 11 years (with 50% of subjects aged younger than 12 years).

Efficacy endpoints were descriptive and evaluated in subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result from NP swab at randomisation. There were no deaths or COVID-19-related hospitalisations in the paediatric cohort.

## RECOVERY

RECOVERY is an ongoing multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label platform study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalised subjects with COVID-19. RECOVERY enrolled hospitalised subjects on no oxygen, low or high flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive or invasive ventilation and ECMO. In this trial, 9 785 subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) were randomised to a single IV infusion of 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab plus usual care (n=4 839) or usual standard of care alone (n=4 946; herein after referred to as usual care alone). Subjects could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care.

Subjects had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were enrolled regardless of the respiratory support required. Baseline serology test results were used to define analysis populations.

At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (with 30% of subjects aged 70 years or older, 11 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old were included) and 63% of the subjects were male. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab, and usual care alone, treatment groups. Subjects were enrolled in the study when the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was the dominant variant in the UK. Respiratory support received by subjects included 7% on no supplemental oxygen, 61% on simple oxygen, 26% on non-invasive ventilation, and 6% on invasive ventilation (including 17 subjects on ECMO). In subjects who were seronegative at baseline, 10% were on no supplemental oxygen at baseline, 66% were on simple oxygen, 21% were on non-invasive ventilation, and 2% were on invasive ventilation (including one subject on ECMO). Approximately 94% of all randomised subjects received corticosteroids as part of background standard care.

The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in all randomised subjects who were seronegative at baseline. The results are shown in Table 9.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects | 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects                                 | 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects |
| Number of subjects with all- cause mortality (%)    | 396 (24%)                                                                           | 452 (30%)                                           |
| Rate Ratio (95% CI)                                 | 0.79 (0.69, - 0.91) (p=0.0009)                                                      | 0.79 (0.69, - 0.91) (p=0.0009)                      |

In seropositive subjects, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 16% (410/2 636) in the casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 15% (384/2 636) in the usual care alone arm (rate ratio 1.09 [95% CI: 0.94, 1.25]).

In seronegative subjects aged ≥80 years, 28-day all-cause mortality was 54.5% (126/231) and 57.5% (134/233) in the casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care alone arms, respectively (rate ratio 0.97 [95% CI: 0.76, 1.25]). Statistical testing of the secondary endpoint was performed outside of the hierarchy and is, therefore, considered descriptive.

The secondary endpoint of discharge alive from hospital within 28 days was more common in the allrandomised seronegative population treated with casirivimab and imdevimab compared with usual care alone (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 1.19 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.31]), with a 4-day shorter median duration of hospital stay (13 days vs. 17 days).

Among the all-randomised seronegative population not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab was associated with a lower risk of progressing to the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (31% vs. 37%; risk ratio 0.83 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.92]).

## COV-2066

COV-2066 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of hospitalised subjects with COVID-19 on low flow oxygen devices (e.g. by face mask or nasal cannula) or no supplemental oxygen. In this phase 2/3 trial, 1 197 subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline and were randomised 1:1:1 to a single intravenous infusion of 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n=406), 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab (n=398), or placebo (n=393), with all subjects receiving casirivimab and imdevimab, or placebo in addition to the usual standard of care for COVID-19. The overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to the early study termination following several months of low recruitment rates. Overall, similar effects were observed in patients on no supplemental oxygen or on low flow oxygen devices for casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg, and casirivimab and imdevimab 8 000 mg doses, indicating an absence of a dose effect in this population. These dose groups were combined when compared to the placebo group for the efficacy analysis.

At baseline, the median age was 62 years (with 44% of subjects aged 65 years or older), and 54% of the subjects were male, 43% of the subjects were seronegative, 48% were seropositive and 9% had an unknown serostatus. Baseline respiratory support received by subjects included 44% on no supplemental oxygen and 56% on low flow oxygen devices. Prior to randomisation, approximately 33% of subjects received remdesivir and 50% received systemic corticosteroids as part of background usual care. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary virologic efficacy endpoint was time weighted average (TWA) daily change from baseline in viral load (log10 copies/mL) through day 7, measured by RT-qPCR in NP swab samples, in subjects who were seronegative and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline. Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the LS mean viral load (log10 copies/mL) compared to placebo (-0.28 log10 copies/mL/day for casirivimab and imdevimab; p=0.0172).

The primary clinical endpoint was the proportion of subjects who died or went on mechanical ventilation in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result.

Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a reduced proportion of subjects with a high viral load who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to day 29, but the endpoint did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk reduction [RRR] 25.5% [95% CI: -16.2%, 52.2%]; p=0.2048).

Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a 47.1% RRR (95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%) in the proportion of seronegative subjects who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to day 29.

In a post hoc analysis of all randomized seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, all-cause mortality from day 1 to day 29 was 18.1% (19/105 subjects) and 30.0% (18/60 subjects) in the casirivimab+imdevimab (combined doses) and placebo arms, respectively (risk ratio 0.60 [95% CI: 0.34, 1.06]).

## Prevention of COVID-19

COV-2069 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that compared 600 mg casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab given subcutaneously to placebo for prevention of COVID-19 in asymptomatic household contacts of symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (index cases). Subjects had not been previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.

Subjects were randomised 1:1 to casirivimab and imdevimab or placebo within 96 hours of collection of the first index case sample that gave a positive result (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2.

Randomised subjects with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result at baseline were assigned to Cohort A and those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result were assigned to Cohort B.

## Cohort A

The primary analysis population included subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative and seronegative at baseline. Subjects who were seropositive or who had undetermined/missing baseline serology were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.

For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects ages 65 years or older) and 54% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed symptomatic RT-qPCRconfirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a statistically significant 81% risk reduction in the development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment versus placebo. In a sensitivity analysis that included all RT-qPCR negative subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological status, there was a statistically significant 82% risk reduction in development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

## Cohort B

The primary analysis population included asymptomatic subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive and seronegative at baseline.

For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 40 years (with 11% of subjects ages 65 years or older) and 55% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a 31% risk reduction in the development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment vs. placebo. In a sensitivity analysis that included all RT-qPCR positive subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological status, there was a 35% risk reduction in RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional PK across the intravenous (150 to 4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) and subcutaneous (300 and 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) dose ranges evaluated in clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable after either a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenous dose (182.7 mg/L, 1 754.9 mg.day/L, 37.9 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 181.7 mg/L, 1 600.8 mg.day/L, 27.3 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab), or a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) subcutaneous dose (52.5 mg/L, 1 121.7 mg.day/L, 30.5 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 49.2 mg/L, 1 016.9 mg.day/L, 25.9 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab).

For the intravenous regimen of 8 000 mg (4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) in patients who require oxygen supplementation, the mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were 1 046 mg/L, 9280 mg.day/L, 165.2 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 1 132 mg/L, 8789 mg.day/L, 136.2 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab, after a single intravenous dose.

For the pre-exposure prophylaxis intravenous and subcutaneous regimens at monthly administration of 300 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab following an initial (loading) dose of 600 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab, the median predicted casirivimab and imdevimab trough serum concentrations at steady state are similar to observed mean day 29 concentrations in serum for a single subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 1 200 mg (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab).

## Absorption

Casirivimab and imdevimab administered as a single intravenous dose results in peak serum concentrations at the end of infusion. The median (range) time to reach maximum serum concentration of casirivimab and imdevimab (Tmax) estimates following a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody are 6.7 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days and 6.6 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. After a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody, casirivimab and imdevimab had an estimated bioavailability of 71.8% and 71.7%, respectively.

## Distribution

The total volume of distribution estimated via population pharmacokinetic analysis was 7.072 L and 7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively.

## Biotransformation

As human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) serum elimination half-lives after a 600 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 29.8 (16.4, 43.1) days and 26.2 (16.9, 35.6) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) clearances were 0.188 (0.11, 0.30) and 0.227 (0.15, 0.35), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab.

For patients who require supplemental oxygen, the mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) serum elimination halflives after a 4 000 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 21.9 (12.4, 36.9) days and 18.8 (11.7, 29.4) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) clearances were 0.303 (0.156, 0.514) and 0.347 (0.188, 0.566), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab.

## Elderly

In the population PK analysis, age (18 years to 96 years) was not identified as a significant covariate on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant renal elimination due to their molecular weight (&gt; 69 kDa).

## Hepatic impairment

Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab following intravenous or subcutaneous dosing have been studied in the paediatric population, ranging from birth to &lt; 18 years of age in non-infected subjects, non-hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or household contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, using population pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic properties of casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents and children who do not require supplemental oxygen are shown in Table 12.

Table 12: Pharmacokinetic properties of casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents and children who do not require supplemental oxygen.

| Parameter                                        | Casirivimab        | Imdevimab          |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Subcutaneous bioavailability (%)                 | ~89                | ~86                |
| Mean terminal half-life (days) (90% CI)          | 35.5 (14, 57)      | 29.1 (16, 42.1)    |
| Mean clearance (L/day) (5 th , 95 th percentile) | 0.125 (0.04, 0.23) | 0.157 (0.06, 0.28) |

The weight-based intravenous doses recommended in Table 1 for patients who do not require supplemental oxygen are expected to provide exposures in adolescents and children that are comparable to those in adults who receive a 1200 mg intravenous dose of Ronapreve (600 mg casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab).

The predicted systemic exposure (C28, Cmax and AUCd28) following intravenous administration of casirivimab and imdevimab at the recommended doses in adolescents and children aged 2 years and weighing at least 10 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen are shown in Table 13.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Antiviral resistance

Casirivimab and imdevimab were developed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 prior to the emergence of omicron variants. Due to the reduction of in vitro neutralising activity, casirivimab and imdevimab are not anticipated to provide protection against infection with viral variants exhibiting mutations in the Spike Protein characteristic of omicron variants (see section 5.1).

Decisions regarding the use of Ronapreve for treatment or prophylaxis should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

geographical differences and available information on Ronapreve susceptibility patterns. See section 5.1.

Patients who receive Ronapreve for prophylaxis should be informed of the potential for breakthrough infections to occur. If signs or symptoms of COVID-19 occur (the most common symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, cough, tiredness, and new loss of taste or smell; the most serious symptoms include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, or confusion and chest pain), advise individuals to promptly seek medical attention.

## Subcutaneous administration for treatment of COVID-19

The clinical efficacy of Ronapreve when administered by the subcutaneous route for treatment of COVID-19 has not been evaluated in clinical trials (see section 5.1). The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in the first 48 hours after subcutaneous administration of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody indicate lower serum exposures compared to intravenous administration of the same dose. It is unknown whether differences in initial systemic exposure result in differences in clinical efficacy. It is recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment.

## Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of casirivimab and imdevimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

Cases of convulsive syncope have been observed following intravenous and subcutaneous administration (see section 4.8). Convulsive syncope should be differentiated from seizures and managed as clinically indicated.

## Infusion related reactions

Infusion related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of casirivimab and imdevimab.

IRRs observed in clinical studies were mostly moderate in severity and were typically observed during or within 24 hours of infusion. The frequently reported signs and symptoms for these reactions included nausea, chills, dizziness (or syncope), rash, urticaria, pruritus, tachypnoea and flushing. However, infusion related reactions may present as severe or life-threatening events and may include other signs and symptoms.

If an IRR occurs, the infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped.

## Polysorbate

This medicine contains 11.1 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial of 1 332 mg / 11.1 mL casirivimab and 1 332 mg / 11.1 mL imdevimab which is equivalent to 1 mg / mL.  Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

Patient's known allergies shall be taken into consideration.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are limited data from the use of casirivimab and imdevimab in pregnant women. Data from pregnant women exposed to casirivimab and imdevimab from clinical studies, registry-based cohort, and post-marketing surveillance including a total of 364 exposed pregnant women, did not identify adverse effects associated with casirivimab and imdevimab use on pregnancy or on the health of the developing foetus. Animal studies have not been performed with respect to reproductive toxicity. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placenta. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing foetus. However, as casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARSCoV-2 and in view of lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or foetal tissues in the tissue cross reactivity studies, negative effects on developing foetus are not expected. Ronapreve should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the foetus considering all associated health factors. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking this medicine, the individual should be informed that any potential risk to the foetus is unknown.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether casirivimab and imdevimab are excreted in human milk, but maternal IgG is known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth. As casirivimab and imdevimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and in view of low systemic absorption after oral ingestion of antibodies, administration of Ronapreve whilst breast-feeding can be considered when clinically indicated.

## Fertility

No fertility studies have been performed.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ronapreve has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Overall, 8 796 subjects (6 373 via intravenous administration and 2 423 via subcutaneous administration) have been treated with casirivimab and imdevimab in clinical trials.

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, which include infusion related reactions (IRRs) and injection site reactions (ISRs).

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions in Table 5 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000), Very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

## Paediatric population

## Intravenous administration

In study COV-2067, 98 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old and 102 children ≥ 2 and &lt; 12 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. In the RECOVERY study, 4 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. The safety profile observed across these studies was similar to that in adult patients.

## Subcutaneous administration

In study COV-2069, 66 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old received treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab. The safety profile observed was similar to that in adult patients.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses up to 4 000 mg each of casirivimab and imdevimab have been administered in clinical trials. No data are available beyond this dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There is no known specific antidote for casirivimab and imdevimab overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: J06BD07

## Mechanism of action

Casirivimab (IgG1κ) and imdevimab (IgG1λ) are two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies which are unmodified in the Fc regions. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This prevents RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor, so preventing virus entry into cells.

## In-vitro antiviral activity

In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay in Vero E6 cells, casirivimab, imdevimab, and casirivimab and imdevimab together neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 values of 37.4 pM (0.006 μg/mL), 42.1 pM (0.006 μg/mL), and 31.0 pM (0.005 μg/mL) respectively.

## Resistance

There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant to casirivimab and imdevimab administered together.

The neutralising activity of casirivimab, imdevimab and casirivimab and imdevimab together was assessed against S protein variants, including known Variants of Concern/Interest, variants identified in in vitro escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome data obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Casirivimab and imdevimab neutralising activity against the Variants of Concern/Interest are shown in Table 6.

## Clinical efficacy

Treatment of COVID-19

## COV-2067 - Adult cohort (≥ 18 years old)

COV-2067 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of subjects with COVID-19 (symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-qPCR]) who did not require supplemental oxygen and were at increased risk of progression to severe disease.

In Phase 3 Cohort 1 of this trial, subjects not previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were randomised within 7 days of symptom onset to a single intravenous infusion of 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab (n = 1 347), 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n = 2 036) or placebo (n = 2 009).

Subjects in Phase 3 Cohort 1 had at least one protocol-listed risk factor for developing severe COVID19 (these included age &gt; 50 years, obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , cardiovascular disease including hypertension, chronic lung disease including asthma, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease including those on dialysis, chronic liver disease, pregnancy and immunosuppressed).

The median age was 50 years (with 13.1% of subjects aged 65 years or older) and 51.4% of the subjects were female. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 COVID-19-related hospitalisation or allcause death through Day 29.

mFAS: modified full analysis set included those subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab at randomisation, and with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.

The median time to symptom resolution, as recorded in a trial-specific daily symptom diary, was reduced from 13 days with placebo to 10 days with both doses of casirivimab and imdevimab (p&lt;0.0001).

## COV-2067 - Paediatric cohort (&lt; 18 years old)

In cohort 2 of this trial, 206 subjects less than 18 years old with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 were randomised to a single intravenous infusion of casirivimab and imdevimab at a 1 200 mg dose (or body weight equivalent dose; n=129), casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg dose (or body weight equivalent dose; n=75) or placebo (n=2). Following the pre-specified interim analysis in adult patients the placebo arm was removed.

The median age was 11 years (with 50% of subjects aged younger than 12 years).

Efficacy endpoints were descriptive and evaluated in subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result from NP swab at randomisation. There were no deaths or COVID-19-related hospitalisations in the paediatric cohort.

## RECOVERY

RECOVERY is an ongoing multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label platform study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalised subjects with COVID-19. RECOVERY enrolled hospitalised subjects on no oxygen, low or high flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive or invasive ventilation and ECMO. In this trial, 9 785 subjects in the United Kingdom (UK) were randomised to a single IV infusion of 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab plus usual care (n=4 839) or usual standard of care alone (n=4 946; herein after referred to as usual care alone). Subjects could receive between 0 and 4 treatments on top of usual standard of care.

Subjects had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were enrolled regardless of the respiratory support required. Baseline serology test results were used to define analysis populations.

At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (with 30% of subjects aged 70 years or older, 11 adolescents ≥ 12 and &lt; 18 years old were included) and 63% of the subjects were male. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab, and usual care alone, treatment groups. Subjects were enrolled in the study when the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was the dominant variant in the UK. Respiratory support received by subjects included 7% on no supplemental oxygen, 61% on simple oxygen, 26% on non-invasive ventilation, and 6% on invasive ventilation (including 17 subjects on ECMO). In subjects who were seronegative at baseline, 10% were on no supplemental oxygen at baseline, 66% were on simple oxygen, 21% were on non-invasive ventilation, and 2% were on invasive ventilation (including one subject on ECMO). Approximately 94% of all randomised subjects received corticosteroids as part of background standard care.

The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in all randomised subjects who were seronegative at baseline. The results are shown in Table 9.

Table 9: Summary of primary endpoint results from study RECOVERY

|                                                     | 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab (intravenously) plus usual care   | Usual care alone                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects | 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects                                 | 28-Day all-cause mortality in seronegative subjects |
| Number of subjects with all- cause mortality (%)    | 396 (24%)                                                                           | 452 (30%)                                           |
| Rate Ratio (95% CI)                                 | 0.79 (0.69 - 0.91) (p=0.0009)                                                       | 0.79 (0.69 - 0.91) (p=0.0009)                       |

In seropositive subjects, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 16% (410/2 636) in the casirivimab+imdevimab arm and 15% (384/2 636) in the usual care alone arm (rate ratio 1.09 [95% CI: 0.94, 1.25]).

In seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, 28-day all-cause mortality was 54.5% (126/231) and 57.5% (134/233) in the casirivimab+imdevimab and usual care alone arms, respectively (rate ratio 0.97 [95% CI: 0.76, 1.25]).

Statistical testing of the secondary endpoint was performed outside of the hierarchy and is, therefore, considered descriptive.

The secondary endpoint of discharge alive from hospital within 28 days was more common in the allrandomised seronegative population treated with casirivimab and imdevimab compared with usual care alone (64% vs. 58%; rate ratio 1.19 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.31]), with a 4-day shorter median duration of hospital stay (13 days vs. 17 days).

Among the all-randomised seronegative population not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab was associated with a lower risk of progressing to the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (31% vs. 37%, risk ratio 0.83, [95% CI: 0.75, 0.92]).

## COV-2066

COV-2066 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of hospitalised subjects with COVID-19 on low flow oxygen devices (e.g., by face mask or nasal cannula) or no supplemental oxygen. In this phase 2/3 trial, 1 197 subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline and were randomised 1:1:1 to a single intravenous infusion of 1 200 mg of casirivimab and 1 200 mg of imdevimab (n=406), 4 000 mg of casirivimab and 4 000 mg of imdevimab (n=398), or placebo (n=393), with all subjects receiving casirivimab and imdevimab, or placebo in addition to the usual standard of care for COVID-19. The overall sample size was smaller than anticipated due to the early study termination following several months of low recruitment rates. Overall, similar effects were observed in patients on no supplemental oxygen or on low flow oxygen devices for casirivimab and imdevimab 2 400 mg and casirivimab and imdevimab 8 000 mg doses, indicating an absence of a dose effect in this population. These dose groups were combined when compared to the placebo group for the efficacy analysis.

At baseline, the median age was 62 years (with 44% of subjects aged 65 years or older), and 54% of the subjects were male, 43% of the subjects were seronegative, 48% were seropositive and 9% had an unknown serostatus. Baseline respiratory support received by subjects included 44% on no supplemental oxygen and 56% on low flow oxygen devices. Prior to randomisation, approximately 33% of subjects received remdesivir and 50% received systemic corticosteroids as part of background usual care. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary virologic efficacy endpoint was time weighted average (TWA) daily change from baseline in viral load (log10 copies/mL) through day 7, measured by RT-qPCR in NP swab samples, in subjects who were seronegative and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result at baseline. Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the LS mean viral load (log10 copies/mL) compared to placebo (-0.28 log10 copies/mL/day for casirivimab and imdevimab; p=0.0172).

The primary clinical endpoint was the proportion of subjects who died or went on mechanical ventilation in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR result.

Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a reduced proportion of subjects with a high viral load who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to day 29, but the endpoint did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk reduction [RRR] 25.5% [95% CI: -16.2%, 52.2%]; p=0.2048).

Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab for the combined doses group resulted in a 47.1% RRR (95% CI: 10.2%, 68.8%) in the proportion of seronegative subjects who died or went on mechanical ventilation from day 6 to day 29.

In a post hoc analysis of all randomized seronegative subjects aged ≥ 80 years, all-cause mortality from day 1 to day 29 was 18.1% (19/105 subjects) and 30.0% (18/60 subjects) in the casirivimab+imdevimab (combined doses) and placebo arms, respectively (risk ratio 0.60 [95% CI: 0.34, 1.06]).

## Prevention of COVID-19

COV-2069 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that compared 600 mg casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab given subcutaneously to placebo for prevention of COVID-19 in asymptomatic household contacts of symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (index cases). Subjects had not been previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.

Subjects were randomised 1:1 to casirivimab and imdevimab or placebo within 96 hours of collection of the first index case sample that gave a positive result (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2.

Randomised subjects with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result at baseline were assigned to Cohort A and those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test result were assigned to Cohort B.

## Cohort A

The primary analysis population included subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR negative and seronegative at baseline. Subjects who were seropositive or who had undetermined/missing baseline serology were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.

For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 44 years (with 9% of subjects ages 65 years or older) and 54% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed symptomatic RT-qPCRconfirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a statistically significant 81% risk reduction in the development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment versus placebo. In a sensitivity analysis that included all RT-qPCR negative subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological status, there was a statistically significant 82% risk reduction in development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

## Cohort B

The primary analysis population included asymptomatic subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive and seronegative at baseline.

For the primary analysis population at baseline, the median age was 40 years (with 11% of subjects ages 65 years or older) and 55% of the subjects were female. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 through Day 29. There was a 31% risk reduction in the development of COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment vs. placebo. In a sensitivity analysis that included all RT-qPCR positive subjects at baseline, regardless of baseline serological status, there was a 35% risk reduction in RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 with casirivimab and imdevimab treatment compared to placebo.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional PK across the intravenous (150 to 4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) and subcutaneous (300 and 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) dose ranges evaluated in clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable after either a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) intravenous dose (182.7 mg/L, 1 754.9 mg.day/L, 37.9 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 181.7 mg/L, 1 600.8 mg.day/L, 27.3 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab), or a single 1 200 mg (600 mg of each monoclonal antibody) subcutaneous dose (52.5 mg/L, 1 121.7 mg.day/L, 30.5 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 49.2 mg/L, 1 016.9 mg.day/L, 25.9 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab).

For the intravenous regimen of 8 000 mg (4 000 mg of each monoclonal antibody) in patients who require oxygen supplementation, the mean peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28) and concentration at 28 days after dosing (C28) for casirivimab and imdevimab were 1 046 mg/L, 9280 mg.day/L, 165.2 mg/L, respectively for casirivimab, and 1 132 mg/L, 8789 mg.day/L, 136.2 mg/L, respectively for imdevimab, after a single intravenous dose.

For the pre-exposure prophylaxis intravenous and subcutaneous regimens at monthly administration of 300 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab following an initial (loading) dose of 600 mg each for casirivimab and imdevimab, the median predicted casirivimab and imdevimab trough serum concentrations at steady state are similar to observed mean day 29 concentrations in serum for a single subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 1 200 mg (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab).

## Absorption

Casirivimab and imdevimab administered as a single intravenous dose results in peak serum concentrations at the end of infusion. The median (range) time to reach maximum serum concentration of casirivimab and imdevimab (Tmax) estimates following a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody are 6.7 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days and 6.6 (range 3.4 - 13.6) days for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. After a single subcutaneous dose of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody, casirivimab and imdevimab had an estimated bioavailability of 71.8% and 71.7%, respectively.

## Distribution

The total volume of distribution estimated via population pharmacokinetic analysis was 7.072 L and 7.183 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively.

## Biotransformation

As human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.

## Elimination

The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) serum elimination half-lives after a 600 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 29.8 (16.4, 43.1) days and 26.2 (16.9, 35.6) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) clearances were 0.188 (0.11, 0.30) and 0.227 (0.15, 0.35), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab.

For patients who require supplemental oxygen, the mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) serum elimination halflives after a 4 000 mg dose of each monoclonal antibody were 21.9 (12.4, 36.9) days and 18.8 (11.7, 29.4) days, respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab. The mean (5 th , 95 th percentile) clearances were 0.303 (0.156, 0.514) and 0.347 (0.188, 0.566), respectively, for casirivimab and imdevimab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

In the population PK analysis, age (18 years to 96 years) was not identified as a significant covariate on PK of casirivimab and imdevimab.

## Renal impairment

Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant renal elimination due to their molecular weight (&gt; 69 kDa).

## Hepatic impairment

Casirivimab and imdevimab are not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab following intravenous or subcutaneous dosing have been studied in the paediatric population, ranging from birth to &lt; 18 years of age in non-infected subjects, non-hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or household contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, using population pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic properties of casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents and children who do not require supplemental oxygen are shown in Table 12.

Table 12: Pharmacokinetic properties of casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents and children who do not require supplemental oxygen.

| Parameter                                        | Casirivimab        | Imdevimab          |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Subcutaneous bioavailability (%)                 | ~89                | ~86                |
| Mean terminal half-life (days) (90% CI)          | 35.5 (14, 57)      | 29.1 (16, 42.1)    |
| Mean clearance (L/day) (5 th , 95 th percentile) | 0.125 (0.04, 0.23) | 0.157 (0.06, 0.28) |

The weight-based intravenous doses recommended in Table 1 for patients who do not require supplemental oxygen are expected to provide exposures in adolescents and children that are comparable to those in adults who receive a 1200 mg intravenous dose of Ronapreve (600 mg casirivimab and 600 mg imdevimab).

The predicted systemic exposure (C28, Cmax and AUCd28) following intravenous administration of casirivimab and imdevimab at the recommended doses in adolescents and children aged 2 years and weighing at least 10 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen are shown in Table 13.

## 1. What Ronapreve is and what it is used for

## What Ronapreve is

Ronapreve is made up of the active substances 'casirivimab' and 'imdevimab'. Casirivimab and imdevimab are a type of protein called 'monoclonal antibodies'.

## What Ronapreve is used for

Ronapreve is used to treat adults, adolescents, and children aged from 2 years weighing at least 10 kg with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and are at increased risk for the illness becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor.

Ronapreve is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg who require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and who test negative for antibodies (proteins in the body's defence system) against COVID-19.

Ronapreve is used to prevent COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg.

## How Ronapreve works

Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the 'spike protein'. This stops the virus from getting into your cells and from spreading between cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Ronapreve

## You must not be given Ronapreve

- if you are allergic to casirivimab, imdevimab, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you.

## Warnings and precautions

- This medicine can cause allergic reactions or reactions following the infusion or injection. The signs of these reactions are listed in Section 4. Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of these signs or symptoms.
- This medicine contains 2.5 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial of 300 mg / 2.5 mL casirivimab and 300 mg / 2.5 mL imdevimab which is equivalent to 1 mg / mL.  Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you or your child have any known allergies.

## Children and adolescents

- Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.
- Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age or adolescents that weigh less than 40 kg who need oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19.
- Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age or adolescents that weigh less than 40 kg for the prevention of COVID-19.

## Other medicines and Ronapreve

Before you have Ronapreve, tell the doctor or nurse who is giving it to you about any other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken.

After you have had Ronapreve:

- tell the doctor, nurse or pharmacist that you have had this medicine to treat or prevent COVID19
- tell the doctor, nurse or pharmacist you have had this medicine, if you are getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be pregnant.

- This is because there is not enough information to be sure that this medicine is safe for use in pregnancy.
- This medicine will only be given if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks to the mother and the unborn child.

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding.

- This is because it is not yet known whether this medicine passes into human breast milk - or what the effects might be on the baby or milk production.
- Your doctor will help you decide whether to keep breast-feeding or to start treatment with this medicine.

## Driving and using machines

This medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How Ronapreve is given to you

## Administration by Intravenous Infusion

Ronapreve infusion solution should be administered by a qualified healthcare professional using aseptic technique.

- Gather the recommended materials for infusion:
- -Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU) infusion set.
- -In-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for intravenous administration
- Attach the infusion set to the intravenous bag.
- Prime the infusion set.
- Administer the entire infusion solution in the bag via pump or gravity through an intravenous line containing a sterile, in-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for intravenous administration.
- The infusion should be administered over 20 minutes to 2 hours. The rate of infusion may be slowed, interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse reactions.
- The prepared infusion solution should not be administered simultaneously with any other medicinal product. The compatibility of casirivimab and imdevimab injection with intravenous solutions and medicinal products other than 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection is not known.
- After infusion is complete, flush the tubing with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection to ensure delivery of the required dose.

## Preparation for Subcutaneous Injection

Remove the casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not expose to direct heat. Do not shake the vials .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new vial. The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow.

1. Ronapreve should be prepared using the appropriate number of syringes (see Table 3). Obtain 3 mL or 5 mL polypropylene syringes with luer connection and 21-gauge transfer needles.
2. Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and imdevimab from each respective vial into each syringe (see Table 3) for a total of 4 syringes for the 1 200 mg combined total dose and a total of 2 syringes for the 600 mg combined total dose. Store any remaining product as directed.
3. Replace the 21-gauge transfer needle with a 25-gauge or 27-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection.
4. This product is preservative-free and therefore, the prepared syringes should be administered immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared casirivimab and imdevimab syringes at 2ºC to 8ºC for no more than 72 hours and at room temperature up to 25ºC for no more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the syringes to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 10-15 minutes prior to administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Monitor and report side effects

- Monitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion or injection according to current medical practice. The rate of infusion may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.
- Report side effects via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## Storage

- Before use, store casirivimab and imdevimab vials in a fridge between 2 °C to 8 °C until they are required. Do not use after expiry date, marked on the vials/cartons after the letters EXP.
- Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrates are clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solutions.
- Before dilution, allow casirivimab and imdevimab vials to warm up to room temperature (up to 25 °C).
- After initial puncture of the 6 mL vial, the medicinal product should be used immediately, and any remaining product should be discarded.
- Once diluted, Ronapreve should be administered immediately. If necessary, bags of diluted solution can be stored for up to 20 hours at room temperature (up to 25 °C) and 2 °C to 8 °C for no more than 72 hours. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

## 1. What Ronapreve is and what it is used for

## What Ronapreve is

Ronapreve is made up of the active substances 'casirivimab' and 'imdevimab'. Casirivimab and imdevimab are a type of protein called 'monoclonal antibodies'.

## What Ronapreve is used for

Ronapreve is used to treat adults, adolescents, and children aged from 2 years weighing at least 10 kg with COVID-19 who do not require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and are at increased risk for the illness becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor.

Ronapreve is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg who require oxygen to treat COVID-19, and who test negative for antibodies (proteins in the body's defence system) against COVID-19.

Ronapreve is used to prevent COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged from 12 years weighing at least 40 kg.

## How Ronapreve works

Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the 'spike protein'. This stops the virus from getting into your cells and from spreading between cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Ronapreve

## You must not be given Ronapreve

Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you.

## Warnings and precautions

- This medicine can cause allergic reactions or reactions following the infusion or injection. The signs of these reactions are listed in Section 4. Tell your doctor straight away if you get any of these signs or symptoms.
- This medicine contains 11.1 mg of polysorbate 80 in each vial of 1 332 mg / 11.1 mL casirivimab and 1 332 mg / 11.1 mL imdevimab which is equivalent to 1 mg / mL.  Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you or your child have any known allergies.

## Children and adolescents

- Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg.
- Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age or adolescents that weigh less than 40 kg who need oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19.

## Administration by Intravenous Infusion

Ronapreve infusion solution should be administered by a qualified healthcare professional using aseptic technique.

- Gather the recommended materials for infusion:
- -Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE)-lined PVC, or polyurethane (PU) infusion set.
- -In-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for intravenous administration
- Attach the infusion set to the intravenous bag.
- Prime the infusion set.
- Administer the entire infusion solution in the bag via pump or gravity through an intravenous line containing a sterile, in-line or add-on 0.2 μm to 5 μm polyethersulfone, polysulfone, or polyamide filter for intravenous administration.
- The infusion should be administered over 20 minutes to 2 hours. The rate of infusion may be slowed, interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse reactions.
- The prepared infusion solution should not be administered simultaneously with any other medicinal product. The compatibility of casirivimab and imdevimab injection with intravenous solutions and medicinal products other than 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection is not known.
- After infusion is complete, flush the tubing with 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose injection to ensure delivery of the required dose.

## Preparation for Subcutaneous Injection

Remove the casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) from refrigerated storage and allow to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 20 minutes before preparation. Do not expose to direct heat. Do not shake the vials .

Inspect casirivimab and imdevimab vial(s) visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Should either be observed, the vial must be discarded and replaced with a new vial. The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Ronapreve should be prepared using the appropriate number of syringes (see Table 3). Obtain 3 mL or 5 mL polypropylene syringes with luer connection and 21-gauge transfer needles.
2. Using a sterile syringe and needle, withdraw the appropriate volume of casirivimab and imdevimab from each respective vial into each syringe (see Table 3) for a total of 4 syringes for the 1 200 mg combined total dose and a total of 2 syringes for the 600 mg combined total dose. Store any remaining product as directed.
3. Replace the 21-gauge transfer needle with a 25-gauge or 27-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection.
4. This product is preservative-free and therefore, the prepared syringes should be administered immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared casirivimab and imdevimab syringes at 2ºC to 8ºC for no more than 72 hours and at room temperature up to 25ºC for no more than 24 hours. If refrigerated, allow the syringes to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 10-15 minutes prior to administration.

## Administration for Subcutaneous Injection

- For the administration of Ronapreve 1 200 mg dose (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab), gather 4 syringes (Table 3) and prepare for subcutaneous injections.
- For the administration of Ronapreve 600 mg dose (300 mg of casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab), gather 2 syringes (Table 3) and prepare for subcutaneous injections.
- Due to the volume, subcutaneous injections of casirivimab and imdevimab should be made consecutively at separate body sites (into upper thighs, upper outer arms, or abdomen, avoiding 5 cm around the navel and the waistline).

## Monitor and report side effects

- Monitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion or injection according to current medical practice. The rate of infusion may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events. If signs or symptoms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

- Report side effects via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## Storage

- Before use, store casirivimab and imdevimab vials in a fridge between 2 °C to 8 °C until they are required. Do not use after expiry date, marked on the vials/cartons after the letters EXP.
- Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrates are clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solutions.
- Before dilution, allow casirivimab and imdevimab vials to warm up to room temperature (up to 25 °C).
- After initial puncture of the 20 mL vial , if not used immediately, the medicinal product in the vial can be stored for 16 hours at room temperature up to 25 °C or for 48 hours in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C). Other in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.
- Once diluted, Ronapreve should be administered immediately. If necessary, bags of diluted solution can be stored for up to 20 hours at room temperature (up to 25 °C) and 2 °C to 8 °C for no more than 72 hours. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
