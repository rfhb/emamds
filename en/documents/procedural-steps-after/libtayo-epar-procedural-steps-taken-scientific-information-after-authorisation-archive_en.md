1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0047   | Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to update paediatric population information from Study R2810-ONC-1690 (Study 1690) following the outcome of Article 46 procedure (EMA/H/C/004844/P46/011). C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   | 05/09/2024   | 19/12/2024   | SmPC and PL   | The efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab were evaluated in 57 paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory solid and CNS tumours, newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), newly diagnosed high-grade glioma (HGG) or recurrent HGG in Study 1690. The study, an open-label, multi-centre study, consisted of two phases, Phase 1 and Efficacy phase, conducted in parallel. Efficacy of cemiplimab in combination with radiotherapy was not established in studied populations as an improvement in OS or PFS was not demonstrated over historical data. No new risks or safety signals were identified. Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients were estimated based on an updated population PK model containing PK data from 1227 adults pooled with PK data from 55 paediatric to young adult patients aged 1 to 24 years. The exposure in paediatric patients was comparable to that in adults. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.   |

| II/0007 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 of the SmPC to amend an existing warning and add new ADRs with frequency uncommon, regarding new safety information in the post marketing setting on the terms 'Transplant rejection', 'Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)' and 'Myositis' and amended relevant recommendations for treatment modification. The MAH took the opportunity to update Section 5.1, based on minor corrections to the efficacy data in the SmPC from study R2810- ONC-1540 (primary analysis for group 2 and 3 dated 09 Jul 2019), considering errors that were revealed in two patient's data following the completion of the MA. The pharmacokinetic properties (section 5.2 of the SmPC) has been updated with population predicted and observed cemiplimab exposure at 350 mg Q3W from the group 3 primary analysis. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The MAH also took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in the PI across sections 4.2, 4.9, 6.3 and 6.6.
