## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

[ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must only be received, handled and administered by qualified personnel and must be prepared in accordance with both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements (for more details see also sections 4.4, 6.6 and 12).

Paediatric population

Posology Zevalin must be used following pretreatment with rituximab. Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of rituximab for detailed guidance on its use. The treatment regimen consists of two intravenous administrations of rituximab and one administration of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution in the following order: Day 1: intravenous infusion of 250 mg/m 2 rituximab. Day 7 or 8 or 9: -intravenous infusion of 250 mg/m 2 rituximab shortly (within 4 hours) before administration of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution. -10-minute intravenous infusion of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution. Repeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with Zevalin are not available. The recommended radioactivity dose of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution is: Treatment of rituximab relapsed or refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL): -patients with ≥ 150,000 platelets/mm 3 : 15 MBq/kg body weight. -patients with 100,000-150,000 platelets/mm 3 : 11 MBq/kg The maximum dose must not exceed 1200 MBq. Repeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with [90Y]-radiolabeled Zevalin are not available. Consolidation therapy after remission induction in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma -patients with ≥ 150,000 platelets/mm³: 15 MBq/kg up to a maximum of 1200 MBq for patients with less than 150,000 platelets per mm³ see section '4.4' Repeated use: Data on the re-treatment of patients with [90Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin are not available. Special populations Zevalin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Older people

Limited data in elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) are available. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients.

Patients with hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

<!-- image -->

Patients with renal impairment The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Method of administration The [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must be prepared according to section 12. Before administration to the patient, the percent radioincorporation of the prepared [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must be checked according to the procedure outlined in section 12. If the average radiochemical purity is less than 95%, the preparation must not be administered. The prepared solution must be given as a slow intravenous infusion over 10 minutes. The infusion must not be administered as an intravenous bolus. Zevalin may be infused directly by stopping the flow from an infusion bag and administering it directly into the line. A 0.2 or 0.22 micron low protein-binding filter must be on line between the patient and the infusion port. The line must be flushed with at least 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection after the infusion of Zevalin. 4.3 Contraindications -Hypersensitivity to ibritumomab tiuxetan, to yttrium chloride, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. -Hypersensitivity to rituximab or to other murine-derived proteins. -Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Since the Zevalin regimen includes rituximab, see also the Summary of Product Characteristics of rituximab. [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must only be received, handled and administered by qualified personnel with the appropriate government authorization for the use and manipulation of radionuclides within a designated clinical setting. Its receipt, preparation, use, transfer, storage, and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate authorisation/licences of the local competent official organisations. Radiopharmaceuticals must be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions must be taken, complying with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice of pharmaceuticals. Infusions must be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician with full resuscitation facilities immediately available (for radiopharmaceutical precautions see also sections '4.2 and 12').

[ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution must not be administered to patients who are likely to develop life-threatening haematological toxicity signs.

Zevalin must not be administered in patients mentioned below, as safety and efficacy have not been established:

- -&gt; 25% of the bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoma cells
- -prior external beam radiation affecting more than 25% of active bone marrow

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -platelet counts &lt;100,000/mm 3 (monotherapy) and &lt;150,000/mm 3  (consolidation treatment)
- -neutrophil counts &lt; 1,500/mm 3
- -prior bone marrow transplant or stem cell support

 Haematological toxicity Special caution is required with respect to bone marrow depletion. In most patients, administration of Zevalin (after pretreatment with rituximab) results in severe and prolonged cytopenia which is generally reversible (see section 4.8). Therefore, complete blood cell and platelet counts must be monitored following Zevalin treatment weekly until levels recover or as clinically indicated. The risk of haematological toxicity may be increased after prior therapy with fludarabine containing regimens (for details see section 4.5).  Treatment with growth factors Patients must not receive growth factor treatment such as G-CSF for 3 weeks prior to Zevalin administration as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the treatment in order to assess the adequate bone marrow reserve correctly and because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to radiation (see also section 4.5).  Human anti-murine antibodies Patients who had received murine-derived proteins before Zevalin treatment must be tested for human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA). Patients who have developed HAMAs may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with Zevalin or other murine-derived proteins. After use of Zevalin, patients must generally be tested for HAMA before any further treatment with murine-derived proteins.  Infusion reactions Infusion reactions may occur during or following Zevalin administration after pretreatment with Rituximab. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include dizziness, cough, nausea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, tachycardia, asthenia, pyrexia and rigors (see section 4.8). In case of a potential severe infusion reaction treatment must be stopped immediately.  Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions following Zevalin administration are commonly observed. Severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis occur in &lt; 1 % of patients (see also section 4.8). In case of hypersensitivity reactions, Zevalin infusion must be stopped immediately. Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. adrenaline, antihistamines and corticosteroids, must be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab or Zevalin.  Severe mucocutaneous reactions Severe mucocutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in association with Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab. The onset of the reactions varied from days to months. In patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction treatment must be discontinued.  Contraception Medicinal product no longer authorised

Long-term animal studies on the effect on fertility and reproductive function have not been performed. There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin could cause toxic effects on female and male gonads. Due to the nature of the compound, women of child-bearing potential, as well as males, must use effective contraceptive methods during and up to 12 months after treatment with Zevalin (see also section 4.6 and 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Immunization

The safety and efficacy of immunization with any vaccine, particularly live viral vaccines, following therapy with Zevalin have not been studied.  Due to the potential risk of developing viral infections it is not recommended to administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received Zevalin (see section 4.5). A potentially limited ability to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to any vaccine following Zevalin treatment has to be taken into consideration.

Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with ibritumomab tiuxetan. Since IgGs are known to cross the placenta, and because of the significant risk associated with radiation, Zevalin is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).

 NHL with CNS involvement No data are available on patients with CNS-lymphoma as those patients were not included in clinical studies. The use of Zevalin is therefore not recommended in NHL patients with CNS involvement.  Extravasation Close monitoring for evidence of extravasation during the injection of Zevalin is required in order to avoid radiation-associated tissue damage. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation have occurred, the infusion must be immediately terminated and restarted in another vein.  Secondary malignancies The use of Zevalin is associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), (see also section 4.8).  Excipients The final [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution contains up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on the radioactivity concentration. Patients on a controlled sodium diet must take this into consideration. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction There are no known interactions with other medicinal products. No interaction studies have been performed. Growth factor treatment such as G-CSF must not be given to patients for 3 weeks prior to Zevalin administration as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the treatment (see also section 4.4). In a clinical trial in which Zevalin was administered as consolidation after prior first line chemotherapy, a higher frequency of severe and prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in patients who had received Zevalin within 4 months after a combination chemotherapy of fludarabine with mitoxantrone and/or cyclophosphamide compared to those patients who had received any other chemotherapy. Hence the risk of haematological toxicity may be increased when Zevalin is administered shortly (&lt; 4 months) after fludarabine-containing regimens (see also section 4.4). The safety and efficacy of immunization with any vaccine, particularly live viral vaccines, following therapy with Zevalin have not been studied (see also section 'Special warnings and precautions for use'). 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment in women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Any woman who has missed a period must be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise and alternative therapies which do not involve ionising radiation must be then considered.

Women of childbearing potential as well as males must use effective contraceptive methods during and up to 12 months after treatment with Zevalin.

-  Myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukaemia

Breast-feeding Although it is not known whether ibritumomab tiuxetan is excreted in human milk, maternal IgGs are known  to  be  excreted  in  human  milk.  Therefore,  women  must  discontinue  breast-feeding,  as  the potential  for  absorption  and  immunosuppression  in  the  infant  is  unknown.  Zevalin  must  be  used following pretreatment with rituximab for which breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment and up to 12 months following treatment (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of rituximab for detailed guidance on its use). Fertility No animal studies have been performed to determine the effects of Zevalin on fertility in males or females. There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin could cause toxic effects on female and male gonads (see sections '4.4 and 5.2). Patients should be advised that fertility may be affected and that male patients may wish to consider semen cryopreservation. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Zevalin could affect the ability to drive and to use machines, as dizziness has been reported as a common side effect. 4.8 Undesirable effects Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. In all cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself. Since Zevalin is used after pretreatment with rituximab (for details see section 4.2), see also the prescribing information of rituximab. The overall safety profile of Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab is based on data from 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma studied in five clinical trials, on data from a study with 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation therapy after first-line remission induction, and from post-marketing surveillance. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab are thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, infections, pyrexia, nausea, asthenia, rigors, petechiae, and fatigue. The most serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab are:  Severe and prolonged cytopenias (see also 'Special warnings and precautions for use')  Infections  Haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic  Severe mucocutaneous reactions (see also 'Special warnings and precautions for use') Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fatal outcomes have been reported for each of the following serious adverse drug reactions. These reports originated either from clinical trials or from postmarking experience.

-  Infection

 Sepsis  Pneumonia  Myelodysplastic syndrome / Acute myeloid leukaemia  Anaemia  Pancytopenia  Haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic  Intracranial haemorrhage while thrombocytopenic  Mucocutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome The frequencies of the adverse drug reactions which were considered to be at least possibly related to Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab are represented in the table below. These adverse drug reactions are based upon 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma studied in 5 clinical trials. In addition, the adverse drug reactions marked with ** were observed in the study with 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation therapy after first-line remission induction where indicated. The adverse drug reactions identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be estimated, are listed under 'not known'. Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class (MedDRA). Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: (very common ≥1/10, common ≥1/100 to &lt;1/10, uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to  1/100, rare:  1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000; very rare: &lt;1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

after first line remission induction the median times to recovery was 20 days and 35 days for grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and 20 days and 28 days for grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

-  Infections and infestations
- -Data from 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular lymphoma, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma studied in five trials: patients very commonly developed infections. Grade 3 and grade 4 infections were reported commonly. During follow-up,

During the first 13 weeks after treatment with Zevalin , infections occurred commonly. Of these, grade 3 was common, grade 4 uncommon. -Data from 204 patients receiving Zevalin as consolidation therapy after first line remission induction: Infections were very commonly observed. Infections may be bacterial, fungal, viral including reactivation of latent viruses.  General disorders and administration site conditions Reports of extravasation with subsequent infusion site reactions including e.g. infusion site dermatitis, infusion site desquamation, and infusion site ulcer have been received. Zevalin-associated radiation might cause damage to lymphoma-surrounding tissue and complications due to lymphoma swelling  Immune system disorders Data from 349 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular lymphoma, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma studied in five trials: Hypersensitivity reactions following Zevalin administration are commonly observed. Severe (Grade 3/4) hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis occur in less than 1% of patients (see also section 'Special warnings and precautions for use').  Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) -Secondary malignancies Refractory or relapsed NHL: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been reported in eleven out of 211 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL assigned to treatment with Zevalin in four studies. Consolidation therapy: From the final analysis at around 7.5 years of a study investigating the efficacy and safety of Zevalin consolidation in patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma responding to first-line chemotherapy (Study 4, Section 5.1) of the 204 patients receiving Y-90 Zevalin following first line chemotherapy, 26 (12.7%) patients in the Zevalin arm developed a second primary malignancy compared to 14 (6.8%) of patients in the control arm.  Seven patients (3.4%, 7/204) were diagnosed with MDS/AML after receiving Zevalin, compared to one patient (0.5%, 1/205) in the control arm, with a median follow-up of 7.3 years.  Deaths due to second primary malignancy included 8 (3.9%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to 3 (1.5%) patients in the control arm.  Deaths due to MDS/AML included five (2.5%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to no patients in the control arm. The risk of developing secondary myelodysplasia or leukaemia following therapy with alkylating agents is well known. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Doses up to 19.2 MBq/kg of Zevalin have been administered in clinical trials. Expected haematological toxicity was observed, including grade 3 or 4. Patients recovered from these toxicity signs, and overdoses were not associated with serious or fatal outcome.

The safety and efficacy of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen were evaluated in two multi-center trials enrolling a total of 197 subjects. The Zevalin therapeutic regimen was administered in two steps (see 4.2). The efficacy and safety of a variation of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen employing a reduced dose of ibritumomab tiuxetan [ 90 Y] was further defined in a third study enrolling a total of 30 patients who had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 149,000 cells/mm 3 ).

There is no known specific antidote for [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin overdosage. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Zevalin and supportive therapy, which may include growth factors. If available, autologous stem cell support must be administered to manage haematological toxicity. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Various therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX02 Mechanism of action Ibritumomab tiuxetan is a recombinant murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody specific for the B-cell antigen CD20. Ibritumomab tiuxetan targets the antigen CD20 which is located on the surface of malignant and normal B-lymphocytes. During B-cell maturation, CD20 is first expressed in the midstage of B-lymphoblast (pre-B-cell), and is lost during the final stage of B-cell maturation to plasma cells. It is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalise on antibody binding. [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan binds specifically to CD20-expressing B-cells, including malignant cells. The isotope yttrium-90 is a pure β-emitter and has a mean path length of about 5 mm. This results in the ability to kill both targeted and neighbouring cells. The conjugated antibody has an apparent affinity constant for the CD20 antigen of approximately 17 nM. The binding pattern is very restricted, with no cross-reactivity to other leukocytes or to other types of human tissue. Rituximab pretreatment is necessary to clear circulating B-cells, enabling ibritumomab tiuxetan [ 90 Y] to deliver radiation more specifically to the lymphoma B-cells. Rituximab is administered in a reduced dose when compared with the approved monotherapy. Pharmacodynamic effects Treatment with [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin also leads to depletion of normal CD20+ B-cells. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated that this was a temporary effect; recovery of normal B-cells began within 6 months and median counts of B-cells were within normal range within 9 months after treatment.

 6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR) using the International Workshop Response Criteria (IWRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to disease progression (TTP) and duration of response (DR). In a secondary analysis comparing objective response to the Zevalin therapeutic regimen with that observed with the most recent treatment with rituximab, the median duration of response following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen was 6 vs. 4 months. Table 1 summarizes efficacy data from this study.

IWRC:  International Workshop response criteria

Study 3 was a single arm study of 30 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell NHL who had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100,000 to 149,000 cells/mm 3 ). Excluded from the study were patients with  25% lymphoma marrow involvement and/or impaired bone marrow reserve. Patients were considered to have impaired bone marrow reserve if they had any of the following: prior myeloablative therapy with stem cell support; prior external beam radiation to &gt;25% of active marrow; a platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm 3 ; or neutrophil count &lt;1,500 cells/mm 3 . In this study, a modification of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen with a lower [ 90 Y]-Zevalin activity per body weight (11 MBq/kg) was used. Objective, durable clinical responses were observed

Study 2 was a randomized, controlled, multicenter study comparing the Zevalin therapeutic regimen versus treatment with rituximab. The trial was conducted in 143 rituximab-naïve patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or transformed B-cell NHL. A total of 73 patients received the Zevalin therapeutic regimen, and 70 patients received rituximab given as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m 2 weekly times 4 doses. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was to determine the ORR using the IWRC (see Table 2). The ORR was significantly higher (80% vs. 56%, p = 0.002) for patients treated with the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. The secondary endpoints, duration of response and time to progression, were not significantly different between the two treatment arms.

[67% ORR (95% CI: 48-85%), 11.8 months median DR (range: 4-17 months)] and resulted in a greater incidence of haematologic toxicity (see 4.8) than in Studies 1 and 2.

Study 4 investigated the efficacy and safety of Zevalin consolidation in patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma responding to first-line chemotherapy. Major inclusion criteria were: CD20+ grade 1 or 2 follicular lymphoma; stage III or IV at diagnosis; normal peripheral blood cell counts; &lt; 25% bone marrow involvement; age ≥ 18 yrs; and complete response (CR/Cru) or partial response (PR) after first-line chemotherapy determined by physical examination, CT scans and bone marrow biopsy. After completing induction therapy, patients were randomized to receive either Zevalin (250 mg/m 2 rituximab on day -7 and on day 0 followed on day 0 by Zevalin 15 MBq/kg body weight; maximal dose 1200 MBq; [n=208]) or no further treatment (control; n=206). Induction therapies included CVP n=106, CHOP (-like) n=188, fludarabine combinations n=22, chlorambucil n=39 and rituximab-chemotherapy combinations n=59. Median progression free survival (PFS) was calculated at a median follow-up of 2.9 years. PFS increased from 13.5 months (control) to 37 months (Zevalin; p&lt;0.0001; HR 0.465). For patient subgroups in PR or CR after induction, median PFS was 6.3 vs 29.7 months (p&lt;0.0001; HR 0.304) and 29.9 vs 54.6 months (p=0.015; HR 0.613), respectively. After Zevalin consolidation, 77% of patients in PR after induction therapy converted to CR. Patients whose response status changed after Zevalin from PR to CR showed a significantly longer median progression free survival time (986 days) compared to those patients who remained in PR (median progression free survival time of 460 days, p=0.0004). In total, 87% of patients were in CR(u); 76% in CR and 11% in CRu. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties In patients given intravenous infusions of 250 mg/m 2 rituximab followed by intravenous injections of 15 MBq/kg of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin, the median serum effective half-life of ibritumomab tiuxetan [ 90 Y] was 28 h. As  90 Y forms a stable complex with ibritumomab tiuxetan, the biodistribution of the radiolabel follows the biodistribution of the antibody. Irradiation by the emitted beta particles from 90 Y occurs in a radius of 5 mm around the isotope. In clinical studies, the [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab results in a significant radiation dose to the testes. The radiation dose to the ovaries has not been established. There is a potential risk that [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin after pretreatment with rituximab could cause toxic effects on the male and female gonads (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single and repeated dose toxicity. The human radiation dose estimates derived from biodistribution studies in mice with [ 90 Y]- or [ 111 In]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan predicted acceptable radiation to normal human tissue with limited levels of skeleton and bone marrow radiation. The linker chelate tiuxetan forms a stable complex with the radioisotopes yttrium-90 and indium-111 and only negligible degradation due to radiolysis is expected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The single and repeated dose toxicity studies of the non-radioactive compound in cynomolgus monkeys did not indicate any other risk than the expected B-cell depletion arising from the use of ibritumomab tiuxetan alone or in combination with rituximab. Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed.

Studies on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Zevalin have not been performed. Due to the exposure to ionising radiation derived from the radiolabel, a risk of mutagenic and carcinogenic effects has to be taken into account.

Date of first authorisation: 16 January 2004 Date of latest renewal: 16 January 2009 10. DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT 11. DOSIMETRY Yttrium-90 decays by the emission of high-energy beta particles, with a physical half-life of 64.1 hours (2.67 days). The product of radioactive decay is stable zirconium-90. The path length of beta emission (  90) by yttrium-90 in tissue is 5 mm. Analyses of estimated radiation absorbed dose were carried out using quantitative imaging with the gamma-emitter [ 111 In]-radiolabelled Zevalin , blood sampling, and the MIRDOSE3 software program. The imaging dose of [ 111 In]-radiolabelled Zevalin was always given immediately following an infusion with rituximab at 250 mg/m² to deplete peripheral CD20+ cells and to optimise biodistribution. Following administration of [ 111 In]-radiolabelled Zevalin , whole body scans were performed at up to eight time-points, acquiring both anterior and posterior images. Blood samples, used to calculate residence times for red marrow, were drawn up to eight time-points. Based upon dosimetry studies with [ 111 In]-radiolabelled Zevalin, the estimated radiation dosimetry for individual organs following administration of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin at activities of 15 MBq/kg and 11 MBq/kg was calculated according to Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD) (Table 3). The estimated radiation-absorbed doses to normal organs were substantially below recognised upper safety limits. Individual patient dosimetry results were not predictive for [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin toxicity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

Read complete directions thoroughly before starting the preparation procedure.

Proper aseptic technique and precautions for handling radioactive materials must be employed. Waterproof gloves must be utilised in the preparation and during the determination of radiochemical purity of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin. Radiation protection precaution in accordance with local regulations must be taken, since administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc.. Characteristics of yttrium-90  The following minimum yttrium-90 characteristics are recommended: Radioactivity concentration at time of use 1.67 to 3.34 GBq/ml Total extractable activity to deliver at time of use  1.48 GBq corresponding to 0.44 ml to 0.89 ml of yttrium-90 solution HCl concentration 0.035-0.045 M Chloride identification Positive Yttrium identification Positive Radiochemical purity of the yttrium-90 chloride solution  95% of free ionic yttrium-90 Bacterial endotoxins  150 EU/ml Sterility No growth Radionuclidic purity strontium-90 content  0.74 MBq strontium-90 / 37 GBq yttrium-90 Metal impurities Total metals*  50 ppm Individual metals*  10 ppm each * Metals to be included need to be based on the specific manufacturing process. Control of these metals can be achieved either through process validation or release test.  Additional testing that might be required for suitability assessment: Medicinal product no longer authorised

* Needs to be included as release test or controlled through process validation if above limit of quantitation

Directions for radio-labelling of Zevalin with yttrium-90 : Sterile, pyrogen-free yttrium-90 chloride of the above specified quality must be used for the preparation of [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin. Before radiolabelling, bring refrigerated Zevalin cold kit to room temperature 25°C. Clean the rubber stopper of all cold kit vials and the yttrium-90 chloride vial with a suitable alcohol swab and allow to air dry. Place cold kit reaction vial in a suitable dispensing shield (plastic enclosed in lead). Step 1: Transfer sodium acetate solution to the reaction vial Using a 1-ml sterile syringe, transfer sodium acetate solution to reaction vial. The volume of sodium acetate solution added is equivalent to 1.2 times the volume of yttrium-90 chloride to be transferred in step 2. Step 2: Transfer yttrium-90 chloride to the reaction vial Aseptically transfer 1500 MBq of yttrium-90 chloride with a 1 ml sterile syringe to the reaction vial containing the sodium acetate solution transferred in step 1. Mix completely by coating the entire inner surface of the reaction vial. Mix by inversion, rolling the container, avoid foaming or agitating the solution. Step 3: Transfer ibritumomab tiuxetan solution to the reaction vial Using a 2-3 ml sterile syringe, transfer 1.3 ml ibritumomab tiuxetan solution to the reaction vial. Mix completely by coating the entire inner surface of the reaction vial. Mix by inversion, rolling the container, avoid foaming or agitating the solution. Incubate the yttrium-90 chloride/acetate/ibritumomab tiuxetan solution at room temperature for five minutes. Labelling time longer than six minutes or shorter than four minutes will result in inadequate radioincorporation. Step 4: Add the formulation buffer to the reaction vial Using a 10-ml syringe with a large bore needle (18-20 G), draw formulation buffer that will result in a combined total volume of 10 ml. After the 5-minute incubation period, withdraw from the reaction vial the same volume of air as the formulation buffer to be added in order to normalise pressure and immediately thereafter gently add the formulation buffer down the side of the reaction vial to terminate incubation. Do not foam, shake, or agitate the mixture. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Step 5: Assay the [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin solution for its specific radioactivity

Radiochemical purity of the radiolabelled preparation applies as long as more than 95% of yttrium-90 is incorporated into the monoclonal antibody.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before administration to the patient, the percent radioincorporation of the prepared [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin must be checked according to the procedure outlined below.

Caution : Patient dose not to exceed 1200 MBq.

Instructions for determining the percent radioincorporation The radioincorporation assay for radiochemical purity, is performed by Instant Thin Layer Chromatography (ITLC) and must be carried out according to the following procedure. Required materials not supplied in the Zevalin kit : - Developing chamber for chromatography - Mobile phase: sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution, bacteriostatic-free - ITLC strips (e.g. ITLC TEC-Control Chromatography Strips, Biodex, Shirley, New York, USA, Art. Nr. 150-772 or equivalent, dimensions: approximately 0.5-1 cm x 6 cm) - Scintillation vials - Liquid scintillation cocktail (e.g. Ultima Gold, catalog No. 6013329, Packard Instruments, USA or equivalent) Assay procedure: 1.) Add approximately 0.8 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to developing chamber assuring the liquid will not touch the 1.4 cm origin mark on the ITCL strip. 2.) Using a 1 ml insulin syringe with a 25- to 26-G needle, place a hanging drop (7-10 µl) of [ 90 Y]radiolabelled Zevalin onto the ITLC strip at its origin. Spot one strip at a time and run three ITLC strips. It may be necessary to perform a dilution (1:100) before application of the [ 90 Y]-radiolabelled Zevalin to the ITLC strips. 3.) Place ITLC strip in the developing chamber and allow the solvent front to migrate past the 5.4 cm mark. 4.) Remove ITLC strip and cut in half at the 3.5 cm cut line. Place each half into separate scintillation vials to which 5 ml LSC cocktail must be added (e.g. Ultima Gold, catalog No. 6013329, Packard Instruments, USA or equivalent). Count each vial in a beta counter or in an appropriate counter for one minute (CPM), record net counts, corrected for background. 5.) Calculate the average Radiochemical Purity (RCP) as follows: 6.) Average % RCP = net CPM bottom half x 100 net CPM top half + net CPM bottom half 7.) If the average radiochemical purity is less than 95%, the preparation must not be administered. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Medicinal product no longer authorised

-

-

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet: 1. What Zevalin is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Zevalin 3. How to use Zevalin 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Zevalin 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. WHAT ZEVALIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for therapy only. Zevalin is a kit for the preparation of the active substance ibritumomab tiuxetan [ 90 Y], a monoclonal antibody labelled with the radioactive substance yttrium-90 ( 90 Y). Zevalin attaches to a protein (CD20) on the surface of certain white blood cells (B-cells) and kills them by irradiation. Zevalin is used to treat patients suffering from specific subgroups of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (CD20+ indolent or transformed B-cell NHL) if an earlier rituximab, another monoclonal antibody, treatment has not worked, or has stopped working (refractory or relapsed disease). Zevalin is also used  in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. It is used as a consolidation therapy to improve the reduction in the number of lymphoma cells (remission) achieved with the initial chemotherapy regimen. The use of Zevalin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. 2. WHAT  YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ZEVALIN You must not be given Zevalin: if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the following:  ibritumomab tiuxetan, yttrium chloride or to any of the other ingredients of Zevalin (listed in section 6 'What Zevalin contains') Medicinal product no longer authorised

- 
- rituximab or other murine-derived proteins if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also section 'pregnancy and breast feeding').

## Take special care with Zevalin

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the following cases, Zevalin use is not recommended since its safety and efficacy have not been established:

-  more than a quarter of your bone marrow contains malignant abnormal cells.
-  If you have had external beam radiation (a type of radiotherapy) to more than a quarter of your bone marrow.

 If you receive Zevalin alone and the number of your blood platelets is fewer than 100,000/mm 3  If the number of your blood platelets is fewer than 150,000/mm 3 after chemotherapy  If the number of your white blood cells is fewer than 1,500/mm 3  If you have had a bone marrow transplant or have received blood stem cells in the past. If you have been treated with other proteins (especially mouse-derived) before Zevalin treatment, you may be more likely to have an allergic reaction. You may, therefore, need to be tested for special antibodies. In addition, Zevalin is not recommended for the use in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the brain and/or spinal cord as those patients were not included in clinical studies. Children Zevalin is not recommended for use in children below age 18 since safety and efficacy have not been established. Elderly patients Limited data in elderly patients (aged 65 years or over) are available. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other medicines and Zevalin Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, your doctor will need to interrupt treatment with growth factors such as filgrastim for a period of three weeks before giving you Zevalin to two weeks after Zevalin treatment. If you are given Zevalin less than 4 months after chemotherapy containing the active substance fludarabine, you may have a higher risk of having a reduced number of blood cells. Please tell your doctor that you were given Zevalin if you are due for vaccination after using it. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Zevalin must not be used during pregnancy. Your doctor will perform tests to exclude pregnancy before you start the treatment. Women of child-bearing potential and male patients must use reliable contraception during treatment with Zevalin and for up to one year after stopping treatment. There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by Zevalin could harm your ovaries and testicles. Please ask your doctor how this may affect you, especially if you are planning on having children in the future. Women must not breast-feed during treatment and for 12 months following the treatment. Driving and using machines Zevalin can affect your ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness is a common side effect. Please be cautious until you are sure you are not affected. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Zevalin contains sodium

This medicine contains up to 28 mg sodium per dose, depending on the radioactivity concentration. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. HOW TO USE ZEVALIN

There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Zevalin will only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe use of this product and will keep you informed of their actions.

The dose of Zevalin depends on your body weight, blood platelet counts and what Zevalin is being used for (indication). The maximum dose must not exceed 1200 MBq ('megabecquerel', a unit to measure radioactivity). Zevalin is used with another medicine containing the active substance rituximab. You will be given a total of 3 infusions in the course of two visits to a medical facility, 7 to 9 days apart. -On day 1 you will be given one rituximab infusion -On day 7, 8, or 9 you will be given one rituximab infusion, followed by one Zevalin infusion shortly afterwards (within 4 hours). The recommended dose is: For consolidation therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma  The usual dose is 15 MBq/kg body weight. For therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not responding to rituximab  The usual dose is 11 or 15 MBq per kg body weight, depending on your blood platelet count. Preparation of Zevalin Zevalin is not used directly, but must be prepared by your healthcare professional first. The kit allows the coupling of antibody ibritumomab tiuxetan with the radioactive isotope yttrium 90 Y (radiolabelling). How Zevalin is given Zevalin is given by intravenous infusion (drip into a vein) usually lasting about 10 minutes. After you are given Zevalin The amount of radiation that your body will be exposed to due to Zevalin is smaller than with radiotherapy. Most radioactivity will decay within the body, but a small part will be eliminated through your urine. Therefore, for one week after the Zevalin infusion you must wash your hands thoroughly each time after urinating. After treatment your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check your platelet and white cell counts. These usually decrease around two months after start of treatment. If your doctor plans to treat you with some other antibody after treatment with Zevalin, you will need to be tested for special antibodies. Your doctor will tell you if this applies to you. If you have received more Zevalin than you should Medicinal product no longer authorised

Your doctor will treat you, as appropriate, if you have any particular ill effects. This may include discontinuation of Zevalin therapy and treatment with growth factors or your own stem cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

Like all medicines, Zevalin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Tell your doctor immediately if you notice symptoms of any of the following:

- -feeling anxious ( anxiety) ; trouble sleeping ( insomnia )

 infection: fever, chills  blood poisoning (sepsis): fever and chills, changes in mental status, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, decreased urine output, low blood pressure, shock, problems with bleeding or clotting  infections of the lung (pneumonia): breathing difficulties  Low counts of blood cells: unusual bruising, more bleeding then usual after injury, fever, or if you feel unusually tired or breathless  severe mucous membrane reactions, which may occur days or months after Zevalin and/or rituximab administration. Your doctor will immediately stop the treatment.  extravasation (leakage of the infusion to the surrounding tissue): pain, burning sensation, stinging or another reaction at the infusion site during administration. Your doctor will immediately stop the infusion and restart it using another vein.  allergic ( hypersensitivity ) reactions/infusion reactions : symptoms for allergic reactions/ infusion reactions may be skin reactions, breathing difficulties, swelling, itching, flushing, chills, dizziness (as potential sign for low blood pressure). Depending on the kind/severity of reaction your doctor will decide if treatment must be stopped immediately.
