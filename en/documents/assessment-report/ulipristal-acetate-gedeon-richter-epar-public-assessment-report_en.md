## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

The applicant Gedeon Richter Plc. submitted on 06 April 2018 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ulipristal Acetate Gedeon Richter, through the centralised procedure.

As this application concerns active substance already authorised via the centralised procedure, 'automatic' access was granted by the CHMP on 22 March 2018.

The applicant applied for the following indications:

- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for one treatment course of pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.
- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age who are not eligible for surgery.

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC - relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder for an authorised medicinal product.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality, non-clinical and clinical data with a letter from a MAH Gedeon Richter Plc. allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, nonclinical and/or clinical data.

This application is submitted as a multiple of Esmya authorised on 23 February 2012 in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Not applicable.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 2.6. PSUR submission

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.8. Product information

## 2.8.1. User consultation

<!-- image -->

Since Ulipristal Acetate Gedeon Richter application is an informed consent of Esmya application, the product information (PI) for Ulipristal Acetate Gedeon Richter 5 mg tablets is identical to the up-todate PI of Esmya, with the only exception of the name of the medicinal product.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Ulipristal Acetate Gedeon Richter tablets are identical to Esmya tablets; the CHMP has previously reviewed data on quality, safety and efficacy of Esmya and considered the benefit/risk balance favourable.

Therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indications:

- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for one treatment course of pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.
- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age who are not eligible for surgery.

## 4. Recommendations

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Ulipristal Acetate Gedeon Richter is favourable in the following indication:

- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for one treatment course of pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.
- Ulipristal acetate is indicated for intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age who are not eligible for surgery.
