## 1. Introduction

On  12/02/2018,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  SUTENT  (A6181196),  in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  the  single-arm,  multi-center,  multi-national,  Phase  I/II  clinical  trial  A6181196 evaluating  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  preliminary  anti-tumour  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in children  and  young  adults  diagnosed  with  advanced  unresectable  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour (GIST) is currently included in the approved sunitinib Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP).

Considering that the PIP for sunitinib is still ongoing, the MAH does not consider that a change in the Sutent Product Information is warranted at this stage.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In the Study A6181196 sunitinib malate study medication was  supplied to the clinic pharmacy as hard gelatin capsules in HDPE bottles containing 28 or 30 capsules for oral administration. Sunitinib malate capsules contained 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg equivalents of sunitinib free-base.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final Clinical Study Report for Study A6181196: A Phase I/II Study of Sunitinib In Young Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## \"A Phase I/II Study of Sunitinib In Young Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour\" (Study A6181196)

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary Objective

- To characterize the plasma PK profile of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662 in children and young adults with advanced, unresectable GIST.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary Objectives

- To investigate whether doses greater than the established pediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were tolerated in pediatric patients with GIST;
- To investigate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST;
- To investigate the anti-tumor activity of sunitinib in children and young adults with GIST;
-  To  explore  pharmacokinetic  (PK)-pharmacodynamic  (PD)  relationships  with  respect  to  safety  and efficacy in children and young adults with GIST.

## Study design

This was a single arm, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the PK, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of sunitinib in children and young adults diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST.

## Study population /Sample size

Protocol Amendment 2 (see Section 9.8.2) was implemented to reduce the sample size to 6 patients from  the  originally  planned  15  patients  because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  difficulties  in identifying  pediatric  patients  suitable  for  participation  in  the  study.  The  revised  sample  size  was expected to still allow characterization of the PK profile, ie, analysis of the primary endpoint.

The originally planned sample size calculations were as follows. Assuming the coefficient of variation of sunitinib clearance among pediatric patients is approximately 35%, a total of 15 patients would allow detection  of  a  35%  margin  of  error  in  sunitinib  CL/F  with  95%  confidence  and  80%  power. Furthermore, assuming the coefficient of variation of sunitinib clearance among young adult patients is also ~35%, a total of 30 patients would allow detection of a 25% margin of error with 95% confidence and 80% power.

Pediatric patients with GIST aged 6 to 18 years who met the selection criteria were to be enrolled in the study. A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients were enrolled in the study and were included  in  the  analysis  of  PK,  safety,  and  efficacy  (see  table  below).  Of  the  6  enrolled  patients,  4 patients  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  objective  disease  progression  or  relapse,  1  patient discontinued treatment due to an AE, and 1 patient completed the treatment phase with 18 cycles and the follow-up phase. Of the 5 patients who discontinued treatment, 4 patients were followed up for survival  and  completed  the  study  phase.  One  (1)  patient  discontinued  treatment  and  chose  to  not participate in the follow-up phase.

## Full Analysis Population

The  full  analysis  (or  intent-to-treat)  population  included  all  enrolled  patients  regardless  of  what treatment, if any, was received. The efficacy analysis was based on the full analysis population. Note that if all patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment, this population would be equivalent to the as -treated population.

## As-Treated Population

The as-treated population included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The safety analysis was based on the as-treated population.

## Pharmacokinetic Population

The PK population included all treated patients with at least 1 PK observation. The PK analysis was based on PK population.

## Treatments

Eligible patients were dosed based on the body surface area (BSA). The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, (ie, 4 weeks on study treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment).

Intra-patient  dose  escalation  of  sunitinib  was  allowed  after  completion  of  Cycle  1,  based  on  dose modification  guidelines.  Patients  were  monitored  for  toxicity,  and  the  sunitinib  dose  was  adjusted according to individual patient tolerance at the discretion of the Investigator. For patients &lt;18 years, intra -patient dose escalation of sunitinib was allowed after completion of Cycle 1 and/or later cycles, and in the absence of toxicity greater than Grade 1 in the prior cycle.

Dose escalation was in increments of 7.5 mg/m2 up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/m2 (not to exceed 50 mg/day).

The dose could be reduced in response to toxicities based on Investigator discretion. Dose reductions in patients &lt;18 years was in decrements of 7.5 mg/m2.

A treatment cycle was 42 days, and patients could receive up to 18 cycles of sunitinib therapy for up to 24 months. Patients were to be followed for overall survival (OS) until either 2 years from the first dose of the study drug or completion of 18 cycles of study treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Doses higher than the previously defined MTD (15 mg/m2 per day) were generally well tolerated in this limited population (increase to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients).

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary Study Endpoints:

- PK parameters of sunitinib and its main active metabolite (SU012662) including total plasma exposure (AUC24) and oral clearance (CL/F).

## Secondary Study Endpoints:

- Type, incidence, severity (graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 [v4.0]), timing, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities;
- Objective  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (DOR),  progression-free  survival  (PFS) and OS at 2 years after study enrollment;
- PK-PD relationships with respect to safety and efficacy in paediatric GIST, if data allowed.

## Clinical Pharmacology-Methodology

The primary objective of the study was characterization of PK profile.

Pharmacokinetic  endpoints  were: PK  parameters  of  sunitinib and  its main  active metabolite, SU012662, including total plasma exposure (AUC from 0 to 24 hours [AUC24]) and CL/F.

The post dose PK profile samples for sunitinib and its active metabolite (SU012662) were obtained at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (see Table  below). Trough/pre-dose samples were collected on Days 1, 15, and 28 of Cycle 1 and on Days 1 and 28 of Cycles 2-3. Trough PK sample collection on Days 7 and 21 of Cycle 1 was optional. In addition, trough PK sample collection on Day 15 of Cycles 2-3 was required only if the patient underwent dose escalation during that cycle.

Pharmacokinetic  evaluation. Standard  plasma  PK  parameters  including  trough  plasma  concentration (Ctrough), Cmax, time to first occurrence of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), and area under the curve for concentration versus time profile from time 0 to 8 hours post dose (AUC8) for sunitinib and SU012662 were estimated following non-compartmental analysis methods, using eNCA. Nominal  sample  collection  times  were  used  for  non-compartmental  analyses  of  sunitinib  and SU012662.

Descriptive statistics for observed and dose-corrected (where appropriate) PK data was reported for all patients with at least one PK observation by presenting the population size, arithmetic mean, standard

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

deviation,  percent  coefficient  of  variation  (CV%),  median,  minimum,  maximum  values.  In  addition, geometric mean and the 95% CI for the geometric mean were reported where appropriate.

In addition to the non-compartmental analyses, NONMEM approaches were to be used to estimate PK parameters  absorption  rate  constant  (Ka),  CL/F,  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Q/F),  volume  of distribution for the central compartment (Vc/F) and peripheral compartment (Vp/F). Other parameters such as half-life for the distribution phase (t1/2 α ) and elimination phase (t1/2 β ), Cmax, and AUC24 were to be estimated based on individual patient parameter estimates.

Pharmacokinetic Analytical Methods. Human plasma samples were analyzed for sunitinib (also referred to  as  SU-011248  or  SUTENT)  and  its  active  metabolite  SU012662  (also  referred  to  as  SU-012662) concentrations  at  Bioanalytical  Systems,  Inc  (BASi,  Inc,  West  Lafayette,  Indiana)  using  a  validated analytical  assay  in  compliance  with  Pfizer  standard  operating  procedures.  Sunitinib  and  SU012662 samples were assayed using a validated, sensitive, and specific high performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC/MS/MS) method.

Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic .  In  addition  to  the  analyses  of  the  PK  data  listed  above, PK-PD analyses were carried out with respect to selected safety and efficacy parameters. The PK-evaluable patients on Day 28 of Cycle 1 were divided into 2 PK subgroups: those with Total Drug Ctrough values less  than  the  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  those  with  Total  Drug  Ctrough  values greater than or equal to the median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure).

Subsequently, the summary statistics (n, %) of incidence of adverse events (AEs) Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Fatigue, Hand-foot syndrome, Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, Lymphopenia, Anemia, and Hypertension by maximum CTCAE Grade and for all Grades combined during Cycles 1 to 3 for both PK subgroups were generated.

The  Pearson  correlation  coefficients  (R)  between  the  percent  change  in  the  laboratory  values  for absolute neutrophil count (ANC), thrombocyte count, lymphocyte count, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hemoglobin (Hgb) with Total Drug Ctrough values were calculated with respect to PK visits Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3. The laboratory value nearest to the time of PK sample collection was used for correlation purposes. The overall assessment was based on an overall trend observed based on the 3 individual correlation values and is included in the Sponsor's Clinical Pharmacology Contribution (CPC) report.

Furthermore,  the  summary  statistics  (n,  %,  or  median)  for  the  rate  of  SD,  ORR  (PR+CR),  and progressive disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), as well as for PFS were provided in both PK subgroups, based on Total Drug Ctrough values on Day 28 of Cycle 1. Finally,  the  R  values  between  the  PFS  with  Total  Drug  Ctrough  values  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  were calculated.

## Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Primary Endpoint (PK)

Descriptive statistics for observed and dose-corrected (where appropriate) PK data will be reported for all  patients  with  at  least  one  PK  observation  by  presenting  the  population  size,  arithmetic  mean, standard  deviation,  percent  coefficient  of  variation  (CV%),  median,  minimum,  maximum  values.  In addition, geometric mean and the 95% CI for the geometric mean will be reported where appropriate.

The key PK parameters in paediatric patients will be compared to adult patients with GIST based on historical data.  The  formal  comparison will be carried out as part of the NONMEM portion using the historical PK data in adult GIST patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints

Efficacy  endpoints  were  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (DR),  progression-free survival (PFS), and OS.

All  baseline  tumour  imaging  assessments  were  performed  within  28  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  of medication and then within 14 days prior to the end of each even-numbered cycle (ie, Cycles 2, 4, etc.).  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  or  computed  tomography  (CT)  scans  with  contrast  agents (unless  contraindicated),  and  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scans  were  used  for  tumor measurements. The determination of anti-tumor efficacy was based on Investigator's objective tumor assessments.  Assessments  of  confirmed  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial  response  (PR)  were according  to  RECIST  version  1.1.  Designation  of  best  response  of  stable  disease  (SD)  required  the criteria to be met at least once after the first dose of medication, at a minimum interval of 8 weeks. For  effusions  or  ascites,  only  cases  having  cytologic  proof  of  malignancy  were  recorded  as  tumour lesions on the case report form (CRF). Effusions that were not evaluated using cytology or were found to  be  non-malignant were not recorded on the 'non-target and new lesion' CRF. Measurable lesions that were previously irradiated were not considered target lesions unless increase in size was observed following completion of radiation therapy.

ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1. The number and percent of patients who achieved objective response (CR or PR) was summarized along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated using a method based on the F distribution.

DOR was defined as the time from the first objective documentation of complete or partial response (according  to  RECIST  version  1.1)  that  was  subsequently  confirmed  to  the  first  documentation  of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR was calculated for the subgroup  of  patients  who  had  objective  disease  response  and  was  summarized  using  Kaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically where appropriate.

PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of the study drug to the date of the first documentation of objective tumour progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS data were censored on the day following the date of the last tumour assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who 1) were given antitumour treatment other than the study  treatment  prior  to  observing  objective  tumour  progression;  2)  were  removed  from  the  study prior  to  documentation  of  objective  tumour  progression;  or  3)  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the analysis.  Patients  who  did  not  have  any  post-baseline  tumour  assessments  had  their  PFS  endpoint censored  on  the  date  of  enrollment.  Death  or  disease  progression  that  occurred  after  more  than  1 missed visit was censored on the day following the date of the last tumour assessment as well. PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically where appropriate. Median PFS and its corresponding 2-sided 95% CI for the median were summarized.

Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death due to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time was censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive.

## Analysis of safety parameters

Frequencies of patients experiencing at least 1 AE were displayed by System Organ Class(SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Detailed  information  collected  for  each  AE  include  a  description  of  the  event,  duration,  severity, seriousness, study drug relatedness, action taken, and clinical outcome. The severity of the AEs was graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The analyses were performed on AEs classified as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment-emergent.  Summary  tables  presented  the  number  of  patients  observed  with  AEs  and corresponding percentages. The denominator used to calculate incidence percentages consisted of the patients enrolled since all of them received at least 1 dose of study medication. Within each table, the AEs  were  categorized  by  MedDRA  system  organ  class  and  preferred  term.  Additional  subcategories were based on event intensity and relationship to study drug. Hematology and blood chemistry data were graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The frequencies of the worst severity grade observed were displayed for each parameter for the study and by cycle.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients were enrolled in the study and were included in the analysis of PK, safety, and efficacy.

## Pharmacokinetics results

The summary of PK parameters is provided in the table reported below. At an oral dose of 15 mg/m2 in  pediatric  patients  with  GIST,  the  median  Tmax  values  were  8.0  h  and  8.0  h  for  sunitinib  and SU012662,  respectively.  The  mean  Cmax  values  were  18.4  and  2.37  ng/mL  for  sunitinib  and SU012662,  respectively.  The  AUC8  was  82.7  and  10.7  ng.h/mL  for  sunitinib  and  SU012662, respectively. The respective inter-patient variability (CV%) in Cmax and AUC8 were 34% and 39% for sunitinib, and 17% and 35% for SU012662. The respective mean observed Ctrough values on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 44.7, 31.3 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 20.9, and 20.5 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 65.6, and 51.8 ng/mL for Total Drug.

Furthermore, the respective mean dose-corrected Ctrough values on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 32.5, 19.9 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 15.2, and 13.1 ng/mL for  SU012662;  and  36.0,  42.1,  47.7,  and  32.9  ng/mL  for  Total  Drug.  The  CV%  in  steady  state observed  or  dose-corrected  Ctrough  on  Day  28  of  Cycle  1  was  46%,  36%,  and  42%  for  sunitinib, SU012622, and Total Drug, respectively.

## Relationship between Efficacy Parameters and Plasma Drug Exposures

The  relationship  between  efficacy  parameters  and  plasma  drug  exposures  for  PK  subgroups  Lower Exposure (&lt;median total drug)  and Higher Exposure  (&gt;= total median drug) is summarized below:

<!-- image -->

The  rate  of  RECIST-defined  SD  and  objective  response  (CR  or  PR)  were  33.3%  and  0%  in  the  PK subgroup  with  less  than  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  66.7%  and  0%  in  the  PK subgroup with greater than or equal to median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure) on Day 28 of Cycle 1, respectively.

The median PFS was 2.6 months for the PK subgroup with Lower Exposure and 9.0 months in the PK subgroup with Higher Exposure on Day 28 of Cycle 1 (Study A6181196 CSR Table 14.4.3.9.5). The R value for the relationship between PFS and trough Total Drug plasma concentration on Day 28 of Cycle 1 was 0.59, indicating a moderate positive correlation (0.5≤R&lt; 0.7)

## Efficacy results

Best overall response, PFS, and OS were measured as secondary efficacy endpoints in the intent-totreat population and are summarized in the table below. Since none of the study patients experienced CR or PR, an analysis of DOR was not performed. The best overall response was SD (reported in 3 patients  [50.0%])  and  objective  progression  (observed  in  3  patients  [50.0%]).  PFS  events  were reported  in  4  (66.7%)  patients.  Two  (2)  patients  (33.3%)  were  censored  from  the  PFS  analysis because they did not have disease progression. The median PFS was estimated to be 5.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, not reached [NR])

There were no deaths in the study population. Consequently, all patients were censored and OS was not  summarized  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  The  time  from  the  first  study  dose  to  the  last available survival follow-up ranged from 0.9 years to 2.4 years for the 6 patients.

## Safety results

## Extent of Exposure to Sunitinib

Extent  of  exposure  to  the  study  treatment  was  assessed  in  terms  of  number  of  treatment  days, treatment cycles, and dose levels. Treatment duration ranged from 110 to 742 days with a median duration of 219 days (Table 3). Of the 6 patients in the as-treated population, all received at least 3 cycles of the study treatment and 1 patient received all 18 of the planned cycles. The mean cumulative dose was 4866.67 mg, with a mean relative intensity of 97.62%, and the mean daily dose was 27.12 mg or 19.07 mg/m2.

## Summary of Adverse Events (All Causalities)

A total of 82 AEs were reported as TEAEs in the as-treated population. In all 6 patients, at least 1 TEAE was  reported.  AEs  of  Grade  3  or  4  severity  were  reported  in  5  (83.3%)  patients.  There  were  no patients with SAEs or Grade 5 AEs.

One  (1)  patient  had  a  dose  reduction  due  to  an  AE,  4  patients  temporarily  discontinued  study treatment, and 1 patient permanently discontinued study treatment due to an AE.

Severity coumts are based on the maximwm severity or grade of events.

## Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities)

The overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  of  any  grade  was  100%  (6  patients)  (Table  5).  The  majority  of  the reported AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Three (3) patients had 1 Grade 3 AE each, and 2 patients had 1 Grade 4 AE each. There were no reports of Grade 5 TEAEs.

Overall, Headache (Grades 1 or 2) was reported in 4 (66.7%) patients and Diarrhoea (Grades 1 or 2), Nausea (Grade 1), Neutropenia (Grades 2 to 4), or white blood cell (WBC) count decreased (Grade 2) were reported in 3 patients each, respectively.

Hepatic hematoma and Intra-abdominal hemorrhage TEAEs (Grade 4) were reported in 1 patient. Both of  these  events  were  determined  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to  disease  progression.  This conclusion  was  supported  by  laparotomy  showing  multiple  lesions  localized  at  stomach  wall,  liver, lymph node at falx hepatis, and massive peritoneal dissemination, with hemorrhagic ascites.

The other Grade 4 TEAE was Neutropenia that was reported in 1 patient and led to dose reduction. Grade 3 TEAEs reported were Hypoglycaemia, Hypophosphataemia, Neutropenia, and Thrombocytopenia.

## Treatment-Related Adverse Events

A total of 59 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in the study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The  MAH  submitted  a Phase  (I/II  Study  A6181196)  of  Sunitinib  In  Young  Patients  With  Advanced Gastrointestinal  Stromal  Tumour .  Study  A6181196  was  a  single-arm,  multi-center,  multi-national, Phase  I/II  clinical  trial evaluating  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  safety,  and  preliminary  anti-tumour efficacy of sunitinib in children and young adults diagnosed with advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).

The primary objective of the study was characterization of PK profile.

A total of 8 patients were screened, of which 6 patients (age: 14.3 years (1.4 SD) were enrolled in the study and were included in the analysis of PK, safety, and efficacy.

Eligible patients were dosed based on the body surface area (BSA).  The starting dose of sunitinib was 15 mg/m2 per day administered orally per Schedule 4/2, (ie, 4 weeks on study treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment). Intra-patient dose escalation of sunitinib was allowed after completion of Cycle 1,  based on dose modification guidelines. Dose escalation was in increments of 7.5 mg/m2 up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/m2 (not to exceed 50 mg/day). The dose could be reduced in response to toxicities based on Investigator discretion.

A treatment cycle was 42 days, and patients could receive up to 18 cycles of sunitinib therapy for up to 24 months. Patients were to be followed for overall survival (OS) until either 2 years from the first dose of the study drug or completion of 18 cycles of study treatment.

Doses higher than the previously defined MTD (15 mg/m2 per day) were generally well tolerated in this limited population (increase to 22.5 mg/m2 per day in 5 of the 6 patients, and a further increase to 30 mg/m2 per day in 2 patients).

At an oral dose of 15 mg/m2 in pediatric patients with GIST, the median Tmax values were 8.0 h and 8.0 h for sunitinib and SU012662, respectively. The mean Cmax values were 18.4 and 2.37 ng/mL for sunitinib  and  SU012662,  respectively.  The  AUC8  was  82.7  and  10.7  ng.h/mL  for  sunitinib  and SU012662, respectively.  The  respective  inter-patient  variability  (CV%)  in  Cmax  and  AUC8  were  34% and 39% for sunitinib, and 17% and 35% for SU012662. The respective mean observed Ctrough values on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 44.7, 31.3 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 20.9, and 20.5 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 65.6, and 51.8 ng/mL for Total Drug. Furthermore, the respective mean dose-corrected Ctrough values (the dose-corrected trough concentrations  were  calculated  by  multiplying  the  observed  concentration  by  the  correction  factor: starting dose/actual dose) on Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 were 24.4, 29.1, 32.5, 19.9 ng/mL for sunitinib; 11.7, 13.0, 15.2, and 13.1 ng/mL for SU012662; and 36.0, 42.1, 47.7, and 32.9 ng/mL for Total Drug. The CV% in steady state observed or dose-corrected Ctrough on Day 28 of Cycle 1 was 46%, 36%, and 42% for sunitinib, SU012622, and Total Drug, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PK-evaluable patients on Day 28 of Cycle 1 were divided into 2 PK subgroups: those with Total Drug Ctrough  values  less  than  the  median  Ctrough  value  (Lower  Exposure)  and  those  with  Total  Drug Ctrough values greater than or equal to the median Ctrough value (Higher Exposure).

Regarding the relationship between safety and plasma drug exposures, it was observed that  a higher incidence  of  all  grade  AEs  (gastrointestinal-related  and  fatigue)  and  a  higher  degree  of  decrease  in some of the haematology findings (a greater percent decrease from baseline in absolute neutrophil count and platelet count was observed) with higher Total Drug plasma concentrations.

Furthermore, regarding the relationship between efficacy and plasma drug exposures a higher rate of SD  and  a  longer  PFS  time  in  patients  with  higher  total  drug  plasma  concentrations  have  been observed, indicating sunitinib's anti-tumour activity at higher plasma drug concentrations in paediatric patients with GIST.

No  confirmed  objective  responses  were  reported  in  the  6  patients  enrolled  and  treated,  with  SD reported in 50% of the evaluable population as best overall response.

A total of 82 TEAEs (59 considered treatment-related by the investigator), mostly Grade 1-2 in severity were reported in the as-treated population. No SAEs or Grade 5 TEAEs were reported. Only one patient permanently discontinued treatment due a treatment-related AE (anaemia Grade 2). No new safety signals were identified, and the safety profile appeared to be in line with the known safety profile in adults.

In  conclusion,  the  number  of  patients  enrolled  in  study  A6181196  do  not  allow  to  draw  any  sound conclusion about pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and efficacy of sunitinib in children and young adults diagnosed with advanced unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).
