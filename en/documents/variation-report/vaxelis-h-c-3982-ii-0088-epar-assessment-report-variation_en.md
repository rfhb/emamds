## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, MCM Vaccine B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 August 2021 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include information about long-term durability of the immune protection against HBV infection based on study V419-013 A Hepatitis B Vaccine Challenge Study to Demonstrate the Durability of Protection Against Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Healthy Children Vaccinated Approximately 9 Years Previously With a 2- or 3-Dose Infant Series and Toddler Dose of Vaxelis (study report P013V419). In addition, the MAH is updating sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC to implement EMA proposed wording and a typo error.

The MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the PL and implement minor editorial changes in sections 4.8 and 6.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2 rev. 1.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Vaxelis is a hexavalent vaccine co-developed by Sanofi Pasteur and MSD and was approved in the EU in 2016.

Vaxelis is indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis (caused by poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3), and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b in children from the age of 6 weeks. The vaccine is administered as a 0.5-mL intramuscular injection in a 2- or 3-dose infant vaccination series (with an interval of at least 1 month between doses) followed by a toddler dose (least 6 months after the last priming dose), depending on local recommendations.

This submission relates to a paediatric study (V419-013). The submission of the final study report is also in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 which sets out the obligation for MAHs to submit any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use of an authorised medicinal products in the paediatric population to the competent authority.

Study V419-013 is a stand-alone study and is not included in a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

The data submitted concern the long-term durability of protection against HBV infection 8-9 years after vaccination with a 3 + 1 or 2 + 1 Vaxelis series (i.e., a 3 or 2 dose primary vaccination series followed by a single toddler dose) from the Hepatitis B Vaccine Challenge Study V419-013. The MAH, MCM Vaccine B.V., submitted this variation application to propose updates of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties with information about long-term durability of the immune protection against HBV infection.

Study V419-013 is an open-label study conducted at 10 study-sites in Finland. The aim of the study was to evaluate long-term antibody persistence and immune memory 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. Participants 8 to 10 years of age who previously participated in either V419-007 or V419-008 and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

received a 3 + 1 Vaxelis or 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, respectively, were enrolled. All participants were to receive one dose of the HBVAXPRO vaccine as hepatitis B surface antigen challenge. This vaccine is approved in the EU for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus.

An anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL is accepted as correlate of protection against HBV infection. It is known that when this level is achieved 1 to 3 months after receipt of a complete and adequately administered vaccination course, individuals are considered completely protected against both acute and chronic infection for decades. Reaching anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL 30 days after a single dose challenge provides acceptable evidence to show persistent protection against HBV infection.

In this study, the proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level ( ≥ 10 mIU/mL) 30 days postchallenge is assessed and anti-HBs GMCs are evaluated pre- and post-challenge. Throughout the study, AEs resulting in discontinuation and SAEs were collected. The design, objectives, methods and endpoints of the study are endorsed.

Of the 207 participants enrolled, 205 received the HBVAXPRO challenge.

At 8-9 years after primary vaccination, protective anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL were still present in 40.9% and 49.1% of the participants who previously received a 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, respectively. Thirty days after receiving the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO, nearly all participants (201 out of 202) had seroprotective anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

The mean GMC increased from 9.63 mIU/mL (95% CI: 7.88 - 11.76) pre-challenge, to 685.84 mIU/mL (95% CI: 605.67 - 776.63) 30 days after the challenge. Furthermore, 96.0% of the participants showed a ≥ 4-fold rise in anti-HBs antibody titers, confirming the robust anamnestic response after Hepatitis B surface antigen challenge.

No significant differences were observed in the humoral immune response in participants who initially were administered a 3 + 1 or a 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, both pre- and post-challenge with HBVAXPRO.

These results suggest long-term persistence of protection against Hepatitis B infection up to at least 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis.

No SAEs and no AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported after vaccination with the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO. The safety profile of Vaxelis remains unchanged.

Based on the data from V419-013, it is concluded that 8-9 years after having received a 3 + 1 or 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, anti-HBs levels remain above the seroprotection level of 10 mIU/mL in 40.9% and 49.1% of the individuals, respectively. In addition, administration of a hepatitis B surface antigen challenge with HBVAXPRO markedly increased anti-HBs antibody levels, reaching a seroprotective titer above 10 mIU/mL in nearly all subjects. This data demonstrates an anamnestic response and hence longterm persistence of immune memory.

These data are consistent with the literature on immune persistence hepatitis B vaccination.

The updates in the SmPC are considered in line with the data of study V419-013.

The benefit-risk balance of Vaxelis remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

The study V419-013 was a single-group, open-label, single-dose, and multi-site study to evaluate the long-term durability of the immune protection against HBV infection approximately 9 years after receipt of a primary Vaxelis immunization series. Participants had previously participated in studies V419-007 or V419-008 and received Vaxelis according to a 3 + 1 (at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age) or a 2 + 1 (at 2, 4, and 11 to 12 months of age) schedule, respectively. They were 8 to 10 years of age at Protocol V419-013 enrolment.

Immune protection against HBV infection was demonstrated by administering a hepatitis B surface antigen challenge in the form of a hepatitis B vaccine (HBVAXPRO [5μg dose], MSD) and measuring anti -HBs levels pre- and post-challenge. A post-challenge anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL was considered evidence of persistent protection against HBV infection.

## · Design and objectives:

The study V419-013 was a single-group, open-label, single-dose, and multi-site study conducted in Finland in healthy participants 8 to 10 years of age who had previously participated in studies V419-007 or V419-008 and received Vaxelis according to a 3 + 1 or a 2 + 1 (infant + toddler) schedule, respectively (Figure 1). Study participants were challenged with HBVAXPRO vaccine. HBVAXPRO is a wellestablished hepatitis B vaccine that has been used worldwide since its initial licensure in 1986. The dose of 5 μg (0.5 mL) is approved for persons from birth through 15 years of age.

## Assessor's comment:

The paediatric study V419-013 is a single-group, open-label, single-dose study conducted at 10 studysites in Finland. The aim of the study was to evaluate long-term antibody persistence and immune memory 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. Participants 8 to 10 years of age who previously participated in studies V419-007 or V419-008 and received Vaxelis according to, respectively, a 3 + 1 or a 2 + 1 (infant + toddler) schedule were enrolled. The level of protective Hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) was analysed before and 30 days after a challenge with the HBVAXPRO vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The HBVAXPRO vaccine, used as hepatitis B surface antigen challenge, contains half of the amount of HBsAg compared to Vaxelis (5 µg vs. 10 µg) and a higher dose of aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (0.25 mg vs. 0.15 mg). HBVAXPRO is approved in EU for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus. This vaccine is administered as a 3-dose (0, 1, 6 months) or 4-dose (0, 1, 2, 12 months) primary vaccination series.

The study primarily assesses the proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level ( ≥10 mIU/mL , discussed in section 'study endpoints') at 30 days post-challenge and secondarily, anti-HBs GMCs are evaluated pre- and post-challenge. As an exploratory objective, the proportion of participants with a ≥4 -fold rise in the level anti-HBs antibodies by 30 days post-challenge is analysed as an indication of the robustness of the response. No separate analysis was done on the effect of the challenge in those subjects with HBs Ab &gt;10 mIU/ml vs those with Ab &lt;10 mIU/ml before the challenge. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving HBs Ab titers above 100 mIU/ml after the challenge was also not investigated, while this analysis is recommended according to the WHO GL of 2010 'Recommendations to Assure the Quality, Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines'.

Throughout the study, AEs resulting in discontinuation and SAEs are collected.

The design and objectives are endorsed.

## · Methods used to evaluate immunogenicity

Blood samples for immunogenicity assays were drawn immediately before vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 1) and at 30 days post-challenge at Visit 2 (Day 30). Anti-HBs concentration was measured by using the hepatitis B ECi assay.

## Assessor's comment:

A Hepatitis B Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECi) assay was used to measure anti-HBs concentrations just before and 30 days after administration of the HBVAXPRO vaccine challenge. This assay is a solid phase sandwich enzyme-labelled immunoassay, with a LLOQ of 5 mIU/mL. The control samples used to monitor performance of the assay consist of (a) three internally prepared control serum pools (high-positive, lowpositive and negative); (b) a positive and negative manufacturer supplied control; and (c) the WHO reference standard at 10 mIU/mL. Information on the manufacturer of the ECi assay and whether the assay is qualified or validated were not found. Upon request, applicant clarified that the ECi assay is a partially validated assay performed by Focus Diagnostics (now Q2 Vaccines). The ECi assay was the same for this study (V419-013) was the same as for the MAA Phase 3 pivotal clinical studies. (RFI, Issue resolved).

## · Study endpoints

Study endpoints are depicted in Table 1.

The primary immunogenicity endpoint is the proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO.

The secondary immunogenicity endpoint is the anti-HBs GMCs pre-challenge on Day 1 and 30 days postchallenge with HBVAXPRO.

The exploratory immunogenicity endpoint includes the proportion of participants with a ≥ 4-fold rise in anti-HBs level from pre-challenge on Day 1 to 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO.

This study will monitor safety through the collection of AEs resulting in discontinuation from study and SAEs at Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Day 30).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following changes in the planned analyses of the study were made:

- The proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL pre-challenge on Day 1 was reported by subgroup of prior Vaxelis schedule (i.e., 3 + 1 schedule in Protocol V419007 and 2 + 1 schedule in Protocol V419-008).
- The point estimates of the proportions for both subgroups were calculated, and the corresponding 95% CIs were calculated.

## Assessor's comment:

This study investigates if a hepatitis B surface antigen challenge with HBVAXPRO, 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis, induces an anamnestic response by Day 30. It is known that despite reduction of anti-HBs antibodies over time, B cell central memory is generally prolonged and protective efficacy is generally maintained at a high level. The antibodies induced by antigenic stimulation of memory cells are used as a surrogate to assess immune memory..

An anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL is accepted as correlate of protection against HBV infection. It is known that when this level is achieved 1 to 3 months after receipt of a complete and adequately administered vaccination course, individuals are considered completely protected against both acute and chronic infection for decades. Reaching anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL 30 days after a single dose challenge provides acceptable evidence to show persistent protection against HBV infection. It is known that for Hepatitis B, the peak anamnestic response is reached approximately 30 days after antigen challenge. In addition, as Hepatitis B infection has a long incubation period (30 to 180 days, with an average of 75 days), the analysis timepoint of 30 days post-challenge is considered appropriate and relevant.

As secondary endpoint, anti-HBs GMCs pre- and 30-days post-challenge will be assessed. As an exploratory endpoint, the proportion of subjects with at least a 4-fold increase in anti-HBs antibody concentrations at 30-days post-challenge will be assessed. A strong increase in anti-HBs levels after a challenge is indicative of an anamnestic response associated with persistent protection.

Although there is no endpoint based on anti-HBs levels 8-9 years after primary vaccination and before administering the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge, the proportion of participants with a protective baseline anti-HBs level was also calculated. As protection against infection can be maintained even if subsequently over time anti-HBs concentrations decline under 10 mIU/mL, it is difficult to interpret the clinical importance of these results.

Analysis of anti-HBs levels was also reported by prior Vaxelis schedule received (3 + 1 or 2 + 1 dose). In addition, it would have been interesting to see if there are difference in anamnestic response between baseline seronegative or seropositive individuals prior to the challenge, but this was not analysed.

Overall, the study endpoints are endorsed.

## Assessor's comment:

All study-participants in V419-013 previously participated in either V419-007 or V419-008 and received a 3 + 1 Vaxelis or 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, respectively. All participants were 8 to 10 years of age at time of enrolment. Individuals with a history of HBV infection, as well as subjects who received a hepatitis B vaccine after the previous study, were excluded from participation. Subjects had to be healthy as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.

## · Study cohorts

Immunogenicity Analysis Population: The per protocol (PP) population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this study. The PP population consists of all enrolled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants without deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the immunogenicity endpoint.

Safety Analysis Population: Safety summaries were conducted in the APaT population, which consists of all participants who received study vaccine and had safety follow-up data after the vaccination.

## Assessor's comment:

The immunogenicity analysis population includes all participants without significant protocol deviations that might influence the immunogenicity data, while the safety analysis population includes all individuals that have safety follow-up data after vaccination.

The cohort for analysis is endorsed.

## · Statistical methods

This is an estimation study, and no formal hypothesis testing was performed.

The point estimate for the primary immunogenicity objective was calculated as the proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated based on the exact method proposed by Clopper and Pearson.

The point estimates for the secondary immunogenicity objective were calculated by exponentiating the estimates of the mean of the natural log values. The 95% CIs were derived by exponentiating the bounds of the CIs of the mean of the natural log values based on the t-distribution. Any AE resulting in discontinuation from the study and SAEs will be reported and summarized descriptively.

No interim analyses are planned.

## Assessor's comment:

The study was descriptive and no between group comparisons are planned.

The statistical methods are endorsed.

## 5.2. Results

## · Study participants

A total of 207 participants were enrolled across 10 study sites in Finland.

All but 2 enrolled participants received HBVAXPRO and completed the study. Two participants withdrew from the study prior to receiving study vaccination.

All 205 participants who received HBVAXPRO were included in immunogenicity analyses for the PP population at Day 1. The data for 3 of these participants were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses for the PP population at Day 30 due to clinically important protocol deviations. All 205 participants were included for safety analysis.

The median age of participants was 8.0 years (range: 8 to 9 years) (Table 3). Nearly all participants were white and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

## Assessor's comment:

Of the 207 participants enrolled, 205 received the HBVAXPRO challenge vaccination and were included in the immunogenicity analysis population on Day 1. On Day 30, 202 participants are included in the immunogenicity analyses population, as for 3 subjects clinically important protocol deviations were reported.

All participants were 8 to 9 year-old at enrolment (Mean age: 8.4 yoa; SD 0.5). There is a good balance between males and females (110 vs 97 participants, respectively); and the previously received Vaxelis schedule (94 vs 113 received previously the 2+1 and 3+1 schedule, respectively). As all participants were enrolled in Finland, nearly all are white and have a non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (205 out of 207 participants).

## · Immunogenicity results

The proportions of participants with anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at Day 1 pre-challenge were 40.9% and 49.1% for participants who previously received a 2 + 1 (n=93) or 3 + 1 (n=112) Vaxelis schedule, respectively.

## Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoint

Most participants (96.0%) had a ≥ 4-fold rise in anti-HBs level from pre-challenge at Day 1 to 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO (Table 4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup analyses

Within each subgroup by prior Vaxelis schedule (3 + 1 schedule, 2 + 1 schedule), the following were generally consistent with those observed for the overall population (Table 5; Table 6; Figure 3):

- Proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL pre-challenge at Day 1
- Proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO
- Anti-HBs GMCs pre-challenge at Day 1
- Anti-HBs GMCs at 30 days post-challenge with HBVAXPRO

## Assessor's comment:

At 8-9 years after primary vaccination, protective antiHBs levels  ≥10 mIU/mL were still present in 40.9% and 49.1% o f the participants who previously received a 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 Vaxelis® schedule, respectively. Thirty days after receiving the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO , nearly all participants ( 201 out of 202 ) had seroprotective antiHBs antibody concentrations.

The mean GMC increased from 9.63 mIU/mL (95% CI: 7.88 -11.76) pre -challenge, to 685.84 mIU/mL (95% CI: 605.67 -776.63) 30 days after the challenge. It is unclear if there were any participants with a baseline titer below the LLOQ (5 mIU/mL). Furthermore, 96.0% of the participants showed a ≥4 -fold rise in anti-HBs antibody titers, confirming the robust anamnestic response after Heptatis B surface antigen challenge.

No significant differences are observed in the humoral immune response in participants who initially were administered a 3 + 1 or a 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, both pre - and postchallenge with HBVAXPRO.

These results suggest there is a long -term persistence of protection against Hepatitis B infection up to at least 89 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. Even when antibody titers are below the seroprotective level of 10 mIU/mL, an anamnestic response is induced indicating the presence of memory B-cells.

One month after the final Vaxelis dose in the primary vaccination schedule, 98.1% and 99.6% of the participants who received the 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 schedule, respectively, had seroprotective anti-HBs levels (SmPC Vaxelis). The GMCs after primary vaccination of the participants in V419 -013 is however not described, making it not possible to assess the magnitude of the anamnestic response.

## · Safety results

AEs resulting in discontinuation from study and SAEs were to be collected for this study. In the APaT population (vaccinated participants), no AEs resulting in discontinuation from study or SAEs were reported.

One participant experienced an AE of syncope and withdrew from the study prior to receiving HBVAXPRO.

## Assessor's comment:

No SAEs and no AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported after vaccination with the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile of Vaxelis remains unchanged.

## 5.3. Discussion

The study V419-013 is an open-label study conducted at 10 study-sites in Finland. The aim of the study was to evaluate long-term antibody persistence and immune memory 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. Participants 8 to 10 years of age who previously participated in either V419-007 or V419008 and received a 3 + 1 Vaxelis or 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, respectively, were enrolled. All participants were to receive one dose of the HBVAXPRO vaccine as hepatitis B surface antigen challenge.

Vaxelis is indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis (caused by poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3), and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b in children from the age of 6 weeks. The vaccine is administered as a 0.5-mL intramuscular injection in a 2- or 3-dose infant vaccination series (with an interval of at least 1 month between doses) followed by a toddler dose (least 6 months after the last priming dose), depending on local recommendations.

HBVAXPRO is approved in EU for active immunisation against hepatitis B virus infection in individuals from birth through 15 years of age considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus.

## Methods

An anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL is accepted as correlate of protection against HBV infection. It is known that when this level is achieved 1 to 3 months after receipt of a complete and adequately administered vaccination course, individuals are considered completely protected against both acute and chronic infection for decades. Reaching anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL 30 days after a single dose challenge provides acceptable evidence to show persistent protection against HBV infection. Anti-HBs titers were evaluating by the ECi methods (Focus Diagnostics, now Q2 Vaccines).

The study primarily assesses the proportion of participants with a protective anti-HBs level ( ≥ 10 mIU/mL) at 30 days post-challenge and secondarily, anti-HBs GMCs pre- and post-challenge. As an exploratory objective, the proportion of participants with a ≥ 4-fold rise in the level anti-HBs antibodies by 30 days post-challenge were analysed.  Analysis of anti-HBs levels was also reported by prior Vaxelis schedule received (3 + 1 or 2 + 1 dose).

Throughout the study, AEs resulting in discontinuation and SAEs were to be collected.

The study was descriptive.

The design, objectives, methods and endpoints of the study are endorsed.

## Results:

Of the 207 participants enrolled, 205 participants received the HBVAXPRO challenge vaccination.

At 8-9 years after primary vaccination, protective anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL were still present in 40.9% and 49.1% of the participants who previously received a 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, respectively. Thirty days after receiving the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO, nearly all participants (201 out of 202) had seroprotective anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

The mean GMC increased from 9.63 mIU/mL (95% CI: 7.88 - 11.76) pre-challenge, to 685.84 mIU/mL (95% CI: 605.67 - 776.63) 30 days after the challenge. Furthermore, 96.0% of the participants showed a ≥ 4-fold rise in anti-HBs antibody titers, confirming the robust anamnestic response after Heptatis B surface antigen challenge.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No significant differences are observed in the humoral immune response in participants who initially were administered a 3 + 1 or a 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, both pre- and post-challenge with HBVAXPRO.

These results suggest long-term persistence of protection against Hepatitis B infection up to at least 8-9 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. Even when antibody titers are below the seroprotective level of 10 mIU/mL, an anamnestic response is induced indicating the presence of memory B-cells.

No SAEs and no AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported after vaccination with the hepatitis B surface antigen challenge HBVAXPRO. The safety profile of Vaxelis remains unchanged.

## Conclusion:

Based on the data from V419-013, it is concluded that 8-9 years after having received a 3 + 1 or 2 + 1 Vaxelis schedule, anti-HBs levels remained above the seroprotection level of 10 mIU/mL in 40.9% and 49.1% of the individuals, respectively. In addition, administration of a hepatitis B surface antigen challenge with HBVAXPRO markedly increased anti-HBs antibody levels, reaching a seroprotective titer above 10 mIU/mL in nearly all subjects. These data demonstrate an anamnestic response and hence long-term persistence of immune memory. Data are consistent with the literature on immune persistence after hepatitis B vaccination.

## 6. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, section(s) 5.1 of the SmPC is being updated in order to include information about long-term durability of the immune protection against HBV infection based on study V419-013.

The MAH initially proposed the following changes:

## Persistence of the immune response

Long-term persistence of antibody to hepatitis B antibodies and surface antigen immune memory

The persistence of aAntibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) was measured in children 4 of  years of age-who had received Vaxelis either at 2, 4 and 11-12 months of at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age. The proportions of children seroprotected (with anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL) i.e., seroprotected were:

- 98.1% and 99.6%, respectively, at approximatively 1 month after the final Vaxelis dose (see table 3)

Follow up assessment of available participants (subset from the original studies) showed the proportion of children with anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL to be:

- after those vaccination schedules was 98.1% and 99.6%, respectively, and decreased to-65.78% and 70.2%, respectively, at approximatively 5 years of age
- 40.9% and 49.1%, respectively, at 8-9 yeafs of age and just prior to a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose approximately 4 years latef.
- 100% and 99.1%, respectively, approximatively 1 month after receiving the challenge dose

The challenge dose study results confirm persistence of hepatitis B immune response and protection in persons who previously had received Vaxelis.

Considerable study data suggest that individuals who have ever had a seroprotective response te hepatitis B vaccination will have a memory response that is protective against clinical disease if exposed to the hepatitis B virus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP recommended amendments to the initially proposed section on 'Long-term persistence of hepatitis B antibodies and immune memory', mainly in relation to the following points: title of the section, removal of seroprotection rates data that had been previously described in Table 3, rewording of sentence 'Follow up assessment of available participants (subset from the original studies) showed the proportion of children with antiHBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL to be' , to specify the number of subjects included in each analyses and in relation to present the data on persistence of immune responses to Hepatitis B in a table, including also the sample size.

Based on the above assessment remarks, the resulting text for Section 5.1 is therefore endorsed:

## Persistence of theimmuneresponse

Long term persistenee of antibody to hHepatitis B surface antigenimmune memory The persistence of immune responses antibody to hepatitis B surfaee antigen (anti- HBsAg) was evaluatedmeasured in children up to 8 years after primary vaccination with Vaxelis. 4 or 5 years of age The proportions of these children with anti-HBsAg &gt; 10 mIU/mL after having who had-received Vaxelis either at 2, 4, and 11-12 months or at 2, 3, 4, and 12\\_-months of age, respectively, were:. The proportion of ehildren seroproteeted (anti- HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL) after those vaceination schedules was 98.1% and 99.6%, respeetively, and deereased to 65.7% and 70.2% appr0ximately 4 years later.

- 65.8% (119 of 181) and 70.2% (134 of 191), respectively, at 4 or 5 years of age:
- 40.9% (38 of 93) and 49.1% (55 of 112), respectively, at 8 or 9 years of age.

A hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose was given to children 8 or 9 years of age. Approximately 1 month after this challenge dose, the proportions with anti-HBsAg &gt; 10 mlU/mL were 100% (93 of 93) and 99.1% (108 of 109), respectively. These data demonstrate an anamnestic response after a challenge dose, indicating the persistence of hepatitis B immune memory in persons who previously receivedVaxelis.

Considerable study data suggest that individuals who have ever had a seroproteetive response to hepatitis B vaeeination will have a memory response that is proteetive against elinieal disease if exposed to the hepatitis B virus.

## Long term pPersistence of antibodies to pertussis antigens

The persistence of pertussis antibodies was measured in children 4 or 5 years of age who had received Vaxelis at 2, 4, and 11-12 months of age. After approximately 4 years, tThe percentages of these children with anti-pertussis antibodies ≥ the lower limit of quantification above LLOQ-were-as follows: anti-PT 58.4%, anti-FHA 80.9%, anti-PRN 66.1%, and anti-FIM 94.34%.

In addition, the CHMP recommended wording for section 4.4 and sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC were also amended. Minor editorial changes were implemented in sections 4.8 and 6.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL.

Changes are also made throughout the PI to bring it in line with the QRD template version 10.2 rev. 1.

The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL was revised.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information and Package Leaflet.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The validated Hepatitis B ECi assay used for clinical trial testing is performed using the VITROS ECiQ Immunodiagnostic System (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) and the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products AntiHBs Quantitative Reagent Pack.

The assay was originally qualified for clinical testing at PPD Vaccines &amp; Biologics Laboratory (PPD VBL) in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The assay was transferred to Focus Diagnostics (now Q2 Vaccines), San Juan Capistrano, California in 2014 where method transfer and partial validation were executed prior to using the assay to support clinical testing.

To execute the Hepatitis B ECiQ assay transfer to Focus Diagnostics, a two-step approach, including a method transfer study followed by a partial validation study, was used to insure comparable assay performance at the new laboratory location. The objective of the method transfer study was to evaluate Focus Diagnostics' ability to perform the Hepatitis B ECiQ assay, and the results were evaluated against

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pre-specified criteria for control/run validity, assay precision, and concordance and agreement with historical testing results from the Hepatitis B ECiQ assay at PPD VBL. The objective of the partial validation study was to confirm the operating characteristics and performance at Focus Diagnostics and the results were evaluated against pre-specified criteria for control/run validity, verification of limits of quantitation, precision, ruggedness, selectivity (spike and recovery), and dilutional linearity.

The Hepatitis B ECiQ assay was subsequently transferred in 2019 to another lab within the same building at Q2 Vaccines and a partial validation was executed to confirm comparable performance of the assay by assessing controls, sample classification agreement, intermediate precision and concordance parameters against pre-defined acceptance criteria.

Finally, the Applicant would like to reiterate that the test method for the Hepatitis B Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECi) assay was the same for the MAA Phase 3 pivotal clinical studies and this present V419-013 study.

The following test method, method transfer and partial validation reports for the transfer of the assay to Focus Diagnostics, and Q2 Vaccines intra-laboratory transfer report are included for reference:
