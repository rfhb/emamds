|                     | based on final results from study AI444046, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 3 non-randomized, open-label, long-term follow-up and observational study of durability of efficacy, resistance and characterization of progression of liver disease in subjects with chronic hepatitis C previously treated with daclatasvir and/or asunaprevir. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to postpone (from Q2 2021 to Q2 2023) the due date of the safety study AI444427 evaluating recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Annex II is updated in accordance. The RMP version 6.1 has also been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |                    | no         | longer      | after treatment with daclatasvir. Among 258 patients who achieved SVR12 with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (± ribavirin) with a median duration of post-SVR12 follow-up of 38 months, no relapses occurred (with relapses defined as confirmed or last available HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ). Among 302 patients who achieved SVR12 with daclatasvir + pegIFN/RBV with a median duration of post-SVR12 follow-up of 44 months, 2% (n=6) of patients relapsed. With regards to resistance, emergent daclatasvir resistance-associated substitutions have been shown to persist for 3 years post-treatment and beyond for patients treated with daclatasvir-based regimens.   |

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 15/09/2016 product   | 23/02/2017 no   | SmPC        | The MAHsubmitted the results from an integrated analysis of resistance prevalence data from all daclatasvir (DCV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) and DCV/pegylated interferon (pegINF)/ribavirine (RBV) studies submitted to support the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Daklinza. In 9 phase 2/3 studies with daclatasvir in combination with peginterferon alfa + ribavirin or in combination with sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin, the following frequencies of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed at baseline: 7% in genotype 1a infection (M28T, Q30, L31, and/or Y93), 11% in genotype 1b infection (L31 and/or Y93H), 51% in genotype 2 infection (L31M), 8% in genotype 3 infection (Y93H) and 64% in genotype 4 infection (L28 and/or L30). In addition baseline nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) RAVs (at M28T, Q30, L31, and Y93 for genotype 1a; at L31 and Y93 for genotype 1b) increase the risk for non-response in treatment-naive patients infected with genotype 1a and genotype 1b infection. The impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on cure rates of genotype 4 infection is not apparent. In case of non-response to therapy with daclatasvir + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin, NS5A RAVs generally emerged at failure (139/153 genotype 1a and 49/57 genotype 1b). Finally, in limited numbers of genotype 4-infected patients with non-response, substitutions L28M and L30H/S were detected at failure. Section 5.1 of the SmPC has therefore been updated to reflect the above information. longer authorised   |

|                     | completion of the part 2 of study AAI444064, a phase I open-label drug-drug interaction study between methadone and daclatasvir, and between buprenorphine/naloxone and daclatasvir. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the Croatian local representative. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                                                      |            |            | Based on this finding no dose adjustment of DCV or buprenorphine when buprenorphine/naloxone is co-administered with DCV is warranted. In section 4.5 of the SmPC, the AUC and Cmin values for both buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine have been amended accordingly in the 'interactions and dose recommendations with other medicinal products' table. In addition, the recommendation concerning coadministration has been clarified that, although no dose adjustment of Daklinza or buprenorphine may be required, patients should be monitored for signs of opiate toxicity.   |

This is the first dedicated efficacy and safety study of DCV in patients with hepatic decompensation and post-transplant. Patients with cirrhosis (Child Pugh A/B/C; the 'cirrhotic cohort') and post-transplant patients (with various degrees of fibrosis including cirrhosis, the 'post- transplant cohort') were given 12 weeks of therapy with sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + ribavirin (600mg starting dose).

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were allowed, but in fact not used in any patient; 1 patient received blood transfusion. Although all genotypes were allowed, the majority of patients had genotype-1 infection.

High cure rates were seen in the post-transplant cohort, including patients with F3 (12/13) and F4 (15/16) fibrosis, and in patients with Child Pugh A and B in the cirrhotic cohort. In contrast, in patients with the most advanced liver disease (Child Pugh C, cirrhotic cohort) the relapse rate was high (relapse in 6/14 patients without a liver transplant procedure during study + yet another case where HCV-RNA was still detectable at end of treatment). Potential reasons for the high relapse rate in patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis were explored. It was shown that daclatasvir exposure (including unbound concentration) was similar in patients with Child Pugh A, B and C cirrhosis. In contrast, the actual ribavirin dosage was lower (CP C&lt;CP B&lt;CP A), with a median dose of only 350 mg/d (calculated by actual dosage given over the 12 weeks period, divided by 84 days). That figure is considerable lower than the dose given in a similar study called SOLAR-1, where sofosbuvir/ledipasvir + ribavirin given for 12 weeks yielded similarly low relapse rates in patients with Child Pugh A-C cirrhosis (median dose transplant and subjects post-liver transplant'. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the PI to the latest QRD template (v 9.1), amend the list of local representatives and correct minor editorial corrections to section 4.5 of the SmPC. The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

600 mg/d in subset of patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis treated for 12 weeks). It was concluded that the low ribavirin dosage de facto administered to the Child Pugh C patients may have been suboptimal. As a consequence of ALLY-1, the recommended treatment duration for patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis was set to 24 weeks.

No deaths were reported in ALLY-1 at the time of the follow-up Week 12 database lock. Two subjects in the cirrhotic cohort died after the follow-up Week 12 visit; both deaths (one due to sepsis and the other due to progressive liver failure) were judged to be unrelated to study therapy by investigator assessment.

The results in ALLY-2 provides, as expected, evidence for similar efficacy outcomes with sofosbuvir + daclatasvir in HIV co-infected patients treated for 12 weeks, as in patients only infected with hepatitis C. Although patients with all genotypes were allowed, numbers of patients with non-1 genotypes were low and not evidently supportive for a treatment recommendation for genotypes 2, 5 or 6. There was no trend for loss of control of HIV suppression.

No new or unexpected safety signal was observed. No deaths occurred during therapy. None were reported to have stopped therapy due to an adverse event and there were no clinically relevant trends in grade 3/4 laboratory values.

This data showed that 60 mg of daclatasvir should be used for darunavir/r and lopinavir/r, and 30 mg in combination with atazanavir/r to mimic the 'target exposure' seen with 60 mg without interacting drugs. The applicant would like to extrapolate the DDI data to DRV or ATV combinations with cobicistat or cobicistat as combination with elvitegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir (Stribild). The effect of DRV/RIT and LPV/RIT was lower than expected and due to the lack of complete data on DCV elimination (biliary excretion), extrapolation to unstudied scenarios are somewhat uncertain. However, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective, available data are indicative that the therapeutic margins of daclatasvir, when given with sofosbuvir, are wide. There is no reason to believe that any difference in exposure, of the magnitude that might reasonably occur when replacing ritonavir with cobicistat, would cause problems. The proposed SPC recommendations are thus supported.   |

| II/0005   | Submission of the results from two in vitro studies (NCPK 160 and NCPK 212) conducted to evaluate the involvement of transporters, committed in the Risk Management Plan as post authorisation measure (MEA 011). Based on the results of these studies, sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics are being updated. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to | 30/07/2015 28/01/2016 no | Submitted data are two in vitro studies investigating daclatasvir uptake transport into hepatocytes. The data suggest that liver uptake of daclatasvir involves multiple pathways (both active transport and passive diffusion) and that the active liver uptake of daclatasvir is mediated by OCT1 and other unidentified transporters. The sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been amended to reflect the new data. longer |
