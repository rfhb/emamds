## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Docefrez  powder  and  solvent  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  medicinal  product containing docetaxel as active substance. Two strengths have been developed, 20 mg and 80 mg. The  reference  medicinal  product  Taxotere  concentrate  and  solvent  for  solution  for  infusion  has been  centrally  authorised  since  27  November  1995  and  is  at  present  available  in  the  following strengths; 20 mg/0.5 ml, 80 mg/2 ml, 20 mg/1 ml and 80 mg/4 ml. In this EPAR only reference to Taxotere strengths 20 mg/0.5 ml and 80 mg/2 ml is made. The active substance in Docefrez and Taxotere  is  the  same,  docetaxel.  Docefrez  contains  docetaxel  in  the  anhydrous  form,  whereas Taxotere contains docetaxel as a trihydrate. Docefrez is a hybrid medicinal product in the sense that the pharmaceutical form is different compared to the reference medicinal product. Docefrez 20 mg and Docefrez 80 mg are hybrids of Taxotere 20 mg/0.5 ml (EU/1/95/002/001) and Taxotere 80 mg/2 ml (EU/1/95/002/002), respectively. Docefrez is presented as a package containing one powder and one solvent vial whereas a package of the reference medicinal product contains one concentrate and one solvent vial.

Similar  to  the  reference  product,  the  Docefrez  powder  vial  needs  to  be  reconstituted  with  the solvent vial before dilution into the infusion bag. The qualitative composition of the reconstituted solution (premix) is similar for both products, but the quantitative composition is different. After reconstitution  of  the  20  or  80  mg  strength,  the  Docefrez  premix  contains  24  mg/ml  docetaxel whereas the Taxotere premix contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel.

The medicinal product Docefrez is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution and dilution in an infusion bag containing either 5% glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Reconstitution occurs by withdrawing the content of the solvent vial with a syringe and injecting the solvent into the powder vial as explained in the package leaflet.

Docefrez is indicated in the treatment of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer. The indications of Docefrez are the same as for the reference medicinal product (see page 19).

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

<!-- image -->

The  medicinal  product  Docefrez  contains  the  active  substance  docetaxel  and  is  presented  as powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. Docefrez is available in two strengths 20 mg and 80 mg. A Docefrez package contains two vials, one powder vial and one solvent vial.

The  powder  vial  contains  a  white  sterile  lyophilised  cake  intended  for  reconstitution  with  the solvent provided in the separate solvent vial. The powder vial contains only the active substance docetaxel  and  no  excipients.  The  powder  is  packed  into  colourless  glass  vials  with  grey  rubber closures and sealed with flip-off aluminium seals (dark green for 20 mg, blood red for 80 mg).

The  solvent  vial  contains  polysorbate  80  and  anhydrous  ethanol  and  is  used  to  dissolve  the powder. The solvent is a viscous, clear, colourless, sterile solution and is packed into colourless glass vials  with  grey  rubber  stoppers  sealed  with  flip-off  aluminium  seals  (dark  blue  for  20  mg, brown for 80 mg).

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Active Substance

The chemical name for docetaxel is (2R, 3S)-N-Carboxy-3-phenylisoserine, N-tert-butylester, 13ester with 5beta, 20-epoxy-1,2 alpha 4, 7 beta, 10beta, 13 alpha-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4acetate 2-benzoate.

The  molecular  formula  is  C 43 H53NO14  and  the  molecular  weight  is  807.88  g/mol.  Docetaxel  is  a white to off-white powder, which is highly hygroscopic and highly lipophilic. At 25  C, docetaxel is freely  soluble  in  ethanol  and  tetrahydrofuran,  soluble  in  methanol,  acetone  and  ethyl  acetate, sparingly  soluble  in  acetonitrile  and  insoluble  in  n-hexane  and  water.  There  is  no  Ph.Eur. monograph for anhydrous docetaxel, however a Ph.Eur. monograph exists for docetaxel trihydrate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel  has  eleven  chiral  centres  and  one  stereoisomer,  epi-docetaxel  (7-epi-docetaxel). Docetaxel exhibits polymorphism. The manufacturing conditions have been chosen to ensure that docetaxel is always produced as a single crystalline morphological form. It is noted that the active substance used in the reference medicinal product is the trihydrate form. However given that both medicinal products aim to deliver the active substance in solution, the active substance in Docefrez and in the reference medicinal product are considered equivalent.

The chemical structure of docetaxel has been confirmed by elemental analysis, ultra-violet (UV) spectra, infrared (IR) spectra, mass spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). All data are consistent with the proposed structure.

-  Manufacture

The  manufacture  of  docetaxel  consists  of  an  eight-step  process.  Detailed  information  about  the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and  intermediates  and  process  development  and  process  validation  of  the  active  substance  has been supplied in the form of an active substance master file (ASMF). At the time of the opinion, only one active substance manufacturer is used. All manufacturing steps are adequately described. Adequate in-process controls are in place and appropriate specifications have been adopted for the starting  materials,  solvents  and  reagents.  All  relevant  impurities,  degradation  products  and residual solvents have been appropriately characterised.

The test parameters evaluated in these studies were appearance, specific rotation, assay, purity, residual solvents, water content, bacterial endotoxins and microbial count. The packaging used in stability  trials  is  identical  to  that  proposed  for  market.  The  stability  data  provided  justify  the proposed retest period at the proposed storage conditions.

Medicinal product no longer authorised  Specification As for anhydrous docetaxel no monograph exists in the Ph. Eur. or USP, in-house specifications have been set for the active substance, in accordance with the principles of ICH guidelines. The specification  has  been  harmonised  to  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  for  docetaxel  trihydrate  where possible.  The  active  substance  specifications  of  the  MAH  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  active substance manufacturer. The  active  substance  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance,  identifications  (IR spectra  and  HPLC),  assay  and  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  water  content (Karl  Fischer  and  coulometry),  specific  optical  rotation,  heavy  metals,  bacterial  endotoxins, microbial limit and residue on ignition/sulphated ash. The analytical procedures have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety. Batch analysis data and Certificates of Analysis have been presented and all batches were in compliance with the predefined active substance specification.  Stability Stability  studies  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  requirements  for  substances intended to be stored under refrigeration. Long-term stability data (at 5 ± 3  C, 60 ± 5% RH) and accelerated  stability  data  (at  25  ±  2  C/60  ±  5  %  RH)  have  been  provided  for  four  pilot  scale batches of the active substance.  In addition to this, forced degradation studies were performed to determine  the  stability  of  the  active  substance  at  4,  25,  50  and  75  C  for  4  weeks  in  different environments.  Furthermore,  studies  were  performed  to  determine  the  stability  of  the  active substance in oxygen and nitrogen at various temperatures (25, 50 or 75  C during 4 weeks) and to determine  the  stability  of  the  active  substance  in  solution  at  pH  2,  5  and  7  at  various temperatures. In addition, a photostability study was also performed in line with ICH Q1B, which indicated that the active substance  is slightly photosensitive  in the solid  state  and  very photosensitive in solution form.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Pharmaceutical Development

The medicinal product Docefrez 20 mg and 80 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is a generic (hybrid) version of the reference medicinal product Taxotere concentrate and solvent for infusion 20 mg/0.5 ml and 80 mg/2 ml, respectively.

The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic (hybrid) medicinal product that contains the same active substance (but in a different hydrate form) and that is intended for the  same  indications,  dosage  regimens  and  route  of  administration  as  the  reference  medicinal product Taxotere, without infringement upon composition patents held by the innovator company. Two strengths of Docefrez have been developed; 20 mg and 80 mg, both having a very similar qualitative composition compared to the reference product.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Docefrez differs from the reference medicinal product with respect to pharmaceutical form of the finished  product  and  the  hydrate  form  of  the  active  substance.  Taxotere  contains  docetaxel trihydrate and the active substance is presented as a concentrate in polysorbate 80 intended for dilution in ethanol in water for injections (solvent provided in a separate vial) prior to subsequent dilution in a suitable infusion solution. Docefrez contains anhydrous docetaxel and is presented as a powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. The powder vial contains docetaxel and  the  solvent  vial  contains  polysorbate  80  and  anhydrous  ethanol.  Docefrez  contains  more ethanol than the reference medicinal product. The higher ethanol content in Docefrez is considered not relevant as Docefrez is to be diluted into an infusion bag before administration to the patient. The concentration of docetaxel in the reconstituted (premix) solution is also different for Docefrez and the reference medicinal product. After reconstitution, Taxotere 20 and 80 mg results in a 10 mg/ml premix, whereas Docefrez 20 and 80 mg results in a 24 mg/ml docetaxel premix solution. The docetaxel concentration in the reconstituted (premix) solution is adequately reflected in the SmPC, PL and preparation guide for health care professionals. By applying overfill on the powder vial, it is ensured that the volume which is extracted from the premix solution contains the appropriate amount of docetaxel. For the 20 mg strength, the minimal extractable volume from the premix solution is 0.84 ml containing 20 mg docetaxel (anhydrous). For the 80 mg strength, the minimal extractable volume from the premix solution is 3.36 ml containing 80 mg docetaxel (anhydrous). This is reflected in the SmPC and preparation guide. During development, the MAH focussed mainly on obtaining a stable and sterile formulation. In the stability studies, the MAH demonstrated compatibility of the active substance with the excipients. All  of  the  excipients  are used commonly in parenteral products and stability data are considered acceptable. Adequate compatibility studies have been performed to show compatibility and stability of the premix and after dilution with the infusion solutions proposed in the SmPC.

Docefrez is to be administered as a non-aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance  in  the  same  concentration  as  the  currently  authorised  reference  product  Taxotere (following reconstitution) at the point of administration.    The  Note  for  Guidance  on  the Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence,  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98),  states  that  the applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study if the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as  the  currently  authorised  product,  however  this  is  a  non-aqueous  solution  and  no  specific guidance is  given.  The  MAH  provided  reports  of  several in  vitro pharmaceutical studies and two non-clinical  studies  to  compare  the  proposed  Docefrez  product  with  the  reference  product, Taxotere.  All  of  these  studies  support  the  claim  that  the  proposed  product  is  equivalent pharmaceutically to the reference product and therefore that the proposed biowaiver is acceptable.

##  Adventitious Agents

No component of human or animal origin is used for the finished product manufacture; therefore there is no BSE/TSE risk. BSE/TSE declarations from the active substance manufacturer and the manufacturers of the excipients are provided.

##  Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process of Docefrez has been confirmed as a two-step filling process and has been adequately described and validated. All critical process parameters have been identified and are controlled by appropriate in-process controls. The manufacturing process is demonstrated to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reproducible and provides a finished product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications.

-  Product Specification

The medicinal product specifications for Docefrez at batch release include the following tests on the powder vial: tests for description, identification (HPLC and IR), water content, reconstitution time, uniformity  of  dosage  units,  visual  inspection,  transmittance  and  absorbance  of  the  constituted solution,  related  substances,  residual  solvent  (ethanol),  assay,  particulate  matter,  sterility  and bacterial  endotoxin.  The  specifications  for  the  solvent  vial  include  tests  for:  description,  ethanol identification and content, transmittance and absorbance of the solvent, volume in container and volume  variation,  particulate  matter,  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins.  All  tests  included  in  the specification  have  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated.  Appropriate  data  have  been presented to justify the release specifications for each quality characteristic that is controlled. All excipients used in the formulation comply with the monographs of the current Ph.Eur. Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of  safety.  Batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  proposed  specification  and  confirm  consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

<!-- image -->

Docefrez is a hybrid medicical product, meaning that the pharmaceutical form is different from the reference  medicinal  product;  Taxotere.  The  qualitative  composition  is  very  similar;  however  the quantitative composition with respect to the excipients is different from Taxotere. It is noted that Docefrez  contains  more  ethanol  than  Taxotere.  In  addition,  the  docetaxel  concentration  of  the premix solution obtained after reconstitution is different from the reference medicinal product. This was determined to be acceptable considering that the volume of Docefrez premix solution that can be  extracted  from  the  vial  after  reconstitution  of  the  Docefrez  20  mg  (or  80  mg)  presentation contains 20 mg docetaxel (or 80 mg respectively).

Medicinal product no longer authorised  Stability of the Product Stability studies have been carried out under long term (5 ± 3  C) and accelerated (25 ± 2  C/60 ± 5 % RH) conditions according to the ICH requirements. Long term stability data up to 36 months and accelerated stability data up to 6 months have been provided. All batches placed on stability studies were manufactured at the proposed site of finished product manufacture, according to the proposed  process  and  using  active  substance  obtained  from  the  proposed  active  substance manufacturer. All batches were packaged as proposed for marketing. The parameters tested and analytical methods used were identical to those used for the release specifications. However, some release tests were not repeated at the end of shelf-life. Furthermore, a photostability study was performed on one batch of the 80 mg presentation, in accordance with ICH Q1B and at 25 ± 2  C. The  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  for  the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC. The MAH confirmed that the first three batches of both strengths (20 mg and 80 mg) will be placed on stability trials in line with the ICH guidance to confirm the shelf-life. In accordance with GMP, the MAH confirmed to investigate  any  out  of  specification  result  in  stability  data  and  report  any  such  result  to  the competent authorities. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects The quality of Docefrez is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical  documentation  has  been  submitted  for  marketing  authorisation.  There  are  no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements. Information  on  the  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  drug product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  batch  testing  indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

The CHMP concluded that the observed differences between Docefrez and Taxotere are minor and are  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  no unresolved quality issues having impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

The Applicant has submitted a non-clinical overview which is based on a literature review including 32  publications  up  to  2008.  In  addition  three  non-clinical  studies  have  been  submitted:  a pharmacology study (comparative efficacy vs. reference product in mice), a pharmacokinetic study (comparative plasma concentration study in the rat) and a toxicological study (comparative acute toxicity study in mice of docetaxel containing the 7-epimer impurity and Taxotere). All submitted studies were conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP.

## Pharmacology

## Mechanism of action

Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting (rate and extent) the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly preventing their depolymerization. The  consequences  of  blocking  microtubule  dynamics  are  complex:  a  number  of  vital  cellular functions  in  which  microtubules  play  a  critical  role  are  compromised.    Impairment  of  mitotic progression  leading  to  cell  cycle  arrest  is  considered  to  be  a  principal  component  of  docetaxel's mechanism  of  action.    This  blocks  progression  of  a  cell  through  its  natural  division  cycle,  and consequently, inhibits cell proliferation.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Docetaxel produces changes in cell shape including alteration of the cytoskeleton morphology. It was found that the amount of tubulin was increased in KB 3-1 human epidermoid carcinoma cells treated  by  both  paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  before  the  accumulation  of  cells  in  the  G2/M  phase. Docetaxel leads to the formation of bundles and asters in KB 3-1 cells and in J82 human bladder carcinoma  cells,  and  accumulates  cells  in  the  G2/M  phase  leading  to  an  inability  of  the  cells  to divide.  In  HeLa  synchronised  cells,  docetaxel  and  paclitaxel  are  active  during  the  S  phase. Docetaxel does not inhibit  synthesis  of  DNA,  RNA  or  protein  using  P388  leukemia cells.  Higher potency of docetaxel observed in vitro may be explained by the combination of its higher affinity for  microtubules,  its  higher  achievable  intracellular  concentration  and  the  slower  cellular  efflux. Docetaxel primarily targets centrosome organisation, leading to abortive mitosis and cell death. In vitro it is almost totally lethal to cells exposed during S phase, with only partial toxicity against cell sin mitosis and this declines to a minimum with progression to G1.  Exposure during S phase does not delay progression to G2 but leads to gross damage after mitosis with dysfunction in cytokinesis and accumulation of multinucleated, non-viable cells. Disruption of microtubules not only affects progression through the cell cycle, but may also alter signalling pathways involved in processes such as apoptosis and docetaxel has been reported to promote  apoptosis  in  cancer  cells.  Several  signal  transduction  pathways  may  be  involved  in docetaxel's effects on apoptosis and the Bcl -gene family in particular appears to play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. Inhibition of Bcl-2 induces apoptosis, whereas overexpression of Bcl2  prevents  or  delays  apoptosis  (enhancing  cell  survival)  and  may  be  a  factor  relating  to chemotherapeutic  drug  resistance.  Consequently,  down  regulation  of  Bcl-2  expression  has  been investigated as a strategy for reversal of resistance. Antimicrotubule agents are believed to cause inactivation of Bcl-2 function through phosphorylation.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways present one of those that feed into processes affected by docetaxel, that is, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Members of the EGFR family (e.g.,  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptors  HER-1  and  HER-2)  and  their  signalling pathways influence cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Signals are transmitted from the cell surface to the cell nucleus via a variety of downstream effector proteins such as Ras and MAP kinase. HER-1 is overexpressed in a wide range of tumours, especially SCCHN, where it is associated with poor prognosis. HER-2 is also overexpressed in many tumour types, in particular, breast cancer (30% of tumours).  HER-2 overexpression imparts a metastatic advantage to the cell and is associated with impaired survival in the patient.

Tumour angiogenesis is a critical component of tumour growth and metastasis and targeting of the vascular  supply  of  tumours  is  an  intense  field  of  interest,  with  many  promising  preclinical  trials highlighting  the  potential  effectiveness  of  this  form  of  therapy.  Endothelial  cell  migration  and proliferation are key components of tumour angiogenesis, and agents that target the microtubule cytoskeleton can interfere with these processes. It has been demonstrated that docetaxel inhibits endothelial  cell  migration  and  angiogenesis in  vitro and in  vivo . In  vitro this  was  achieved  at concentrations  substantially  below  those  that  inhibited  the  proliferation  of  the  cells  or  caused alterations in their shape or viability. The effects of docetaxel on migration were associated with a reduction in the reorientation of the cell's centrosome, at concentrations that did not affect gross microtubule  morphology  or  proliferation.  Results  of  these in  vitro studies  demonstrate  that

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endothelial cell migration correlates more closely with changes in microtubule plasticity than with microtubule  gross  structure. In  vivo ,  angiogenic  response  to  fibroblast  growth  factor  2  was inhibited in vivo by docetaxel with an ID50 of 5.4 mg/kg when injected twice weekly over a 14-day period, and angiogenesis was completely blocked in mice that received 10 mg/kg docetaxel. In vivo data  further  suggested  that  docetaxel  had  selectivity  for  endothelial  cell  migration  and/or microvessel formation because infiltration of inflammatory cells into the Matrigel plug was much less  sensitive  to  inhibition  by  docetaxel.  Thus,  docetaxel  is  a  potent  and  potentially  specific inhibitor  of  endothelial  cell  migration in vitro and  angiogenesis in vitro and in  vivo .  The antiangiogenic effect of docetaxel is four times stronger than that of paclitaxel and enhancement of antiangiogenic properties of docetaxel through inhibition of endogenous angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) demands further investigation.

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

Docetaxel  has  been  shown  to  have  significant  inhibitory  activity  against  cell  lines  P388  (murine leukaemia),  KB  (epidermoid  carcinoma),  CEM  (acute  lumphoblastic  leukaemia),  N417  (small-cell lung  carcinoma),  and  24  (bladder  carcinoma).  It  also  has in  vitro cytotoxicity  in  murine  (P388, SVras) and human cell lines (Calc18, HCT116, T24, N417, and KB). Docetaxel's activity against freshly explanted human tumour cells has been demonstrated. Breast, lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and melanomas have also been found to be responsive to docetaxel. It has a lesser degree of  activity  against  Lewis  lung  carcinoma,  Glasgow  osteogenic  sarcoma  and  the  L1210  and  P388 leukemias.  Docetaxel  is  reported  to  have  a  significant  concentration-dependent  effect  on  the frequency  of  growth-inhibition  in  breast  cancer,  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  melanoma,  ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Docetaxel  is  thus  cytotoxic  against  both  murine  and  human  tumour  cell  lines in  vitro ,  with  the latter being most drug sensitive. The concentration of docetaxel required to reduce cell survival by 50% (IC50) ranged from 4 to 35 ng/ml, and the cytotoxic effects were greater on proliferating than  non-proliferating  cells,  being  both  time-  and  concentration-dependent.  The  AUC  values required  for  50%  kill  of  tumour  cells in  vitro were  much  lower  (0.4-3.4  µg/ml.h)  than  the pharmacologically achievable AUC values in mice at non-toxic dosage both in plasma (17 µg/ml.h) and  in  tumour  (44  µg/ml.h).    Thus,  docetaxel  achieves  concentrations  in  plasma  and  tumours which are much greater than is required for 50% kill of tumour cells. Docetaxel's in vivo antitumour activity was investigated using transplantable tumours and found to have wide spectrum efficacy. It was highly active against B16 melanoma model (producing a total log-cell kill of 3, which is 2.7 times greater than that achieved with paclitaxel in the same system) and against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 03 and colon adenocarcinoma 38, producing total 100% cures in early-stage disease and greater than 80% complete regressions in advanced-stage disease.    Colon  adenocarcinoma  51/A,  early  and  advanced  stages,  was  also  highly  sensitive  to docetaxel, while other cell lines were less responsive. Docetaxel is active against three colon tumours. The most responsive is the 5-FU sensitive colon 38  with  100%  cure  rate  of  early  stage  disease,  and  complete  regressions  of  advanced  stage tumours. It is also active against the slow-growing, mucin-producing, adenocarcinoma colon 51 at both  early  and  advanced  stage.  Modest  activity  was  found  against  the  undifferentiated  colon adenocarcinoma  26.  Pancreatoc  ductal  adenocarcinoma  is  another  tumour  very  sensitive  to docetaxel.

Docetaxel has been shown active against several murine breast cancer cell lines :

-Mice  bearing  early  stage  MA16/C  (fast  growing  metastatic  adenocarcinoma)  tumours  were treated using a 2 days x 3 schedule. At the highest non-toxic dose (15 mg/kg/injection), docetaxel was found to be highly active with a 0% T/C value corresponding to a 2.4 log cell kill. Against advanced stage MA16/C (tumour burden ranging from 126 to 395 mg, with a median of 190 mg) using  the  same  schedule.  The  highest  non-toxic  dose  was  10.8  mg/kg/injection,  and  produced 100% complete regressions.

- Docetaxel was administered on an every 2 days x 3 schedule to mice bearing early stage MA13/C tumours. The highest non-toxic dose (14.2 mg/kg/injection) produced a 0% T/C value with a 4.3 log cell kill. At an advanced stage (tumour burden ranged from 200 to 320 mg), the highest nontoxic  dose  (15  mg/kg/injection),  administered  on  an  every  3  days  x  3  schedule,  yielded  60% complete regressions with a 2.5 log cell kill.

- At the highest non-toxic dose (15 mg/kg/injection), administered on days 4, 6 and 8 post-tumour implantation of mammary 17/A cells, docetaxel was found to be highly active, with a 0% T/C value

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and a 2.8 log cell kill.

-  For  the  mammary  adenocarcinoma  17/A,  doxorubicin  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  parent  tumour MA17/A. The resistant tumour MA17/A/Adr is 4-fold less sensitive based on log cell kill.  At the highest  non-toxic  dose,  docetaxel  (22.5  mg/kg/injection)  was  found  to  be  cross-resistant  with MA17/A/Adr, with a 74% T/C value.

- At the highest non-toxic dose (22 mg/kg/injection), the T/C value indicated very minor docetaxel activity on mammary adenocarcinoma 44, which has marginal sensitivity to doxorubicin.

- A slow growing adenocarcinoma, it was established in mice using 10 7  cells per mouse, and was then propagated was found to be highly active on palpable Calc18 and yielded a 2.1 log cell kill at the highest non-toxic dose. The mammary MX-1 cell line is a carcinoma that is sensitive to L-Pam. The  highest  non-toxic  dose  of  docetaxel  produced  100%  complete  regressions  of  tumours  that weighed approximately 320 mg when treatment was initiated. There was no recurrence up to 84 days posttumour implantation.

In  order  to  support  the  claim  that  the  differences  in  formulation  of  the  proposed  and  reference products do not impact on the behaviour of the product the Applicant submitted an in vivo study comparing the efficacy of  Docefrez  versus  the reference  product  Taxotere.  The  model  used  was based  on  a  human  mammary  carcinoma  xenograph  in  athymic  nude  mice.  Docefrez  was administered in tumour bearing mice at a dose of 15mg/kg with a dosing regimen of 3 repeated injections  (day  0,  4  and  8).  The  results  indicate  that  both  Docefrez  and  Taxotere  showed antitumour activity at the end of the 38 day study. The efficacy and toxicity profile of Docefrez was comparable to the reference product.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Pharmacodynamic drug interactions In  combination  chemotherapy,  choice  of  agents  was  guided  by  the  clinical  activity  observed  in phase II trials in breast, ovarian, and lung tumours: doxorubicin (breast), 5-fluorouracil (breast), cyclophosphamide  (breast,  lung,  ovarian),  cisplatin  (ovarian,  lung),  etoposide  (small  cell  lung cancer),  vinca  alkaloids  (breast  lung),  methotrexate  (breast),  and  mitomycin  C  (lung).  When selecting agents it is standard practice to combine agents with different mechanisms of action. In in vivo studies of mice bearing s.c. transplanted tumours, certain combinations of docetaxel with other antitumour agents produced a modest to marked synergistic effect with: vincristine (against P388), vinorelbine (against MA16/C), navelbine, etoposide (against B16 melanoma), cyclophosphamide (against MA13/C), mitomycin C (against MA13/C) and 5-FU (against colon 38). Synergistic  effects  have  been  noted  with  docetaxel  and  cyclophosphamide  against  MA13/C mammary  adenocarcinoma  with  a  33%  cure  rate.  These  agents  have  different  mechanisms  of action and have been proven not to demonstrate cross-resistance or is only partial in vivo on B16 melanoma. But cross resistance was noted in vitro using a P388/Adr cell line and using an in vivo mammary  adenocarcinoma  resistant  to  doxorubicin  (MA17/A/Adr).  However,  absence  of  crossresistance was shown using cells that expressed low levels of vincristine or etoposide resistance, but which were P-glycoprotein positive, and previously cited Susa/VPC3 and Susa/VPC4, indicating that in vitro cross-resistance was not automatically observed in sublines expressing the multidrug resistance phenotype.

The combination of docetaxel and etoposide also demonstrated therapeutic synergism against B16 melanoma. Furthermore, absence of cross-resistance was also observed both in  vivo in  the  B16 melanoma  model  resistant  to  docetaxel  and  in  two in  vitro cell  lines  selected  for  low  levels  of etoposide resistance.

The combination of trastuzumab with docetaxel against four HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cell  lines  resulted  in  combination  index  values  ranging  from  0.30  (95%  CI  =  0.04  to  0.56; p&lt;0.001)  in  SK-BR-3  cells  to  0.62  (95%  CI  =  0.29  to  0.95;  p&lt;0.001)  in  MDA-MB-453  cells, indicating  synergism.    Cell  lines  with  higher  HER-2  levels  (SK-BR-3  and  BT-474)  had  lower combination  index  values  than  cell  lines  with  lower  HER-2  levels,  indicating  enhanced  synergy against  tumour  cell  with  higher  HER-2  overexpression.    Further  to  these in  vitro results,  the combination had statistically significant increased antitumour efficacy in vivo against MCF-7/HER2overexpressng xenografts compared with either single agent alone, and there was an increase in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

durable complete responses in mice treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab compared with mice treated with either single agent alone.

In terms of toxicity, the combination toxicity index (CTI, the sum of the fractions of the LD10 of each  agent)  ranged  from  0.75  for  the  most  toxic  combination  (docetaxelcisplatin),  indicating complete  overlap  in  dose-limiting  toxicity,  to  a  CTI  index  of  2  for  the  least  toxic  combination, docetaxel-vincristine  (simultaneously  administered).  Thus,  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  of  each agent could be administered without additional toxicity. The most aggressive combinations were found to be docetaxel cisplatin and docetaxel-mitomycin C. The optimal doses of each agent that could be administered in the highest non-toxic combinations were 43% and 50%, respectively. But it should be noted that there was no hyperhydration for the docetaxel-cisplatin combination which is a deviation to standard clinical practice.

The  vinca  alkaloids  share  the  same  target,  that  is,  tubulin-microtubule  system,  either  inhibiting tubulin polymerisation in the case of the vinca alkaloids or inhibiting microtubule depolymerisation in case of taxoids.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Dexamethasone  was  administered  s.c.  simultaneously  with  docetaxel  i.v.  every  2  days  for  3 injections  in  mice  bearing  s.c.  B16  melanoma.  Dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg/dose) dose was the highest  that  could  be  administered  safely  on  a  chronic  schedule  (8.6%  body  weight  loss). Docetaxel administered as a single agent produced 15.3% body weight loss and 2.0 log cell kill at the highest non-toxic dose (20 mg/kg/injection). The highest non-toxic dose of docetaxel using the dexamethasone/docetaxel  concomitant  regimen  was  unchanged  (20  mg/kg/injection).    This combination  produced  a  16.7%  body  weight  loss  at  nadir,  and  thus  premedication  to  prevent hypersensitivity  reactions  did  not  influence  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  and  the  efficacy  was similar at all the dose levels tested. Resistance Resistance  to  the  cytotoxic  actions  of  docetaxel  may  occur  owing  to  alterations  in  tubulin  or increased  expression  of  the  multidrug-resistant  gene  and  subsequent  overproduction  of  the  Pglycoprotein. Acquired resistance to taxoids in vitro is likely either due to multidrug resistance phenotype related to overproduction of P-glycoprotein, or that due to tubulin alteration. Human breast adenocarcinoma cells resistant to docetaxel (Calc18/TXT), which overexpress the MDRI gene and have decreased β -tubulin mRNA levels compared with parental cells, are 15 times less sensitive to docetaxel  and  are  also  highly  cross-resistant  to  vinblastine.  However,  cross-resistance  to  other agents is either moderate (doxorubicin and cisplatin (resistance factor ≤ 3)) or absent (camptothecin or 5-FU). Although docetaxel and paclitaxel are structurally similar, docetaxel is still able to inhibit tumour cell replication of paclitaxel resistant J744.2 murine macrophage cells.

Determinants of innate resistance are likely to occur  at the level of  MAPs.  Differences in MAPs (e.g., in murine mammary tumours, that is sensitive MA16/C, MA13/C and poorly sensitive MA44 to docetaxel in vivo ) may account for the differences in docetaxel tumour sensitivity and intrinsic insensitivity in murine mammary tumours in vivo .

Cross-resistance to docetaxel has been observed in several multidrug resistant sublines.  But it is not likely that cross-resistance to docetaxel is automatically observed in cell sublines that express the  MDR  phenotype.  Furthermore,  a  lack  of  cross-resistance  was  noted  with  5-FU  in  colon COLO/5FU-R  and  LOVO/5FU-R,  and  with  cisplatin  in  ovarian  41McisR,  CH1cisR,  and  OVCAR3carboR.

Reversal  of  resistance  to  docetaxel  has  been  examined  in  human  myeloma  cell  lines,  in  which some chemosensitisers have proven to be useful.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Evaluation  of  preclinical  pharmacokinetics  of  docetaxel  in  non-tumour  bearing  mice  and  mice bearing colon adenocarcinoma 38 demonstrate that after bolus doses, the decline in docetaxel's concentration  is  biexponential,  with  the  maximum  plasma  concentration  proportional  to  the administered dose and there is a linear relationship between dose and area under the curve (AUC). At all tested doses, drug concentrations in tumour were higher than the inhibitory concentration in 50% (IC50) of KB (epidermoid carcinoma) and T24 (bladder carcinoma) tumour cell lines studied.

In mice bearing colon adenocarcinoma, the disposal of docetaxel was biphasic, with half-lives of 7 min and  1.2 h, respectively. Docetaxel displayed linear pharmacokinetics,  peak  plasma concentration  and  AUCp  increased  in  proportion  to  the  administered  dose.  At  the  optimal  single i.v. dose of 37 mg/kg, the plasma total body clearance averaged 2.2 l/h/kg. The AUCp at doses of 13 -62 mg/kg ranged from 4.5 to 29.6 µg/ml.h.

After i.v. administration of a highly active 111 mg/m 2  dose, the plasma pharmacokinetics in normal B6D2F1 mice and in colon adenocarcinoma 38 tumour-bearing mice were similar. Pharmacokinetic parameters  of  docetaxel  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  after  single  dose  and  as  unlabeled  product  are presented in Table 1.

Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Docetaxel in Mice, Rats and Dogs  (Single Dose, Unlabeled Product)

a Extrapolated value (bolus administration)

Medicinal product no longer authorised

In mice, docetaxel showed a good proportionality of plasma Cmax, plasma AUC and tumour AUC values with i.v. administered doses of 39 to 186 mg/m 2 .

b Concentration at the first sampling time, that is, 2 min post end of infusion (10 min duration) In the rat, plasma docetaxel half-lives were comparable to those in the mouse: 0.014-0.21 h for the first  phase  and  0.78=1.66 h for the second phase.  For doses above 15 to 60 mg/m 2 , AUC increased proportionally from 0.6 to 2.5 µg.h/ml.  However, at 120 mg/m 2  the increase was more than proportional (9.4 µg.h/ml).

In  order  to  support  the  claim  that  the  differences  in  formulation  of  the  proposed  and  reference products  do  not  impact  on  the  behaviour  of  the  product  the  Applicant  submitted  an in  vivo comparative plasma concentration study of Docefrez versus Taxotere in male Spague Dawley rats. The  results  suggest  that  the  docetaxel  concentration  levels  in  plasma  after  administration  of Docefrez and Taxotere were comparable and the differences in the drug concentrations were not statistically  significant.  The  comparable plasma  levels  indicate  that drug release from micelles is similar from Docefrez and Taxotere.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Kinetic studies of radiolabelled docetaxel disposal in mice demonstrated that it is rapidly distributed with an apparent distribution half-life of 10 min.  Plasma protein binding ranged from 76 to 89%. Tissue uptake of radiolabelled docetaxel is rapid, especially in the liver, bile, intestine and gastric contents,  as  well  as  in  haematopoietic  tissues,  muscle,  the  salivary  glands  and  pancreas.  But docetaxel was not found in the CNS.

The highest mean tissue concentrations of docetaxel after i.v. administration are observed in the heart and the liver (26.1 ± 7.8 and 25.3 ± 26.1) as compared to that after i.p. administration in the abdominal wall and colon (23.6 ± 15.1 and 21.7 ± 5.7), respectively. These differences post i.v. and i.p. administration are statistically significant in the heart  (p=0.0079),  stomach (p=0.0159), colon (p=0.0159) and abdominal wall (p=0.0079).

At all doses, tumour docetaxel levels were considerably higher than the IC50 values of cytotoxicity in tumour cell cultures, up to 24 h after administration.  This long exposure of tumour tissue may be  an  essential  factor  for  docetaxel  activity  in  human  patients,  where  plasma  exposure  at therapeutic doses is in the same range as in the mouse (4.7 µg.h/ml at 100 mg/m 2 ).

In vivo metabolism studies in the mouse, the rat, the rabbit and the dog did not indicate any major species or gender differences in the metabolic pathway. The main enzymes involved in docetaxel metabolism are monooxygenases (phase I enzymes).  Studies in rat liver microsomes and in the isolated  perfused  rat  liver  also  indicated  a  major  role  of  CYP3A  in  this  species.  Metabolism  of docetaxel was also found to be similar in rat, pig, minipig and human liver microsomes and cDNAexpressed  P450  enzymes  leading  to  similar  products  of  metabolism  through  CYP3A  orthologs. Docetaxel  is  oxidised  to  metabolites  that  are  less  antineoplastic  than  the  parent  drug  and  the antineoplastic  effects  of  taxanes  observed in  vivo were  concluded  to  be  apparently  related  to metabolic rates rather than metabolic profiles.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In vivo plasma protein binding of the radiolabelled compound was high in mice and rats (from 84.1 to 89.1% at 0.25 h).  Binding to plasma proteins in vitro was also high in mouse (8995 %), rat (70-76%),  dog  (83-89%)  and  man  (79-83%).    Among  human  plasma  proteins,  it  was  mainly bound  to  albumin  and α 1-acid  glycoprotein  (AAG),  the  association  with  the  latter  might  be concentration dependent. Docetaxel  is  found  to  be  active  i.p  and  i.v.  against  s.c.  implanted  tumours,  indicating  that  it crosses physiological barriers well. But it is inactive by the p.o. route, probably as a result of deesterification and cleavage of the molecule at the acidic pH of the stomach. Metabolism Hepatic  metabolism  and  biliary  excretion  is  the  major  pathway  of  docetaxel  elimination  in  all species.  Only a minor fraction of the dose is excreted in the form of parent drug. In the mouse, docetaxel is almost completely metabolised. Only a minor fraction (&lt;20%) of the parent drug is eliminated unchanged in the mouse, dog and rat excreta, rat bile and human faeces. Docetaxel is primarily metabolised by successive oxidation of the tert-butyl ester group on the side chain,  with  cyclisation  occurring  for  the  aldehyde  and  acid  derivatives  with  the  resultant  alcohol derivative being the most abundant metabolite. A minor pathway is caused by 7epimerisation.

## Excretion

Following  rapid  tissue  uptake  (especially  in  liver  and  kidneys),  the  elimination  of  docetaxel  in normal  tissues  is  biphasic  with  terminal  half-lives  ranging  from  2.2  to  4.5  h.    However  the elimination half-live of docetaxel from tumour sites is approximately 22 h, suggesting long tumour site retention and thus very slow elimination. At a dose of 37 mg/kg, AUCt, and plasma AUC in the tumour values were 84 µg/g.h and 17 µg/ml.h, respectively.  For a 111 mg/m 2  dose, elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

half-life tumour levels of docetaxel were noted to be 1.29 µg/g even 24 hrs after administration. This high affinity of docetaxel for tumour tissue in vivo is consistent with that for tumour cells in vitro and the observation of a slow efflux.

Studies of radiolabelled docetaxel in mice and dogs showed the drug's elimination to be primarily biliary  and  hepatic,  while  urinary  excretion  was  less  than  10%  and  pulmonary  excretion  was negligible.    Biliary  excretion  accounted  for  75%  of  the  dose,  in  three  major  metabolites. Radioactivity was detected in all tissues except the CNS. Several metabolites, each representing less than 2% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine.

## Toxicology

Preclinical  general  toxicology  studies  of  docetaxel  have  been  carried  out  in  Beagle  dogs,  CD2F1 mice and rats.

## Single dose toxicity

Medicinal product no longer authorised Single i.v. dose studies (X1) or once daily i.v. dosing of docetaxel for 5 days (X5) demonstrated dog  to  be  the  most  sensitive  species  to  the  toxic  effects  of  docetaxel.  In  single  dose  studies, docetaxel  principally  affected  tissues  with  a  high  cell  turnover  such  as  the  gastrointestinal epithelium  (dog),  haematopoietic  and  lymphatic  organs  (all  species),  and  testis  (rodents). Hemopoietic toxicity, including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, and involution of the lymphoid organs, was consistently observed in all three species. The dose limiting toxicities were digestive tract lesions, and myelosuppression associated with peripheral leucopenia. Hypotension was also observed in the dog but this was attributed to polysorbate 80.  When single dose  (X1)  and  X5  schedules  were  compared,  similar  cumulative  haematopoietic  toxicity  was observed with the 5 day schedule. Neurotoxicity was present in mice only, and testicular toxicity occurred in both mice and rats. In dogs,  gastrointestinal  effects  were  the  dose-limiting  toxicity.  In  dogs,  single  doses  of  70  or  50 mg/m 2  were severely toxic and/or lethal.  In rats, mortality occurred following single doses of 120 mg/m 2   of  docetaxel  and  above.    A  single  dose  of  60  mg/m 2 was  the  'highest  non-lethal  dose' (HNLD).  The  single-dose  LD50  in  mice  was  414  mg/m 2   and  the  HNLD  was  285  mg/m 2 . Haematopoietic toxicity was cumulative in both mice and dogs, as were testicular and neuromotor changes  in  mice  and  lethal  digestive  toxicity  in  dogs.  Haematopoietic  toxicity  was  reversible, neurotoxicity was partially reversible and testicular effects were not reversible within the 28 day recovery period following treatment. Animal toxicology failed to show evidence of fluid retention or increased capillary permeability. Repeat-dose toxicity Multiple-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys, given docetaxel at 21-day intervals for 10,  10,  and  12  courses,  respectively,  showed  no  evidence  of  increased  incidence  or  severity  of adverse effects with successive treatment courses. No local irritation was observed at the injection site  during  single,  5-day,  and  intermittent-dose  animal  studies.  The  intravenous  formulation  of docetaxel does not possess significant sensitisation or vesicular potential.

Five-day cumulative toxicity studies in mice and dogs indicated that the incidence and severity of adverse effects at cumulative dose levels were comparable to those at corresponding single-dose levels. The cumulative 5-day LD50 in mice was 450 mg/m 2 , which correlates with the single dose LD50 of 414 mg/m 2 . In dogs, GI toxicity and leucopenia of cumulative daily doses were of severity corresponding  to  comparable  single-dose  levels:  five  daily  doses  of  6  mg/m 2 produced  adverse effects comparable  to  those  following a single dose  of 30  mg/m 2 . Administration as  an intermittent-dose regimen should allow for resolution of hemopoietic adverse effects and minimise cumulative toxicity. Furthermore results of intermittent-dose studies demonstrated that docetaxel may be administered for up to 12 treatment courses without increasing the severity of principal (particularly haematopoietic) toxicities.

## Genotoxicity

In  mutagenicity  tests,  docetaxel  was  found  to  have  no  effect  on  five  strains  of Salmonella typhimurium or  on  one  strain of Escherichia coli .  Genotoxicity tests indicated that docetaxel was non-mutagenic  and  non-clastogenic.  However, in  vitro and in  vivo ,  docetaxel  has  produced  an increase in the number of micronucleated, aneuploid and polyploidy cells, which can be interpreted

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a mutagenic potential. Docetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. It did not induce mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay.

## Carcinogenicity

No studies have been submitted.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Foetal toxicity was observed in rats administered maternally toxic doses of docetaxel. A significant reduction in the number of corpora lutea and implantations, litter size and number of live births was reported. Treatment of pregnant rats and rabbits with daily doses up to 1.8 mg/m 2  and 2.4 mg/m 2 ,  respectively,  during  the  organogenesis  phase  of  gestation  demonstrated  that  docetaxel increases post-implantation loss, reduces fetal weight, and delays fetal ossification. In rabbits, 2.4 mg/m 2 /day was lethal to most of the dams and a dose of 1.2 mg/m 2 produced marked maternal toxicity. External, skeletal or visceral malformations were not reported, suggesting that docetaxel was embryo- and fetotoxic but not teratogenic.

Adverse effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair male fertility.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Medicinal product no longer authorised Studies on impurities The Applicant has submitted an in vivo study in mice to compare the acute toxicity after a single i.v. dose of Docetaxel for injection with 1% 7-epimer impurity, the vehicle control and Taxotere. A total  of  20  male  and  20  female  mice  per  group  were  dosed  at  40  or  80mg/kg.  The  route  of administration was i.v. which is the proposed clinical route. Doses were selected on the basis of the reported  human  MTD  at  115mg/m 2 which  when  converted to  the  dose  in  mice  is  38.13  mg/kg. Therefore one dose was selected at 40mg/kg (approximately equivalent to human MTD) and the other at 80 mg/kg (double the equivalent of human MTD) for both Docefrez and Taxotere. There  were  no  deaths  in  animals  treated  with  either  Docefrez  with  1%  7-Epimer  impurity  or Taxotere.  Histopathologically,  there  were  no  major  differences  in  microscopic  findings  between Docefrez and Taxotere. This indicates that under the conditions of the study, the acute toxicity of Docefrez with 1% 7-Epimer impurity is comparable to that of Taxotere. Guideline ICH Q3B states that in order to qualify above the applicable threshold of 0.2% of this impurity,  two  types  of  genotoxicity  studies  are  required  in  addition  to  a  toxicity  test:    (i)  point mutation (ii) chromosomal aberration. The Applicant has conducted only the former: the submitted AMES test. However, the Applicant has agreed to reduce the release and end of shelf-life limit for 7-epi-docetaxel  from  initially  NMT  1%  to  NMT  0.3%  which  is  in  line  with  the  docetaxel  active substance monograph in the Ph Eur. The CHMP considered this to be acceptable. Local tolerance Local  tolerance  and  sensitisation  studies  results  suggest  a  good  tolerance  and  absence  of  a significant sensitisation potential of the i.v. formulations of docetaxel.

An ERA has not been submitted.

## Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects

The  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  docetaxel  containing  products  has  been  well  established  in  a comprehensive literature review. In addition, in order to support the claim that the differences in formulation of the proposed and reference products do not impact on the behaviour of the product the Applicant has submitted three non-clinical studies that have supported the claim of equivalence of Docefrez to the reference product.

Guideline ICH Q3B states that in order to qualify above the applicable threshold of 0.2% of this impurity,  two  types  of  genotoxicity  studies  are  required  in  addition  to  a  toxicity  test:    (i)  point mutation (ii) chromosomal aberration. The Applicant has conducted only the former: the submitted AMES test.

The qualification limits set for the impurity 7-epimer are higher than the qualification threshold of 0.2% mentioned in the ICH Q3B(R2) for new drug products. However, the Applicant has agreed to reduce  the  release  and  end  of  shelf-life  limit  for  7-epi-docetaxel  from  initially  NMT  1%  to  NMT 0.3% which is in  line  with  the  docetaxel  active  substance  monograph  in  the  Ph  Eur.  The  CHMP considered this to be acceptable.

According  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

The  Applicant  has  provided  an  updated  review  of  the  clinical  use  of  docetaxel  for  the  proposed indications with 34 publications from 1994 to 2008.

There were no detailed study reports from clinical trials submitted by the Applicant. The application was submitted in accordance with Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, where the Applicant was not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests and of clinical trials as the medicinal product is a generic (hybrid) of a reference medicinal product which is authorised for 6/10 years in a MS or in the Community.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Exemption The Applicant has claimed that Docefrez, a lyophilised powder to be reconstituted with solvent, has after dilution in the recommended infusion fluid, the same drug concentration of docetaxel as the reference  product  Taxotere.  Docefrez  according  to  the  Applicant  contains  the  same  active substance with a similar composition and pharmaceutical form at the time of administration and is recommended for administration through the same route, that is, intravenous, as Taxotere. The Applicant has claimed that according to the CPMP guideline 'Note for Guidance on the Investigation of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence'  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98),  there  is  no  requirement  for  a bioequivalence study for such products. The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  Docefrez,  like  the  reference  product  Taxotere,  is  a  micellar solution,  and  in  this  regard  it  may  be  considered  as  'complex'.  Therefore  comparable  data regarding  the  main  characteristics  of  the  micellar  solution  (physico-chemical  properties,  micelle size  and  size  distribution)  were  required  (see  Quality  section).  The  results  of  these  studies confirmed  pharmaceutical  comparability  of  Docefrez  and  the  reference  product  Taxotere  and therefore bioequivalence studies were not required. Clinical studies The  application  contains  adequate  clinical  data  from  the  review  of  the  publication  literature submitted for the proposed indications:

## Breast cancer

Docefrez  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  is  indicated  for  the  adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer.

Docefrez  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition.

Docefrez  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent.

Docefrez in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Docefrez  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally advanced  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy should have included an anthracycline.

## Non-small cell lung cancer

Docefrez is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy.

Docefrez in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable, locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  in  patients  who  have  not  previously received chemotherapy for this condition.

## Prostate cancer

Docefrez in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

## Gastric adenocarcinoma

Medicinal product no longer authorised Docefrez in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of patients with  metastatic  gastric  adenocarcinoma,  including  adenocarcinoma  of  the  gastroesophageal junction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Head and neck cancer Docefrez in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  operable  node-positive  breast  cancer,  the  recommended  dose  of docetaxel  is  75 mg/m 2 administered  1-hour  after  doxorubicin  50 mg/m 2   and  cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2   every  3 weeks  for  6  cycles.  For  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2  in monotherapy. In first-line  treatment,  docetaxel  75 mg/m 2   is  given  in  combination  therapy  with  doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ). In combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m 2 every three weeks, with trastuzumab administered weekly. In combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2  every three weeks, combined with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m 2   twice  daily  (within  30 minutes  after  a  meal)  for  2 weeks  followed  by  1-week  rest period. In  chemotherapy  naïve  patients  treated  for  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  the  recommended  dose regimen is docetaxel 75 mg/m 2  immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2  over 30-60 minutes. For  treatment  after  failure  of  prior  platinum-based  chemotherapy,  the  recommended  dose  is 75 mg/m² as a single agent. The  recommended  dose  of  docetaxel  for  prostate  cancer  patients  is  75 mg/m 2 .  Prednisone  or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily is administered continuously (see section 5.1).

The recommended dose of docetaxel for gastric adenocarcinoma patients is 75 mg/m 2  as a 1 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 , as a 1 to 3 hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg /m 2 per day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. Treatment is repeated every three weeks.

For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2  as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 mg/m 2  per day for five days. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m 2  as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m 2  administered as a 30-minute to 3 hour infusion, followed by 5fluorouracil  1000 mg/m 2 /day  as  a  continuous  infusion  from  day  1 to  day 4.  This  regimen  is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.

## Pharmacokinetics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of  docetaxel  has  been  shown  to  be  linear,  with  first  order  elimination.  In dose  ranging  studies,  AUC  increased  in  proportion  to  dose  and  total  plasma  clearance  was independent of dose. Following the administration of a 100 mg/m 2  dose, given as a 1 h infusion, a mean peak plasma level of  3.7 μ g/ml  was  obtained;  with  a  corresponding  AUC  of  4.6  h. μ g/ml. Mean values for total body clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m 2  and 113 l. Inter-individual variation in total body clearance has been shown to be approximately 50%. Total  clearance  was  27%  lower  on  average  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  liver  function impairment. Docetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and docetaxel pharmacology is unlikely to be altered in patients with kidney impairment, as renal excretion is responsible for &lt;5% docetaxel elimination. Docetaxel is extensively bound (&gt;95%) to plasma  proteins  both in  vivo and in  vitro ,  predominantly  to α 1-acid  glycoproteins,  albumin  and lipoproteins.  Docetaxel  is  metabolised  via  hepatic  cytochrome  P450  isoenzyme  CYP3A4  and excreted chiefly in the faeces as metabolites. A study of 14 C-docetaxel showed that approximately 80%  of  the  radioactivity  recovered  in  faeces  is  excreted  during  the  first  48  hrs  as  one  major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites and very low amounts of unchanged drug.

## Pharmacodynamics

Docetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells, which is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. Docetaxel acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin.

## Additional data

No additional studies were submitted.

## Post marketing experience

No  post-marketing  data  are  available.  The  medicinal  product  has  not  been  marketed  in  any country.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance,  as  described  in  version  6  (dated January 2010) presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

##  Risk Management Plan

Not  applicable.  The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety concerns requiring additional risk minimisation activities have been identified.

##  User consultation

The user testing of the package leaflet was performed. The criterion for a successful Readability Test was fulfilled. The user testing of the package leaflet was judged acceptable.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

Docefrez  meets  the  requirement  on  safety  and  efficacy  required  for  a  marketing  authorisation application under Article 10 (3) 'hybrid application' and a biowaiver for not submitting bioequivalence  studies  has  been  granted.  Therefore  no  further  clinical  data  was  required.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

current knowledge concerning the safety and efficacy of docetaxel has been evaluated by means of an updated literature search.

A RMP was considered not required as the application concerns a medicinal product containing a known active substance for which no additional safety concerns requiring specific risk minimisation activities  have  been  identified  with  respect  to  the  reference  medicinal  product.  The  active substance has been in use for many years and the safety profile of the products is well established. It  was  considered  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  according  to  the  Detailed  Description  of Pharmacovigilance System was sufficient for safety monitoring.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data.  A  benefit/risk  ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

'Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  by  consensus  that  the benefit/risk ratio of Docefrez in the treatment of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
