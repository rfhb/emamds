## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ripretinib, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on risk from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between ripretinib and malignant melanoma is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ripretinib should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ripretinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ripretinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
