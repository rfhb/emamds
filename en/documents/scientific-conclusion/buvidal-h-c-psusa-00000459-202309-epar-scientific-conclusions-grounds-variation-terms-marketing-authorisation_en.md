## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

In view of available data from spontaneous sources and literature on the interactions between opioids and gabapentinoids  as  well  as  anticholinergics,  and  taking  into  account  the  existing  warnings  in  product informations  of  other  opioid  containing  products,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of products containing buprenorphine (all formulations except implants) should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data from the literature and spontaneous reports on risks of paediatric intoxication, including  some  fatal  cases,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  package  leaflet  of  products  containing buprenorphine (all formulations except implants) should be amended accordingly (except those for which take-home use by patients is not allowed as per the instructions of the product information).

In view of available data on the risk of medication errors related to a wrong route of administration (e.g. intradermally, intramuscularly, intravenously), the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing buprenorphine (all formulations except implants) for subcutaneous injection only, should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on the risk of drug dependency/drug abuse from post-marketing case reports and literature  data,  and  taking  into  account  the  existing  warnings  in  product  information  of  other  opioid containing products, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing buprenorphine (all  formulations  except  implants)  should  be  updated  to  reinforce  the  labelling  on  the  risk  of  drug dependency/drug abuse by adding negative consequences of opioid use disorder and risk factors identified in accordance with wordings already implemented for other opioids.

In view of available data on dental caries from the literature and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between buprenorphine (all formulations except implants) for oromucosal use and dental caries is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing  buprenorphine  (all  formulations  except  implants)  for  oromucosal  use  should  be  amended accordingly.
