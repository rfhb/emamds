## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

The  product  Fingolimod  Mylan  0.5  mg  hard  capsules  was  developed  as  a  generic  equivalent  to  the innovator's product Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules. Gilenya was authorised in the EU on 17.03.2011.

The indication proposed for Fingolimod Mylan is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product Gilenya:

Fingolimod Mylan is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older:

- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one  disease  modifying  therapy  (for  exceptions  and  information  about  washout  periods  see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

or

- Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Fingolimod is metabolised by sphingosine kinase  to  the  active  metabolite  fingolimod  phosphate.  By  acting  as  a  functional  antagonist  of  S1P receptors  on  lymphocytes,  fingolimod  phosphate  blocks  the  capacity  of  lymphocytes  to  egress  from lymph nodes, causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. This redistribution reduces the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes, including pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, into the CNS, where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage.

In accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **)and Fingolimod product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016), the applicant submitted one fasting bioequivalence study to support the application (study FING-CAZ-1001 on 0.5 mg strength).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 0.56 mg of fingolimod hydrochloride as the active substance, corresponding to 0.5 mg of fingolimod.

## Other ingredients are:

- Capsule content: calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, glycine, colloidal anhydrous silica and magnesium stearate,
- Capsule  shell:  gelatin,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  yellow  iron  oxide  (E172)  and  red  iron  oxide (E172),
- Printing ink: shellac (E904), propylene glycol (E1520), black iron oxide (E172) and potassium hydroxide.

The product is available in PVC/PCTFE-Alu blisters, PVC/PE/PVdC-Alu blisters and HDPE bottles with childresistant PP closure with wad containing aluminium induction sealing liner as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

## 2.2.2. Active substance

## General information

The chemical name of the active substance is 2-amino-2-(4-octylphenethyl)propane-1,3-diol hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C19H33NO2.HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 343.93 g/mol and the following structure:

Figure 1: Active substance structure

<!-- image -->

The active substance is a white or almost white powder, freely soluble in water and in ethanol (96 %) and practically insoluble in heptane.

The active substance has a non-chiral molecular structure.

Fingolimod hydrochloride exhibits polymorphism and 4 distinct polymorphic forms are known (form I, form II, form III and hydrate form). The manufacturing process used by the CEP holder consistently produces one polymorphic form. An identification test is included in the active substance specification to confirm  the  desired  polymorphic  form.  Conversion  to  other  polymorphic  forms  occurs  at  elevated temperature and at elevated humidity. The material rapidly transitions back to the desired polymorphic form once returned to room temperature.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As there is a monograph of fingolimod hydrochloride in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for fingolimod hydrochloride which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application.

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site.

The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.

Details of container closure system are specified in the CEP issued by EDQM for Fingolimod Hydrochloride Ph. Eur.

## Specification

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance  (visual),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.), identification (IR, test for chloride), water content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (HSGC), particle size (Malvern) and identification (XRPD).

The active substance specification applied by the finished product manufacturer includes the tests and requirements stated in Ph. Eur. monograph for fingolimod hydrochloride and those on the CEP, including the  additional  tests  for  residual  solvents  which  are  included  in  the  CEP.  Two  additional  specification parameters  are  tested  by  the  active  substance  manufacturer:  identification  (by  PXRD)  to  confirm formation of desired polymorph form and testing for one additional impurity. The relevant information regarding  these  tests  has  been  assessed  by  EDQM  before  issuing  the  Certificate  of  Suitability.  The finished product manufacturer uses the same analytical methods as the active substance manufacturer.

Particle  size  is  only  tested  by  the  finished  product  manufacturer.  The  analytical  method  has  been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The specification limit has been set based on the particle size distribution of the active substance batches used to manufacture finished product, including those that were used in the bioequivalence study.

## Stability

The relevant CEP for fingolimod hydrochloride does not include a re-test period.

Stability data from three production-scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of the commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.

The stability studies were performed before the Ph. Eur monograph for fingolimod hydrochloride became effective. For the stability studies, loss on drying (NMT 0.5%) was tested instead of the water content according to Ph. Eur. The limits for impurities were higher than the Ph. Eur. specification limits (not more than 0.10%) for the specified impurities. All results were within the Ph. Eur. specification for fingolimod hydrochloride.

The analytical method used for assay and related substances has been demonstrated to be stability indicating.

The applicant did not test photolytic degradation of the active substance according to ICH Q1B and this can be accepted as the active substance is stored protected from light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions.

## Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

The finished product is a hard capsule with brown-orange opaque cap and white opaque body, printed with 'MYLAN' over 'FD 0.5' in black ink on both the cap and body. Each capsule is approximately 16 mm in length.

The  capsules  are  purchased  as  pre-printed  empty  capsule  shells;  therefore,  the  finished  product manufacturer does not test and release the individual components of the capsule shells.

The  description  and  composition  of  the  finished  product  is  adequate.  All  excipients,  capsule  shell components and printing ink components are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except iron oxide yellow, red and black which are not described in Ph. Eur. but comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic version of the reference medicinal product Gilenya, 0.5 mg hard capsules.

The qualitative composition of the excipients is different in Fingolimod Mylan compared to the reference medicinal product and optimisation studies were conducted to select fill weight, filers and disintegrants. The compatibility of the excipients with the active substance has been confirmed.

The reference medicinal product is an immediate release product with low dose of active substance. Therefore, content uniformity and maintenance of assay were considered critical criteria for selecting an appropriate manufacturing process. During development, the manufacturing process was optimised.

The  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  and  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  were identified.  These  CQAs  include  assay,  content  uniformity,  dissolution  and  related  compounds.  A  risk assessment  of  the  active  substance  attributes,  formulation  variables  and  manufacturing  process variables was performed to evaluate their impact on the finished product CQAs. No design space was applied.

The  choice  of  routine  dissolution  method  has  been  adequately  justified.  The  applicant  adequately demonstrated the optimal concentration for the surfactant. The discriminatory power of the proposed dissolution method has been demonstrated at the dissolution specification limit.

A bioequivalence study was performed with relevant batches of the test and the reference medicinal products. Please refer to the clinical section for further details of this study. The test product used in the bioequivalence study is identical to the proposed commercial formulation.

Comparative dissolution profiles of the bioequivalence batches of the test product and the reference product have been presented in 3 media with addition of surfactant (release media, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer). The similarity factor (f2) values were calculated. In release media the dissolution profiles are similar for test and reference medicinal product. In pH 4.5 and 6.8 dissolution profiles  are  different.  This  difference  was  justified  by  the  difference  in  qualitative  and  quantitative composition and in the manufacturing process between test and reference medicinal product.

Comparative in vitro dissolution tests between test and reference medicinal product in 3 media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) without the use of surfactant have also been conducted in accordance with the Guideline on Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). At pH 1.2, the dissolution profiles are comparable. At pH 4.5 and pH 6.8, the dissolution results show that the inclusion of SLS is required

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to enhance the dissolution kinetics and solubility of the product. Fingolimod hydrochloride is insoluble in pH  6.8,  therefore  the  dissolution  is  minimal  for  the  reference  and  the  test  medicinal  product.  The information provided is sufficient to justify the selected dissolution conditions.

The finished product is proposed for use in adult patients and paediatric patients from 10 years and older. Relevant aspects of the specific needs of the paediatric population have been sufficiently discussed.

The product is presented in the following packaging types:

- PVC/PE/PVdC - Alu blister pack
- PVC/PCTFE - Alu blister pack
- High density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle pack with polypropylene (PP) child resistant closure with wad containing aluminium induction sealing liner

Adequate data has been provided for the container closure systems and the materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements.

In  addition  to  the  commercial  packaging,  bulk  packs  are  described  in  the  dossier  (low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags in an outer triple laminated bag placed in suitable tertiary packaging.)

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The finished product manufacturing process is a non-standard manufacturing process due to the low content  of  active  substance  in  the  medicinal  product.  The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  a combination of several blending steps, dry granulation and final encapsulation.

The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail and the in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

A holding-time study of process intermediates has not been performed. The entire manufacturing process is completed within 30 days. The start of shelf life of the finished product is determined in compliance with the Note for Guidance on start of shelf life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96).

The filled capsules may be stored and transported as bulk product packaged in LDPE bags. The bulk packaging is described in the dossier and stability data is provided. The proposed shelf life of 12 months for bulk product is acceptable based on the provided stability data.

The control strategy for the critical steps is based on the process development studies performed.

The manufacturing process is considered as a non-standard as the amount of active substance in the medicinal product is low. Therefore, the manufacturing process has been validated as required by three consecutive  production-scale  batches.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.

## Product specification

The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: description (visual), identification (HPLC-PDA, HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (by content  uniformity),  related  compounds  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  microbial  test  (Ph.  Eur.),  colour identification (visual) and water content (KF.).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  proposed  specifications  are  compliant  with  ICH  Q6A  and  cover  appropriate  parameters  for  this dosage form.

The proposed limits for the impurities have been appropriately justified.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines or reference is made to the relevant Ph. Eur. chapters.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 'Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products' (EMA/409815/2020) and the 'Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products' (EMA/369136/2020).

Considering  the  synthetic  route  of  active  substance,  a  risk  of  nitrosamine  formation  was  identified. Confirmatory  testing  was  conducted,  and  several  batches  of  active  substance  were  analysed  for nitrosamine  impurities.  The  results  were  below  the  detection  limit  of  the  analytical  method.  This  is acceptable considering the maximum daily dose of finished product. In response to a major objection raised during the procedure, confirmatory testing was also conducted on the finished product. Several finished product batches were also tested using a validated analytical method (GC-MS/MS). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.

Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for three production-scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data from three production-scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 65% RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing  (blister  packs PVC/PE/PvdC, blister packs PVC/PCTFE and HDPE bottles).

Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  dissolution,  water,  microbiological  purity  and  related substances. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Under intermediate and long-term storage  condition,  all  tested  parameters  remained  within  specification.  Under  accelerated  storage conditions, the level of two impurities increased above the specification limit and a significant decrease in assay was observed.

In addition, a photostability study was conducted as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The capsules were found not to be sensitive to light.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An in-use stability study has been conducted for the bottle pack which confirmed stability for 180 days.

Data was presented for an open-pot stability study and the product was found to be stable for 90 days at 25°C / 60 % RH.

A holding-time study of process intermediates has not been performed. A bulk pack is proposed for holding the finished product before packaging or for transportation to any other approved re-packaging site in European Economic Area. A simulated bulk pack has been studied for 6 months at accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH), for 12 months at intermediate conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for 12 months at long-term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH). The stability data justify the proposed shelf life of 12 months for the bulk pack.

The start of shelf life of the finished product is determined in compliance with the Note for Guidance on start of shelf life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96).

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable with the special precautions for storage outlined in section 6.4 of the SmPC (Do not store above 25°C; Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture).

## Adventitious agents

Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. A major objection raised during the procedure in relation to the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities has been resolved and acceptable results from confirmatory testing of the finished product have been presented. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

## 2.2.4. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

## 2.2.5. Recommendations for future quality development

Not applicable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generate  additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  impurity profile has been discussed.

## 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Fingolimod Mylan manufactured by Mylan Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all fingolimod containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to remain unchanged.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical studies for fingolimod have not been performed by the applicant. The non-clinical data are based on literature review of published studies in animals and in vitro models. Fingolimod is wellknown active substance clinically used in humans for more than 10 years and the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

The impurity profiles and excipients are discussed adequately.

The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product Gilenya.

In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the  justification  for  omission  of  an  environmental  risk  assessment  is considered acceptable.

## 2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The CHMP considers the non-clinical aspects adequate to support this application.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

This is an application for a hard capsule containing 0.5mg of fingolimod hydrochloride. To support the marketing authorisation application, the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study (FING-CAZ-1001) with parallel design under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) and the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09),  as  well  as  the  fingolimod  product  specific  bioequivalence  guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016) are of particular relevance.

No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical studies

To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study (FING-CAZ-1001):

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Methods

## Study design

The study FING-CAZ-1001 was a single-dose, randomised, one-period, two-treatment, parallel-designed study  with  the  objective  to  investigate  the  bioequivalence  of  Mylan  Fingolimod  capsules,  0.5  mg  to Novartis Gilenya capsules, 0.5 mg following a single, oral 0.5 mg dose administration in healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions.

The study was conducted in six groups on 56 subjects total. In each group (28 subjects per treatment arm), the subjects received one capsule of 0.5 mg of either test or reference products randomly on the day of dosing as per the randomisation schedule under fasting conditions. Drug product was administered after at least 10 hours overnight fasting. A fast was maintained for at least 4 hours after dosing.

Blood samples were collected in K2EDTA tubes at pre-dose (0 hours) and at intervals over 72 hours after administration of dose, which is sufficient for a substance with a long half-life to characterise the plasma concentration-time profile.

Each blood sample was divided equally into two (2) aliquots and stored upright in a freezer at -70°C until shipment to the bio-analytical department for analysis.

## Population(s) studied

A total of 72 subjects were planned for enrolment as per protocol. Due to difficulties in recruitment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, only 56 (28 per treatment arm) non-smoker, healthy, adult, male volunteers of Asian ethnicity, black and white between 19 to 55 years of age weighing from 62.8 to 102.3 kg, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) range of 19.8 to 29.6 kg/m 2 , met eligibility requirements per protocol, were enrolled for the study.

The subjects were dosed as per randomisation, one at a time, consecutively, at their scheduled intervals during period 1 in six groups. On study day 1, each subject received either a single oral dose of 0.5 mg (1 x 0.5 mg capsule) of the test product or the reference product.

All 56 subjects completed the clinical portion of the study successfully. However, 2 subjects (subject 19 and subject 20) had pre-dose fingolimod concentrations greater than 5% of Cmax and were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis as per EMA guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev,1/Corr**) and the protocol exclusion criteria. Therefore, only 54 subjects are included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.

## Analytical methods

## Pre-study validation of the test method

A high-performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of  fingolimod  in  K2EDTA  human  whole  blood  using  automated  sample  preparation  with  liquid-liquid extraction has been developed in 2014 and later modified three times (Project #13-026-00 - Project #13-026-03). The method has been validated in 2014 and revalidated six times (from 03.06.2014 to 26.9.2020) in accordance with the requirements of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).

Adequate certificates of analysis of the reference (fingolimod hydrochloride) and the internal standard (fingolimod-d4) were provided, as well as the method SOPs and statements on GLP compliance.

The  method  met  the  acceptance  criteria  for  all  the  validation  parameters  evaluated,  demonstrating acceptable performance.

Sensitivity  of  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  of  12  pg/ml  with  an  acceptable  accuracy  and precision has been demonstrated.

Long-term stability data of fingolimod co-spiked with fingolimod phosphate metabolite in human whole blood at -70°C for 145 days showed stability of the subject samples stored under these conditions for 94 days.

Neither carry-over nor matrix effect was observed.

Selectivity of the fingolimod in the presence of co-administered drug (acetaminophen) and the fingolimod phosphate metabolite has been demonstrated. The method has acceptable selectivity and specificity and can accurately quantify concentration of fingolimod in human plasma.

The possibility of back-conversion of metabolite fingolimod phosphate was evaluated at the stage of bioanalytical method validation. The stability in the presence of fingolimod phosphate showed that there is no back-conversion of fingolimod phosphate to the fingolimod during the sample analysis and storage and thus considered acceptable.

## Bioanalytical report

The analysis of the blood samples for fingolimod were carried out by the Bioanalytical Department of Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.

A validated high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometric method (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the determination of fingolimod in K2EDTA human whole blood was used to assay all biostudy samples. Sample processing involved liquid-liquid extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. The method used a standard curve range of 12600 pg/mL, based on analysis of 150 μL of K2EDTA  male  whole  blood  with  the  limit  of  quantification  was  12  pg/mL.  A  weighted  (1/X2)  linear regression was used to determine slopes, intercepts, and correlation coefficients.

The bioanalytical laboratory study report including the complete analytical method package associated with the biostudy and statement on GLP, protocol and SOP compliance and quality insurance audit have been provided.

Adequate  certificate  of  analysis  for  reference  standard  (USP  Fingolimod  hydrochloride)  and  internal standard (Fingolimod-d4) were included in the dossier.

A  total  number  of  1792  collected  samples  were  received  frozen  and  intact  at  the  bioanalytical  site. However, only the primary set of samples (896 subject samples) was analysed for the biostudy.

Samples were stored at -70°C from the date of initial sample collection until the final day of sample resulting in the maximum sample storage period of 94 days at -70°C. Stability of fingolimod co-spiked with fingolimod phosphate in human whole blood has been demonstrated for 145 days of storage at 70°C.

All  samples of one subject were analysed together in one analytical run. Each run consisted of zero sample, blank samples, ten calibration standards (12 pg/mL to 600 pg/mL), quality control samples in duplicate (30 pg/mL, 125 pg/mL, 325 pg/mL and 450 pg/mL) and study samples. Correlation coefficients (r) were &gt;0.9982.

For  the  Quality  control  samples  of  fingolimod,  at  a  low  level,  two  middle  levels,  and  a  high-level concentration,  accuracy  values  were  96.82%  -  98.43%  and  precision  values  3.72%  -  6.40%, respectively.

The number of QC samples per one analytical run (4 QC levels in duplicate) corresponding to 12.5% of 64 study samples (4 subjects X 16 samples) analysed in one analytical run, which is considered adequate.

The re-assay of individual study samples and re-analysis of complete analytical batches was performed according to the SOP MPI-SOP-BIO-GEN-0020. A total number of re-analysed individual study samples was 2 of 896 samples. The reason for re-analysis was in both cases measurable concentration in subject zero sample (pre-dose) and it is considered justified.

A  total  of  108  incurred  samples  were  re-analysed  according  to  SOP  MPI-SOP-BIO-GEN-0023.  Reanalysed samples corresponding to 12,1% of 896 study samples and 98.1% of them met the acceptance criteria specified in the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). The incurred sample reanalysis confirmed the reproducibility of the method.

## Pharmacokinetic variables

Single-dose  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  fingolimod  were  calculated  using  non-compartment techniques.

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, AUC0-72

Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters: Tmax

## Statistical methods

Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72 of fingolimod using the SAS® Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Analysis of variance: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72 of fingolimod using PROC GLM of SAS® Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The presented data shows that groups and treatments were comparable in all known variables (e.g., age, sex, race, weight, BMI, height) that may affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance.

Bioequivalence between the Test (Treatment A) and Reference (Treatment C) was tested by the 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the population geometric means (T/R) for the parameters.

Confidence intervals (CI) were determined for the ln- transformed AUC72, and Cmax for fingolimod using the treatments least squares means (LS-Means) obtained from ANOVA.

Bioequivalence was concluded when the 90% confidence intervals of geometric least square mean ratio of the test and reference product falls within the acceptance range of 80% -125% for ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-72.

Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed on the 54 subjects who completed study period with test and reference product.

The test to reference ratio of geometric LS means and corresponding 90% confidence interval of the Cmax and AUC0-72 were all within the acceptance range of 80-125%.

Concentrations  for  both  reference  and  test  drug  in  pre-dose  time  point  were  below  the  limit  of quantification except for 2 subjects (subjects 19 and 20). Those 2 subjects were excluded from PK and statistical analysis.

No subject reached Cmax at the first sample time.

Considering the sampling period of 72h, and quantifiable concentrations at 72h, AUC(0-∞) and residual area do not need to be reported and it is sufficient to report AUC truncated at 72h, AUC(0-72h).

## Safety data

All 54 subjects were included in the safety and tolerability evaluation.

Six post-dose adverse events were experienced by 5 subjects over the course of this study. The AEs were mild in severity. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.

There was 1 pre-dose adverse event (thermal burn) reported after signing of the ICF but prior to dosing and, therefore, considered unrelated to either treatment.

There were 4 AEs (back pain, bradycardia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea) that were considered probably related and 2 AEs (headache) that were considered possibly related to study drug (reference).

There were no AEs reported after the oral administration of test product.

Overall, Fingolimod Mylan was well tolerated as a single, oral 0.5 mg dose administered under fasting conditions.

## Conclusions

Based on the results of the bioequivalence study, Fingolimod Mylan 0.5 mg hard capsules is considered bioequivalent with the reference product Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

## 2.4.4. Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.4.5. Discussion on clinical aspects

To  support  this  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  review  of  clinical  data  as  well  as  one bioequivalence study performed in 2020.

The bioequivalence study was designed as a one-period, two-treatment, parallel study bioequivalence study to compare the bioavailability of 2 formulations of fingolimod (0.5 mg) under fasting conditions.

A total of 72 healthy, adult, human subjects were planned for enrolment as per protocol. However, due to difficulties in recruitment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, only 56 (28 per treatment arm) met eligibility requirements per protocol. The subjects were dosed in 6 groups as per randomisation, one at a time, consecutively, at their scheduled intervals during period 1. All 56 subjects completed the clinical portion of the study. Two subjects had pre-dose fingolimod concentrations greater than 5% of Cmax and were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis as per EMA guideline. Therefore, only 54 subjects are included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.

Overall,  the  study  design  is  acceptable  for  substances  with  very  long  half-life  and  in  line  with  the Bioequivalence Guideline. According to the Fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016), one single dose, parallel, fasting study with blood sampling for 72 hours is appropriate. The bioequivalence study was conducted under standardised conditions.

The study was conducted under fasting conditions, which is acceptable as the drug product can be taken with or without food and the fasting condition is the most sensitive to identify differences between the formulations.

Sampling time schedule seems adequate taking into account long tmax of fingolimod of around 12 - 16 hours.

As fingolimod is highly distributed in red blood cells, blood was used as matrix for the evaluation of fingolimod  (parent)  concentrations,  which  is  acceptable.  The  measurement  of  the  parent  compound (fingolimod) in blood is in line with the requirements of the Fingolimod product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016).

Adequate information is provided on the test and reference products. The reference product marketed in Germany is a suitable comparator of the generic product. The assayed content of the batch used as test product did not differ more than 5% from that of the batch used as reference product.

The  analytical  method  was  validated,  either  pre-study  or  within  study  according  to  Guideline  on bioanalytical method validation (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). Bioanalytical method had satisfactory performance and was adequately validated.

The pharmacokinetic parameters measured/calculated are standard for a single-dose study. They are acceptable and according to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence and Fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The statistical method used for the pharmacokinetic analyses is considered acceptable. The ANOVA model used is adequate for a bioequivalence study. Given that the study was conducted in 6 groups and those groups were dosed at different time, exclusion of the interaction terms (Group, Group*Formulation) from the ANOVA model was justified.

Furthermore, in view of the parallel design and in accordance with the guideline, a detailed analysis comparing treatment groups was provided and showed that groups and treatments were comparable in all known variables (e.g., age, sex, race, weight, BMI, height) that may affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance.

The 90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables AUC0-72h and Cmax were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%.

Both the formulations (Test and Reference) were well tolerated during the conduct of the study.

The clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

## 2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical aspects

Based on the results of the bioequivalence study, Fingolimod Mylan 0.5 mg hard capsules is considered bioequivalent with the reference product Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules.

The CHMP agrees that Fingolimod Mylan is acceptable from a clinical point of view.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Product information

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Gilenya (for content) and to Duloxetine Mylan (for design and layout). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

This application concerns a generic version of fingolimod hydrochloride hard capsules. The reference product Gilenya is indicated for as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older:

- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

or

-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more disabling  relapses  in  one  year  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application. An adequate summary of the available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or on the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The clinical overview, based on information from published literature, was considered sufficient.

The  bioequivalence  study  forms  the  pivotal  basis  with  a  single-dose,  randomised,  one-period,  twotreatment, parallel-designed study in healthy adult male subjects under fasting conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  test  formulation  of  Fingolimod  Mylan  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when compared with the reference product Gilenya. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-72h and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range (80 to 125%). Bioequivalence of the two formulations was therefore demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Fingolimod Mylan is favourable in the following indication:

Fingolimod Mylan is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older:

- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

or

-  Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more disabling  relapses  in  one  year  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal  product  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  (See  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product Characteristics, section 4.2).

## Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Periodic Safety Update Reports

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed  RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  Marketing  authorisation  and  any  agreed  subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## Additional risk minimisation measures

Prior to launch of Fingolimod Mylan in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must  agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  programme,  including  communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).

The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State (MS) where Fingolimod Mylan is marketed, all physicians who intend to prescribe it are provided with the following educational materials:

1. Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)
2. Physician's checklist for adult and paediatric patients, to consider prior to prescribing Fingolimod Mylan.
3. The Patient / Parent / Caregiver's guide, to be provided to all patients, their parents (or legal representatives), and caregivers.
4. The pregnancy-specific patient reminder card, to be provided to all patients, their parents (or legal representatives), and caregivers, as applicable.

## Physician's checklist

The physician's checklist shall contain the following key messages:

- -Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation:

## Before first dose

- Perform baseline ECG prior to the first dose of Fingolimod Mylan;
- Perform blood pressure measurement prior to the first dose of Fingolimod Mylan;
- Perform a liver function test including transaminases and bilirubin, prior to (within 6 months) treatment initiation;
- Arrange  ophthalmological  assessment  before  starting  Fingolimod  Mylan  treatment  in patients with diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis.
- A negative pregnancy test result must be confirmed prior to starting treatment.

## Until 6 hours after first dose

- Monitor  the  patient  for  6  hours  after  the  first  dose  of  Fingolimod  Mylan  has  been administered  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  bradycardia,  including  hourly  pulse  and  blood pressure checks. Continuous (real time) ECG monitoring is recommended;
- Perform an ECG at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period.

## &gt; 6 to 8 hours after first dose

- If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first dose, extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate increases again.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Recommendation for re-initiating Fingolimod Mylan therapy after treatment interruption: The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is interrupted for:
- One day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment;
- More than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment;
- More than 2 weeks after at least one month of treatment.
- -Recommendation for overnight  monitoring  after  the  first  dose  (or  if  the  first  dose  monitoring applies during treatment re-initiation):
- Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during monitoring at treatment initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first dose monitoring after the second dose of Fingolimod Mylan;
- Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until resolution of findings in patients:
- -With third degree AV block occurring at any time;
- -Where at the 6-hour time point:
- a. Heart rate &lt; 45 bpm, &lt; 55 bpm in paediatric patients aged 12 years old and above, or &lt; 60 bpm in paediatric patients 10 to below 12 years of age;
- b. New onset second degree or higher AV block;
- c. QTc interval ≥ 500 msec.
- -Fingolimod Mylan is contraindicated in patients with:
- Known immunodeficiency syndrome;
- Patients  with  increased  risk  for  opportunistic  infections,  including  immunocompromised patients  (including  those  currently  receiving  immunosuppressive  therapies  or  those immunocompromised by prior therapies);
- Severe active infections, active chronic infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis);
- Known active malignancies;
- Severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C);
- In the previous 6 months, myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina pectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure (requiring inpatient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure;
- Severe cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic treatment with class Ia or class III anti-arrhythmic medicinal products;
- Second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) block or third-degree AV block, or sicksinus syndrome, if they do not wear a pacemaker;
- Patients with a baseline QTc interval ≥ 500 msec;
- Pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception;
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
- -Fingolimod Mylan is not recommended in patients with:
- Sino-atrial heart block;
- QTc  prolongation  &gt; 470 msec  (adult  females),  QTc &gt; 460 msec  (paediatric  females)  or &gt; 450 msec (adult and paediatric males);
- History of cardiac arrest;
- Severe sleep apnoea;
- History of symptomatic bradycardia;
- History of recurrent syncope;
- Uncontrolled hypertension.

If Fingolimod Mylan treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits must outweigh potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring, at least overnight extended monitoring is recommended.

- -Fingolimod  Mylan  is  not  recommended  in  patients  concomitantly  taking  medicines  known  to decrease the heart rate. If treatment is considered in these patients anticipated benefits must outweigh potential risks and a cardiologist must be consulted to switch to non heart-ratelowering therapy  or,  if  not  possible,  to  determine  appropriate  monitoring.  At  least  overnight  extended monitoring is recommended.
- -Fingolimod Mylan reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) should be checked in all patients prior to initiation (within 6 months or after discontinuation of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prior therapy) and monitored during treatment. Treatment should be interrupted if lymphocyte count is confirmed as &lt; 0.2x10 9 /L. The approved dosing of 0.5 mg once daily (or 0.25 mg once daily  in  paediatric  patients  10 years of age and above with a body weight of ≤ 40 kg)  when restarting  Fingolimod  Mylan  should  be  administered.  Other  dosing  regimens  have  not  been approved.

- -Fingolimod Mylan has an immunosuppressive effect that predisposes patients to an infection risk, including opportunistic infections that can be fatal, and increases the risk of developing lymphomas (including mycosis fungoides) and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. Surveillance should  include  vigilance  for  both  skin  malignancies  and  mycosis  fungoides.  Physicians  should carefully monitor patients, especially those with concurrent conditions or known factors, such as previous immunosuppressive therapy. If this risk is suspected, discontinuation of treatment should be considered by the physician on a case-by-case basis.
- Treatment  initiation  in  patients  with  severe  active  infection  should  be  delayed  until  the infection  is  resolved.  Suspension  of  treatment  during  serious  infections  should  be considered. Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive immune system effects. For the same reason, a decision to use prolonged concomitant treatment with corticosteroids should be taken after careful consideration.
- Vigilance  for  basal  cell  carcinoma  and  other  cutaneous  neoplasms  including  malignant melanoma,  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  Kaposi's  sarcoma  and  Merkel  cell  carcinoma  is recommended,  with  skin  examination  prior  to  treatment  initiation  and  then  every  6  to 12 months taking into consideration clinical judgement. Patients should be referred to a dermatologist  if  suspicious  lesions  are  detected.  Caution  patients  against  exposure  to sunlight without protection. These patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy.
- -Specific recommendations regarding vaccination for patients initiating fingolimod treatment.
- Check  varicella  zoster  virus  (VZV)  antibody  status  in  patients  without  a  healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or documentation of a full course of varicella vaccination. If negative, a full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine is recommended and treatment initiation should be delayed for one month to allow full effect of vaccination to occur.
- -Patients  should  be  instructed  to  report  signs  and  symptoms  of  infections  immediately  to  their prescriber during and for up to two months after treatment with Fingolimod Mylan.
- Prompt  diagnostic  evaluation  should  be  performed  in  patient  with  symptoms  and  signs consistent with encephalitis, cryptococcal meningitis or meningoencephalitis; appropriate treatment, if diagnosed, should be initiated.
- Serious, life-threatening, and  sometimes  fatal cases of encephalitis, meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV were reported while on Fingolimod Mylan treatment.
- Reports of cryptococcal meningitis (sometimes fatal) have been received after approximately 2-3 years of treatment, although an exact relationship with the duration of treatment is unknown.
- Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred after approximately 23 years of monotherapy treatment although an exact relationship with the duration of treatment is unknown. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, treatment with fingolimod Mylan should be suspended until PML has been excluded.
- Human  papilloma  virus  (HPV)  infection,  including  papilloma,  dysplasia,  warts  and  HPV related cancer, has been reported in the post-marketing setting. Cancer screening, including Pap  test,  and  vaccination  for  HPV-related  cancer  is  recommended  for  patients,  as  per standard of care.
- -A full ophthalmological assessment should be considered:
- 3-4 months  after  starting  Fingolimod  Mylan  therapy  for  the  early  detection  of  visual impairment due to drug-induced macular oedema;
- During treatment with Fingolimod Mylan in patients with diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Fingolimod Mylan is teratogenic. It is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential (including female adolescents) not using effective contraception and in pregnant women.
- A negative pregnancy test result must be confirmed prior to starting treatment, and it must be repeated at suitable intervals.
- Women  of  child-bearing  potential,  including  adolescent  females,  their  parents  (or  legal representatives),  and  caregivers,  should  be  counselled  before  treatment  initiation  and regularly thereafter about the serious risks of Fingolimod Mylan to the foetus, facilitated by the pregnancy-specific patient reminder card.
- Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for two months following treatment discontinuation.
- While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant while  on  treatment,  Fingolimod  Mylan  must  be  discontinued.  When  stopping  Fingolimod Mylan therapy due to pregnancy or for planning a pregnancy, the possible return of disease activity should be considered. Medical advice should be given regarding the risk of harmful effects  to  the  foetus  associated  with  Fingolimod  Mylan  treatment  and  ultrasonography examinations should be performed.
- Fingolimod Mylan must be stopped 2 months before planning a pregnancy.
- -Some cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant and clinically significant liver injury have been reported. Therefore, liver function should be monitored carefully.
- Before initiation of treatment, recent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available;
- During  treatment,  in  the  absence  of  clinical  symptoms,  liver  transaminases  and  serum bilirubin  should  be  monitored  at  months  1,  3,  6,  9  and  12  on  therapy  and  periodically thereafter until 2 months after Fingolimod Mylan discontinuation;
- During treatment, in the absence of clinical symptoms, if liver transaminases are greater than 3 but less than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) without increase in serum bilirubin, more frequent monitoring including serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurement should be instituted to determine if further increases occur and in order to discern if an alternative aetiology of hepatic dysfunction is present. If liver transaminases are at least 5 times the ULN or at least 3 times the ULN associated with any increase in serum bilirubin, Fingolimod Mylan should be discontinued. Hepatic monitoring should be continued. If serum levels return to normal (including if an alternative cause of the hepatic dysfunction is discovered), Fingolimod Mylan may be restarted based on a careful benefitrisk assessment of the patient.
- -The approved dosing of 0.5 mg daily (or 0.25 mg once daily in paediatric patients 10 years of age and above with a body weight of ≤ 40 kg) should be administered. Other dosing regimens have not been approved.
- -In the post-marketing setting, severe exacerbation of disease has been observed rarely in some patients stopping Fingolimod Mylan. The possibility of recurrence of exceptionally high disease activity should be considered.
- -Cases of seizure, including status epilepticus, have been reported. Physicians should be vigilant for  seizures  and  especially  in  those  patients  with  underlying  conditions  or  with  a  pre-existing history or family history of epilepsy.
- -Physicians should reassess on an annual basis the benefit of Fingolimod Mylan treatment versus risk in each patient, especially paediatric patients.
- -Physicians  should  provide  patients/parents/caregivers  with  the  patient/parents/caregiver  guide and with the pregnancy-specific patient reminder card.

The safety profile in paediatric patients is similar to adults and therefore the warnings and precautions in adults also apply for paediatric patients.

Specifically, with paediatric patients, physicians should also:

- Assess Tanner staging and measure height and weight as per standard of care;
- Perform cardiovascular monitoring;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Take precautions when the first dose is administered / patients are switched from 0.25 to 0.5 mg daily, due to the potential for bradyarrhythmia;
- Monitor the patient for sign and symptoms of depression and anxiety;
- Emphasise  treatment  compliance  and  misuse  to  patients,  especially  about  treatment interruption and the importance of repeating cardiovascular monitoring;
- Emphasise Fingolimod Mylan immunosuppressive effects;
- Consider a complete vaccination schedule before starting Fingolimod Mylan;
- Provide guidance on seizure monitoring.

## Patient / Parent / Caregiver guide

The patient/parents/caregiver guide shall contain the following key messages:

- Have a negative pregnancy test before starting Fingolimod Mylan;
- Be using effective contraception during and for at least two months following discontinuation of Fingolimod Mylan treatment;
- Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and up to two months following discontinuation of Fingolimod Mylan treatment;
- -A liver function test should be performed prior to treatment initiation; liver function monitoring should be performed at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during Fingolimod Mylan therapy, and periodically thereafter  until  2 months  after  Fingolimod  Mylan  discontinuation.  Patients  should  inform  their doctor if they notice yellowing of their skin or the whites of their eyes, abnormally dark urine, pain on the right side of the stomach area, tiredness, feeling less hungry than usual or unexplained nausea and vomiting as these can be signs of liver injury;
- -Skin  cancers  have  been  reported  in  multiple  sclerosis  patients  treated  with  Fingolimod  Mylan. Patients should inform their doctor immediately if any skin nodules (e.g., shiny, pearly nodules), patches or open sores that do not heal within weeks are noted. Symptoms of skin cancer may include abnormal growth or changes of skin tissue (e.g., unusual moles) with a change in colour, shape or size over time;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Seizure may occur. The doctor should be informed about a pre-existing history or family history of epilepsy;
- -Stopping  Fingolimod  Mylan  therapy  may  result  in  return  of  disease  activity.  The  prescribing physician  should  decide  whether  and  how  the  patient  should  be  monitored  after  stopping Fingolimod Mylan.

## Specifically for paediatric patients:

The following should be considered:

- Physicians should assess Tanner staging and measure height and weight as per standard of care;
- Precautions  should  be  taken  during  the  first  dose  of  Fingolimod  Mylan  and  when  patients  are switched from 0.25 to 0.5 mg daily;
- Depression and anxiety are known to occur with increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and have been reported also in paediatric patients treated with Fingolimod Mylan;
- Cardiac monitoring guidance;
- Patients should ensure medication compliance and avoid misuse, especially treatment interruption, and repeat cardiac monitoring;
