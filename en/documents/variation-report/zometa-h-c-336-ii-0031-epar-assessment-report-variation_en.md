## I SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Zometa (zoledronic acid 4 mg) is a nitrogen-containing, third generation bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption with very high potency. Zometa is resistant to hydrolysis by phosphatases because of the characteristic phosphorus-carbon-phosphorus bond. It binds tightly to calcified bone matrix  and  inhibits  osteoclast-mediated  bone  resorption  more  effectively  than  earlier  generation bisphosphonates,  at  doses  that  do  not  impair  bone  mineralization.  As  a  bone  resorption  inhibitor, zoledronic  acid  has  demonstrated  therapeutic  use  in  several  diseases  involving  enhanced  bone turnover.

Zometa  was  first  registered  in  Canada  on  21  August  2000  for  the  treatment  of  tumor-induced hypercalcemia (TIH). Zometa was authorized in the European Union for the treatment of TIH and for the prevention of skeletal related events (SRE) in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone on 20 March 2001 and 19 July 2002, respectively.

In  general,  Zometa  is  currently  approved  as  a  solution  for  infusions  in  a  powder  formulation  in 96 countries  and  as  a  concentrate  in  81  countries  worldwide,  including  European  Union,  for  the treatment of 2 conditions:

-  Prevention of SREs (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or TIH) in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, and
-  Treatment of TIH.

The  Osteogenesis  imperfecta  (OI)  comprises  a  group  of  inherited  disorders  that  primarily  (but  not always) arise from mutations in the genes for type I collagen (COL1A and COLA2). These molecular defects result in impaired bone formation, increased bone fragility and low bone mass. These essential features lead to the common name 'brittle bone disease' for the condition. The clinical classification system published by Sillence in 1979 is widely used and divides the condition into Types I-IV. More recently, additional OI types (V-VII) have been identified from within the Type IV phenotype, and have  distinct  clinical  and  molecular  characteristics.  The  severity  of  the  clinical  characteristics increases as follows: type I &lt; types IV, V, VI, VII &lt; type III &lt; type II.

Children with severe OI suffer recurrent fractures resulting in severe deformity and impaired growth (short  stature),  usually  accompanied  by  chronic  bone  pain,  and  progressive  loss  of  independent ambulation by the teenage years in over 50% of cases.

The cornerstone of treatment for OI includes physical therapy, rehabilitation, pain management, and orthopedic surgery to address deformities. Early trials with several different medical therapies were unsuccessful, including those involving fluoride, magnesium, calcitonin, and anabolic steroids.

The  most  promising  long-term  results  have  come  from  studies  using  intravenous  pamidronate.  An observational study of 30 children with severe type III or IV OI aged 3-16 years, treated with cyclic intravenous pamidronate 1.5-3.0 mg/kg q 4-6 months for 1.5 to 5 years, showed substantial increases in BMD and BMD Z-score, suppression of metabolic bone markers, reduction in fractures, increase in height, and in many patients improved mobility. Subsequently, smaller trials of i.v. pamidronate have shown similar efficacy.

With the exception of neridronate, which is nationally approved in Italy only, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies to address the frequent fractures, impaired growth, skeletal deformities, and impaired mobility that are characteristic of severe OI in affected children.

With this variation application the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) sought approval for a new indication in the treatment of severe OI in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years to be added to section 4.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). Furthermore, the MAH proposed also revisions to SPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 related to the available data in paediatric patients. In addition, SPC section 4.4 was proposed to be amended with a warning regarding the concomitant use of Aclasta as  well  as  changes  to  SPC  sections  4.3,  4.6  and  4.8  were  applied  to  align  with  the  QRD  template. Moreover, Annex II is to be updated with the RMP standard text reflecting the latest agreed version number. The package leaflet has been proposed to be revised based on the results of a Readability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Testing.  The  MAH  took  also  the  opportunity  to  introduce  minor  corrections  to  the  PI  of  several languages.

## Information on Paediatrics

The  paediatric  program  in  OI  was  agreed  between  Novartis  and  the  FDA  during  2002  and  later amended  in  2003.  The  data  was  submitted  to  and  evaluated  by  the  FDA  and  data  with  respect  to available data for paediatric patients included in the US Prescribing Information.

In Europe, the MAH submitted to EMEA/PDCO on 26 July 2007 a proposal for a Zometa Paediatric Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  (EMEA-000024-PIP01-07),  in  accordance  with  articles  13  and  16.1  of  the Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006. The MAH voluntarily proposed a paediatric program in severe OI and applied for paediatric waivers for all paediatric subsets in the currently approved Zometa adult indications. A modified version of the PIP was discussed with PDCO on 07 May 2008 and received a positive PDCO opinion and the corresponding EMEA Decision on 08 May 2008 and 24 June 2008, respectively.

In  addition  to  the  acceptance  of  paediatric  waivers  for  all  paediatric  subsets  for  the  Zometa  adult indications by EMEA/PDCO, a clinical program in paediatric OI was agreed between EMEA/PDCO and  the  MAH  so  that  this  program  formed  the  basis  for  the  EMEA  Zometa  PIP  Decision (EMEA/310261/2008).

The PIP is completed, the PDCO issued an opinion on compliance.

## 1.2 Nonclinical aspects

## 1.2.1  Pharmacology

The CHMP had initially concerns that prior to any further clinical studies in osteogenesis imperfecta every effort should be made to further study the disease and potential therapies in preclinical models. The  MAH  summarised  that  some  studies  in  OI  pre-clinical  models  were  conducted.  The  study  by Camacho, et al (2001) was carried out in oim/oim mice, an established animal model of OI based on a naturally  occurring  mutation.  In  their  study,  alendronate  was  shown  to  reduce  fracture  risk  and increase bone density in growing mice that serve as a model for the disease. Since the model used growing mice, that could be relevant to bone biology in children. Other positive outcomes from their study included increased bone diameter and decreased tibial bowing. In contrast to these findings, a decrease in femur length and a persistence of calcified cartilage were also found with treatment; both were considered indicators of potential negative outcomes. The same research later investigated the effect  of  alendronate  on  the  material  properties  in  these  mice  and  concluded  that  the  observable improvement to the oim/oim mouse bone was increased in cancellous bone volume and geometry but not  material  properties.  This  study  suggested  that  in  this  mouse  model  of  OI,  the  previously demonstrated bisphosphonate associated reduction in fractures was primarily attributable to increased metaphyseal bone mass and not changes in material properties (Misof, et al 2005).

The most recent publication related to alendronate and OI in mice was from Uveges, et al (2009). The authors used the Brtl mouse model, which had a glycine substitution in COL1A1 and was ideal for modeling the effects of bisphosphonate in classical OI (most closely mimicking the phenotype of type IV OI). The study demonstrated that alendronate treatment improved femoral areal BMD and cortical volumetric  BMD  without  altering  bone  length  (longitudinal  bone  growth).  Alendronate  improved diaphyseal cortical thickness and trabecular number, and cross-sectional shape, resulting in significantly increased load to fracture in femora after 12 weeks. However, predicted material strength and  elastic  modulus  were  negatively  impacted  at  12  weeks  presumably  due  to  the  retention  of metaphyseal remnants of mineralized cartilage. Femoral brittleness was unimproved by alendronate.

From  the  MAH's  point  of  view,  overall  there  is  evidence  in  favor  of  treatment  benefits  (such  as reduced number of fractures, and reduced bone deformation) in those pre-clinical models. The results from these studies seem to explore the association between bone mass improvement and therapeutic benefits for OI, including reductions in fracture and bone deformation. Although these studies used alendronate,  not  zoledronic  acid,  a  similar  effect  is  expected  because  of  the  same  mechanism  of alendronate and zoledronic acid. Novartis is not planning any further pre-clinical studies in OI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP noted that no pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid.  However,  published  scientific  data  indicate  that  bisphosphonates  may  be  beneficial  for  the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta due to their effects on bone remodelling. The in vivo assessment of bone architecture and strength are known to be important for the initial efficacy assessment in other products used in somewhat related indications (e.g. treatment of primary osteoporosis). Nevertheless, the clinical efficacy of zoledronic acid in treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta has been compared to pamidronate,  the  most  common  standard  of  care.  Furthermore,  Zometa  has  been  used  in  adults  for several  years.  Thus,  the  CHMP  considered  that  further  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  are  not warranted  as  the  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid  in  non-clinical  disease  models  would  not  significantly affect the risk-benefit balance.

## 1.2.2  Toxicology

## Environmental Risk Assessment

The MAH has provided a phase I environmental risk assessment for the proposed new indication. The predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  was  calculated  by  the  MAH  based  on  the  formula proposed in guideline EMEA/CHMP/4447/00. The MAH used a refined Fpen. For the refinement of the  Fpen  the  MAH  calculated  consumption  data  for  the  active  substance  based  on  4  treatments/ patient/ year and the prevalence of the disease (number of patients in Europe).

The  outcome  of  MAH`s  approach  is  a  PEC  below  the  trigger  value  of  10ng/L  for  a  phase  II assessment. It should be pointed out that the guideline EMEA/CHMP/4447/00 assumes in phase I that one percent of the population is treated with the product on a given day. Therefore an annual dose for one  patient  is  not  acceptable  for  PEC  calculation.  An  Fpen  refinement  in  phase  I  would  only  be possible  on  published  prevalence  data  for  the  disease/indication.  The  MAH  has  provided  data  on number of patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta.

Subsequently,  the  MAH  provided  a  full  Phase  II-Tier  A  environmental  risk  assessment  (EAR)  for zoledronic acid. From the MAH's point of view, this ERA showed that there is no concern for the environmental  compartments  considered  in  this  assessment,  i.e.  sewage  treatment  plants,  surface waters, groundwaters, sediments and soils.

Due to the properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, zoledronic acid, analytical verification of test substance concentrations has not been possible for all concentrations tested. The available UV photometric detection at 209 nm for zoledronic acid enables the analysis of concentrations down to 1.97  mg/L.  As  effective  concentrations  of  zoledronic  acid  in  Daphnia  magna  and  fish  have  been observed in the μ g/L range, the development of a more sensitive LC-MS method was tackled.

The  following  problems  have  been  identified  impeding  the  development  of  a  suitable  analytical method for zoledronic acid:

-  The volatility is poor so no GC analysis is possible.
-  The test  item  is  a  poor  chromophor  and  thus  HPLC-UV  analysis  can  only be  performed  at very high concentrations.
-  The test item is highly polar with acidic and alkaline groups making it difficult to concentrate the test item.
-  Zoledronic acid forms complexes with the calcium ions present in test media used for aquatic toxicity tests.

Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates, which is specifically mentioned in the OECD guidance  document  on  aquatic  toxicity  testing  of  difficult  substances  and  mixtures  (OECD,  2000. OECD Series on Testing and Assessment Number 23). In Chapter 3.7 on 'Complexing substances', the authors of this document come to the conclusion that 'Analysis methods for quantifying exposure concentrations,  which  are  capable  of  distinguishing  between  the  complexed  and  non-complexed fraction of a test substance, may not always be available or economic. Where this is the case approval should  be  sought  from  the  regulatory  authority  for  expressing  the  test  results  in  terms  of  nominal concentrations.'  Following  these  recommendations,  the  environmental  toxicity  and  fate  testing  has been conducted to the extent possible with zoledronic acid. The effective concentrations in the aquatic toxicity  tests  have  been  expressed  as  nominal  concentrations  calculated  from  the  higher  test

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations,  which  could  be  verified  with  the  previously  implemented  UV  spectrophotometric method.

Zoledronic acid contains 5 acidic groups and 1 basic group (imidazole ring) and is not present as a neutral substance over a wide pH range, including environmentally relevant pHs (see Figure 4-1).

Figure 4-1 Calculated logD values for zoledronic acid range from -3.1 at pH 2 to 7.4 to -7.6 at pH 12.

Based  on  the  properties  of  zoledronic  acid  as  an  ionisable  substance,  a  significant  potential  to accumulate  in  aquatic  organisms  is  therefore  highly  unlikely  in  the  MAH's  opinion.  Moreover,  an experimental  determination  of  an  octanol-water  partition  coefficient  will  also  be  impeded  by  the properties of zoledronic acid described above, hindering the development of a suitable HPLC method for the analytical determination of partitioned substance in water and octanol.

Therefore, the experimental  determination  of an octanol-water partition coefficient is neither technically feasible nor indicated based on the known physico-chemical properties of zoledronic acid.

As the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) is 0.02 µg/L, which exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L a Phase II - Tier A ERA assessment was needed. The Phase II - Tier A environmental risk assessment  indicated  no  concern  for  surface  water,  ground  water  and  microorganisms  in  sewage treatment plants.

With  reference  to  the  determination  of  transformation  half-life  in  sediments  and  total  systems  the OECD 308 demonstrated significant shifting of Zoledronic acid and its transformation products to the sediment (&gt;90% as well as bound residues and free substance in total). The CHMP requested a test on lumbriculus  (OECD  225to  be  undertaken.  The  MAH  agreed  to  conduct  this  test  as  a  Follow-Up Measure.

## 1.3 Clinical aspects

The clinical development program to support the treatment of children with severe OI comprised two studies. The core randomized, active-controlled open-label Study H2202 was conducted to demonstrate  both  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the  target  population  over 12 months. The open-label extension Study H2202E1 provides an additional 12 months of treatment data  with  zoledronic  acid  in  the  patient  population  who  completed  the  controlled  study  H2202 regardless of the treatment received in the original core study.

## GCP compliance

According  to  the  MAH  all  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  requirements  of Directive 2001/20/EC and with the ICH E6 guideline on Good Clinical Practice and the principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All studies were closely monitored by Novartis personnel or a contract organization for compliance to the protocol and the procedures described in it.

No new pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies were performed for this submission.

## 1.3.1  Clinical Efficacy

## 1.3.1.1  Main study H2202

Study H2202 was an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel efficacy and safety trial  of  intravenous  Zoledronic  acid  compared  to  intravenous  pamidronate  in  children  with  severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).

## Methods

## Study Participants

Approximately 132 children 1 to 17 years of age with severe OI were to be randomized (66 patients per treatment group) in order to obtain 120 evaluable patients for the primary efficacy variable. The main inclusion criteria were:

- -Children, male or female, between 1 and 17 years of age, all inclusive.
- -Any child with phenotypic OI type III or IV.
- -Any  child  with  phenotypic  OI  type  I  who  had ≥ 3  minimal  trauma  fractures  (including  vertebral fractures) in the previous 2 years or with a history of limb deformity requiring surgery.

The  washout  period  for  other  metabolic  bone  therapies,  in  particular  for  bisphosphonates,  prior  to study drug administration at visit 2 was:

-  If used for &gt;12 months, the washout period was 12 months.
-  If used for 4 -≤ 12 months, the washout period was 6 months.
-  If used for ≤ 3 months, there was no washout period.

A 'use' could be daily or weekly oral bisphosphonate or every 3 months intravenous injections, where one dose by i.v. injection = 3 months' use if the patient received the complete dose over the 3 day period (e.g. pamidronate 3 mg/kg was given as 1 mg/kg/day over 3 consecutive days as 4 hour i.v. infusions;  therefore,  the  total  dose  of  three  infusions  over  3  days  was  considered  equivalent  to 3 months' use).

All patients must have completed 2 weeks of treatment with an appropriate dose of vitamin D daily and  elemental  calcium  (or  equivalent  described  in  the  protocol)  daily  (prestudy  and/or  within  the screening period) prior to the first administration of zoledronic acid or pamidronate.

## Treatments

Patients were randomized to either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in a 1:1 ratio.

Zometa dose selection for the core study was based on several sources available at the time of protocol development:  adults  with  benign  disease  safely  received  up  to  5  mg  i.v.  infusion  over  15  minutes. Compared to pamidronate, Zometa 4 mg was more efficacious than 90 mg pamidronate in patients with  TIH  or  metastatic  cancers  to  the  bone.  These  approved  doses  of  zoledronic  acid  (4  mg)  and pamidronate (90 mg) in adults for oncology indications are equal to an approximate dose of zoledronic acid of 0.07 mg/kg or pamidronate 1.5 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult. In a long-term paediatric pamidronate OI study, pamidronate 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg was tested and the dose range was safe and efficacious. Agespecific dose range of zoledronic acid being administrated as an i.v. infusion in this paediatric trial is comparable  to  that  of  pamidronate.  Therefore,  the  higher  zoledronic  acid  dose  selected  in  children 3 years of age or older, 0.05 mg/kg, was expected to provide similar safety and efficacy (demonstrated with BMD measurements) compared to that previously reported for pamidronate in OI patients. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

maximum allowable zoledronic acid dose of 4 mg (regardless of patient weight), does not exceed the 4 mg single dose that has been used in adults.

A  dose  of  zoledronic  acid  equivalent  to  that  administered  to  adults  with  other  metabolic  bone conditions is approximately 0.05 mg/kg (maximum of 4.0 mg). This is the zoledronic acid dose range comparable to pamidronate 90 mg which has been studied in patients with OI.

The doses of zoledronic acid to be administered as an i.v. infusion at a peripheral site, based on age and body weight are presented below.

Table9-1 Zoledronic acid pediatric dosing schedule

| Age           | Dose ofzoledronic acid                          | Frequency                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 to<3 years  | 0.025 mg/kg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline t | 30 to 45 minute infusion every 3 months |
| 3 to 17 years | 0.05 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of normal saline   | 30 minute infusion every 3 months       |

´

Body weight was measured at each dose administration visit, for calculation of the dose. Patients aged 3 to 17 years were to receive 0.05 mg/kg of zoledronic acid up to a maximum of 4 mg. Patients aged 1 to &lt;3 years were to receive a lower zoledronic acid dose of 0.025 mg/kg up to a maximum of 2 mg, until  they  reached  their  third  birthday.  If  a  2  year  old  patient  had  a  birthday  during  the  study,  the zoledronic  acid  dose  was  to  be  increased  from  0.025  to  0.05  mg/kg  at  the  next  scheduled  dose administration  visit.  To  enable  accurate  dosing  in  the  children  aged  &lt;3  years,  zoledronic  acid  was provided in 5 mg/100 mL vials.

The doses of pamidronate to be administered as an i.v. infusion at a peripheral site, based on age and body weight, are presented below.

Table9-2 Pamidronate pediatric dosing schedule

| Age           | Doseofpamidronatet   | Frequency                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 to<2 years  | 0.5 mg/kg/day        | 4 hour infusion on each of 3 successive days, every2months   |
| 2 years       | 0.75 mg/kg/day       | 4 hour infusion on each of 3 successive days, every3 months  |
| 3 to 17 years | 1.0 mg/kg/day        | 4 hour infusion on each of 3 successive days, every 3 months |

Body  weight  was  measured  at  each  dose  administration  visit,  for  calculation  of  the  dose.  The pamidronate dose was not to exceed 60 mg per day for any patient (total of 180 mg over 3 days). The volume  of  the  infusion  was  the  same  on  each  successive  day  except  on  the  first  day  of  the  first infusion cycle for pamidronate (day 1 of visit 2), when only half of the patient's calculated daily dose was infused to mitigate initial post-dose symptoms. Pamidronate patients followed the same dosing schedule assigned to them at randomization throughout the study, regardless of age increases.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 relative to  baseline  in  zoledronic  acid-treated  paediatric  patients  with  severe  OI  compared  to  pamidronatetreated  paediatric  patients  who  were ≥ 1  year  to ≤ 17  years  of  age.  The  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid would  be  considered  demonstrated,  if  it  was  shown  to  be  noninferior  to  pamidronate  (i.e.  the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density after 12 months is less than 13% inferior to pamidronate).

The secondary objectives were:

- -To assess the change in Z-score of the lumbar spine at month 12 relative to baseline in zoledronic acid-treated  patients  with  severe  osteogenesis  imperfecta  compared  to  pamidronate  in  children ≥ 1 year to ≤ 17 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -To assess the effect of zoledronic acid on the change in femoral neck bone mineral content (BMC) after 6 and 12 months of treatment relative to baseline compared to pamidronate in children ≥ 1 year to ≤ 17 years of age.
- -To assess  the  effect  of  zoledronic  acid  on  the  number  of  clinical  fractures  that  occurred  over  a 1-year period compared to pamidronate in children ≥ 1 year to ≤ 17 years of age.
- -To  assess  the  effect  of  zoledronic  acid  on  the  change  in  bone  resorption  and  bone  formation markers  after  6  and  12  months  of  treatment  relative  to  baseline  compared  to  pamidronate  by measuring  the  following  bone  markers  in  serum:  bone  specific  alkaline  phosphatase  (BSAP) (formation), N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) (formation), and C-telopeptide (CTx) (resorption) in children ≥ 3 years to ≤ 17 years of age.
- -To  assess  the  effect  of  zoledronic  acid  on  the  change  in  supine  length  (or  height)  after  6  and 12 months  of  treatment  relative  to  baseline  compared  to  pamidronate  in  children ≥ 1  year  to ≤ 17 years of age.
- -To assess the effect of zoledronic acid on the change in bone pain, using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale, relative to baseline compared to pamidronate in children ≥ 1 year to ≤ 17 years of age.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy variable was percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 relative to baseline. Secondary efficacy variables were the following:

- -Change from baseline in lumbar spine Z-score at month 12: applies only to patients aged ≥ 3 years imaged on the Hologic equipment and patients aged ≥ 5 years imaged on the Lunar equipment for whom there are validated normative ranges
- -Change from baseline in femoral neck BMC at month 6 and 12
- -Number of clinical fractures over a year (frequency and time to first fracture)

## Sample size

The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  demonstrate  that  zoledronic  acid  (0.025  mg/kg  or 0.05 mg/kg, dependent upon age) is not inferior to pamidronate (1.5 mg/kg, 2.25 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg total dose over three days, dependent upon age) in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, with respect to the percentage change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD) at month 12 relative to  baseline.  A  previous  study  suggests  that  the  annualized  percentage  change  in  LS  BMD  after treatment is as much as 42% (SD 29%).

μ P and μ Z were defined as the population means of annualized percentage change in LS BMD for the pamidronate and zoledronic acid patients, respectively, and Δ = μ Z μ P the treatment difference. The null hypothesis that zoledronic acid is more than 13% inferior to pamidronate (H0 : Δ ≤ -13%) was tested,  or  was  rejected  in  favor  of  the  alternative  hypothesis  that  zoledronic  acid  is  less  than  13% inferior to pamidronate (HA : Δ &gt; -13%). In testing this hypothesis, it was assumed that the standard deviations  for  two  treatments  were  the  same  under  H0  and  HA  and  that  zoledronic  acid  had approximately a 2% advantage with respect to the annualized percentage change in LS BMD under HA relative to pamidronate. Therefore, given a two-sample t-test with 80% power and a one-sided level of significance of 0.025 to detect a non-inferiority margin of 13%, approximately 60 evaluable patients per treatment group were necessary. Assuming a 5% adjustment for dropouts and missing data for  LS  BMD,  the  total  sample  size  required  in  the  study  was  approximately  132  patients  (66  per group).

## Statistical methods

The 2-sided 95% CI, based on t-distribution, for the difference of percentage change from baseline in LS  BMD  between  the  two  treatment  groups  was  calculated.  The  noninferiority  and  superiority  of zoledronic acid relative to pamidronate were assessed by comparing the lower bound of the 95% CI to a pre-defined non-inferiority margin (-13%) in the ITT, per-protocol and completers populations.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline value as a covariate, treatment, region, gender and puberty stage as factors  was  fitted  for  all  efficacy  variables  except  fracture  and  WongBaker FACES score. Cox's proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier estimate with log-rank test

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were used to compare the risk of fracture, and the t-test was used to compare the number of fractures per patient during treatment between the two treatment groups. Descriptive statistics was provided to summarize the Wong-Baker FACES pain scores.

In the ANCOVA model applied to changes in biomarkers, a loge transformation of the ratio of the on treatment  value  at  a  visit  relative  to  baseline  value  (relative  change)  was  used  in  the  analysis  to approximate  normality.  A  non-parametric  ANCOVA  model  based  on  rank  scores  was  used  as  a confirmatory analysis for the percentage change from baseline in LS BMD at month 6 and 12 when the assumption of normality was not valid.

All hypothesis tests were evaluated at a 0.05 level of significance, and no adjustments for multiplicity were  performed  for  any  of  secondary  variables.  No  interim  analysis  was  performed  for  any  of  the efficacy variables.

## Results

## Participant flow

A  total  of  155  patients  were  randomized  out  of  the  205  patients  screened.  A  screening  log  was maintained  at  each  center  but  records  of  screen  failures  were  not  entered  in  the  clinical  database. Therefore frequency and reasons for screen failures were not summarized in the report. Patients were randomized at 20 centers in 9 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, South Africa, Hungary, Poland, Finland: 1 center each, Great Britain: 3 centers, USA: 10 centers). The first patient was enrolled on 26 June 2003 (first patient screened) and the last patient completed on 09 May 2007.

The majority of patients in both groups completed the study. Reasons for discontinuation were similar in each group, namely withdrawal of consent, AE or lost to follow up at comparable frequencies. Only 2 patients in each group discontinued because of AEs.

The proportions of patients with major protocol deviations were similar in the two treatment groups.

Lack of valid baseline or month 12 lumbar spine BMD assessments were the most frequent cause of major PDs.

All  patients  received  randomized  study  medication,  as  assigned,  except  one  pamidronate  treated patient  (GBR/0403/00007) who received hospital supply of drug for the first infusion due to issues

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with delivery of study drug. Three randomized patients (1 zoledronic acid, 2 pamidronate) were not administered any study drug and were excluded from all analyses.

## Baseline data

The  characteristics  matched  the  intended  target,  paediatric  population  including  children  aged  1  to 17 years: 51% were between 9 and 17 years of age, 41% were aged 3 to 8 years, 7% were 2 years old and one child in each group was just 1 year old. Most children were Caucasian (84%) and there was a slightly higher proportion of boys versus girls particularly in the pamidronate group (zoledronic acid boys vs. girls:  51%  vs.  49%,  pamidronate  boys  vs. girls:  59%  vs.  41%).  Otherwise  the  two  groups were comparable.

Children with OI type I accounted for 49% of the study subjects overall. Some imbalance was noted in terms of the distribution across the 3 OI types, in that a higher proportion of pamidronate patients had OI type IV (zoledronic acid 24%, pamidronate 34%).

Almost all the children (97%) had a history of fracture, approximately 45% had undergone surgical correction of deformities, 50% of zoledronic acid patients and 43.4% of pamidronate patients used a mobility aid at baseline, and 27% and 25% respectively were using a wheelchair.

Mean and median number of fractures per patient in the last 12 months prior to this study (mean 3.0 vs. 2.3) and in the children's lifetimes (mean 18.9 vs. 16.5) were slightly higher in the zoledronic acid group versus pamidronate. A similar proportion of children in each group had suffered at least one fracture in the 12 months before this study (zoledronic acid 77%, pamidronate 79%).

There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  baseline characteristics, except for serum calcium with a higher baseline mean value in the pamidronate group (p=0.0024).

## Numbers analysed

155 patients were randomized (zoledronic acid 75, pamidronate 80). The efficacy analysis comprised 150 patients in the ITT population (zoledronic acid 74,pamidronate 76); 152 patients were analyzed for safety (zoledronic acid 74, pamidronate 78) and 11 patients were analyzed for PK of zoledronic acid (4 aged 3-8 years, 7 aged 9-17 years).

## Outcomes and estimation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary analysis of the percentage change in lumbar  spine (LS) BMD at month 12 relative to baseline in the ITT (LOCF) population demonstrated that the estimated effects on BMD were similar between zoledronic acid and pamidronate with an 8.06% greater increase in LS BMD and lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 0.42%. This result was confirmed by analyses in the per-protocol and completers population and by a non-parametric ANCOVA model in the ITT (LOCF) population.

Note: N = number of patients with measurements at both baseline and month 12 visit, as determined by the visit windows after imputation by LOCF, the last observed value carried forward, if applicable. LOCF applied to ITT population only.

(1) Mean, mean difference (zoledronic acid minus pamidronate) and 95% Cl of mean difference are based on t-dhstribution.

BMD change from baseline was greater in OI type III  or  IV  patients  than  in  OI  type  I  patients  at Months. It seems that increase in LS BMD was higher with zoledronic acid than pamidronate in both subgroups although p values are not provided.

## Serum biomarkers of bone turnover

Serum  biomarkers  of  bone  turnover  were  measured  in  patients  aged ≥ 3  years  from  fasting  blood samples.

For all three biomarkers of bone turnover, zoledronic acid had a greater effect than pamidronate on reducing resorption and formation from baseline. The relative change from baseline was statistically significantly greater at month 6 and month 12 for zoledronic acid compared to pamidronate.

N = number of patients with non-missing data at each specific visit, as determined by visit windows.

(1) Back transformed Least Squares Mean (LSM).

- (3) The 95% Cl is calculated by inversing the log(e)(ratio) transfommation. The ratio = endpoint/baseline. The pvalue is obtained from an analysis of covariance on log(e)(ratio) with log(e) base ine as covariate, treatment, region, gender and puberty stage as factors.

(2) Relative treatment difference = exponential of the difference in LSM on the log(e) scale or the geometric LSM on the original scale. For values less than 1, zoledronic acid has a greater reduction than pamidronate.

(1) P-value is from Fisher's exact test; Hazard ratio and 95% Cl of zoledronic acid vs. pamidronate is computed from a Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment, region, gender and puberty stage as factors. A hazard ratio &lt;1 implies that a zoledronic acid-treated patient has a lower risk of having a fracture than 3 pamidronate-treated patient.

(2) P-value is from Kaplan-Meier log-rank test.

NA, = Not available due to ≤50% of the patients having experienced an event during this time period.

Fractures are based on medlical history at baseline, and radiograph or radlographic interpretation reports post-baseline.

P 1: p-value between treatment groups from two-sample t-test.

n = number of patients with values at baseline. If a patient did not report any cEnical fractures during the study, the number of fractures for this patient post-base Ine is zero.

P2: p-value within treatment group by comparing the post-baseline with baseline values using paired t-test.

Fewer patients had clinical fractures in the 12 months of the study compared with the 12 months prior to randomization, with decreases in the proportions of patients with fractures from 77% to 43% in the zoledronic acid group and 79% to 41% in the pamidronate group (ITT population).

Overall, the incidence of fracture during treatment with zoledronic acid (43.2%) versus pamidronate (40.8%) was similar (p=0.8687, hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 - 1.72) and the Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to clinical fracture were comparable.

However, rates of clinical fracture by OI type subgroup, I / III or IV, showed a higher incidence with zoledronic acid relative to pamidronate in the OI type I patients (zoledronic acid 50.0%, pamidronate 28.6%, hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI 0.96 - 4.69) and a lower incidence relative to pamidronate in the OI type  III  or  IV  patients  (zoledronic  acid  36.1%,  pamidronate  51.2%,  hazard  ratio  0.59,  95% CI 0.29 - 1.19).

Within  treatment  groups,  the  overall  mean  reductions  of  1.96  fractures/patient/year  with  zoledronic acid treatment and 1.55 fractures/patient/year with pamidronate treatment were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001 in both groups). Similarly, reductions in fracture rates were observed in each of the OI type subgroups. The highest mean reductions in fractures/patient/year were seen in the OI type I subgroup (reductions: zoledronic acid 2.21 fractures/patient/year p&lt;0.0001, pamidronate 2.23 p&lt;0.0001), while those  in  the  OI  type  III  or  IV  subgroups  were  lower  (reductions:  zoledronic  acid  1.71  p&lt;0.05, pamidronate 0.97 p&lt;0.05).

The comparison of treatments regarding fracture rates showed no statistically significant differences between zoledronic acid and pamidronate.

## Bone pain

Summaries of bone pain scores using Wong-Baker FACES, for all patients and by OI type subgroups, did not show any marked, consistent differences between zoledronic acid and pamidronate treatments at any time during the study versus the baseline pain assessment.

At baseline and post-baseline assessments the majority of patients or their legal guardian reported 'no hurt' or 'hurts little bit'. Some imbalance at baseline was observed in the OI type I subgroup where 30 (79%) of patients in the zoledronic acid group compared to 21 (60%) of patients in the pamidronate group reported 'no hurt'. With high proportions of patients having none or very little pain at baseline, improvements in pain status post-baseline relative to baseline were difficult to detect.

## 1.3.1.2  Study H2202E1

This  was  a  one-year,  international,  multicenter,  randomized,  open-label,  parallel-group,  safety  and efficacy study extending treatment to paediatric patients with severe OI who completed the first year of  treatment  in  core  Study  H2202,  stratifying  extension  zoledronic  acid  regimens  (once  or  twice yearly)  by  core  treatment  (zoledronic  acid  or  pamidronate).  The  first  visit  of  the  extension  study coincided with the final visit of study H2202.

The once yearly treatment group had 1 dosing visit (extension visit 1 at month 12 relative to the core baseline) when patients received a zoledronic acid infusion (0.025 mg/kg in children 1 to &lt; 3 years of age and 0.05 mg/kg in children 3 to 17 years of age).

The  twice  yearly  treatment  group  had  two  dosing  visits  (extension  visit  1  and  extension  visit  4  at month 18 relative to the core baseline).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  was  conducted  according  to  Good  Clinical  Practice,  randomizing  103  patients  into zoledronic acid once a year or twice a year treatment group. With previous treatment assignment in the core  study,  the  treatment  assignment  over  the  2-year  core-extension  are  displayed  as  the  following 4 study groups: 25 zol-zol 1x/yr, 27 zol-zol 2x/yr, 24 pam-zol 1x/yr, 27 pam-zol 2x/yr.

The primary objective of Study H2202E1 was to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly zoledronic acid over a 12 month extension treatment period in patients aged who had completed one year of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. Continued efficacy of zoledronic acid was a secondary objective of the extension study.

Baseline values for lumbar spine BMD and Z-score and total body BMC are from the core study.

Lumbar spine Z-score data includes only patients aged ≥3 years imaged on the Hologic equipment and patients aged ≥5 years imaged on the Lunar equipment which have manufacturer validated normative ranges.

The  population  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  open-label  extension  were  similar  to those of the initial study. Mean LS BMD, LS Z-score and total body BMC were lowest at baseline for patients  who  were  in  the  extension  zoledronic  acid  once-yearly  group  of  the  core  zoledronic  acid stratum (zol-zol 1x/yr) and highest in the pam-zol 1x/yr group.

Patients were grouped by core treatment stratum (zoledronic acid or pamidronate) and extension study zoledronic acid regimen (1x/yr or 2x/yr). The majority of patients in each treatment group completed the extension study. Seven patients discontinued for administrative problems, namely the termination of the study as per the recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board. They were brought in for their final visit earlier than intended and therefore did not complete the study as originally planned. All 7 of these patients received the first study drug infusion and one patient in the zol-zol 2x/yr group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

also had the second infusion at 6 months. Two of these 7 patients completed 3 months, one 4 months, two 6 months and two 9 months of the planned 12 month extension study period.

The extension study was terminated early at the recommendation of the DSMB who in their review of unblinded  interim  safety  and  efficacy  data  had  observed  an  'excess  fracture  risk'  that  'had  not changed from the core' study (see discussion in safety section below). The changes in study conduct necessary to terminate the extension study were communicated to the investigators.

As  noted  assessment  of  continued  efficacy  and  disease  control  over  an  additional  12  months  in paediatric  patients  with  severe  OI  who  completed  the  core  study  was  a  secondary  objective  in extension.

Median percentage increases in LS BMD from core baseline to month 24 (LOCF) were 56.7%, 50.7%, 43.4% and 44.3% in the zol-zol 1x/yr (n=22), zol-zol 2x/yr (n=21), pam-zol 1x/yr (n=22) and pam-zol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2x/yr (n=22) groups, respectively. There is no apparent efficacy advantage in LS BMD of the twice a year zoledronic acid regimen over the once yearly regimen.

Sustained  decreases  in  median  values  of  serum  biomarkers  of  bone  resorption β -CTx  and  bone formation P1NP and BSAP were observed in all treatment groups over 24 months, however, both bone resorption and formation remained active at month 24.

The majority of patients  reported  'no  hurt'  in  the  Wong-Baker  FACES  pain  scores  throughout  the 24 month treatment period with no clinically relevant changes in the distribution of scores within or between treatment groups.

The proportion of patients who had clinical fractures in the 24 months of treatment was higher in the core  pamidronate  stratum  (34/51  patients,  66.7%)  compared  to  the  core  zoledronic  acid  stratum (29/52 patients,  55.8%).  All  treatment  regimens  reduced  the  proportion  of  patients  with  clinical fractures during the extension phase compared to the 12 months before the study when 41/51 (80.4%) and  41/52  (78.8%)  patients  reported  fractures  in  the  pamidronate  and  zoledronic  acid  strata, respectively.

Over the combined 24 months of treatment, patients who sustained a clinical fracture in the zoledronic acid  stratum  had  a  higher  mean  (3.3)  and  median  (2.0)  number  of  clinical  fractures  per  patient compared  to  those  in  the  pamidronate  stratum  (mean  2.1,  median  1.0).  However,  due  to  the  small sample sizes these analyses should be interpreted with caution.

## 1.3.1.3  Overall conclusion on clinical efficacy

The clinical development program to support the treatment of children with severe OI comprised two studies. The core randomized, active-controlled open-label Study H2202 was conducted to demonstrate  both  the  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the  target  population  over 12 months. The open-label extension Study H2202E1 provides an additional 12 months of treatment data  with  zoledronic  acid  in  the  patient  population  who  completed  the  controlled  study  H2202 regardless of the treatment received in the original core study.

Zometa dose selection was based on several sources: adults with benign disease safely received up to 5 mg i.v.  infusion  over  15  minutes.  Compared  to  pamidronate,  Zometa  4  mg  was  more  efficacious than 90 mg pamidronate in patients with TIH or metastatic cancers to the bone. Doses in adults for oncology  indications  are  equal  to  an  approximate  dose  of  zoledronic  acid  of  0.07  mg/kg  or pamidronate 1.5 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult. In a long-term paediatric pamidronate OI study, pamidronate 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg was tested and the dose range was safe and efficacious. Age-specific dose range of zoledronic acid being administrated as an i.v. infusion in this paediatric trial is comparable to that of pamidronate. The maximum allowable zoledronic acid dose of 4 mg (regardless of patient weight), does  not  exceed  the  4  mg  single  dose  that  has  been  used  in  adults.  A  dose  of  zoledronic  acid equivalent  to  that  administered  to  adults  with  other  metabolic  bone  conditions  is  approximately 0.05 mg/kg (maximum of 4.0 mg). This is the zoledronic acid dose range comparable to pamidronate 90 mg which has been studied in patients with OI.

Notwithstanding the more recently identified subtypes of OI (type VII and VIII), where a recessive inheritance  was  found  and  mutations  of  additional  genes  involved  in  the  cellular  machinery responsible  for  synthesis  and  output  of  type  I  collagen  were  noticed,  it  is  held  that  OI  diagnosed according to the Sillence classification is a heterogeneous condition, both clinically and pathogenetically.  Silence  types  III  and  IV  are  deforming  variants  that  are  associated  with  variable severity  of  growth  retardation  and  limb  deformity.  The  phenotype  is  a  consequence  of  a  genetic mutation  affecting  the  structure  of  the  type  1  collagen  molecule.  The  qualitative  defects  of  the extracellular  matrix  account  for  distinctly  low  mineral  bone  mass  at  an  early  age,  impaired  bone growth  and  severe  deformities.  In  contrast,  a  number  of  cases  of  less  deforming  or  even  nondeforming  OI  type  I  are  the  result  of  mutations  affecting  the  production  and/or  the  output  from osteoblasts of otherwise normal type 1 collagen. Bone cell biology, bone mineral content, frequency and location of fractures, and the response to antiresorptive medication in the paediatric age from 1 to 17 years, are conceivably different among OI types.

Clinical consequences of the differences involve the phenotype, which is usually milder in type I than in  the  two  other  types  and,  on  the  other  hand,  is  usually  most  severe  in  type  III.  The  majority  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

individuals  affected  with  this  type  do  not  walk  without  assistance,  and  a  number  of  them  use  a wheelchair because of marked bone fragility and deformities. It is reasonable to think that also bone resorption and bone turnover rate be different among types, the excess being more apparent in cases of recognized  structural abnormalities  of  the collagen  triple  helix.  Accordingly,  the  response  to antiresorptive bisphosphonates, when studied as changes of BMD from baseline is conceivably greater in such cases, as indeed was noticed in the MAH's studies (post-hoc analyses).

Children with type I accounted for half of the study subjects overall. Moreover, the pamidronate arm had  a  higher  percentage  of  cases  with  the  more  severe  types.  A  number  of  cases  had  received metabolic bone therapies prior to study. Due to long-term skeletal accumulation of bisphosphonates, the chosen washout periods were questionable. Dietary calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and sex hormone levels were not systematically assessed. 25-OH Vitamin D was measured at screening before study H2202 after supplementation if necessary (distribution of patients in classes of hypovitaminosis is  not  provided).  Measurements  of  levels  of  25-OHD  were  made  for  safety  purposes  (and  not efficacy), as a precaution to minimize the risk of developing clinically apparent hypocalcemia upon first administration of study drug. Briefly, heterogeneity of the study population for pathogenesis and endocrine  signals  to bone  at the time  of starting  therapy  was  inadequately  addressed;  as  a consequence, overall interpretation of results - either efficacy or safety - has important limitations. Official  positions  of  qualified  scientific  societies  state  that  in  children  fracture  prediction  should primarily  take  into  account  fracture  of  long  bones  in  the  lower  extremities,  together  with  vertebral compression fractures, or two or more  long-bone fractures of the upper extremities.  DXA measurements  should  be  part  of  a  comprehensive  skeletal  health  assessment,  and  therapeutic interventions  should  not  be  based  on  a  single  DXA  measurement.  Pertinently,  DXA  measures  an 'areal' bone density (BMC/projection area). The areal BMD (g/cm2) is particularly deceptive when measured in growing patients. The influence of body (and bone) size must always be considered, not only for the initial assessment but also in the follow-up of growing patients; otherwise, for example, a subject might appear to have an increased BMD while this could be an artefact due to an increased bone size.  Correction  methods  are  used  to  attenuate  difficulties  in  BMD  assessment  when  children with osteoporosis are studied longitudinally.

Although the PDCO recommended a randomization of patients among the different subtypes of OI, to allow proper assessment of the benefit/risk per subtype of OI, randomisation was carried out by sites and  not  by  OI  type.  The  MAH  has  provided  a  posthoc  analysis  on  efficacy  among  the  different subtypes of OI. However, this did not provide additional, convincing information on the benefit/risk for  subtype  of  OI.  The  chosen  criteria  for  clinically  assessing  the  efficacy  'within-treatment'  and 'after-treatment' are based mostly on BMD changes and are therefore questionable.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  in  study  H2202  was  percentage  change  in  lumbar  spine  BMD  at month 12  relative  to  baseline  and  secondary  endpoints  were  change  from  baseline  in  lumbar  spine Z-score at month 12, change from baseline in femoral neck BMC at month 6 and 12 and number of clinical fractures over a year. A total of 155 patients were randomized out of the 205 patients screened.

Discontinuation rates and major protocol deviations were similar in the two groups. At baseline some imbalances were noted with respect to gender, the 3 OI subtypes and number of fractures between the two treatment groups. The study showed that estimated effects on the primary endpoint were similar between zoledronic acid and pamidronate in terms of the primary endpoint of increase in LS-BMD after 12 months of treatment. This was also supported regarding sustained reductions in serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation. With respect to fractures, the proportion of patients who had clinical  fractures  during  the  12  months  of  treatment  was  similar  between  the  zoledronic  acid  and pamidronate treatment groups. Similarly no significant differences were observed regarding LS-BMD Z-score  at  6  and  12 months  and  femoral  neck  and  total  body  BMC.  No  changes  from  baseline  or differences between the two treatments in Wong-Baker FACES pain assessments were detected.

The  open-label  extension  study  H2202E1,  designed  as  a  safety  study  with  secondary  efficacy parameters including small sample sizes, did not demonstrate any antifracture effect of zoledronic acid over pamidronate and median LS Z-score and total body BMC. During the extension period sustained

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decreases in median values of serum biomarkers of bone resorption and bone formation were observed in all treatments.

Although the estimated effects on BMD were similar, the trial design was not sufficiently robust to conclusively establish non-inferior efficacy for Zometa. In particular there was no conclusive evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. The hallmark of OI is the occurrence of fractures. It is not  clear  that  the  key  efficacy  parameter  'improvement  in  BMD  at  12  months  from  baseline' translated into clinical benefit for patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in terms of less fractures, less disability and less chronic bone pain. The pivotal study H2202 was neither designed nor powered to estimate  the  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid  on  fractures  or  other  clinically  relevant  outcome  measures. This lack of a clear relationship between surrogate and clinical efficacy parameter was also reflected by a high rate of new fractures after start of the two bisphosphonates.

Furthermore, the CHMP questioned the choice of comparator. Regarding the use of pamidronate as the active control the applicant argued that this selection was an acknowledgement of the product's ability to alter the natural disease course, improve the clinical status and quality of life in children and are referring  to  two  studies.  The  study  by  Glorieux  1998  showed  that  Cyclical  i.v.  treatment  with pamidronate was associated with a marked increase in BMD and physical activity increased markedly in these patients and decreased fracture rate. This study was an observational and uncontrolled study. In the study by Plotkin children younger than 3 years old pamidronate infusion every 2-4 months over a  increased  BMD, and decreased the rate of fracture. This was  also an observational study using a group of 'historical  controls'.  Despite  the  use  of  bisphosponates  in  clinical  practice  (off-label),  the scientific evidence for pamidronate in this indication is quite weak with regards to placebo-controlled studies:

- -the lack of a placebo-controlled  clinical study  in an indication without  a well-established pharmacological therapy was not sufficiently justified.
- in the absence of a well quantified effect of pamidronate versus placebo the choice of non-inferiority margin required further justification (see CPMP/EWP/2158/99).
-  it  has  not  been  established  that  the  study  has  adequate  assay  sensitivity,  so  that  any  important differences between active agents could be detected.

Therefore, the CHMP emphasized the weakness of the study design and considered this to be not sufficient in support of the proposed new indication.

Note: During the study, zoledronic acid was infused every 3 months (up to 4 doses); pamidronate was infused every 3 months (up to 4 doses) for patients ≥2 years of age and every 2 months (up to 6 doses) for patients ≤2 vearsofaqe.na=notapplicable

All patients in the extension study received at least one infusion of zoledronic acid, and 49/54 patients randomized to twice yearly zoledronic acid received two infusions, per protocol. Three patients did not receive the second infusion because of the early termination of the study when they were required to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinue  for  'administrative  problems'  (defined  as  incorrect  early  terminations  of  study  due  to administrative  errors).  For  the  other  2  patients  in  the  pam-zol  2x/yr  group  who  did  not  receive  the second infusion, one was lost to follow up and the other had only one infusion but was reported to have completed the study.

Another 3 patients were considered to be protocol deviators due to dosing errors or failure to follow protocol  procedures  in  the  event  of  additional  infusions:  1  patient  in  the  zol-zol  2x/yr  group  and 1 patient  in  the  pam-zol  1x/yr  group  had  dosing  errors  when  too  little  zoledronic  acid  was administered at the first infusion, however this was corrected within 2 weeks in both cases. One other patient in the zol-zol 2x/yr group received 2 additional infusions of zoledronic acid due to increased fatigue  secondary  to  severe  OI  but  did  not  discontinue  from  the  extension  study  as  required  per protocol.

AEs included are those starting or continuina in the relevant treatment period between infusions

Almost  all  patients  in  both  groups  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  the  study  (zoledronic  acid 95.9%,  pamidronate  97.4%).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  AEs  in  the  most  frequently  affected primary SOCs were similar between zoledronic acid and pamidronate. More patients in the zoledronic acid  treatment  group  experienced  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (zoledronic  acid 66% vs. pamidronate 51%) and GI disorders (zoledronic acid 50% vs. pamidronate 36%) than those treated with pamidronate.

Pyrexia  was  the  most  frequent  early  onset  AE,  affecting  approximately  50%  of  patients  in  both treatment groups. Hypocalcemia and vomiting occurred more frequently in the zoledronic acid group and with early onset relative to the first infusion in the great majority of cases. No hypocalcemia AEs were reported as late onset.

For  patients  receiving  pamidronate,  the  protocol-specified  procedure  to  infuse  only  half  of  the patient's calculated daily dose on the first day of the first infusion cycle (day 1 of visit 2). This was intended to reduce the risk of acute-phase reactions. This infusion procedure was not applicable for the first zoledronic acid infusion because it required 30 to 45 minutes infusion to be completed in a single dose. Hence early onset adverse events related to acute-phase reactions in the pamidronate group may have been fewer than could have been expected without the dose reduction on day 1.

Over the whole 12 month treatment period, pain in extremity, arthralgia and headache were the most frequent AEs and affected similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups.

Vomiting,  femur  fracture,  hypocalcemia  and  bone  pain  were  10%  or  more  (absolute  proportion) among zoledronic acid-treated patients than pamidronate-treated patients.

Common AEs contributing to the higher rates of musculoskeletal disorders with zoledronic acid versus pamidronate included bone pain and musculoskeletal pain, and for GI disorders vomiting and upper abdominal pain.

Acute-phase reactions were mainly observed after the first infusion and were much less frequent after subsequent infusions of either study drug. While  more  zoledronic acid-treated patients than pamidronate-treated  patients  presented  AEs  after  the  first  infusion,  this  difference  was  much  less marked after subsequent infusions.

In the extension study, the overall AE incidence was higher in the core zoledronic acid stratum than in the  core  pamidronate  stratum  (48  patients,  92.3%  vs.  37  patients,  72.6%).  The  most  noticeable difference  was  a  higher  frequency  of  core  zoledronic  acid  patients  with  AEs  in  the  infections  and infestations SOC.

For AEs affecting at least 10% of patients in any group, there were twice as many patients in the core zoledronic  acid  stratum  versus  the  core  pamidronate  stratum  who  experienced  muscle  spasms, nasopharyngitis, pain in extremity, fatigue, nausea, sinusitis, influenza, musculoskeletal chest pain and humerus fracture. Bone pain was the only AE affecting at least 10% of patients in any group and twice as many patients in the core pamidronate stratum versus the core zoledronic acid stratum.

AEs related to acute-phase reactions were the most frequent overall in the core study, as expected on first administration of bisphosphonate infusions, and such acute-phase reactions were infrequent in the extension. The most frequent AEs overall in the extension were fractures. However, the proportions of patients with fractures in core zoledronic acid and pamidronate strata during the extension phase were similar to those reported in the core study.

The incidence of suspected study drug related AEs reflected the pattern of early onset AEs after the first infusion. Pyrexia was the most frequent AE suspected to be study drug related in both groups and numerically  higher  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group.  Hypocalcemia,  vomiting  and  fatigue  were  by  far more frequent with zoledronic acid than pamidronate. Tachycardia was reported by the investigators as a suspected study drug related event in 5 (6.8%) zoledronic acid-treated patients and none in the pamidronate  group.  However,  6  patients  (8.1%)  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  4  (5.1%) pamidronate-treated patients experienced tachycardia, regardless of study drug relationship.

Tachycardia was the only suspected cardiac disorder occurring in at least 5% of a treatment group in this study.

AEs suspected to be study drug-related by the investigator were more frequent in the zol-zol 1x/yr group compared with the pam-zol 1x/yr group, 4 (16.0%) patients vs. none, respectively, but there was little  difference between the twice yearly groups, 3 (11.1%) patients vs. 4 (14.8%). Suspected study drug-related AEs reported by 2 patients over all extension treatments were pyrexia, hypercalcemia and pain in extremity; other study drugrelated AEs affected only single patients.

SAEs were more frequent with zoledronic acid than with pamidronate (32.4% versus 19.2%) mainly due to the higher rates of femur fracture, hypocalcemia and pyrexia observed with zoledronic acid. In fact in the core study hypocalcemia and pyrexia as suspected as drug related were not observed in the pamidronat group at all.

Hypocalcemia (6 patients) and blood calcium decreased (1 patient), reported as SAEs in 7 zoledronic acid-treated patients, occurred in the 3 days after the first zoledronic acid infusion and did not recur after subsequent infusions. Four of the 7 zoledronic acid patients reported symptoms of hypocalcemia, and 4 required either supplemental calcium or vitamin D. Two of these 7 patients had multiple early onset  SAEs:  one  patient  had  cough  with  sternal  pain,  dyspnea,  pyrexia,  chills  and  hypocalcemia, whereas another  patient  had  hypophosphatemia,  hypokalemia  and  hypocalcemia  -  events  consistent with the clinical picture of hypocalcemia (Study H2202).

Two  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  none  on  pamidronate  had  SAEs  leading  to discontinuation: one patient had bone pain in the right tibia one patient had a left arm fracture.

Thirteen zoledronic acid patients had SAEs involving fractures, 5 of whom had more than one fracture during the study. One patient sustained multiple fractures of the axial and appendicular skeleton after being struck by an automobile, and in another case skull fractures were due to a fall. Both patients had type III OI, a history of 100 fractures in their lifetimes and 10 - 20 fractures in the 12 months before randomization into this study. Only nine pamidronate patients had fracture SAEs, 4 of whom had more than one fracture during the study.

With respect to the patients who had fracture SAEs relative to the most recent study drug infusion, 6 out of 13 patients in the zoledronic acid group had fractures that occurred between the 1st and 2nd dose  and  5  of  these  were  femur  fractures.  In  the  pamidronate  group,  2  out  of  9  patients  had  SAE fractures between the 1st and 2nd cycles of pamidronate infusions, one femur fracture and the other lower limb fracture.

The overall incidence of SAEs  in the extension study was lower than in the core study (19/103 patients, 18.4% vs. 39/152 patients, 25.7%). The number and percentage of patients with any SAE  in  the  core  zoledronic  acid  stratum  versus  the  core  pamidronate  stratum  were  5  (20.0%)  in zol-zol 1x/yr vs. 3 (12.5%) in pam-zol 1x/yr and 6 (22.2%) in zol-zol 2x/yr vs. 5 (18.5%) in pam-zol 2x/yr.  The  majority  of  SAEs  were  attributed  to  the  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications SOC and primarily comprised the preferred terms of femur and tibia fractures.

The total number and proportion of patients who had any fracture reported as an AE during the study were comparable with both treatments.

Whereas the total number of fractures was similar in the treatment groups the frequency of fractures in lower extremity long bones were higher among zoledronic acid patients than pamidronate patients and contrastingly in upper extremity fractures were observed with higher frequency among pamidronate patients than zoledronic acid patients.

Other imbalances by type of fracture were less marked, and, in some cases, the non-specific nature of the  reports  and  hence  preferred  terms  make  between-treatment  comparison  by  fracture  type  not clinically meaningful.

The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  fracture  AEs  was  similar  in  the  zoledronic  and pamidronate  strata,  and  femur  or  tibia  fractures  were  most  frequent.  The  pam-zol  1x/yr  group  had fewer patients  with  fracture  AEs  than  the  pam-zol  2x/yr  group:  9  (37.5%)  patients  vs.  13  (48.1%), respectively. Whereas in the zol-zol 1x/yr and 2x/yr groups there was no relevant difference between the fracture rates: 11 (44.0%) patients vs. 11 (40.7%).

In the extension study, the cumulative incidence of total lower extremity long bone fracture (defined as femur, tibia, femoral neck or lower limb fracture) was 10 vs. 8 vs. 5 vs. 8 affecting 10 vs. 6 vs. 4 vs. 7 patients treated with zol-zol 1x/yr vs. zol-zol 2x/yr vs. pam-zol 1x/yr vs. pam-zol 2x/yr treatment group, respectively (some patients had more than one of these fracture types). The lowest incidence was found in the pam-zol 1x/yr group, the group with the lowest cumulative exposure to zoledronic acid,  but  having  the  highest  baseline  mean  and  median  lumbar  spine  BMD  compared  to  the  other treatment groups.

For femur fracture AEs (not including femoral neck fracture), the incidence of fracture both by core treatment  stratum  (8  [15.4%]  vs.  7  [13.7%]  patients  for  core  zoledronic  acid  vs.  core  pamidronate, respectively), and by extension treatment group (5 [20.0%] vs. 3 [11.1%] vs. 3 [12.5%] vs. 4 [14.8%] patients  for  zol-zol  1x/yr  vs.  zol-zol  2x/yr  vs.  pam-zol  1x/yr  vs.  pam-zol  2x/yr,  respectively)  was similar. During the extension study, the distribution of OI type I patients with femur fracture between core treatment strata was similar (3 in both strata) and also for OI type III and IV patients (5 vs. 4 in core  zoledronic  acid  vs.  core  pamidronate,  respectively).  During  the  extension  study,  four  of  the  8 patients with femur fracture in the core zoledronic acid stratum and 2 of the 7 in the core pamidronate stratum also had a femur fracture during the core study.

Although there were 7 patients who were not observed for the planned length of the study due to early study termination, overall, the incidence of femur fracture events did not increase in frequency over time. Similarly, there was no apparent relationship between the timing of the tibia fractures and the last dose of zoledronic acid either. It appeared that there was a similar distribution of femur fractures in  the  first  and  second  six  months  of  the  extension  study,  regardless  of  the  number  of  infusions administered.

十 AE reported as intermittent tachycardia

Tachycardia was the only cardiac disorder reported during this study.

Six patients in the zoledronic acid group and 4 in the pamidronate group had tachycardia AEs, 2 of which were intermittent tachycardia (1 in each group). All but one of these events occurred within 2 days of the start of a study drug infusion (zoledronic acid 6/6, pamidronate 3/4 patients), usually the first  infusion  (zoledronic  acid  5/6,  pamidronate  2/4  patients),  and  at  the  same  time  as  pyrexia,  a common symptom of  an  acute-phase  reaction  (zoledronic  acid  5/6,  pamidronate  3/4  patients).  The protocol-specified procedure to infuse pamidronate at half of the patient's calculated daily dose on the first day of the first infusion cycle (day 1 of visit 2) reduced the risk of acute-phase reaction in this treatment arm.

All 6 cases of tachycardia AEs in the zoledronic acid-treated patients resolved within 2 days of onset, and 5 were considered mild in severity requiring no action.

## Eye disorder AEs

All  eye  disorders  affected  6  (8.1%)  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  3  (3.8%)  in  the pamidronate group. The most frequently occurring eye disorders were eye irritation experienced by 3 patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  blurred  vision  in  2  pamidronate  patients.  Other  unique reports  of  eye  disorders  were  conjunctivitis,  eye  pruritus,  lacrimation  increased,  ocular  hyperemia, retinal dystrophy and visual disturbance in the zoledronic acid group and eye pain in a pamidronatetreated  patient.  Four  of  these  eye  disorders  occurred  in  one  zoledronic  acid-treated  patient.  In  the extension study eye disorders affected 1 (4.0%) patient with conjunctivitis in the zol-zol 1x/yr group, 1 (4.2%) patient with chalazion in the pam-zol 1x/yr group and 1 (3.7%) patient with conjunctivitis in the pam-zol 2x/yr group. There were no reported cases of uveitis or episcleritis.

No  severe  cases  of  eye  disorders  were  observed  and  no  obvious  imbalances  between  groups  were noted.

## Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) AEs

In  the  core  study,  one  patient  presented  to  the  study  with  'dental  caries,  peri-apical  abscess, bacteremia' and was further evaluated to confirm that no ONJ occurred. This case was followed up for more  detail  of  the  events  and  was  evaluated  by  the  independent  ONJ  adjudication  committee.  The evaluation  did  not  confirm  that  the  events  were  consistent  with  ONJ.  However,  ONJ  can  not  be excluded in paediatric population treated for this indication and it needs to be considered that in fact the sample size was too small to detect this adverse reaction.

## Laboratory findings Hypocalcemia AEs

Eighteen  zoledronic  acid  patients  (24.3%)  and  12  pamidronate  patients  (15.4%)  had  hypocalcemia AEs. All such events occurred as early onset AEs and usually after the first infusion only (zoledronic acid  17/18  patients,  pamidronate  9/12  patients).  For  3  patients,  hypocalcemia  AEs  recurred  after subsequent  infusions:  one  zoledronic  acid  patient  after  the  1st  and  3rd  infusions;  one  pamidronate patient after 1st and 2nd infusions; another pamidronate patient after 1st, 2nd and 3rd infusions. For one pamidronate patient, the hypocalcemia AE occurred after the third infusion only. In a few patients, concomitant hypophosphatemia (zoledronic acid: 2 patients) was also reported as an AE.

## Hematology notable values

Increased  lymphocytes,  platelets  and  eosinophils,  and  decreased  hematocrit,  mean  cell  volume  and neutrophils  were  common in both treatment groups  during  the study  treatment  period.  It  should  be noted  that  high  lymphocytes,  high  platelets,  low  mean  cell  volume  and  low  neutrophils  were  also common at baseline.

The incidence of hematology values outside the normal range any time during treatment with study drug showed some differences between treatments in terms of low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, high neutrophils  and  high  WBCs  all  of  which  were  more  frequent  with  zoledronic  acid,  whereas eosinophilia was more frequent with pamidronate treatment.

The most frequent (&gt; 20% of patients in any group) hematology values outside the normal ranges at any  time  post-extension  baseline  were  hemoglobin  &lt;  LLN,  hematocrit  &lt;  LLN,  mean  cell  volume &lt; LLN,  neutrophils  &lt;  LLN,  eosinophils  &gt;  ULN  and  lymphocytes  &gt;  ULN,  with  no  consistent differences between treatments for any parameter.

Mean and median decreases from baseline in total calcium and phosphate were found in both groups, slightly  more  with  zoledronic  acid  than  pamidronate.  The  decreases  were  most  evident  at  the 9-11 days  post-infusion  visit  after  the  first  infusion  (e.g.  mean  decrease  in  total  calcium  9-11  days post-first  infusion:  zoledronic  acid  -0.186  mmol/L,  pamidronate  -  0.159  mmol/L).  Mean  decreases from baseline at each subsequent dosing visit were lesser in magnitude.

Creatinine mean and median increases from baseline in both groups were highest at month 12 or the last  visit  (e.g.  mean  change  in  creatinine  at  last  visit:  zoledronic  acid  0.037  mg/dL,  pamidronate 0.046 mg/dL). Small mean decreases in blood urea nitrogen in the zoledronic acid group versus small mean  increases  in  the  pamidronate  group  were  noted  (e.g.  mean  change  in  BUN  at  last  visit: zoledronic acid -0.18 mmol/L, pamidronate 0.23 mmol/L).

No  clinically  meaningful  changes  were  observed  in  glucose,  magnesium  alkaline  phosphatase  or parathyroid hormone values.

The most frequent biochemistry values outside the normal ranges were those for calcium, phosphate, magnesium and albumin. High magnesium was found in about half the patients in both groups. High total calcium was more prevalent than low calcium, probably due to intake of calcium and vitamin D supplements as required in this study. Low total calcium and low phosphate were more frequent in the zoledronic acid group.

Increased ALT was seen in a higher proportion of zoledronic acid patients but there was no relevant difference between treatments in the incidence of AST values &gt;ULN. One patient in the zoledronic acid group had very high ALT (1682 U/L, ULN 40 U/L) and AST (1944 U/L, ULN 34 U/L) on day 275 due to mild hepatopathy reported as an AE not suspected to be related to study drug which was last received on day 192. All other ALT and AST values for this patient were within the normal range.

N = the number of patients with both baseline and at least one post-baseline evaluable value at the specified visit.

n = number of patients meeting the criterion at the specified visit. Missing baseline values were excluded.

+ A clinically significant increase in serum creatinine is defined as a ≥ 50% increase from baseline when the midpoint of serum creatinine normal range is ≤ 0.6 mg/dl or a value that is greater than 2 times the baseline value when the midpoint of serum creatinine normal range is &gt; 0.6 mg/dl.

There was no evidence of an adverse effect of zoledronic acid on renal function during the treatment period. Renal abnormalities (defined by a significant creatinine increase dependent on the midpoint of age and gender specific normal range) were more frequent after pamidronate infusions.

During  the  whole  treatment  period,  10/74  patients  (13.5%)  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  15/77 patients  (19.5%)  in  the  pamidronate  group  had  significant  creatinine  increases,  compared  to  3/62 patients (4.8%) and 4/64 patients (6.3%), respectively at the month 12 visit.

Only two events (one in each treatment arm) were reported by the investigators as AEs. Urine protein &gt; 2+ was detected in only one patient in each group, but these two events were not associated with the two reported renal AE cases. It should be noted that although these events met the definition of renal abnormalities the changes that occurred were generally within the normal range of the centrallaboratory.

## Vital signs data analysis in core study

There were no relevant differences between treatments in vital signs.

## 1.3.2.2  Overall discussion on clinical safety

All patients in the extension study received at least one infusion of zoledronic acid, and 49/54 patients randomized to twice yearly zoledronic acid received two infusions, per protocol. Three patients did not receive the second infusion because of the early termination of the study when they were required to discontinue  for  'administrative  problems'  (defined  as  incorrect  early  terminations  of  study  due  to administrative  errors).  For  the  other  2  patients  in  the  pam-zol  2x/yr  group  who  did  not  receive  the second infusion, one was lost to follow up and the other had only one infusion but was reported to have completed the study.

Another 3 patients were considered to be protocol deviators due to dosing errors or failure to follow protocol  procedures  in  the  event  of  additional  infusions:  1  patient  in  the  zol-zol  2x/yr  group  and 1 patient  in  the  pam-zol  1x/yr  group  had  dosing  errors  when  too  little  zoledronic  acid  was administered at the first infusion, however this was corrected within 2 weeks in both cases. One other patient in the zol-zol 2x/yr group received 2 additional infusions of zoledronic acid due to increased fatigue  secondary  to  severe  OI  but  did  not  discontinue  from  the  extension  study  as  required  per protocol.

In  the  core  study  more  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  treatment  group  experienced  musculoskeletal and  connective  tissue  disorders  (zoledronic  acid  66%  vs.  pamidronate  51%)  and  GI  disorders (zoledronic acid 50% vs. pamidronate 36%) than in the pamidronate group. Similarly hypocalcemia and vomiting occurred more frequently in the zoledronic acid group. In the extension study the overall AE incidence was higher in the core zoledronic acid stratum than in the core pamidronate stratum. This was especially pronounced in terms of infections and infestations. For AEs affecting at least 10% of patients in any group, there were twice as many patients in the core zoledronic acid stratum versus the  core  pamidronate  stratum  who  experienced  muscle  spasms,  nasopharyngitis,  pain  in  extremity, fatigue, nausea, sinusitis, influenza, musculoskeletal chest pain and humerus fracture. Pyrexia was the most frequent  AE  suspected  to  be  study  drug  related  in  both  groups  and  numerically  higher  in  the zoledronic group. Furthermore hypocalcemia, vomiting and fatigue were by far more frequent with zoledronic  acid  than  pamidronate.  Similarly,  tachycardia  was  reported  as  a  suspected  study  drug related event in 6.8% zoledronic acid-treated patients and none in the pamidronate group.

SAEs  were  more  frequent  with  zoledronic  acid  than  with  pamidronate,  mainly  due  to  a  higher incidence of femur fractures, hypocalcemia and pyrexia observed with zoledronic acid. In fact in the core  study  hypocalcemia  and  pyrexia  as  suspected  as  drug  related  were  not  observed  in  the pamidronate group at all. Thirteen zoledronic acid patients had SAEs involving fractures whereas only nine pamidronate patients had fracture SAEs. Whereas the total number of fractures was similar in the treatment  groups  the  frequency  of  fractures  in  lower  extremity  long  bones  was  higher  among zoledronic acid patients than pamidronate patients and contrastingly in upper extremity fractures were observed  with  higher  frequency  among  pamidronate  patients  than  zoledronic  acid  patients.  In  the extension  study  the  lowest  incidence  of  lower  extremity  fractures  was  found  in  the  pam-zol  1x/yr group, the group with the lowest cumulative exposure to zoledronic acid. In terms of femur fracture AEs (not including femoral neck fracture), the incidence of fracture was similar in the groups. More patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  experienced  tachycardia  compared  to  the  pamidronate  treated group. Most cases were considered mild in severity requiring no action. The nature of the tachycardia is not described. There was an overweight of hypocalcemia in the zoledronic acid group compared to the  pamidronate treated patients. There was no evidence of an adverse effect of zoledronic acid on renal function during the treatment period. Actually, significant creatinine increases were observed in 13.5%  of  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  group  and  19.5%  of  patients  in  the  pamidronate  group, although within normal thresholds.

The significant creatinine  increase is  a  matter  of  concern  in  this  young  patient  population.  It  is  not clear  if  this  renal  impairment  is  reversible  or  not.  A  decline  in  glomerular  filtration  rate  is  present before serum creatinine starts to rise.

In the study H2202E1 patients treated with four infusions (3-month apart) of zoledronic acid in the core study experienced a higher incidence of lower extremity long bone (femur, tibia) fractures than patients treated with pamidronate infusions, as outlined by DSMB during the interim unblinded safety analysis.  Increasing  BMD does not necessarily mean to avoid further fractures if the quality of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bone does not improve accordingly. Moreover, some imbalances were noted with respect to gender, the 3 OI subtypes and number of fractures between to two treatment groups.

Bone  quality  was  not  addressed  in  the  studies.  The  imbalances  were  not  sufficiently  explained. Orthopaedic care was not considered as a source of additional information and a follow-up beyond the two-year duration of  the  study  was  not  planned  by  the  MAH.  Therefore,  there  would  be  a  need  to further evaluate the long term safety of Zometa in OI.

Recent focus on skeletal accumulation of highly active bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid and pamidronate has led to the concept that prolonged suppression of bone modeling/remodeling affects bone health and mechanical properties especially at sites with greater metabolic demands.

Delayed  osteotomy  healing has been reported in children with OI  treated with intravenous pamidronate. Anecdotal surgical reports describe the rock-hard, shatter-prone quality of OI bone after prolonged treatment with bisphosphonates. Additional concern comes from the prolonged half-life and bone accumulation of active nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates; the significance of giant osteoclast formation  recently  described  in  bone  specimens  form  patients  given  long-term  bisphosphonate therapy, including children with OI, is not clear.

In  the  last  decade,  accumulating  reports  on  animal  models  of  OI  and  on  OI  children  treated  with bisphosphonates as well, are compatible with a dichotomic response to treatment of vertebral and limb long  bone,  respectively.  While  controlled  studies  have  found  increased  lumbar  bone  density  by DEXA, improved vertebral shape, decreased central vertebral compression and fracture rate, effects on cortical mineralization and long bone strength and quality are possibly disadvantageous. Interestingly enough, in the study H2202E1 patients treated with four infusions (3-month apart) of zoledronic acid in the core study experienced a higher incidence of low extremity long bone (femur, tibia) fractures than  patients  treated  with  pamidronate  infusions.  Given  the  long  life  in  the  body  of  administered bisphosphonates  (several  years  after  discontinuation  of  treatment),  it  seems  of  clinical  relevance  to continue monitoring of fractures in this study population.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the  present  trials  of  a  paediatric  population  is comparable to the known safety profile established with Zometa in the adult population. No new or unexpected safety findings were disclosed. It is however important to note that the dosing and dosing schedule  differs  and  that  the  present  study  was  not  blinded  or  placebo  controlled.  Furthermore,  in comparison with pamidronate, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with more pronounced risks for acute  phase  reactions  (which  however  were  less  frequent  and  milder  after  subsequent  infusions), hypocalcemia  (most  cases  were  typically  asymptomatic  and  transient,  although  4  patients  had symptoms, and one patient required intravenous calcium treatment) and unexplained tachycardia. Also zoledronic acid-treated patients experienced a higher incidence of lower extremity long bone (femur, tibia) fractures than pamidronate-treated patients. Although the reason for this excess fracture risk is of uncertain clinical significance, this is a point of concern. No evidence of a long-term adverse effect of zoledronic acid on renal function and no cases of ONJ were reported.

## 1.3.3 Risk Management Plan

An updated Risk Management plan has been submitted with this application focusing on the update of the safety profile of the drug coming  from the new  studies.  The  MAH  proposed  routine pharmacovigilance  activities  in  order  to  monitor  the  newly  identified  risks  resulting  from  the  OI population, which is considered acceptable. Characterization of the potential risks has been adequately addressed in the pharmacovigilance plan.

In conclusion, the RMP for Zometa is adequate, and the updates are relevant. No new additional risk minimization activities were proposed. This was also considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Below, a list of all ongoing safety concerns is presented.

## 1.4 Benefit Risk Assessment

## BENEFITS

- -The  present  controlled  open  label  efficacy  study  demonstrated  that  infusions  of  zoledronic  acid showed similar effects compared to pamidronate in terms of the primary endpoint of increase in LSBMD after 12 months of treatment.
- -Similarity between zoledronic acid and pamidronate was also shown regarding sustained reductions in serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation.
- -The proportion of patients who had clinical fractures during the 12 months of treatment was similar between the zoledronic acid and pamidronate treatment groups.
- -No  significant  differences  were  observed  regarding  LS-BMD  Z-score  at  6  and  12  months  and femoral neck and total body BMC.
- -No changes from baseline or differences between the two treatments in Wong-Baker FACES pain assessments were detected.
- -The open-label extension study, designed as a safety study with secondary efficacy parameters did not demonstrate any antifracture effect of zoledronic acid over pamidronate and median LS Z-score and total body BMC.
- -During  the  extension  period  sustained  decreases  in  median  values  of  serum  biomarkers  of  bone resorption and bone formation were observed in all treatments.

## RISKS

- -In comparison with pamidronate, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with more pronounced risks for acute phase reactions (which however were less frequent and milder after subsequent infusions).
- -In  comparison with pamidronate, zoledronic acid was associated with risk of hypocalcemia (most cases were typically asymptomatic and transient, although 4 patients had symptoms, and one patient required intravenous calcium treatment) and unexplained tachycardia.
- -Zoledronic acid-treated patients experienced a higher incidence of lower extremity long bone (femur, tibia) fractures than pamidronate-treated patients. Although the reason for this excess fracture risk is of uncertain clinical significance, this is a point of concern.

## BALANCE

The MAH has supported its application with two randomized controlled clinical trials investigating zoledronic acid treatment of children 1 to 17 years of age with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (Protocol study H2202 and H2202E1, respectively).

The  estimated  effect  on  BMD  zoledronic  acid  as  well  as  regarding  sustained  reductions  in  serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation was similar to pamidronate. However, the hallmark of OI is the occurrence of fractures and the present studies were neither designed nor powered to estimate the  efficacy  of  Zometa on fractures. BMD has not been demonstrated to be a meaningful surrogate marker for clinical efficacy in osteogenesis imperfecta. In this study, no meaningful positive effects were demonstrated on the clinically relevant parameters pain and new fractures.

It  is  not  clear  that  the  key  efficacy  parameter  'improvement  in  BMD  at  12  months  from  baseline' translated into clinical benefit for patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in terms of less fractures, less disability and less chronic bone pain. The pivotal study H2202 was neither designed nor powered to estimate  the  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid  on  fractures  or  other  clinically  relevant  outcome  measures. This lack of a clear relationship between surrogate and clinical efficacy parameter was also reflected by a high rate of new fractures after start of the two bisphosphonates.

Furthermore, the CHMP questioned the choice of comparator. Regarding the use of pamidronate as the active control the applicant argued that this selection was an acknowledgement of the product's ability to alter the natural disease course, improve the clinical status and quality of life in children and are referring  to  two  studies.  The  study  by  Glorieux  1998  showed  that  Cyclical  i.v.  treatment  with pamidronate was associated with a marked increase in BMD and physical activity increased markedly in these patients and decreased fracture rate. This study was an observational and uncontrolled study. In the study by Plotkin children younger than 3 years old pamidronate infusion every 2-4 months over a  increased  BMD, and decreased the rate of fracture. This was  also an observational study using a group of 'historical  controls'.  Despite  the  use  of  bisphosponates  in  clinical  practice  (off-label),  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scientific evidence for pamidronate in this indication is quite weak with regards to placebo-controlled studies:

-the lack of a placebo-controlled  clinical study  in an indication without  a well-established pharmacological therapy was not sufficiently justified.

- in the absence of a well quantified effect of pamidronate versus placebo the choice of non-inferiority margin required further justification (see CPMP/EWP/2158/99).

-  it  has  not  been  established  that  the  study  has  adequate  assay  sensitivity,  so  that  any  important differences between active agents could be detected.

Therefore, the CHMP emphasized the weakness of the study design and considered this to be a major limitation of the application having a major impact on the benefit risk assessment of the proposed new indication. Recent reviews are pertinent to the above stated comments in that they focus on the effects of  bisphosphonates in children with OI and osteoporosis. These publications underline the fact that despite a large body of published observations, only very few studies have a sufficiently high level of internal validity to be truly informative. These studies confirm improvement in BMD. There is, on the other hand, limited evaluation of broader treatment impacts on clinical features such as deformities, need for orthopaedic surgery, pain, functioning, quality of life. More studies evaluating drug choices, optimal  dosing,  duration  of  treatment,  post-treatment  morbidities  and  long-term  side  effects  are necessary.

The safety profile of zoledronic acid in the present trials of a paediatric population is comparable to the known safety profile established with Zometa in the adult population. No new or unexpected safety findings were disclosed. It is however important to noted that the dosing and dosing schedule differs and  that  the  present  study  was  not  blinded  or  placebo  controlled.  Furthermore  in  comparison  with pamidronate,  zoledronic  acid  seems  to  be  associated  with  more  pronounced  risks  for  acute  phase reactions, hypocalcemia and unexplained tachycardia. Also zoledronic acid-treated patients experienced a higher incidence of lower extremity long bone (femur, tibia) fractures than pamidronatetreated patients.

From a clinical point of view a number of drawbacks with regard to the study population, choice of comparator  drug,  randomization  and  primary  objective  (Lumbar  spine  BMD)  as  well  as  safety concerns are present. The application to extend the indication of intravenous zoledronic acid (Zometa) for  the  treatment  of  children  with  severe  OI  was  found  not  approvable  since  a  clearly  positive benefit/risk balance in patients with severe OI in the paediatric age is not sufficiently corroborated by the submitted data and discussion provided by the MAH.

Thus, the CHMP considered that the overall Benefit-Risk Ratio of Zometa in the applied extension of indications is negative.

In acknowledgment of the objections and concerns raised by the CHMP, the MAH proposed during the procedure to modify the scope of this application to request approval of paediatric information on the  paediatric  studies  in  SPC  section  5.1  together  with  changes  in  other  relevant  sections  of  the  PI (4.2,  4.4  and  5.2  and  package  leaflet)  to  reflect  the  available  paediatric  study  data.  Further,  the MAH informed the Committee that the company no longer seeks approval for the initially requested severe osteogenesis imperfecta indication.

In  conclusion,  the  extension  of  indication  in  SPC  section  4.1  for  the  'treatment  of  severe  OI  in paediatric  patients  aged  1  to  17  years'  was  not  acceptable.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that information  on  the  clinical  studies  performed  could  be  added  to  SPC  section  5.1.  Therefore,  the changes to SPC section 5.1 as well as the related sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC and in the PL were accepted by the CHMP to be included in accordance with the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006.

## 1.5 Significance of Paediatric Studies

The CHMP noted that the PDCO adopted on 12 December 2008 a positive Opinion on Compliance (EMEA-C-024-PIP01-07) with the agreed Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) (Decision P/32/2008) adopted on 24 June 2008) under Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended for Zometa (zoledronic acid).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP is of the opinion that  studies  H2202  and  H2202E1,  which  are  contained  in  the  agreed Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  and  have  been  completed  after  26  January  2007,  are  considered  as significant. The assessment criteria of the significance of studies, as defined in Section 3 - Title 4.2 of the European Commission Communication \"Guideline on the format and content of applications for agreement or modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning  the  operation  of  compliance  check  and  on  criteria  for  assessing  significant  studies\" (2008/C 243/01) has been fulfilled, taken into account the study type of clinical studies H2202 and H2202E1:

## (1) Comparative efficacy studies (randomized/ active control or placebo)

- Study H2202 was a randomized, active-controlled openlabel, multi-center phase III clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous zoledronic acid compared to intravenous pamidronate in paediatric patients (1-17 years) with severe osteogenesis imperfecta. Study  H2202E1  was  one-year  randomized,  openlabel,  parallel-group  multi-center  safety  and efficacy study extending the treatment to paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta who completed first year of treatment in study H2202.
- (2) Prospective clinical safety studies Studies  H2202  and  H2202E1  are  prospective  studies  that  collected  key  clinical  safety information (tolerability, general safety and renal safety) which makes a major contribution to the safe use on the use of zoledronic acid and pamidronate in the study population.\"

## 1.6 Changes to the Product Information - User Testing

An update of SPC section 5.1 has been performed to include clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years. SPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2 have been revised as well considering the available data in paediatric patients. Furthermore, SPC section 4.4 has been amended with a warning regarding the concomitant use of Aclasta.

In addition, changes to SPC section 4.3, 4.6, 4.8 have been performed to align with the QRD template.

Annex II has been updated with the RMP standard text reflecting the latest agreed version number.

## User Testing

The  package  leaflet  has  been  revised  based  on  the  results  of  a  Readability  Testing.  The  MAH submitted  with  this  application  the  final  report  comprising  the  results  of  consultations  with  target patient groups, dated 2007. The basis for this Zometa user testing was the package leaflet as submitted in the Type II variation application EMEA/H/C/336/II/021 with which the MAH applied for the new indication  'Prevention  of  fracture  and  bone  loss  in  postmenopausal  women  with  early-stage  breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors'. This application was subsequently withdrawn by the MAH.

The  package  leaflet  for  Zometa  has  been  through  a  pilot  and  two  rounds  of  user  tests.  Out  of  the 20 respondents that were recruited for the user test, 9 were cancer patients or their caretakers and 11 were healthy volunteers. The participant's age range was between 19 and 68 years.

The questionnaire used in the test procedure was composed of 12 key points of information relating to specific  safety  and  compliance  issues  in  connection  with  the  use  of  Zometa.  Question  selection ensured that points of information were asked for sections 1 to 4 of the PL.

The user testing and readability of the Zometa package leaflet (PL) was considered satisfactory. The methodology met the requirements of the Readability Guideline and the data were well recorded. The weaknesses of the PL identified by the interviewed population were addressed appropriately and led to amendments of some parts of the PL in order to improve readability. Furthermore, rephrasing of some passages of the PL were performed in order to facilitate patient friendly language.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## II. CONCLUSION

On 17 December 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.

Furthermore, the CHMP takes note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is fully completed and that the PDCO issued an Opinion on compliance. The CHMP reviewed the paediatric data of studies subject  to  this  plan  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation EC (No) 1901/2006, significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation.
