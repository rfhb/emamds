## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Catiolanze 50 micrograms/mL eye drops, emulsion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

1 mL eye drops emulsion contains 50 micrograms of latanoprost.

A single-dose container of 0.3 mL eye drops emulsion contains 15 micrograms of latanoprost. One drop contains approximately 1.65 micrograms latanoprost.

## Excipient with known effect:

One ml of emulsion contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride (see section 4.4)

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Eye drops, emulsion

The emulsion is a white liquid with a pH of 4.0-5.5 and an osmolality of 250-310 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Catiolanze is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

Catiolanze is indicated for the reduction of elevated IOP in children from 4 years of age and adolescents with elevated IOP and paediatric glaucoma.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Catiolanze may be used in paediatric patients from 4 years old onwards at the same posology as in adults.

Recommended therapy is one eye drop in the affected eye(s) once daily. Optimal effect is obtained if Catiolanze is administered in the evening.

The dose of Catiolanze should not exceed once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration decreases the IOP lowering effect.

## Missed dose

If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety of Catiolanze in children aged less than 4 years old has not been established as no data for this formulation (emulsion) are available. Currently available safety data for the active substance latanoprost are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1.

## Method of administration

Ocular use. For single use only.

A single-dose container contains enough eye drops liquid to treat both eyes.

As with any eye drops, it is recommended that the lachrymal sac be compressed at the medial canthus (punctal occlusion) for one minute, in order to reduce possible systemic absorption. This should be performed immediately following the instillation of each drop.

Contact lenses should be removed before instillation of the eye drops and may be reinserted after 15 minutes.

If more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be administered at least 5 minutes apart. Catiolanze should be administered last (see section 4.5).

This medicinal product is a sterile white liquid that does not contain a preservative. The liquid from one individual single-dose container is to be used immediately after opening for administration to the affected eye(s). Since sterility cannot be maintained after the individual single-dose container is opened, any remaining contents must be discarded immediately after administration. Patients should be instructed:

- to avoid contact between the dropper tip and the eye or eyelids
- to use the eye drops emulsion immediately after first opening the single-dose container and to discard the single-dose after use.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to latanoprost or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Change in eye colour

Catiolanze may gradually change eye colour by increasing the amount of brown pigment in the iris. Before treatment is instituted, patients should be informed of the possibility of a permanent change in eye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent heterochromia.

This change in eye colour has predominantly been seen with latanoprost in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e. blue-brown, grey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown. In studies with latanoprost, the onset of the change is usually within the first 8 months of treatment, rarely during the second or third year, and has not been seen after the fourth year of treatment. The rate of progression of iris pigmentation decreases with time and is stable for five years. The effect of increased pigmentation beyond five years has not been evaluated. In an open 5-year latanoprost safety study, 33% of patients developed iris pigmentation (see section 4.8). The iris colour change is slight in the majority of cases and often not observed clinically. The incidence in patients with mixed colour irides ranged from 7 to 85%, with yellow-brown irides having the highest incidence. In patients with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

homogeneously blue eyes, no change has been observed and in patients with homogeneously grey, green or brown eyes, the change has only rarely been seen.

The colour change with latanoprost treatment is due to increased melanin content in the stromal melanocytes of the iris and not to an increase in number of melanocytes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may become more brownish. No further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed after discontinuation of latanoprost treatment. It has not been associated with any symptom or pathological changes in clinical trials to date.

Neither naevi nor freckles of the iris have been affected by latanoprost treatment. Accumulation of pigment in the trabecular meshwork or elsewhere in the anterior chamber has not been observed with latanoprost in clinical trials. Based on 5 years clinical experience with latanoprost, increased iris pigmentation has not been shown to have any negative clinical sequelae and Catiolanze can be continued if iris pigmentation ensues. However, patients should be monitored regularly and if the clinical situation warrants, Catiolanze treatment may be discontinued.

## Chronic angle closure glaucoma

There is limited experience of latanoprost in chronic angle closure glaucoma, open angle glaucoma of pseudophakic patients and in pigmentary glaucoma. There is no experience of latanoprost in inflammatory and neovascular glaucoma or inflammatory ocular conditions. Latanoprost has no or little effect on the pupil, but there is no experience in acute attacks of closed angle glaucoma. Therefore, it is recommended that Catiolanze should be used with caution in these conditions until more experience is obtained.

## Cataract surgery

There are limited study data on the use of latanoprost during the peri-operative period of cataract surgery. Catiolanze should be used with caution in these patients.

## History of herpetic keratitis, aphakic, and pseudophakic patients

Catiolanze should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis, and should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis and in patients with a history of recurrent herpetic keratitis specifically associated with prostaglandin analogues.

## Macular oedema and cystoid macular oedema

Reports of macular oedema have occurred with latanoprost (see section 4.8) mainly in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema (such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion). Catiolanze should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema.

## Iritis/ uveitis

Catiolanze should be used with caution in patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients with asthma

There is limited experience with latanoprost in patients with asthma, but some cases of exacerbation of asthma and/or dyspnoea were reported with latanoprost in post marketing experience. Asthmatic patients should therefore be treated with caution until there is sufficient experience (see also section 4.8).

## Periorbital skin discolouration

Periorbital skin discolouration has been observed with latanoprost, the majority of reports being in Japanese patients. Experience to date shows that periorbital skin discolouration is not permanent and in some cases has reversed while continuing treatment with latanoprost.

## Eyelash changes

Latanoprost may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye and surrounding areas; these changes include increased length, thickness, pigmentation, number of lashes or hairs and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are reversible upon discontinuation of latanoprost treatment.

## Other

Concomitant use of latanoprost with prostaglandins, prostaglandin analogues or prostaglandin derivatives is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Excipient with known effect

Catiolanze contains cetalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed in adults.

There have been reports of paradoxical elevations in IOP following the concomitant ophthalmic administration of two prostaglandin analogues. Therefore, the use of two or more prostaglandins, prostaglandin analogues or prostaglandin derivatives is not recommended.

## Paediatric population

No interaction studies have been performed in the paediatric population.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established. It has potential hazardous pharmacological effects with respect to the course of pregnancy, to the unborn or the neonate. Therefore, Catiolanze should not be used during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Latanoprost and its metabolites may pass into breast milk. Catiolanze should therefore not be used in breast-feeding women or breast feeding should be stopped.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Catiolanze has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In common with other eye preparations, instillation of Catiolanze may cause transient blurring of vision. Until this has resolved, patients should not drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The majority of adverse reactions relate to the ocular system. In an open 5-year safety study with preserved latanoprost eye drops, solution, 33% of patients developed iris pigmentation (see section 4.4). Other ocular adverse reactions are generally transient and occur on dose administration.

Safety data specific for Catiolanze are available from 330 patients. The most common adverse reactions were ocular hyperaemia (1.6%) and conjunctival hyperaemia (1.0%). There were no serious adverse reactions during the studies specific for Catiolanze.

Long term safety data are available from a Phase 3 study in which 118 patients received Catiolanze at least for 360 days. The long term safety profile did not differ from that observed during the first 3 months of treatment. The most common ocular adverse reactions reported during long term use were ocular and conjunctival hyperaemia (4.4%), abnormal sensation in eye (2.2%) and growth of eyelashes (2.2%).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

No information is provided.

## Paediatric population

In two short term clinical trials (≤12 weeks), involving 93 (25 and 68) paediatric patients treated with preserved latanoprost eye drops, solution, the safety profile was similar to that in adults and no new adverse events were identified.

The short-term safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets were also similar (see section 4.2 and 5.1). Adverse events seen more frequently with preserved latanoprost in the paediatric population as compared to adults were nasopharyngitis and pyrexia.

Catiolanze was not specifically studied in the paediatric population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose is unlikely to occur after ocular administration. If overdose occurs, treatment should be symptomatic.

## Symptoms

Apart from ocular irritation and conjunctival hyperaemia, no other ocular side effects are known if latanoprost is overdosed via the ocular route.

## Treatment

If overdosage with this medicine occurs, treatment should be symptomatic.

## Paediatric population

The principles described above apply to the management of overdose in the paediatric population.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals; Antiglaucoma preparations and miotics. ATC code: S01EE01

## Mechanism of action

The active substance latanoprost, a prostaglandin F 2α analogue, is a selective prostanoid FP receptor agonist which reduces the IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies indicate that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow, although some increase in outflow facility (decrease in outflow resistance) has been reported.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Reduction of the IOP starts about three to four hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after eight to twelve hours. Pressure reduction is maintained for at least 24 hours. Pivotal studies have demonstrated that latanoprost is effective as monotherapy. In addition, clinical trials investigating combination use have been performed. These include studies that show that latanoprost is effective in combination with beta-adrenergic antagonists (timolol). Short-term (1 or 2 weeks) studies suggest that the effect of latanoprost is additive in combination with adrenergic agonists (dipivalyl epinephrine), oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) and at least partly additive with cholinergic agonists (pilocarpine).

Latanoprost has no significant effect on the production of aqueous humour. Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on the blood-aqueous barrier. Latanoprost has not induced fluorescein leakage in the posterior segment of pseudophakic human eyes during short term treatment. Latanoprost in clinical doses has not been found to have any significant pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory system.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy and safety of Catiolanze has been evaluated in one pivotal Phase 3 study.

A  Phase 3,  single-masked,  randomised,  controlled  non-inferiority  study  evaluated  the  efficacy  and safety of Catiolanze eye drops emulsion to benzalkonium chloride  preserved latanoprost eye drops solution  in  386 adults  with  open  angle  glaucoma  (OAG)  or  ocular  hypertension  (OHT).  Primary endpoint was the peak and trough change from baseline in IOP between treatment groups over a 12week treatment period, with a prespecified non inferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between groups, with an overall mean age (SD) of 63.1 years (11.16). The majority (61.5%) of participants were women and 96.4% were White. 75.8% (n=291) of patients  had  a  primary  OAG  and  21.1%  (n=81)  had  OHT;  the  remaining  had  a  pseudo-exfoliative glaucoma (2.1%) and pigmentary glaucoma (1.0%).

## Efficacy

The primary endpoint was met as the non-inferiority of Catiolanze versus the preserved latanoprost 0.005% solution was demonstrated at Week 12 (see table 1). The Least square (LS) mean treatment difference between the Catiolanze and the preserved latanoprost solution groups at the peak and trough timepoints were -0.6 (95% CI -1.2, -0.1) and -0.5 (95% CI -1.0, 0.1), respectively.

Change from baseline in corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score at Week 12 in subjects with baseline CFS ≥1 on the modified Oxford scale was assessed as key secondary endpoint. Catiolanze demonstrated superiority versus the control in terms of improvement in CFS score at Week 12.

## Paediatric population

Catiolanze eye drops, emulsion was not specifically studied in the paediatric population.

Efficacy and safety of preserved latanoprost eye drops solution has been established in paediatric patients. The efficacy of latanoprost in paediatric patients ≤18 years of age was demonstrated in a 12week, double-masked clinical study of latanoprost compared with timolol in 107 patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension and paediatric glaucoma. Neonates were required to be at least 36 weeks gestational age. Patients received either latanoprost 50 mcg/mL once daily or timolol 0.5% (or optionally 0.25% for subjects younger than 3 years old) twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction in IOP from baseline at Week 12 of the study. Mean IOP reductions in the latanoprost and timolol groups were similar. In all age groups studied (0 to &lt;3 years, 3 to &lt;12 years and 12 to 18 years of age) the mean IOP reduction at Week 12 in the latanoprost group was similar to that in the timolol group. Nevertheless, efficacy data in the age group 0 to &lt;3 years were based on only 13 patients for latanoprost and no relevant efficacy was shown from the 4 patients representing the age group 0 to &lt;1 year old in the clinical paediatric study. No data are available for preterm infants (less than 36 weeks gestational age).

IOP reductions among subjects in the primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) subgroup were similar between the latanoprost group and the timolol group. The non-PCG (e.g. juvenile open angle glaucoma, aphakic glaucoma) subgroup showed similar results as the PCG subgroup.

The effect on IOP was seen after the first week of treatment (see table 2) and was maintained throughout the 12 week period of study, as in adults.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Latanoprost (mw 432.58) is an isopropyl ester prodrug which per se is inactive, but after hydrolysis to the acid of latanoprost becomes biologically active.

## Absorption

The prodrug is well absorbed through the cornea and all latanoprost that enters the aqueous humour is hydrolysed during the passage through the cornea.

## Distribution

Studies in man with latanoprost indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humour is reached about two hours after topical administration. After topical application in monkeys, latanoprost is distributed primarily in the anterior segment, the conjunctivae and the eyelids. Only minute quantities of the drug reach the posterior segment.

## Biotransformation and Elimination

There is practically no metabolism of the acid of latanoprost in the eye. The main metabolism occurs in the liver. The half-life in plasma is 17 minutes in man. The main metabolites, the 1,2-dinor and 1,2,3,4-tetranor metabolites, exert no or only weak biological activity in animal studies and are excreted primarily in the urine.

## Paediatric population

An  open-label  pharmacokinetic  study  of  plasma  latanoprost  acid  concentrations  was  undertaken  in 22 adults  and  25 paediatric  patients  (from  birth  to  &lt;18 years  of  age)  with  ocular  hypertension  and glaucoma. All age groups were treated with latanoprost 50 mcg/mL, one drop daily in each eye for a minimum of 2 weeks. Latanoprost acid systemic exposure was approximately 2-fold higher in 3 to &lt;12 year olds and 6-fold higher in children &lt;3 years old compared with adults, but a wide safety margin for  systemic  adverse  effects  was  maintained  (see  section 4.9).  Median  time  to  reach  peak  plasma concentration was 5 minutes post-dose across all age groups. The median plasma elimination half-life was short (&lt;20 minutes), similar for paediatric and adult patients, and resulted in no accumulation of latanoprost acid in the systemic circulation under steady-state conditions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

The ocular as well as systemic toxicity of latanoprost has been investigated in several animal species. Generally, latanoprost is well tolerated with a safety margin between clinical ocular dose and systemic toxicity of at least 1 000 times. High doses of latanoprost, approximately 100 times the clinical dose/kg body weight, administered intravenously to unanaesthetised monkeys have been shown to increase the respiration rate probably reflecting bronchoconstriction of short duration. In animal studies, latanoprost has not been found to have sensitising properties.

In the eye, no toxic effects have been detected with latanoprost doses of up to 100 micrograms/eye/day in rabbits or monkeys (clinical dose is approximately 1.5 micrograms/eye/day). In monkeys, however, latanoprost has been shown to induce increased pigmentation of the iris. The mechanism of increased pigmentation  seems  to  be  stimulation  of  melanin  production  in  melanocytes  of  the  iris  with  no proliferative changes observed. The change in iris colour may be permanent.

In chronic ocular toxicity studies with latanoprost, administration of latanoprost 6 micrograms/eye/day has also been shown to induce increased palpebral fissure. This effect is reversible and occurs at doses above the clinical dose level. The effect has not been seen in humans.

In a 28-day ocular toxicity study, administration of Catiolanze two times a day for 28 days did not reveal any significant local or systemic toxic effects in rabbits. Plasma concentrations of latanoprost acid were negligible at 15 minutes after the final instillation of Catiolanze.

Latanoprost was found to be negative in reverse mutation tests in bacteria, gene mutation in mouse lymphoma and mouse micronucleus test. Chromosome aberrations were observed in vitro with human lymphocytes. Similar effects were observed with prostaglandin F 2α , a naturally occurring prostaglandin, and indicates that this is a class effect.

Additional mutagenicity studies on in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative and indicate that latanoprost does not have mutagenic potency. Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were negative.

Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies. In the embryotoxicity study in rats, no embryotoxicity was observed at intravenous doses (5, 50 and 250 micrograms/kg/day) of latanoprost. However, latanoprost induced embryolethal effects in rabbits at doses of 5 micrograms/kg/day and above.

The dose of 5 micrograms/kg/day (approximately 100 times the clinical dose) caused significant embryofoetal toxicity characterised by increased incidence of late resorption and abortion and by reduced foetal weight.

No teratogenic potential has been detected.

6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Catiolanze is and what it is used for

Catiolanze contains the active ingredient latanoprost, which belongs to a group of medicines known as prostaglandin analogues. It works by increasing the natural outflow of fluid from inside the eye into the bloodstream.

This medicine is used to treat conditions known as open angle glaucoma (damage to the optic nerve caused by high pressure in the eye) or ocular hypertension (raised pressure in the eye) in adults. Both of these conditions are linked with an increase in the pressure within your eye due to clogging of fluid drainage canals, eventually affecting your eyesight.

Catiolanze is also used to treat increased eye pressure and glaucoma in children from 4 years of age and adolescents.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Catiolanze

## Do not use Catiolanze

-  If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to latanoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or the doctor treating your child or pharmacist before using Catiolanze, or before you give Catiolanze to your child if you think any of the following apply to you or your child:

-  If you or your child are about to have or have had eye surgery (including cataract surgery).
-  If you or your child suffer from eye problems (such as eye pain, irritation or inflammation, blurred vision).
-  If you or your child have severe asthma or the asthma is not well controlled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  If you or your child wear contact lenses. You can still use Catiolanze, but follow the instruction for contact lens wearers in section 3.
-  If you have suffered or are currently suffering from a viral infection of the eye caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).

## Other medicines and Catiolanze

Catiolanze may interact with other medicines. Please tell your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you or your child are using or have used any other medicines, including those medicines (or eye drops) obtained without a prescription.

In particular, speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you know that you or your child are using prostaglandins, prostaglandin analogues or prostaglandin derivatives.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding unless your doctor considers it necessary. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine .

## Driving and using machines

This medicine can cause blurred vision, for a short time. If this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines until your vision becomes clear again.

## Catiolanze contains cetalkonium chloride

Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation.

## 3. How to use Catiolanze

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or the doctor treating your child has told you. You should check with your doctor or the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The recommended dose for adults and children is one drop once a day in the affected eye(s). The best time to do this is in the evening.

Do not use Catiolanze more than once a day, because the effectiveness of the treatment can be reduced if you administer it more often.

Use Catiolanze as instructed by your doctor or by the doctor treating your child until they tell you to stop.

## Contact lens wearers

If you or your child wear contact lenses, these should be removed before using Catiolanze. After using this medicine you should wait 15 minutes before putting the contact lenses back into the eyes.

## Instructions for use

-  For single use only.
-  Use the liquid from one individual single-dose container immediately after opening and administer one drop to the affected eye(s). Any remaining contents must be discarded immediately after use.
-  After using Catiolanze, press a finger lightly on the inner corner of the affected eye by the nose. Hold for 1 minute whilst keeping the eye closed, see step 11 and picture 3.
-  Contact between the dropper tip and eye/eye lids must be avoided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not understand.

<!-- image -->

1. Wash your hands and sit or stand comfortably.
2. Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers.
3. Take 1 single-dose container from the aluminium pouch, leaving the remaining containers in the pouch.
4. Gently shake the single-dose container.
5. Twist off the cap (picture 1).
6. Use your finger to gently pull down the lower eyelid of your affected eye (picture 2) .
7. Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling.
8. Place the tip of the single-dose container close to, but not touching, your eye.
9. Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye, then release the lower eyelid.
10. Blink a few times so that the medicine spreads across your eye.
11. After using Catiolanze, press a finger lightly on the inner corner of the affected eye by the nose. Hold for 1 minute whilst keeping the eye closed (picture 3) . A small duct that drains tears away from your eye and into your nose is located here. By pressing at this point, you close down the opening of this drainage duct. This helps to stop Catiolanze getting into the rest of the body.
12. Repeat steps 6-11 in your other eye if your doctor has told you to use drops in both eyes.
13. Discard the single-dose container after use. Do not keep it to use it again.

## If you use Catiolanze with other eye drops

Use Catiolanze at least 5 minutes after using the other eye drops.

## If you use more Catiolanze than you should

If you put too many drops into the eye, it may lead to some minor irritation in the eye and the eyes may water and turn red. This should pass, but if you are worried contact your doctor or the doctor treating your child for advice.

Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you or your child swallows Catiolanze accidentally.

## If you forget to use Catiolanze

Carry on with the usual dosage at the usual time. Do not use a double dose to make up for the dose you have forgotten. If you are unsure about anything talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

## If you stop using Catiolanze

You should speak to your doctor or the doctor treating your child if you or your child want to stop using this medicine.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following are known side effects of using Catiolanze:

## Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

-  A gradual change in your eye colour by increasing the amount of brown pigment in the coloured part of the eye known as the iris. If you have mixed-colour eyes (blue-brown, grey-brown, yellow-brown or green-brown) you are more likely to see this change than if you have eyes of one colour (blue, grey, green or brown eyes). Any changes in your eye colour may take years to develop although it is normally seen within 8 months of treatment. The colour change may be permanent and may be more noticeable if you use this medicine in only one eye. There appears to be no problems associated with the change in eye colour. The eye colour change does not continue after Catiolanze treatment is stopped.

## Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):
