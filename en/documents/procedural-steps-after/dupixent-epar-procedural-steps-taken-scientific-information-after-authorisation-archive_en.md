1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0078 | Update of sections 4.2 of the SmPC in order to allow the use of the Dupixent Prefilled Pen presentations for patients aged 2 to < 12 years of age based on final results of the R668-AD-1434 sub-study; this is an interventional open-label sub-study which purpose is to evaluate the PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of repeat doses of dupilumab (200 mg Q4W, 300 mg Q4W, and 200 mg Q2W) administered SC using a PFP with a skin pinch in children ≥2 to <12 years of age. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MA | 21/03/2024 | 19/04/2024 | SmPC and PL | The applicant supported the introduction of the pre-filled pen (PFP) for patients aged 2 to < 12 years of age with the final results of R668-AD-1434 sub-study. Based on the provided data on pharmacokinetics, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of repeat doses of Dupixent, there are no new safety findings or differences between age and weight cohorts. The safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent. The administration via PFP seems to be well tolerated in children aged ≥2 to <12 y ears.

The study met all pre-specified efficacy endpoints that assessed skin lesions and other domains of atopic hand and foot dermatitis. No specific safety concern arises from the safety data collected in adolescents. The safety data resulting from the study suggests that dupilumab is well tolerated in patients with hand and foot dermatitis and is overall consistent with the known safety profile in the AD study populations and AD patients.

The long-term safety profile observed in this study up to 3 years was generally consistent with the safety profile of dupilumab observed in controlled studies.   |
