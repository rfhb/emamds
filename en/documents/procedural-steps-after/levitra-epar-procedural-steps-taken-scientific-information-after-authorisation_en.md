| WS/1750            | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) of the vardenafil SmPCs and relevant sections of the PLs to expand the information regarding vardenafil interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as a result of a general review of vardenafil pharmacokinetic properties. Editorial changes proposed by the MAH during the procedure have been accepted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 19/03/2020 | 22/03/2021 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A general review of vardenafil pharmacokinetic properties and available literature regarding vardenafil interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) has led to an update of the product information. In vitro data suggests a potential effect of vardenafil on P-glycoprotein substrates more sensitive than digoxin as for example dabigatran etexilate and this has been reflected in Section 5.2. of the SmPC.                     |

Furthermore it was considered unlikely that any pharmacovigilance activity could further characterize the potential risks. Accordingly all the important potential and identified risks were removed from the RMP safety specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| WS/1390 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect data from two post-marketing observational studies indicating an increased risk of Non-arteritic Anterior lschaemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) when using phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. The MAH is also terminating the Bayer NAION study 12912 and the RMP is updated accordingly to version 5.0. In addition, the PI is brought in line with version 10.0 of the QRD template and the contact details of the Bulgarian local representative are updated in the Package Leaflets. The PI for the 10 mg orodispersible tablet is updated for aspartame and sorbitol, according to the annex to the EC guideline on 'Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use'. Some editorial amendments are also made to the PI. | 06/09/2018 | 26/08/2019 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The analyses of the observational data suggest an approximate 2- fold increase in the risk of Non-arteritic Anterior lschaemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) when phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor use (such as vardenafil, tadalafil and sildenafil), as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. Due to the nature of the performed observational studies, no causality between PDE5i use and NAION can be established. Nevertheless, the study results enhance the current understanding of the association and are considered clinically relevant. The RMP version 5 reflects the termination of NAION study on March 2018 as it was concluded that the study is unlikely to provide value for further risk assessment of NAION associated with the class of PDE5 inhibitors indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. |

| WS/0313   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information adding Penile haemorrhage, Haematospermia, and Haematuria with an uncommon frequency, further to the revision of a cumulative review, as requested by the CHMP. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring in line the PL with the current SmPC and to correct some minor editorial errors. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to delete the e-mail of local representative of Estonia in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 8.2. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications | 13/12/2012   | 21/01/2013 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The variation relates to the CHMP request to update the safety information of the product on urogenital bleeding Adverse Drug Reactions related to PDE5 inhibitor class of active substances, to which vardenafil belongs to. Following the assessment of the cumulative overview concerning the role of PDE5 inhibitors for urogenital bleeding events, it has been concluded that there is sufficient evidence for a possible relationship between PDE5 inhibitor class and penile haemorrhage, haematospermia and haematuria. As a result of this assessment the MAH for Levitra/Vivanza has been asked the introduction of Penile haemorrhage, Haematospermia, and Haematuria to Section 4.8 of the SmPC. |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 26/06/2008 | 28/07/2008 | SmPC and PL | Co-administration of erythromycin (500 mg three times a day), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, with vardenafil (5 mg) resulted in a 4 fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3 fold increase in Cmax. Although a specific interaction study has not been conducted, the in vivo studies already submitted for erythromycin are supportive of the in vivo extrapolation for clarithromycin, considering the similar inhibitory potency view in other in vivo studies, the co-administration of clarithromycin can be expected to result in similar effects on vardenafil AUC and Cmax. When used in combination with a moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitor such as erythromycin or clarithromycin, vardenafil dose adjustment might be necessary.

Levitra was granted a Marketing autorisation where, according to the preliminary data, the use of vardenafil in patients with ED secondary to Spinal cord injury has not been studied. Two Studies 10473 and 100608 specifically designed to provide data concerning the efficacy and safety of vardenafil in this patient population have now been conducted in this group of ED patients. Study 10473 was the larger and more encompassing of the two studies and is considered the pivotal trial. Study 100608 was conducted in Japan and utilized an open-label design. In the clinical trials vardenafil significantly improved the erectile function domain score, the ability to obtain and maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse and penile rigidity compared to placebo. The severity and level of the cord injury did not affect the efficacy results. Vardenafil was well tolerated in the |

| II/0016 | This variation relates to an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) section 4.3 (Contraindications) to include a statement that PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with a previous episode of Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics are also amended in order to include information with regard to non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Relevant sections of the Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. In addition, the contact details of the Icelandic local representative have been updated. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 27/04/2006 | 12/06/2006 | SmPC and PL | In the context of the ongoing evaluation of the NAION issue (see II-12) and considering the data available and new cases arising, it cannot be ruled out that there might be a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitors and NAION. The CHMP agreed with the proposal to contraindicate the use of PDE5 inhibitors in patients with a previous episode of NAION as a class labelling and to continue investigating this issue. Therefore, section 4.3 of the SPC has been updated to contraindicate LEVITRA in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4). Section 4.4 of the SPC was also updated to include the following information: Visual defects and cases of non- arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have been reported in connection with the intake of LEVITRA and other PDE5 inhibitors. The patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should stop taking LEVITRA and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3). NAION is included in section 4.8 of the SPC. |

When vardenafil was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg on a background of stable therapy with tamsulosin, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood pressure, although 3/21 tamsulosin-treated subjects exhibited transient standing systolic blood pressures of less than 85 mmHg. When vardenafil 5 mg was given simultaneously with terazosin 5 or 10 mg, one of 21 patients experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. Hypotension was not observed when vardenafil 5 mg and terazosin administration was separated by 6 hours. Therefore, concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha blocker therapy. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose of 5mg. Vardenafil may be administered at any time with tamsulosin.

Although no safety concerns have arisen during the post- marketing experience, the MAH proposed to restrict the dosing of vardenafil in these patients to a maximum of 10 mg as a precautionary measure and to allow worldwide harmonisation of the hepatic impairment dosing recommendations for vardenafil. |

| II/0004   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 26/02/2004   | 01/06/2004   | SmPC and PL   | Following the availability of further post marketing and clinical trials data (reference is made to the first PSUR) the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were included in section 4.8 of the SPC: back pain, increased creatine kinase, myalgia, postural hypotension and watery eyes. The sentence in section 4.8 of the SPC regarding myocardial infarction was updated to read: myocardial infarction (MI) have been reported in temporal association with the use of Vardenafil and sexual activity, but it is not possible to determine whether MI is related directly to Vardenafil, or to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these factors: Corresponding changes have been included in section 4 of the PL.                                                                                                                                                         |

The nitrate study showed that symptomatic effect (hypotension or/and dizziness) was seen more frequently in the vardenafil group rather than in the placebo group following the NTG administration. The contraindication for the concomitant use of vardenafil and nitrates is therefore maintained and further information was added in section 4.5 of the SPC with regards to this interaction. The results of the alpha blocker studies demonstrated that when 5 mg vardenafil was given on a background of stable tamsulosin therapy there were no clear differences in blood pressure effects between vardenafil and placebo. When 5 mg vardenafil was given simultaneously with terazosin therapy some patients experienced hypotension. This did not occur |

| II/0003 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2004 | 02/03/2004 | SmPC and PL | The effect of vardenafil (10 mg and 80 mg), on the corrected QT interval was evaluated in a single dose, randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 59 healthy adult men. Single oral doses of 10mg and 80 mg of vardenafil were shown to prolong the QTc interval by a mean of 8 msec and 10 msec, respectively. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown and cannot be generalised to all patients under all circumstances, as it will depend on the individual risk factors and susceptibilities that may be present at any time in any given patient. Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were therefore updated in order to include this information and to include the advice that patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators.

| II/0002 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2004 | 02/03/2004 | SmPC and PL | Update of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect data from new pharmacokinetic studies concerning the interaction of vardenafil with ritonavir. The SPC included a formal warning for avoiding the concomitant use of vardenafil with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (and a formal contraindication for men older than 75 years) based on the data coming from the interaction studies presented during the initial Marketing Authorisation application. The data submitted for this variation are consistent with the previous ones and show a clinically relevant increase in the exposure to vardenafil when coadministered with a potent CYP3A4                                                                                                                                                                               |
