## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for aclidinium bromide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Based on the reasonable possibility of a link between formoterol and angina and given that angina is a recognised effect with formoterol and is listed in the SmPC for formoterol products, the proposal to add angina to section 4.8 of the SmPC for Duaklir/Brimica is considered appropriate. Therefore, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing aclidinium bromide

- formoterol fumarate dihydrate were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for aclidinium bromide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aclidinium bromide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
