## 1. Introduction

On 29 th  July 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar 13 (13vPnC), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants, B7471003 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

All subjects received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 20vPnC or 13vPnC intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at the vaccination visits.

The 13vPnC supply is being manufactured specifically for this study and is not a marketed product; however, it is considered representative of Prevenar 13, as the polysaccharide intermediates and vaccine substances are manufactured according to the approved Prevenar 13 commercial process and the formulation and filling processes are similar but are performed at a different scale than the commercial process.

The investigational vaccine 20vPnC contains the same 13 serotypes as 13vPnC, plus conjugated capsular polysaccharides for 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F).

The vaccine is formulated with 5mM succinate buffer, 0.02% polysorbate 80, and 0.125mg of aluminium as aluminium phosphate, per 0.5-mL dose.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Phase 2, randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants, B7471003

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Phase 2, randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants, B7471003

## Description

Pfizer is developing a new 20vPnC candidate to expand protection against pneumococcal disease beyond that covered by current pneumococcal vaccines. 20vPnC has the same composition as 13vPnC, but contains an additional 7 pneumococcal conjugates to protect against serotypes responsible for a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal disease. A meta-analysis of serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children &lt;5 years of age showed that, overall, these 7 serotypes accounted for approximately 70% of disease not due to the 13vPnC vaccine types.

The purpose of this Phase 2 study was to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC in infants administered vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC control) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and inform further clinical development of 20vPnC in the paediatric populations. The control group received 13vPnC prepared specifically for the study to provide context for the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC.

## Study design

This was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 2-arm parallel design, conducted at investigator sites in the United States. Approximately 460 infants aged ≥ 42 to ≤ 98 days were to be randomized (1:1) to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (infant series, Doses 1 through 3) and 12 months of age (Dose 4). Vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis, hepatitis B and polio antigens (Pediarix, GlaxoSmithKline) was administered concomitantly with Doses 1 to 3. Other routine paediatric vaccines (Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), rotavirus, meningococcal, influenza) could be administered as specified in the protocol as well. The study design is presented below in Figure 1.

## Study population /Sample size

Healthy male or female infants born at &gt;36 weeks of gestation and aged 2 months (≥42 to ≤98 days) at the time of consent (the day of birth is considered day of life 1) were enrolled in this study.

A total of 460 participants were randomized across both vaccine groups (20vPnC; and 13vPnC) and 89.3% of participants completed the visit 1 month after Dose 3. The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the disposition table. Of the 49 (10.7%) participants that were withdrawn from the study before the visit 1 month after Dose 3, the most common reason was withdrawal by parent/guardian (26 [5.7%] participants). Two participants (1 each in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups) were randomized but not vaccinated because the parents withdrew consent.

A total of 391 participants were vaccinated at Dose 4 and 82.8% of participants completed the visit 1 month after Dose 4. The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the disposition table. Of the 10 (2.2%) participants that were withdrawn from the study after Dose 4 but before the visit 1 month after Dose 4, the most common reason for withdrawal was lost to followup (7 [1.5%] participants).

## Treatments

All subjects received a single dose (0.5 mL) of 20vPnC or 13vPnC intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg at the vaccination visits.

As stated in the Brief Licensing History, the 13vPnC supply is being manufactured specifically for this study and is not a marketed product; however, it is considered representative of Prevenar 13, as the polysaccharide intermediates and vaccine substances are manufactured according to the approved Prevenar 13 commercial process and the formulation and filling processes are similar but are performed at a different scale than the commercial process.

Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)-containing vaccine (potentially in combination with other antigens such as poliomyelitis) will be administered concomitantly with the first 3 doses of 20vPnC or 13vPnC. If not in the combination, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines may be given with 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination will be administered concomitantly with 20vPnC or 13vPnC Dose 4.

## Study Evaluations

## Safety Evaluations

The legally acceptable representative (LAR) of the participants were asked to monitor and record local reactions, specific systemic events, and antipyretics/pain medication taken for 7 days, each evening after each dose of investigational product (20vPnC or 13vPnC) using an e-diary on a provisioned device or e-diary application on a personal device.

Local Reactions: For the first 7 days after each dose of investigational product from Day 1 through Day 7, the subject's LAR was asked to assess redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site and to record the symptoms in the e-diary in the evening.

Systemic Events: For the first 7 days after each dose of investigational product from Day 1 through Day 7, the subject's LAR was asked to assess decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability and to record the symptoms in the e-diary in the evening. Temperature was recorded in the evening daily in the e-diary by the subject's LAR for 7 days after each dose of investigational product (Days 1 to 7, where Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and at any time during the 7 days that fever was suspected. The subject's LAR was asked to record the use of antipyretic/pain medication (yes/no) in the e-diary in the evening daily for 7 days after each dose of investigational product.

Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs): The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs for each subject began from the time the subject's LAR provided informed consent, which was obtained before the subject's participation in the study (i.e., before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product). AEs were collected through 1 month after Dose 3 and from Dose 4 through 1 month after Dose 4. NDCMCs and SAEs were collected through 6 months after Dose 4. An NDCMC was defined as a disease or medical condition, not previously identified, that is expected to be persistent or is otherwise long-lasting in its effects.

Acute reactions within the first 30 minutes after investigational product and concomitant vaccination administration were assessed and documented as an AE with or without an SAE in the case report form (CRF) and SAE form, as appropriate.

## Immunogenicity Evaluations

Blood samples (approximately 5 mL/visit) for immunogenicity assessments were collected from all subjects 1 month after Dose 3, prior to Dose 4, and 1 month after Dose 4. Concentrations of anticapsular IgG for the 20 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) were determined in all subjects at the 3 time points.

Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA, functional neutralization assay) titers were determined on serum from randomly selected subsets of participants with equal representation of both groups in each subset. There were a small number of participants in each subset so conclusions are limited.

Assessor´s comment : the overall study design, objectives, endpoints and evaluation methods are appropriate.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 460 participants were randomized across both vaccine groups (20vPnC; and 13vPnC) and 89.3% of participants completed the visit 1 month after Dose 3. The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the disposition table. Of the 49 (10.7%) participants that were withdrawn from the study before the visit 1 month after Dose 3, the most common reason was withdrawal by parent/guardian (26 [5.7%] participants). One participant from each vaccine group (20vPnC and 13vPnC) was randomized but not vaccinated because the parents withdrew consent.

A total of 391 participants were vaccinated at Dose 4 and 82.8% of participants completed the visit 1 month after Dose 4. The percentages of participants were similar in the 2 groups for all the categories in the disposition table. Of the 10 (2.2%) participants that were withdrawn from the study after Dose 4 but before the visit 1 month after Dose 4, the most common reason for withdrawal was lost to followup (7 [1.5%] participants).

## Baseline data

The study population consisted of racially diverse, male and female participants aged 44 to 95 days, with a mean age of 64.5 days at Dose 1. The demographic characteristics in the 2 groups were similar.

Abbreviations: IgG = immunoglobulin G; SAP = statistical analysis plan.

a. N = number of subjects with a valid and determinate concentration for the specified serotype. These values are used as the denominators for the percentage calculations.

b. n = Number of subjects with an antibody concentration ≥ a specified comparison level (per the SAP) for the given serotype.

c. Exact 2-sided CI calculated using the Clopper and Pearson method.

## Pneumococcal IgG GMCs

The IgG GMCs and geometric mean fold rises (GMFR) are shown in Table 5. The IgG GMCs were generally similar in the 2 groups but numerically lower in the 20vPnC group compared to the 13vPnC group.

For the 13 serotypes common to both 20vPnC and 13vPnC, the geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) demonstrate a boost in response at 1 month after Dose 4 when compared to both 1 month after Dose 3 (Table 5) and before Dose 4. The GMFRs were generally similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, both from before 1 month after Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 4 and from before Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4.

Antibody concentrations to the diphtheria and pertussis vaccine antigens were determined on sera collected 1 month after Dose 3 from a randomly selected subset of participants with sufficient serum volumes.

Overall, ≥94.0% and ≥95.8% of the tested participants in the 20vPnC group and 13vPnC group, respectively, achieved the prespecified antibody concentrations for diphtheria and pertussis. The diphtheria and pertussis GMCs are similar in the vaccine groups (data not shown in this report).

## Immunogenicity Conclusions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 20vPnC induced robust pneumococcal immune responses to all 20 serotypes 1 month after Dose 3 as measured by both the percentages of participants with prespecified serotype-specific IgG concentrations and the IgG GMCs.
- After Dose 4, strong boosting responses were observed for all serotypes when compared the serotype-specific IgG concentrations from 1 month after Dose 4 to responses both 1 month after Dose 3 and before Dose 4.
- 20vPnC also elicited functional OPA responses to all 20 serotypes at 1 month afterDose 3 and 1 month after Dose 4 as measured by OPA GMTs. Evidence of boosting was observed for all serotypes similar to the IgG responses.
- Immune responses to concomitant vaccines as measured by percentages of participants with prespecified antibody concentrations and GMCs for diphtheria and pertussis were similar between vaccine groups.

Assessors comment : we agree with the MAH immunogenicity conclusions. No specific conclusions regarding Prevenar 13 can be drawn. The results are in agreement with previously presented results.

## Safety results

## Local reactions

Most local reactions were mild or moderate, and the proportions of participants reporting any local reaction in the 20vPnC group were generally similar to the 13vPnC group. The most frequent local reaction reported was pain at injection site. The frequency and severity of reported events was comparable with a slight tendency to decrease after subsequent doses (Table 7).

## Systemic events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most events were mild or moderate and the percentage of participants reporting systemic events in the 20vPnC group  was similar to the 13vPnC group. The most frequent systemic event reported was irritability. The pattern of reported events was comparable with a slight tendency to decrease after subsequent doses, and with the older age of the infant.

## Adverse Events

At least 1 AE was reported in 61.0% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 56.4% of participants in the 13vPnC group from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3. AEs in the SOC of infections and infestations were reported most frequently and included upper respiratory tract infection (16.0% and 18.5% of participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively) and otitis media (9.1% and 7.5%). These events are common in infants and young children.

At least 1 AE was reported in 18.3% of participants in the 20vPnC group and 25.3% of participants in the 13vPnC group from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4. As with the AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs in the SOC of infections and infestations were reported most frequently and included otitis media (3.0% and 3.1% of participants in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups, respectively) and upper respiratory tract infection (2.5% and 3.1%).

Overall during the study period, SAEs were reported by 12 (5.2%) participants in the 20vPnC group and 5 (2.2%) participants in the 13vPnC group. SAEs included hospitalizations for infections commonly seen in this age group. No SAEs reported were considered related to vaccine. There were no deaths during the study.

## Safety conclusions

- Proportions of participants reporting local reactions and systemic events after vaccination with 20vPnC or 13vPnC were similar. Most were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 3 days.
- Proportions of participants reporting any AE were similar in the 20vPnC and 13vPnC groups. Upper respiratory tract infection and otitis media were the most frequently reported AEs.
- Few participants reported AEs that were considered related to vaccination. The most frequently reported related AEs were in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions. Few severe AEs were reported. Immediate AEs were uncommon.
- None of the SAEs or NDCMCs reported during the study were considered related to vaccination. One participant was withdrawn from the study due to an unrelated SAE of failure to thrive and there were no deaths during the study.

Assessors comment : we agree with the MAH safety conclusions.

## 2.4. Discussion on clinical aspects

In the current study, a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants, Prevenar 13 was used as comparator vaccine. There was no hypothesis testing, but the novel vaccine immunogenicity and safety were compared to the already licensed vaccines Prevenar 13 immunogenicity and safety. The study size and design were suitable for a Phase 2 vaccine study.

The administration of 20vPnC was well tolerated, and AEs reported in the study were consistent with medical events or conditions that are common in this age group. The 20vPnC safety profile was similar to 13vPnC, and there were no safety signals identified in this Phase 2 study. The data demonstrate that 20vPnC induces robust and functional immune responses for all 20 serotypes which were boosted after Dose 4. The GMTs were somewhat lower in 20vPnC serotypes common with 13vPc, but were still above the threshold of seroprotection. Safety and immunogenicity results from this study support further clinical development of 20vPnC for the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There data collected for Prevenar 13 in the current study did not provide any new information regarding immunogenicity, and no new safety signal was detected.
