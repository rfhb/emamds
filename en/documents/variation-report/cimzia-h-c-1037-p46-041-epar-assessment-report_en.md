## 1.  Introduction

On 07 October 2024, the MAH submitted a final report for a completed paediatric study for certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), study RA0043, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.  Scientific discussion

## 2.1.  Information on the development program

The MAH stated that RA0043 is a stand alone study.

## CHMP comment:

RA0043 was initiated in 2012 pursuant to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) postmarketing requirement (PMR) 2563-1, as follows: \"Assessment of pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) parameters and dosing, safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity in the pediatric population ≥2 years to &lt;17 years with polyarticular JIA\".

A PK-matching approach to extrapolate efficacy from the adult RA population to the polyarticularcourse juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) population was previously agreed with FDA to fulfill the PMR.

In 2017, the PDCO granted a product-specific waiver on its own motion for all subsets of the paediatric population in the specified condition, on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, and that uncertainties pertain to the long-term safety of Cimzia (i.e. CNS development/cognition).

In their decision, the PDCO states that 'several authorized alternative therapies for the treatment of children with chronic idiopathic arthritis are now available. Furthermore, uncertainties pertaining to the long-term safety of Cimzia exist. Dose-dependent vacuolation associated with PEG accumulation has been observed as a consequence of Cimzia administration in monkeys in various tissues including the choroid plexus epithelial cells, choroid plexus stroma, pituitary gland and dorsal root ganglia. Vacuolation was only partially reversible. Furthermore, clinical monitoring of this potential risk of CNS vacuolation is likely not possible in a meaningful way'.

## 2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Treatment was given with Cimzia prefilled single-use syringe 200mg/mL solution for sc injection.

## 2.3.  Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1.  Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- RA0043, A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol in Children and Adolescents with Moderately to Severely Active PolyarticularCourse Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2.  Clinical study

## RA0043, A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol in Children and Adolescents with Moderately to Severely Active Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

## Description

RA0043 was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK, immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents with moderately-to-severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA).

## Methods

## Study participants

## Selection of study population

## Inclusion criteria

To be eligible to participate in this study, all of the following criteria had to be met:

1. An IRB/IEC-approved written ICF was signed and dated by the study participant or by the parent(s) or legal representative. The consent form or a specific assent form, where required, was signed and dated by minors.
2. Study participants/legal representative/parent was considered reliable and capable of adhering to the protocol, visit schedule, or IMP intake according to the judgment of the Investigator.
3. Study participant was able and willing to comply with the requirements of the study.
4. Study participant was 2 to 17 years of age (inclusive) at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]). The minimum age at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]) for study participants enrolled in Russia was 6 years of age.
5. Study participants must have weighed ≥10kg at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]). The minimum weight at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]) for study participants enrolled in Russia was 15kg.
6. Study participants had onset of signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of JIA (according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology classification of juvenile idiopathic arthritis; second revision, Edmonton, 2001, 2004) and initiation of JIA treatment for at least 6 months prior to Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]). Eligible JIA categories included: polyarthritis RF-positive, polyarthritis RFnegative, extended oligoarthritis, juvenile PsA, and ERA.
7. Study participants had active polyarticular-course disease, defined as ≥5 joints with active arthritis at Screening (Visit 1) and at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]).
8. Study participants had an inadequate response to, or intolerance to, at least 1 DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic). For example, study participants had prior inadequate response to MTX (based on the Investigator's clinical judgment).
9. If the study participant was using MTX, then the study participant was on MTX for a minimum of 3 months at Screening (Visit 1). In addition, the dose was stable for at least 1 month before Screening (Visit 1) at ≥10 to ≤15mg/m2 per week. If the study participant was not using MTX, then the treatment was previously withdrawn for documented reasons of intolerability or inadequate response. A study participant with no prior MTX use was eligible for the study as long as 1 prior DMARD was used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10. If the study participant was using oral corticosteroid therapy, the dose was stable for at least 7 days prior to the Baseline arthritis assessment at a maximum dose of 10mg or 0.2mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent) per day, whichever was the smaller dose.

## CHMP comment:

Inclusion criteria seem adequate.

Radiographic evidence suggestive of any of these infections was sufficient grounds for exclusion.

## CHMP comment:

Exclusion criteria also seem relevant.

## Treatments

Throughout the study, Cimzia dosing was a fixed dose based on weight and given every 2 weeks (Q2W), with the exception of the lowest weight group on the Reduced Cimzia Dose, who received the maintenance dose every 4 weeks (Q4W).

At the onset, study participants were to receive a fixed-dose Cimzia regimen based on body weight categories (10 to &lt;20kg, 20kg to &lt;40kg, or ≥40kg), consisting of 3 loading doses at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by a maintenance dose, referred to as Original Cimzia Dose. An interim population PK analysis of the first 34 pediatric study participants, conducted in Jun 2013, suggested that while observed Cimzia plasma concentrations remained in the adult range, they were at the upper end of the distribution. A decision was made to reduce the loading and maintenance doses by 50% for ongoing and newly enrolled participants (referred to as the Reduced Cimzia Dose). The Cimzia dose was not reduced due to any safety findings during the study. Following further interaction with FDA in Jan 2020, it was agreed to enroll an additional 30 study participants on the Original Cimzia Dose.

The 2 key dose groups of interest are the Original Cimzia Dose and the Reduced Cimzia Dose.

The Original Cimzia dose group includes all study participants in the Safety Set (SS) who began treatment with the Original Cimzia dose regimen and received 1 or more doses of this regimen, regardless of any subsequent switch to the Reduced Cimzia dose regimen.

The Reduced Cimzia dose group includes all study participants in the SS who began treatment in accordance with the reduced dosing regimen defined for the study.

Collectively, the Any Cimzia Dose group includes all data from all study participants while being treated with the Original Cimzia Dose or the Reduced Cimzia Dose at any time in the study, regardless of dose switching.

After Week 4 (Visit 5), home-based Cimzia administration by the study participants or parent/caregiver was permitted between scheduled study visits.

A study participant's dosing category was only changed after the confirmation of a weight change by the Investigator at a scheduled clinic visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The injection was administered at either the lateral abdominal wall or upper outer thigh. Treatment of the injection site with an anesthetic cream prior to dosing was permitted.

Note: The first maintenance dose for the 10kg to &lt;20kg weight group on the Reduced CZP Dose was administeredatWeek8.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety including immunogenicity of Cimzia administered subcutaneously (sc) in children and adolescents with moderately-to-severely active pcJIA. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of Cimzia on the clinical response in children and adolescents with moderately-toseverely active pcJIA. The other objectives of the study were to further assess safety as well as efficacy and health outcomes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

## PK and immunogenicity variables

## Primary PK and immunogenicity variables

Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations and ADAb levels at Week 16 and Week 48 (Visits 8 and 13, respectively) were assessed and data were summarized.

## Other PK and immunogenicity variables

Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations and ADAb levels at other study timepoints.

## PK and immunogenicity measurements

Blood samples were to be collected predose to determine plasma concentrations of Cimzia and ADAbs at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]); Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 (Visits 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively); and then every 24 weeks thereafter; the Early Discontinuation/End of Treatment (EOT) Visit; and the Final Visit 12 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In addition, blood samples were collected 5 to 7 days after dosing at Baseline (ie, at Week 1, Visit 3) and Week 16 (ie, return of study participant to clinic site at Week 17) to determine postdose plasma concentration.

## Safety variables

## Primary safety variable

The primary safety variables were the incidences of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to permanent withdrawal of IMP. Adverse events were solicited at every visit, recorded, and coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) criteria.

## Other safety variables

The other safety variables were as follows:

- Incidences of TEAEs, TEAEs of interest, TEAEs by relatedness, TEAEs by severity, and TEAEs by duration of exposure.
- Clinical laboratory values (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) at every visit except Weeks 1 and 2 (Visits 3 and 4) and Unscheduled Visits.
- Vital sign abnormalities at every visit.
- Assessments of study participant's developmental stages and growth (height, weight) to determine Tanner stages at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]), every 24 weeks thereafter, and the Early Discontinuation/EOT Visit (weight at every visit through Final Visit). For study participants enrolled prior to Protocol Amendment 9, Tanner stage assessments were to be performed every 48 weeks following Protocol Amendment 8, and only for those study participants who had not reached Tanner stage V.

· Autoantibody (antinuclear antibodies [ANA] and anti-double-stranded DNA [anti-dsDNA] antibodies) concentrations at Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]) (testing for anti-dsDNA antibodies only if ANA was positive), Weeks 16 and 48 (Visits 8 and 13), and at the Early Discontinuation/EOT Visit

## Efficacy and health outcomes variables

## Secondary efficacy variable

Efficacy was assessed by the PedACR30, PedACR 50% (PedACR50), PedACR 70% (PedACR70), and PedACR 90% (PedACR90) response rates at Week 16 (Visit 8) as compared to Baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Other efficacy and health outcomes variables

The other efficacy and health outcome variables were:

- PedACR30, PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 response rates at every visit except Week 16 (Visit 8) and Final Visit as compared to Baseline (see Section 4.6.1 for definition).
- Change from Baseline in number of joints with active arthritis at every visit except Final Visit.
- Change from Baseline in number of joints with limitation of range of motion at every visit except Final Visit.

## Sample size

Based upon the ICH guideline for the assessment of safety, the MAH planned to enroll a sufficient number of study participants to this study to have a minimum of 100 participants with at least 12 months continuous exposure to Cimzia. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, it was originally determined that 125 study participants would need to be enrolled. At the time of Protocol Amendment 5, 78 study participants had been enrolled on the Original Cimzia Dose, and it was planned to enroll a further 78 study participants on the Reduced Cimzia Dose, so that a comparable number of study participants on both doses could be analyzed. Thus, the total number of study participants planned to be enrolled was increased to 156 study participants. Assuming a Screening failure rate of 25%, it was planned to screen 195 study participants in total. With Protocol Amendment 9, an additional 30 study participants were planned to be enrolled on the Original Cimzia Dose with the aim to enroll at least 5 study participants in each weight range of 10kg to &lt;20kg, 20kg to &lt;40kg, and ≥40kg. Prior to the start of study conduct, simulations using the adult population PK model in pediatric study participants with pcJIA suggested that the planned sample size of 125 study participants would also be adequate for PK assessment purposes.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

RA0043 was an open-label study with no randomization.

## Statistical Methods

Categorical data were presented as summary tables. A missing category was included as applicable. Continuous variables were summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. For Cimzia plasma concentrations and CRP, the geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) were presented. Mean, standard deviation, and median were displayed to 1 more decimal place than collected in the electronic Case Report Form. Minimum and maximum values were displayed to the same level of precision as collected in the electronic Case Report Form. Percentages were calculated using the number of study participants in the relevant population or subgroup as the denominator. Presentation of percentages were to 1 decimal place. Percentages were not presented if the frequency count was 0. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. Ninety-five percent CIs for the percentage of responders were calculated using the exact binomial method.

## Results

## Recruitment/Number analysed

A total of 227 study participants were screened during the study. A total of 34 (15.0%) of these study participants were screen failures. The most common reasons for screen failure were ineligibility and other (8.8% and 4.4% of study participants screened, respectively).

A total of 193 study participants were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose of Cimzia. Of these, 160 study participants (82.9%) completed at least Week 48 (Visit 13). As of the database lock date of 31 May 2024, all 193 study participants had discontinued from the study. The study participant disposition is presented in Figure 1.

## Baseline data

Overall, study participants had a mean age of 11.9 years at Baseline (range: 3 to 17 years). Most study participants were female (67.4%), white (80.3%), and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (71.5%). The mean BMI and BSA were 19.33kg/m 2  and 1.324m 2 , respectively. The majority of study participants were from the US (68 study participants [35.2%]) and the Russian Federation (64 study participants [33.2%]). Most study participants had Baseline MTX use (139 study participants [72.0%]) and concomitant MTX use (148 study participants [76.7%]).

## PK and immunogenicity results

The Geometric mean trough CZP plasma concentrations (95% CI) for each weight group at Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, Week 48, and Week 72 were as follows:

For the 10 to &lt;20kg weight group: 1.5066 (0.4265, 5.3217) µg/mL, 1.6166 (0.4720, 5.5368) µg/mL, 2.1473 (0.5394, 8.5479) µg/mL, 4.7404 (1.7596, 12.7710) µg/mL, and 6.5404 (1.8198, 22.8636) µg/mL, respectively

For the 20 to &lt;40kg weight group: 7.1480 (4.0691, 12.5568) µg/mL, 9.2277 (5.1453, 16.5491) µg/mL, 9.7804 (6.5912, 14.5126) µg/mL, 8.4459 (5.0002, 14.2661) µg/mL, and 7.5811 (4.1885, 13.7216) µg/mL, respectively

For the ≥40kg weight group: 13.5071 (10.3684, 17.5961) µg/mL, 13.8928 (11.0030, 17.5416) µg/mL, 10.2119 (7.0742, 14.7413) µg/mL, 12.2987 (8.6950, 17.3692) µg/mL, and 11.7108 (7.9296, 17.2953) µg/mL, respectively

After Week 72, CZP plasma concentrations were overall sustained for the Original CZP Dose and the Reduced CZP Dose.

Based on the results of the immunogenicity assays, for the entire Treatment Period, most study participants were treatment-induced ADAb positive (95/105 study participants [90.5%] for the Original CZP Dose and 82/88 study participants [93.2%] for the Reduced CZP Dose).

The median ADAb titers persisted at a generally similar magnitude within each Dose group after Week 24 through Week 72. After Week 72, there were no clear trends in median ADAb titers for the Original CZP Dose and Reduced CZP Dose.

Scatterplots of CZP plasma concentration by overall ADAb titer classification for the entire Treatment Period for the Original CZP Dose and the Reduced CZP Dose are presented for the PK-PPS in Figure 8-9 and Figure 8-11, respectively.

## CHMP comment:

The observed geometric mean CZP plasma concentrations were lower for the Reduced CZP Dose compared with the Original CZP Dose.

Most participants were treatment-induced ADAb positive, for original dose as well as for the reduced dose.

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy variable

No primary efficacy results are included because the primary variables in this study were PK, immunogenicity, and safety variables.

Secondary efficacy variables: PedACR30, PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 at Week 16 (Visit 8) compared to Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2])

The Any Cimzia Dose contains all the efficacy data from all study participants treated with Cimzia during the study, regardless of dose-switching. The American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% (PedACR30, 50, 70, 90) responses at Week 16 (Visit 8) compared to Baseline (Week 0 [Visit 2]) for the Any Cimzia Dose are presented for the full analysis set (using nonresponder imputation method) in the table below.

Note: Response rates incorporated NRI for study participants who discontinued or used prohibited or rescue medication, and NRI was applied up to Week 56 for study participants who discontinued from the study.

Note:Any CZP Dose covers the entire dosing period regardless of dose switching(see Section 6.1.1,Table 10-1, and Figure 3-2).

The majority of study participants were PedACR30 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) for the Any Cimzia Dose (79.3%).

The percentages of study participants who were PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) for the Any Cimzia Dose were 72.5%, 54.4%, and 27.5%, respectively.

## By Baseline weight group

The majority of study participants were PedACR30 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) in all Baseline weight groups in the Any Cimzia Dose (range: 77.8% to 83.3%).

In general, the percentages of PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) were similar across the 2 higher Baseline weight groups (20 to &lt;40kg and ≥40kg), respectively, for the Any Cimzia Dose. For the 10 to &lt;20kg Baseline weight group, the PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 responses varied; however, the interpretation is limited due to the small number of study participants in this weight group for each Dose group (n=18).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## By Baseline age group

The percentages of study participants who were PedACR30 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) were 72.7% for the 2 to &lt;6 years age group, 82.7% for the 6 to &lt;12 years age group, and 77.6% for the 12 to 17 years age group for the Any Cimzia Dose.

In general, the percentages of PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 responders at Week 16 (Visit 8) (compared to Baseline [Week 0 (Visit 2)]) were similar across the 2 older age groups (6 to &lt;12 years and 12 to 17 years), respectively, for the Any Cimzia Dose. For the 2 to &lt;6 years age group, the PedACR50, PedACR70, and PedACR90 responses varied; however, the interpretation is limited due to the small number of study participants in this age group for each Dose group (n=11).

## CHMP comment:

The primary objective of study RA0043 was to evaluate the PK and safety, including the immunogenicity, of Cimzia administered subcutaneously in children and adolescents with moderately-to-severely active pcJIA. The clinical response was assessed as a secondary objective to provide information on the efficacy of Cimzia in the study population.

The majority of study participants were PedACR30 responders at Week 16 compared to baseline. The response was seen in all components of the PedACR response, indicating a clinical effect of the treatment. However, no comparator was included in the study, and no statistical hypothesis testing was performed.

## Safety results

## Extent of exposure

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the Original Cimzia Dose, and the Reduced Cimzia Dose, the mean totals of Cimzia received were 11,494.6mg, 5095.7mg, and 10,580.2mg, respectively, and the mean exposure durations were 4.336 years, 1.127 years, and 4.744 years, respectively. For the Any Cimzia Dose, the Original Cimzia Dose, and the Reduced Cimzia Dose, the mean study participant days at risk were 1608.2 days, 434.2 days, and 1722.7 days, respectively, and the total participant years at risk were and 849.8 years, 124.8 years, and 415.0 years, respectively.

The exposure duration and participant-time risk were higher in the Reduced Cimzia Dose as compared with the Original Cimzia Dose and the Any Cimzia Dose.

## Adverse events

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs starting on or after the first administration of Cimzia and up to 70 days after the last dose of study medication. AEs that are pretreatment or that start more than 70 days after the last dose of study medication will be flagged in the listing but excluded from summaries.

The Any Cimzia Dose included all TEAEs including those emerging after study participants switched doses.

## Overall summary of TEAEs

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the incidences of TEAEs and related TEAEs (per Investigator assessment) were 95.3% (184 study participants) and 48.7% (94 study participants), respectively. In addition, the incidences of serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, and study participant discontinuation due to TEAEs were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

23.8% (46 study participants), 14.0% (27 study participants), and 12.4% (24 study participants), respectively. Three study participants (1.6%) had TEAEs leading to death in the Any Cimzia Dose.

## Overall summary of TEAEs by Baseline weight group

For the Any Cimzia Dose, for the 10 to &lt;20kg, 20 to &lt;40kg, and the ≥40kg weight groups, the incidences of TEAEs were 88.9%, 96.8%, and 95.5%, respectively, and the incidences of related TEAEs (per Investigator assessment) were 38.9%, 49.2%, and 50.0%, respectively. The incidence of serious TEAEs was 27.8% in the 10 to &lt;20kg weight group, and the incidence of serious TEAEs was higher in the 20 to &lt;40kg weight group (31.7%) compared with the ≥40kg weight group (18.8%). The incidences of severe TEAEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs ranged from 5.6% to 19.0% and 0% to 14.3%, respectively. Given the number of study participants in the 10 to &lt;20kg weight group (N=18), any noted differences in these results should be interpreted with caution. Three study participants in the ≥40kg weight group had TEAEs leading to death in the Any Cimzia Dose.

## Most common TEAEs

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the 3 most commonly reported TEAEs (by incidence of preferred term [PT]) were nasopharyngitis (53 study participants [27.5%]), upper respiratory tract infection (48 study participants [24.9%]), and headache (39 study participants [20.2%]).

## TEAEs by severity

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the majority of participants had TEAEs that were mild (89.6% [1709 events/ 2332 total events]) or moderate in intensity (66.8% [577 events/ 2332 total events]). The incidence of participants who had at least 1 TEAE that was severe in intensity was 14.0% (46 events/ 2332 total events).

The most common severe TEAEs (by incidence of PT) were juvenile idiopathic arthritis (5 study participants [2.6%]), anaemia (3 study participants [1.6%]), and abdominal pain and anxiety (2 study participants [1.0%] each). No other severe TEAEs were reported for &gt;1 study participant in this dose.

## TEAEs by relationship to Cimzia

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the incidence of TEAEs related to Cimzia was 48.7%. The most commonly reported TEAEs related to Cimzia (by incidence of PT) were injection site pain (17 study participants [8.8%]), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (14 study participants [7.3%]), and upper respiratory tract infection (12 study participants [6.2%]).

## Most common serious TEAEs

For the Any Cimzia Dose, the incidence of serious TEAEs was 23.8% (46 study participants). The most common serious TEAEs (by incidence of PT) were pneumonia (7 study participants [3.6%]), anaemia (3 study participants [1.6%]), and abdominal pain, vomiting, pyrexia, sepsis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and pregnancy on contraceptive (2 study participants [1.0%] each); no other serious TEAEs were reported for &gt;1 study participants in this dose. Serious TEAEs were most commonly reported in the system organ class of Infection and infestations (22 study participants [11.4%]), Gastrointestinal disorders (7 study participants [3.6%]), Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, Pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions, and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (4 study participants [2.1%] each).

## AE of special interest

No cases of potential Hy's Law were reported during the study. Up to the database lock (DBL) date of 31 May 2024, there were 2 suspected hepatic events reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Deaths

A total of 3 study participants in the Any Cimzia Dose died prior to the DBL date for the final CSR of 31 May 2024. Of those, 2 deaths were deemed related to Cimzia (per investigator assessment). One was in a female that experienced septic shock and tuberculosis liver and the other was in a male that experienced disseminated tuberculosis. The third death was deemed unrelated (road traffic accident).

## CHMP comment:

Although it is of concern that there were 3 deaths in the study, the 2 cases possibly related to Cimzia treatment were related to infections (septic shock and tuberculosis). These risks are considered sufficiently covered by the product information.

Clinical laboratory evaluation, vital sign measurements, and physical examination findings

There were no meaningful trends in changes in clinical laboratory parameters or vital signs during the study.

## CHMP comment:

Treatment with Cimzia across a range of doses was well tolerated in children and adolescents with moderately to severe active pcJIA. It can be agreed with the MAH that the safety results for the study participants were consistent with the established safety profile of TNFα inhibitors. No new safety signals emerged.

## 2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects

RA0043 was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK, immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents with moderately-to-severely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA).

A total of 193 study participants were enrolled in the study, received at least 1 dose of Cimzia. Of these, 160 study participants (82.9%) completed at least Week 48 (Visit 13). Of the 193 study participants, 18, 63, and 112 were enrolled in the 10 to &lt;20kg, 20 to &lt;40kg, and ≥40kg weight groups, respectively.

Throughout the study, Cimzia dosing was a fixed dose based on weight and given every 2 weeks (Q2W), with the exception of the lowest weight group on the Reduced Cimzia Dose, who received the maintenance dose every 4 weeks (Q4W).

At the onset, study participants were to receive a fixed-dose Cimzia regimen based on body weight categories (10 to &lt;20kg, 20kg to &lt;40kg, or ≥40kg), consisting of 3 loading doses at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by a maintenance dose, referred to as Original Cimzia Dose. An interim population PK analysis of the first 34 pediatric study participants, conducted in Jun 2013, suggested that while observed Cimzia plasma concentrations remained in the adult range, they were at the upper end of the distribution. A decision was made to reduce the loading and maintenance doses by 50% for ongoing and newly enrolled participants (referred to as the Reduced Cimzia Dose). The Cimzia dose was not reduced due to any safety findings during the study.

The primary objective of study RA0043 was to evaluate the PK and safety, including the immunogenicity, of Cimzia administered subcutaneously in children and adolescents with moderatelyto-severely active pcJIA. The clinical response was assessed as a secondary objective to provide

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

information on the efficacy of Cimzia in the study population. The majority of study participants were PedACR30 responders at Week 16 compared to baseline. The response was seen in all components of the PedACR response, indicating a clinical effect of the treatment. However, no comparator was included in the study, and no statistical hypothesis testing was performed.

Regarding safety, among all Cimzia-treated patients the incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs was 95.3% and 23.8%, respectively. The 3 most commonly reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (27.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (24.9%), and headache (20.2%). The most common severe TEAEs were juvenile idiopathic arthritis (2.6%), anaemia (1.6%), and abdominal pain and anxiety (1.0%).

Three study participants (1.6%) had TEAEs leading to death. Of those, 2 deaths were deemed related to Cimzia (per investigator assessment). One was in a female that experienced septic shock and tuberculosis liver and the other was in a male that experienced disseminated tuberculosis. The third death was deemed unrelated (road traffic accident).  Although it is of concern that there were 3 deaths in the study, the 2 cases possibly related to Cimzia treatment were related to infections (septic shock and tuberculosis). These risks are considered sufficiently covered by the product information.

Considering that the statement in the SmPC section 4.2 ( 'The safety and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents below age 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.') is no longer correct, the MAH is requested to submit a variation to update section 4.2 (or provide a justification for not doing so) and include a brief summary of the main results from study RA0043 in the SmPC section 5.1 and 5.2. If paediatric data are to be included in the SmPC, the MAH is also asked to consider whether any particular warnings regarding possible risks associated with pegylation are to be included.

## 3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Treatment with Cimzia across a range of doses was well tolerated in children and adolescents with moderately to severe active pcJIA. It can be agreed with the MAH that the safety results for the study participants were consistent with the established safety profile of TNFα inhibitors. No new safety signals evoked.

Considering that the statement in the SmPC section 4.2 ( 'The safety and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents below age 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.') is no longer correct, the MAH is requested to submit a variation to update section 4.2 (or provide a justification for not doing so) and include a brief summary of the main results from study RA0043 in the SmPC section 5.1 and 5.2. If paediatric data are to be included in the SmPC, the MAH is also asked to consider whether any particular warnings regarding possible risks associated with pegylated products in the paediatric population are to be included.

## Fulfilled:

In view of the available data regarding the paediatric population in the phase 3 study (RA0043) with Cimzia, the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.
