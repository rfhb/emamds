## 1. Information on the procedure

The potential for Picato to induce skin tumours was considered during the initial marketing authorisation application evaluation. In 2017, the product information of Picato was updated to reflect an excess of skin tumours (keratoacanthoma (KA)) with ingenol mebutate 0.06% compared to placebo.

Further, an imbalance in tumour incidence in the treatment area was noted in several studies for a number of skin tumour types including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), Bowen's disease and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) between the ingenol mebutate or its related ester ingenol disoxate and comparator or placebo arms. Several explanations were proposed for these imbalances and no firm conclusions could be drawn. However, in view of the reasonable possibility that ingenol esters may be tumour-promoting in some patients, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a non-interventional safety study were imposed to characterise this risk and provide reassurance on long-term safety. Concerns were then raised as to the conduct and finalisation of such RCT in a reasonable timeframe.

Picato (ingenol mebutate) was authorised in the EU under the centralised procedure in November 2012 for the cutaneous treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis in adults. Picato 150 micrograms/gram gel is used on the face and scalp while Picato 500 micrograms/gram gel is used on the trunk and extremities.

In view of the above concern regarding the potential risk of new skin tumour in the treatment area, and the difficulty to generate appropriate data to address the uncertainty about this risk PRAC considered that a review of all available data including from ongoing studies and its impact on the benefit-risk balance of Picato in the authorised indication should be conducted. On 03 September 2019 the EC therefore triggered a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, and requested the PRAC to assess the impact of the above concerns on the benefit-risk balance of Picato (ingenol mebutate) and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. In addition, the EC requested the Agency to give its opinion, as to whether provisional measures were necessary to protect public health. The current report relates only to provisional measures recommended by the PRAC for ingenol mebutate based on the data available at this time. These provisional measures are without prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing review under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction The mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate for use in actinic keratosis (AK) remains to be fully characterised. In vivo and in vitro models have shown a dual mechanism of action: 1) induction of local lesion cell death and 2) promoting an inflammatory response characterised by local production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and infiltration of immunocompetent cells. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The potential for Picato to induce skin tumours was considered during the initial marketing authorisation application evaluation. Specifically, the risk of AK progression to SCC was reflected in the risk management plan as an important potential risk. The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) was requested to conduct a phase 4 clinical trial assessing the long-term cumulative incidence of SCC after treatment with ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% or imiquimod cream, 5% (Aldara) for multiple AKs on face and scalp (Trial LP0041-63).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In 2017, further to data from a clinical trial (LP0105-1020) comparing ingenol mebutate 0.06% to placebo, the product information of Picato was updated to reflect an excess of skin tumours (KA).

In parallel an imbalance in the incidence of SCC between the ingenol mebutate and imiquimod arms was observed in the preliminary results of the ongoing long-term safety study LP0041-63 imposed at time of initial marketing authorisation.

In the PSUR assessment covering the period 1 February 2018 to 31 July 2018, a requested metaanalysis of four studies of the related ester ingenol disoxate (LP0084-1193, -1194, -1195, and -1196) found a marked increase in skin tumours at 14 months in the active group compared to vehicle. An imbalance in tumour incidence was noted for a number of tumour types including BCC, Bowen's disease and SCC. However, it cannot be excluded at this stage that these differences may be observer bias due to partial unblinding of investigators observing local skin responses in patients on active treatment. The pattern of tumour incidence observed in the ingenol disoxate clinical trials is not fully consistent with that observed in studies in which an imbalance in skin tumour was observed in the ingenol mebutate arm.

In the present review, the PRAC considered all data submitted by the MAH. This included data from clinical studies with ingenol mebutate, ingenol disoxate, post-marketing reports, non-clinical data and data from the literature.

It was therefore difficult to draw firm conclusions from the data available in the PSUR in 2018. However, as there was a reasonable possibility that ingenol esters may be tumour-promoting in some patients, the important potential risk 'AK to SCC progression' was updated to 'New skin tumours in treatment area'. In addition, two safety studies were imposed to characterise this risk and provide reassurance on long-term safety: 1. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients treated with ingenol mebutate, over at least 18 months of follow-up to further investigate the incidence of treatment area skin malignancy. 2. A cohort non-interventional post-authorisation safety study comparing patients treated with ingenol mebutate with patients exposed to other AK treatments to investigate the rate of skin malignancies. In 2019, the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) reviewed the protocol of the above mentioned imposed interventional clinical study (study 1) and considered that a substantially larger study than proposed by the MAH would be required to generate meaningful data to conclude on the risk of treatment area skin malignancy. Concerns were raised as to the conduct and finalisation of such a safety study in a reasonable timeframe. The non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (study 2) is currently under discussion. Further, during the reporting period of the latest PSUR (1 August 2018 to 31 January 2019) an additional serious case of SCC was reported. In view of the above concern regarding the potential risk of new skin tumour in the treatment area, and the difficulty to generate appropriate data to address the uncertainty about this risk PRAC considered that a review of all available data including from ongoing studies and its impact on the benefit-risk balance of Picato in the authorised indication should be conducted.

The cumulative exposure to ingenol mebutate from MAH-sponsored clinical trials is 4,202 patients. The cumulative post-marketing patient exposure is estimated to be approximately 2.8 million treatment courses. Of note, one patient can follow a repeat treatment course on the same skin area if an incomplete response is seen at a follow-up examination after 8 weeks or other courses of treatment to treat other AK lesions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2. Data on safety

The MAH has provided a cumulative review of all cases of skin tumour in all clinical trials with ingenol mebutate and a detailed analysis of 14, data on skin tumours from randomised clinical trials with ingenol disoxate and from post-marketing reports.

## 2.2.1. Data on skin tumour from clinical trials with ingenol mebutate

An overview of data on skin tumours from randomised, vehicle or active-controlled clinical trials with ingenol mebutate as AK field treatment is presented below. Data from one open-label uncontrolled study are also presented below (LP0041-62). Design allowing, statistical analyses provide pooled Mantel-Haenszel risk difference estimates, adjusted for trial.

Of note, end points definition varied across studies. One study was specifically designed to assess the long-term safety (LP0041-63). Central histopathological assessment was conducted in studies LP01051020, LP0105-1032 and LP0041-63. Patients were biopsied before and after treatment in two studies, LP0041-62 and -63. 2.2.1.1. 8-week follow-up, vehicle-controlled trials Pool of ingenol mebutate in 25 cm 2  treatment areas, 8-week vehicle-controlled trials There were 1038 subjects treated with ingenol mebutate and 790 treated with vehicle gel on a contiguous skin area of 25 cm 2  in nine studies (LP0041-03, -21, PEP005-006, -014, -015, -016, 017, -025, -028). Skin malignancies inside the treatment area were seen in 0.1 % of the subjects treated with ingenol mebutate gel and 0.5% of those treated with vehicle gel. The corresponding figures for skin malignancies outside the treatment area were 1.6% and 2.2%, respectively. The risk difference estimates were not statistically significant: -0.5% (95% CI: -1.0%, 0.1%) in the treatment area. There were no observations of note concerning the types of skin malignancies.

Pool of ingenol mebutate in larger treatment areas, 8-week vehicle-controlled trials There were 963 subjects treated with ingenol mebutate and 299 treated with vehicle gel in the pooled 8-week data from the three trials of ingenol mebutate in larger treatment areas (LP0105-1012, -1020, -1032). These show a statistically significant higher incidence of skin tumours in the ingenol mebutate groups compared to vehicle; this finding is driven by KA observed in Australian patients in the LP01051020 trial (risk difference in the treatment area: 1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.7%)). In this study a total of 12 subjects treated with ingenol mebutate, reported 16 skin tumour events inside the treatment area (2 Bowen's disease, 3 KA, and 11 SCC). These biopsies were sent for central histopathology review where all SCCs were reclassified as KA and 1 Bowen's disease was classified as SCC. The original classification of the 3 KA was unchanged. No central review could be performed for one Bowen's disease tumour due to loss to follow up. Skin tumours inside the treatment area were reported a median of 33 days after start of treatment. Of the 12 subjects with skin tumours, 11 were enrolled in Australia and 1 in the US. The majority of the subjects were men, all had fair skin (Type I or Type II), and 10 subjects had a history of skin cancer, all indicative of severely sun-damaged skin and an increased risk of developing skin cancers.

2.2.1.2. 8-week follow-up, uncontrolled trial LP0041-62, open label, uncontrolled trial In this study ingenol mebutate gel 0.05% was used on 25 cm2 on the arm in AK patients. Screening biopsies were performed for all participants from one of the 5-9 AKs in the selected treatment area. Biopsies identified 5 cases of Bowen's / in situ SCC and 1 invasive SCC, in total 6/136 = 4.4%. These patients were excluded after screening. AK diagnosis was confirmed in 114 subjects. Finally, 108 AK patients were included and followed for 8 weeks. At study end the following skin malignancies were reported: · inside the treatment area: 1 patient had BCC. · outside the treatment area: 3 patients had BCC, 3 had intraepidermal carcinoma (or Bowen's disease), 4 had SCC. 2.2.1.3. Long-term follow-up, vehicle-controlled trials LP0041-21, vehicle-controlled with 12 months of follow-up after initial cryotherapy Skin malignancies were observed inside the treatment area in 0.6% of the subjects in the ingenol mebutate group and 2.5% of those in the vehicle group, the risk difference being non-statistically significant: -1.9% (95% CI: -4.5%, 0.8%).

In this trial, all subjects received a first treatment course with ingenol mebutate, and if a second treatment course was necessary, were randomised to either ingenol mebutate or vehicle. Following the second treatment course, skin tumours were observed inside the treatment area in 0.7% of the subjects in the ingenol mebutate group and 5.8% of those in the vehicle group; the risk difference was not statistically significant: -5.1% (95% CI: -11%, 0.7%). Skin tumours outside the treatment area were balanced between the treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier plots are displayed in the below figure.

The difference between the 2 treatment groups is developed in the period from around 3 months to 1.5 years after the first exposure. There was only one new event after 1.4 years in the ingenol mebutate group.

Long-term trials PEP005-030, PEP005-031, and PEP005-032 Patients who had complete clearance of AKs in the phase 3 program for Picato were followed up for 1 year. No skin malignancies were observed in these 192 subjects. 2.2.1.4. Long-term follow-up, active-controlled trials LP0041-63, imiquimod controlled trial with 3 years of follow-up There were 240 subjects randomised to ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% and 244 to imiquimod cream 5% for the treatment of AK lesions within a 25 cm² treatment area on the face or scalp. After 3 years of follow-up, skin tumours were observed inside the treatment area in 6.3% of the subjects in the ingenol mebutate group and 2.0% of those in the imiquimod group. The risk difference was statistically significant: 4.2% (95% CI: 0.7%, 7.7%). The difference was driven by SCC and Bowen's disease.

## 2.2.2. Data on skin tumour from clinical trials with ingenol disoxate

An overview of data on skin tumours from randomised, vehicle-controlled clinical trials with ingenol disoxate, as AK field treatment is presented below. Design allowing, statistical analyses provide pooled Mantel-Haenszel risk difference estimates, adjusted for trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While ingenol disoxate is a different chemical entity to ingenol mebutate, it is closely related and its mechanism of action is thought to be similar. Therefore, the disoxate safety data are considered relevant to ingenol mebutate. The treatment area approved for ingenol mebutate is 25 cm 2  compared to the 250 cm 2  area investigated in the ingenol disoxate development program.

## Pool of Ingenol disoxate 8-week vehicle-controlled trials

There were 1264 subjects treated with ingenol disoxate and 530 treated with vehicle gel in seven studies (LP0084-1013, -1014, -1015, -1193, -1194, -1195, -1196). Central histopathological assessment was conducted in studies LP0084-1193, -1194, -1195 and -1196.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Skin tumours inside the treatment area were seen in 0.7% of subjects treated with ingenol disoxate gel and 0.6% of those treated with vehicle gel. The corresponding figures for skin tumours outside the treatment area were 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively. The risk differences were not statistically significant: 0.2 (95% CI: -0.6%, 1.0%) in the treatment area. There were no observations of note concerning the types of skin tumours. Table 11.

## Pool Ingenol disoxate, 14 months vehicle-controlled trials

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from four 14-months randomised, vehicle-controlled trials was pooled: LP00841193, -1194, -1195 and -1196. The effect of the data from an observational explorative 2-year followup extension study of these 4 trials was also analysed (LP0084-1369 trial).

Skin tumours were observed inside the treatment area in 7.7% of subjects in the ingenol disoxate groups and 2.9% of those in the vehicle groups; the risk difference was statistically significant: 4.9% (95% CI: 2.5%, 7.3%). The difference was driven by BCC, Bowen's disease and SCC. AEs outside the treatment area were not collected after 8 weeks.

The Kaplan-Meier plots show that the curves begin to separate around month 5. Inclusion of the extra follow-up time from LP0084-1369 showed a slightly lower hazard rate ratio. The LP0084-1369 study was terminated prematurely, reportedly for commercial reasons.

2.2.3. Interaction by application site Cox regression analyses, accounting for censorings due to withdrawals, were performed for all longterm, randomised controlled trials with ingenol mebutate or ingenol disoxate, except for the LP00841196 trial where no events occurred in the comparator group. Subgroup analyses by anatomical location were performed for the LP0041-63 (ingenol mebutate vs imiquimod with 3 years follow-up) and LP0084-1369 (ingenol disoxate vs vehicle with up to 24 months follow-up) trials. No violation of the proportional hazards assumption was detected in any Cox regression analyses (test for proportional hazards assumption, p-values ranging from 0.12 to 0.77). A higher occurrence of skin tumours in the ingenol mebutate/disoxate group versus the comparator/vehicle group was observed in trials LP0105-1020 (ingenol mebutate in larger treatment areas, 8-week vehicle-controlled), LP0041-63 (ingenol mebutate vs imiquimod, 3 years follow-up), and in the vehicle-controlled ingenol disoxate phase 3 trials (LP0084-1193, 1194, 1195, 1196). LP0105-1020: one strength of ingenol mebutate (0.06%) was studied in one anatomical location (approximately 250 cm2 on the trunk/extremities). The 12 subjects with skin malignancies were equally distributed with 4 subjects in each of the 3 ingenol mebutate treatment groups (2-, 3-, or 4day treatments). Medicinal product no longer authorised

LP0041-63: one strength of ingenol mebutate (0.015%) was studied. The Kaplan Meier survival curves for ingenol mebutate were very similar in the subgroups of subjects treated on the face and the scalp. The hazard rate ratio (ingenol mebutate vs. imiquimod) was numerically larger for the face than the scalp; however, the interaction between treatment and anatomical location was not statistically significant (p=0.50) when assessed in a Cox regression model with factors treatment, anatomical location (face or scalp), and interaction between treatment and anatomical location.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ingenol disoxate phase 3 trials (including additional follow-up from trial LP0084-1369): In 2 of these trials, LP0084-1193 and LP0084-1194, subjects were treated on the face or chest with ingenol disoxate 0.018%. In the 2 other trials, i.e. LP0084-1195 and LP0084-1196, the anatomical location was the scalp and the concentration was 0.037%. For both ingenol disoxate and vehicle, more events occurred in the face/chest trials compared to the scalp trials. The hazard rate ratio (ingenol disoxate vs. vehicle) was numerically larger for the combined scalp trials than the face/chest trials; however, the interaction between treatment and anatomical location was not significant (p=0.44) when assessed in a Cox regression model with factors treatment (ingenol disoxate or vehicle), anatomical location (face/chest or scalp), and interaction between treatment and anatomical location. Since the effect of dose and anatomical location cannot be separated, this also implies no evidence of a dose-response relationship. Excluding the additional data collected in the LP0084-1369 trial does not affect the conclusion.

For the remaining randomised controlled trials with ingenol mebutate/disoxate, a discussion of interaction by application site and dose-response relationship is not considered applicable since one of the following apply: · No or very few events occurred inside the treatment area in the ingenol mebutate/disoxate group (ingenol mebutate 8-week trials, LP0041-1120, LP0105-1012, ingenol disoxate 8-week trials) · The occurrence of skin malignancies inside the treatment area was lower in the ingenol mebutate group compared to the vehicle group (LP0041-21, LP0041-22) · The occurrence of skin malignancies inside the treatment area was similar in the ingenol mebutate and vehicle group and the difference was not statistically significant (LP0105-1032) 2.2.4. Data from post-marketing reports The MAH has provided the results of a search in its global safety database with the Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries (MedDRA SMQ) 'Skin malignant tumours' with a data lock point on 6 September 2019. Results are presented below with a focus on aspects that could help better characterising the risk, as the relevance of this data to prove or exclude this risk is very limited. The search identified 84 valid post-marketing reports (including solicited cases from non-interventional studies). These cases represented 91 events in the SMQ 'Skin malignant tumours'. An overview of the adverse events reported in these cases, individual details of all cases and a cumulative presentation of the reported time to onset are included in the below tables and figure.

In the 3-year follow-up trial comparing ingenol mebutate to imiquimod, there is a significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin malignancy between ingenol mebutate and the active control (imiquimod) in the treatment area, but not outside the treatment area.

In total 58 events of SCCs, reported in 57 patients, and 4 events of Bowen´s disease, reported in 4 patients (one case reporting both Bowen's disease and SCC), originating from 60 reports were identified. Seen as a whole, the reports describe a population at high risk of developing SCC: the vast majority are of advanced age, a large number of patients have past medical history of skin malignancy and are pre-disposed as per indication of sun-damaged skin. The majority of the reported SCC events and Bowen's disease were observed less than 4 months after ingenol mebutate treatment (43 events). In several of the cases reporting a short time to onset of 4 months or less, the identified lesions were described as fast-growing. Several of the cases report that a significant increase in size of the tumour is apparent over as little as 4 weeks or less. Whilst most reported cases were SCC, 8 events of BCC have been reported in 8 patients In addition, 21 events of non-melanoma skin tumours other than SCC or BCC have been: 8 cases of KA, 4 cases of atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), 3 cases of malignant melanoma, 2 cases of lentigo maligna, 2 cases of unspecified skin cancer, 1 case of sarcoma of skin and 1 case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. 2.2.5. Discussion on safety data on skin tumour In clinical trials which compare ingenol mebutate versus vehicle with 8-week follow-up, there is no significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin tumours. However, when considering a larger treatment area, there is a significant statistical difference in a pooled analysis of three clinical trials driven by the development of KA in severely sun-damaged patients seen in one study (LP0105-1020). In long term clinical trials which compare ingenol mebutate versus vehicle there is no significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin malignancy, whatever the duration of follow-up or treatment area surface. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the other active controlled trial, comparing ingenol mebutate to diclofenac, with 17 weeks of followup, there was only 1 skin malignancy inside the treatment area, which was in the ingenol mebutate group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ingenol disoxate and ingenol mebutate have the same therapeutic moiety (ingenol) and the difference of the salt (disoxate and mebutate). Thus, data observed with ingenol disoxate are considered relevant the evaluation of the safety profile of ingenol mebutate.

In ingenol disoxate 8-week vehicle-controlled trials, there is no significant statistical difference of occurrence of skin tumours between ingenol disoxate and vehicle.

In ingenol disoxate 14-months vehicle-controlled trials, there is a significant statistical difference of occurrence of skin tumours between ingenol disoxate and vehicle (p=0.005) with a risk difference of 4.9% (95% CI: 2.5%, 7.3%) when compared to vehicle. This is driven by BCC, Bowen's disease, and SCC. The Kaplan-Meier curves begin to separate at month 5. There is no indication of a dose-response relation.

Moreover, there is a significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin tumours between ingenol disoxate and vehicle in the observational explorative study LP0084-1369, a 2-year follow-up extension of 4 phase 3 trials (p=0.014). With regards to the interaction by application site, the trial LP0041-63 suggests a larger relative risk (ingenol mebutate vs comparator) of skin malignancies in subjects treated on the face than in subjects treated on the scalp; however, the four 14 months follow-up ingenol disoxate trials suggest the opposite interaction. None of these associations are, however, statistically significant. In total 84 post-marketing case reports of skin malignant tumour were identified in the safety database of the MAH: more than half are SCCs (58) and the rest being Keratoacanthoma (8), BCC (6), Bowen's disease (4), atypical fibroxanthoma (4), malignant melanoma (3), lentigo maligna (2), skin cancer (2), neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (1) and sarcoma of the skin (1). The majority of the patients are of advanced age (85% of cases report unknown age or above 65), a large number of patients have past medical history of skin malignancy (33% of cases report skin malignancy history, 85% report either present skin malignancy history, or lack of information on skin malignancy history) and they are pre-disposed to sun-damaged skin. The majority of the reported skin malignancies were observed less than 4 months after Picato treatment (61 events, 67%), especially for SCCs 40/57 (70%). Assuming no retreatment and acknowledging the potential for under-reporting the reporting rates in the post-marketing setting (3.5 - 4 cases per 100,000 patient-year) would appear to be well below background rates. In the UK in 2016, incidence rates of NMSC, after adjusting for age, were 204.2 per 100,000 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 202.6 - 205.7) in women, and 327.7 per 100,000PY (95% CI 325.5 - 329.8) in men (Cancer Research UK 2019). One study among 918 adults with 10 or more AKs but no previous history of skin cancer estimated incidence rates of 4106 and 3198 per 100 000 personyears, for BCC and SCC, respectively (Foote 2001). Data from post-marketing cases is difficult to interpret as elements allowing to determine whether reported skin tumours may be considered to be a manifestation of the risk factors present in the treated population and/or related to treatment with ingenol mebutate are lacking.

A number of hypothesis explaining the imbalance of skin tumour observed in the above-mentioned clinical trials were postulated, however as discussed below, these do not allow to rule out a tumour promoting effect of ingenol mebutate.

While both studies cannot be directly compared, a comparable imbalance to that observed in the LP0041-63 trial, was also seen between imiquimod and diclofenac in the LEIDA trial (risk difference: 5.6% [95% CI: 0.7%, 10.7%]) (Gollnick, 2019). Looking at invasive SCC alone, 4 subjects (1.7%) in the imiquimod group and 7 (3.0%) in the diclofenac group developed SCC in the treatment area. This may point to the efficacy of imiquimod rather than to promotion of existing tumours by the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comparator, be it diclofenac or ingenol mebutate. Therefore, it has been postulated that the imbalance observed could be the consequence of the potential mechanism of action of imiquimod on SCC. The PRAC noted however that imiquimod is indicated in AK and superficial BCC but not in SCC.

It was also postulated that the observed imbalance in skin tumours may be linked to the potential unmasking of SCC lesions by ingenol mebutate. SCC lesions may be pre-existing at the time of topical treatment but not readily recognised as suspicious in the heavily actinically damaged skin, in which suspected or small SCCs may be adjacent to or obscured by AKs (Bettencourt MS. 2015). Once the AK effectively cleared with ingenol mebutate, the remaining SCC lesion would thus be unmasked. The MAH further supported this hypothesis by the fact that most of reported post-marketing skin malignancies events were identified within the treatment area with a time to onset of less than 4 months. To the MAH it is unlikely that SCCs, which represent the majority of skin malignancy events reported postmarketing, would arise de novo after treatment with Picato, as they assume a slow progression of SCCs. For the same reasons, tumour promoters are agents that over long term, repeated exposure may lead to progression of a pre-existing tumour, whereas short-term tumour promotion has not been described thus far (Elinav, 2013; Dalgleish, 2006; Shalapour, 2015). The MAH further argued that fastgrowing tumours are more indicative of KA than SCCs. SCCs and KAs may be difficult to distinguish clinically and histologically, which may be the explanation of reports of SCCs. The correct histological diagnosis of KA may require considerable expertise, and for medico legal reasons there is a growing tendency to report KA as 'SCC' or 'SCC (KA type)'. An important consequence of the above considerations with regard to occurrence of skin tumours, especially SCCs, after treatment with ingenol mebutate and, indeed any therapy for AK, is that centralised pathology reading is necessary to get a reliable estimate of the incidence. This was also observed in trial LP0105-1020, in which all 11 SCCs were re-classified as KAs. It should be underlined that not all study participants were biopsied in this study, and not all biopsies were centrally reviewed. KAs can develop shortly after virtually any skin therapy that directly or indirectly causes inflammation, has a rapid growth phase of 2 to 10 weeks, a stationary phase of similar duration, and a phase of involution that may take 2 months to 1 year. Moreover, it would appear that in the vehicle-controlled LP0105-1020 and LP0105-1032 trials and the vehicle-controlled ingenol disoxate studies, a history of SCC, BCC, malignant melanoma or other neoplasia in the selected treatment area was not an exclusion criterion. In the uncontrolled ingenol mebutate 500mcg/g trial LP0041-62, 4.4% of patients had a pre-existing malignancy identified on the screening biopsy. It seems difficult then to exclude that some lesions detected in the ingenol mebutate arms of LP0105-1020 and LP0105-1032 and the ingenol disoxate arms of the ingenol disoxate studies could be pre-existing, unrecognised lesions. Nevertheless, the PRAC considered this justification not entirely supported, indeed if this mechanism is assumed, an increased number of SCCs would be observed in the ingenol mebutate groups compared to the vehicle groups, which was not the case. Finally, no 'unmasking' effect was observed with other, more effective, AK treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH considers that the investigators were likely to be partly unblinded by observation of marked local skin reactions in ingenol treated patients (but not vehicle). Therefore, the MAH considers that the results may be confounded by a tendency to biopsy lesions that reoccur in the subjects treated with ingenol disoxate, because these lesions are perceived as 'treatment resistant', which routinely elicits biopsy. To the MAH, this could lead to a detection bias where more biopsies are taken from patients treated with ingenol disoxate than with vehicle, potentially also leading to a higher number of positive findings related to NMSC in the ingenol disoxate group. The PRAC considered that this hypothesis cannot be excluded, however the stimulation of tumour growth by ingenol disoxate could also be an explanation for the observed imbalance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, the absence of reduction in incidence of skin tumour in the ingenol mebutate arm of the above-mentioned trials compared to vehicle, keeping in mind that skin cancers remain relatively rare events which might be difficult to observe in these trials, is of concern. Taking into account that ingenol mebutate clears the face and the scalp from AK lesions known to be pre-cancerous lesions, less cancer could be expected in corresponding trial arms. It could also suggest that ingenol mebutate treat some precancerous AK lesions, but also promote some skin tumours, unless a detection bias would occur as described above.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

The MAH has performed a critical review of mechanisms by which Picato might lead to rapidly accelerated growth or increased incidence of tumours by using the publication by Hanahan (Hanahan D, et al, 2011). The authors systematically evaluated 10 recognised capabilities called 'Hallmarks' acquired during the multistep development of human tumours, which together encompass all the capabilities needed for a tumour to escape normal cell regulation, grow, invade and metastasise. For each of the 10 hallmarks the MAH has reviewed all existing evidence that ingenol mebutate may have supporting/opposing/no effect on the hallmark. As ingenol mebutate is an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), literature on the effect of PKC on the hallmarks has also been included in the review. Experimental evidence unequivocally points towards an anti-tumour-promoting effect of ingenol mebutate on 6 of these hallmarks, except in case of prolonged use (24 hours in culture) for two of these (enabling replicative immortality and inducing angiogenesis) for which the mechanism is possible by downregulation of PKC expression. Extrapolation of prolonged use studied with Picato administration in human is difficult but considering non-clinical data in minipigs which revealed persistence of ingenol mebutate in skin for at least 4 weeks after application, these mechanisms of action cannot be excluded. There is evidence that ingenol mebutate has no effect on one hallmark (genome instability and mutation). One hallmark (deregulating cellular energetics) has not been studied and thus an effect cannot be excluded there. For 2 hallmarks, 'sustaining proliferative signalling' and 'evading growth suppressors', there is conflicting evidence. There is solid in vitro evidence that ingenol mebutate inhibits proliferation, whereas in vivo studies in several species showed acanthosis (diffuse epidermal hyperplasia, a normal physiological response to skin irritation), which was reversible 8-weeks after last administration. This phenomenon was also reported with other inflammation inducing drugs (e.g. imiquimod treatment in mice). Thus, acanthosis is unlikely to give rise to any long-term increase in skin cancer growth.

The MAH also conducted a literature review of evidence of any potential carcinogenic effects of ingenol mebutate high-occupancy targets (27 proteins) identified in an in vitro study in immortalised human cell lines a by Parker (2017). Of note, the existence and nature (inhibitory, stimulatory, equivocal) of any interactions between ingenol mebutate and these proteins is purely theoretical as they have not been demonstrated in vivo or in cell culture in vitro. An additional potential target for ingenol mebutate, CACT, was also investigated. Overall, CACT was concluded not to play a significant role in skin cancer development and none of the potential ingenol mebutate high-occupancy targets identified by Parker et al (2017) were found to impose a risk for developing NMSC in patients treated topically with Picato.

In addition, results from requested in vitro colony formation and migration studies in keratinocytes and SCC cell lines suggested that in all cell types (healthy keratinocytes, patient-derived AK cells, human SCC cell lines) migration was either inhibited or unaffected by ingenol mebutate when compared to control. This conclusion based on one experiment only.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from requested in vitro colony formation and migration studies immortalised AK cell line were inconsistent so far.

Overall, no clear mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate in tumour development was identified. A role of PKC activation/downregulation of PKC expression in promoting tumours cannot be ruled out based on available data.

of all AKs in the treatment area after 8 weeks, were randomised to another treatment course with Picato or vehicle. Patients in whom the first treatment course led to complete clearance were seen at 26 and 44 weeks and randomised to a second treatment course if they had a recurrence in the field. The first treatment course, given open label, resulted in a complete clearance rate of 62% (277/450). The results of the randomised and blinded second treatment course are presented in the below table.

2.4.2. New data on the efficacy of Picato The results of a multicentre, single-blind, randomised trial comparing the efficacy and safety of ingenol mebutate to 3 other treatments for actinic keratosis were recently published (Jansen, 2019). A total of 624 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 5% fluorouracil cream, 5% imiquimod cream, methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), or 0.015% ingenol mebutate gel. The treatment strategy allowed for a second treatment in case of insufficient treatment response, defined as a lesion response of less than 75% at the first follow-up visit. In case of less than 75% clearance of actinic keratosis 3 months after the final treatment, those patients were assessed as having treatment failure for the final analysis.

The efficacy of Picato was previously assessed as follows:

A modified intention-to-treat analysis was based on 602 randomly assigned patients who started treatment and for whom data regarding the primary outcome were available. Figure 12. Cumulative probability of treatment success at 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment and hazard ratios for treatment failure 2.4.3. Discussion on Efficacy Medicinal product no longer authorised

- rate of success at 2 months (defined as the percentage of patients in whom 75% or more of the number of baseline actinic keratosis lesions were cleared): 63.9%;
- rate of recurrence at 12 months (defined as any identified actinic keratosis lesion in the previously treated area for patients who achieved complete clearance at day 57): 53.9%.

In the recently published study, the rate of success of Picato is 67.3% at 3 months and 42.9% at 12 months. It further supports that the efficacy of Picato is moderate and not maintained in time as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment failure was reported in 57.1% of the patients at 12 months, despite allowing for a retreatment in case of insufficient response. Further, it shows that it has the lowest efficacy of all four treatment options (42.9% for Picato at 12 months versus 49.6% for MAL-PDT, 71% for imiquimod and 82.4% for fluorouracil).

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

Picato (ingenol mebutate) was authorised in the EU under the centralised procedure in November 2012 for the cutaneous treatment of non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis in adults. Picato 150 micrograms/gram gel is used on the face and scalp while Picato 500 micrograms/gram gel is used on the trunk and extremities. The potential for Picato to induce skin tumours was considered during the initial marketing authorisation application evaluation and the conduct of a trial was imposed on the MA to investigate the long-term risk of SCC compared to imiquimod (LP0041-63). PRAC considered the final safety data of this study as well as a cumulative review of all cases of skin tumours in clinical trials with ingenol mebutate and data on skin tumours from randomised clinical trials with ingenol disoxate and from post-marketing reports. PRAC also considered non-clinical data on mechanisms by which Picato might lead to rapidly accelerated growth or increased incidence of tumours. In addition, efficacy data from a recently published trial was considered in the context of the known efficacy of Picato (Jansen, 2019). The significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin malignancy between ingenol mebutate and the active control (imiquimod) observed in the interim results of the LP0041-63 trial, is confirmed in the final results (21 cancers versus 6), which is of major concern. While the MAH suggests this might be explained by an intrinsic efficacy of imiquimod, an alternative possibility is that Picato fails to prevent malignancies either because it promotes skin malignancies, or because despite its moderate action on actinic keratosis this does not lead to the expected goal of preventing the development of skin malignancies. While a difference was also observed between diclofenac and imiquimod in the LEIDA trial (Gollnick, 2019), the difference was more limited and the time to onset is less suggestive as the difference between the two arms appeared at a later stage, in addition both trials cannot be directly compared. There was a significant statistical difference in the occurrence of skin tumours between ingenol disoxate and vehicle in a pooled analysis of 14-months trials, with a risk difference of 4.9% (95% CI: 2.5%, 7.3%). This is driven by BCC, Bowen's disease, and SCC. Ingenol disoxate is closely related to ingenol mebutate, and its safety profile is considered relevant to characterise that of Picato. The MAH postulated that the results may be confounded by a tendency to biopsy lesions that reoccur in the subjects treated with ingenol disoxate, because these lesions are perceived as 'treatment resistant', which routinely elicits biopsy. This hypothesis cannot be excluded, however the stimulation of tumour growth by ingenol disoxate could also be an explanation for the observed imbalance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In 8-week follow-up vehicle-controlled clinical trials with ingenol mebutate, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of skin tumours. However, when considering a larger treatment area there is a significant statistical difference in a pooled analysis of three clinical trials driven by the development of KA in severely sun-damaged patients seen in the LP0105-1020 trial. In long term vehicle-controlled clinical trials no significant difference in the occurrence of skin malignancy was observed, whatever the duration of follow-up or treatment area surface. Acknowledging that skin cancers remain relatively rare events which might be difficult to observe in this context, the clearance of AK lesions known to be pre-cancerous by ingenol mebutate would be expected to reduce the occurrence of skin cancers compared to the vehicle arm. The absence of such effect could also suggest

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that ingenol mebutate treats some precancerous AK lesions, but also promotes some skin tumours, unless the above-mentioned detection bias would intervene.

Post-marketing surveillance has kept reporting increasing numbers of skin cancers, especially SCC. Cumulatively, 84 skins cancers are reported. The majority of the reported skin malignancies were observed less than 4 months after Picato treatment, especially for SCC. Whilst the patient exposure was not estimated, considering the estimated 2.8 million treatment courses administered, this does not appear superior to known background rates of these conditions.

While no clear mechanism could be identified at present for a tumour promoting effect of ingenol mebutate, protein kinase C (PKC)/down-regulation of PKC expression could not be ruled out.

Given the available information on the risk of skin malignancy, the PRAC considered that provisional measures are needed and recommended that the marketing authorisations of Picato be suspended forthwith in all concerned EU Member States awaiting the adoption of the final measures.

In this context it is also noted that a recently published study provides further evidence on the level of efficacy of Picato at 3 months (67.3% clearance) and at 12 months (42.9% clearance). A high recurrence rate is observed. PRAC noted that in this study the efficacy of Picato is lower to that of 3 alternative treatments (photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), imiquimod and fluorouracil). The authors noted that no unexpected toxic events were reported. While it is acknowledged that the study was likely not powered to evaluate malignancy, based on the incidences reported in the clinical trials in which malignancies have been observed with ingenol, cases of malignancy might have been expected. In addition to photodynamic therapy, imiquimod, fluorouracil and diclofenac, the PRAC noted that in case of isolated lesions cryotherapy, curettage, excisional surgery constitute effective alternative options to ingenol mebutate. Altogether a detailed analysis was available for 14 of the MAH-sponsored clinical trials and a number of uncertainties remain regarding the effect of possible detection bias, an unmasking effect, the effect of the activity of imiquimod on the finding of LP0041-63, retention time in human skin and a mechanism for a tumour promoting effect of ingenol. The PRAC noted that on 9 January 2020 the MAH of Picato sent a request to the European Commission to withdraw its marketing authorisation. The MAH stated that this request is based on commercial reasons. Considering the growing concerns regarding a possible risk of skin tumour in the treatment area associated to Picato, including the final results of study LP0041-63 and noting the recent publication of results further supporting that the efficacy of Picato is not maintained over time, the PRAC recommended as a precaution the provisional suspension of the marketing authorisation while the review continues. 4.

## 5. Grounds for provisional Recommendation

Whereas,

- The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 resulting from pharmacovigilance data, in particular regarding the need for provisional measures in accordance with Article 20(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Picato (ingenol mebutate) and taking into account the grounds set out in Article 116 of Directive 2001/83/EC.
- The PRAC reviewed the information currently available to the Committee, from clinical trials, post-marketing reports and non-clinical studies, on the risk of skin tumour in the treatment area in patients treated with Picato (ingenol mebutate). The PRAC also noted the MAH's request to withdraw the MA.

· The PRAC considered of concern the evidence on skin malignancies from all the available data with ingenol mebutate, including the statistically significant imbalance in skin malignancy with ingenol mebutate compared to imiquimod, observed in the interim results of trial LP0041-63, and confirmed in the final study results. · The PRAC considered the remaining uncertainties regarding a mechanism for a tumour promoting effect of ingenol. · The PRAC noted that recent study results further support that the efficacy of Picato is not maintained over time. · Therefore, given the growing concerns on the serious risk of skin tumour possibly associated with Picato, the PRAC provisionally recommend as a precaution while the review continues that patients should no longer be treated with Picato. The Committee, as a consequence, considers that the benefit-risk balance of Picato (ingenol mebutate) is not favourable. Therefore, pursuant to Article 116 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the Committee recommends the provisional suspension of the marketing authorisations for Picato (ingenol mebutate).
