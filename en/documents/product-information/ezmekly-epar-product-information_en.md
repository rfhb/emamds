a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 or over. Clinical data in patients aged 65 or over is limited (see section 5.1).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Ezmekly has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min) or patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), and therefore, no dose recommendations can be made (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN), based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Ezmekly has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and therefore, no dose recommendation can be made (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Ezmekly in children below 2 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Ezmekly is for oral use.

The capsules can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).

Ezmekly capsules should be swallowed whole with drinking water. The capsules should not be chewed, broken or opened to ensure the full dose is administered.

For paediatric patients 2 to &lt;6 years of age and for patients who are unable to swallow whole capsules, Ezmekly is also available as a 1 mg dispersible tablet formulation that can be dispersed in water. Refer to the SmPC for Ezmekly dispersible tablets for method of administration.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular toxicity

Patients should be advised to report any new visual disturbances. RVO (retinal vein occlusion) and RPED (retinal pigment epithelial detachment) were commonly reported in adult patients receiving Ezmekly in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

A comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation prior to treatment initiation, at regular intervals during treatment, and at any time a patient reports new or worsening visual changes such as blurred vision is necessary in children, adolescents and adults. For ocular adverse reactions, mirdametinib therapy should be interrupted and then dose reduced or treatment permanently discontinued based on severity of the adverse reaction. If RVO is diagnosed, treatment with mirdametinib should be permanently discontinued. If symptomatic RPED is diagnosed, treatment with mirdametinib should be interrupted until resolution and the dose reduced when treatment is resumed. In patients diagnosed with RPED without reduced visual acuity, treatment can be continued but ophthalmic assessment should be conducted every 3 weeks until resolution (see section 4.2).

## Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

Asymptomatic decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline occurred in 17% of adult patients and 27% of paediatric patients in the ReNeu study. All cases of decreased LVEF in adult or paediatric patients in the clinical studies were asymptomatic (see section 4.8).

Patients with a history of impaired LVEF or a baseline ejection fraction that is below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN) have not been studied. LVEF should be evaluated by echocardiogram before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, every 3 months during the first year, then as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

clinically indicated thereafter. Prior to starting treatment, patients should have an ejection fraction above the institutional LLN.

Decreased LVEF can be managed using treatment interruption, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2).

## Skin toxicity

Skin adverse reactions, including rash (dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes), dry skin, pruritus, eczema, and hair changes have been reported in the ReNeu study (see section 4.8).

Patients should contact their doctor or nurse if they experience any skin reactions. Supportive care, e.g. the use of emollient creams, should be initiated at first signs of skin toxicity. Mirdametinib therapy should be interrupted, the dose reduced or permanently discontinued based on severity of the adverse reaction (see section 4.2).

## Carcinogenicity risk

A potential carcinogenicity risk in humans could not be excluded at the clinical exposure range (see section 5.3).

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males

Mirdametinib is not recommended in women of childbearing potential who are not using contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). Both male and female patients (of reproductive potential) should be advised to use effective contraception.

## Excipients with known effect

Each capsule contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, which means it is essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2).

## Effects of other medicinal products on mirdametinib pharmacokinetics

In vitro studies showed that mirdametinib is metabolised by multiple uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and carboxyl esterase (CES) enzymes. No clinical studies assessing the effect of a strong inducer and inhibitor of these enzymes have been performed. Therefore, caution should be made when mirdametinib is concomitantly used with medicinal products known to either induce or inhibit  these  enzymes:  probenecid,  diclofenac  (UGTs  inhibitors),  rifampicin  (UGT  inducer)  (see section 5.2).

## Effects of mirdametinib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

## Hormonal contraceptives

The effect of mirdametinib on the exposure of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives has not been evaluated.  Therefore,  use  of  an  additional  barrier  method  should  be  recommended  to  women  using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effects of gastric acid reducing agents on mirdametinib

The combination of mirdametinib with proton -pump inhibitors, antacids, or H2 -receptor antagonists is not expected to be clinically meaningful as mirdametinib does not exhibit pH dependent dissolution. Ezmekly can be used concomitantly with gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., H2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) without restrictions.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males

Women of childbearing potential should be advised that Ezmekly may cause foetal harm and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Ezmekly. It is recommended that a pregnancy test should be performed on women of childbearing potential prior to initiating treatment. Both female and male patients (of reproductive potential) should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months and 3 months, respectively, after the last dose. The effect of mirdametinib on the exposure of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives has not been evaluated, therefore women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be recommended to add a barrier method.

## Pregnancy

There are limited data on the use of mirdametinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ezmekly should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a female patient or a female partner of a male patient receiving Ezmekly becomes pregnant, she should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast -feeding

It is not known whether mirdametinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast -fed child cannot be excluded, therefore breast -feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ezmekly and should not be resumed for 1 week after the last dose.

## Fertility

Based on findings in animals, Ezmekly may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential. The reversibility of the effects on male and female reproductive organs in animals is unknown (see section 5.3). There are no data on the effect of mirdametinib on human fertility. The potential risk for humans is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ezmekly may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and blurred vision have been reported during treatment with mirdametinib (see section 4.8). Patients who experience these symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In the adult pool of NF1 patients, the most common adverse reactions of any grade were dermatitis acneiform (83%), diarrhoea (55%), nausea (55%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (47%), musculoskeletal pain (41%), vomiting (37%), and fatigue (36%). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in &gt;1 adult patient were dermatitis acneiform, diarrhoea, nausea, rash, and vomiting. The following serious adverse reactions were reported: abdominal pain (3%), musculoskeletal pain (1.3%) and retinal vein occlusion (1.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the paediatric pool of NF1 patients, the most common adverse reaction of any grade were blood creatine phosphokinase increased (59%), diarrhoea (53%), dermatitis acneiform (43%), musculoskeletal pain (41%), abdominal pain (40%), vomiting (40%), and headache (36%). The following serious adverse reaction was reported: musculoskeletal pain (1.7%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile of mirdametinib has been determined following evaluation of a combined safety population of 75 adult and 58 paediatric patients dosed at 2 mg/m 2 twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle. This pool of patients comprised 114 patients (58 adult, 56 paediatric) in ReNeu (the pivotal dataset), and 19 patients (17 adult, 2 paediatric) in NF -106.

In the adult pool (N = 75), the median total duration of mirdametinib treatment was 18.7 months (range: 0.4 to 45.6 months).

In the paediatric pool (N = 58, including 32 patients aged ≥ 2 to 11 years), the median total duration of mirdametinib treatment was 21.9 months (range: 1.6 to 40.1 months).

Table 4 presents the adverse reactions identified in the safety population.

Adverse reactions are classified by MedDRA system organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, preferred terms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Ocular toxicity

In the ReNeu study, retinal vein occlustion (RVO) was observed in 3% of adult patients, including Grade 3 RVO in 1.7% of patients which resulted in permanent discontinuation. Asymptomatic Grade 1 retinal pigment epithelium detachment (RPED) occurred in 1.7% of patients and was managed without dose modification. Vision blurred was reported by 12% of adult patients. The median time to first onset of ocular toxicity in adults was 147 days. The median time to resolution was 267 days. In these adults, 38% of patients reported resolution of their ocular toxicity, while 25% reported resolution of events with sequelae.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vision blurred was reported by 7% of paediatric patients. The median time to first onset of vision blurred was 161 days in paediatric patients. The median time to resolution was 29 days. All paediatric patients reported resolution of events of vision blurred (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

In the ReNeu study, asymptomatic decreased LVEF was reported in 16% of adults. Of these patients, only one reported an LVEF to &lt; 50%, which led to discontinuation followed by return to normal values. Of the remaining adult patients with decreased LVEF, five had a dose interruption, and one patient had a dose reduction. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in adults was 70 days. Decreased LVEF resolved in 89% of adult patients.

In the ReNeu study, asymptomatic decreased LVEF was reported in 27% of paediatric patients. Of these patients, one reported an LVEF to &lt; 50%, which returned to normal values without dose modification. One patient had a Grade 3 decreased LVEF that resolved without dose modification and another patient with Grade 2 decreased LVEF had a dose interruption. The remaining 12 patients' events of decreased LVEF were Grade 2 and no action was taken with study treatment in response to any of these events. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in paediatric patients was 132 days. Decreased LVEF resolved in 67% of paediatric patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Skin toxicity

In the ReNeu study, dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 90% of adult patients. Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform and other rashes occurred in 9% and 1.7% of adult patients, respectively. Rashes resulted in discontinuations in 10% of adults and dose reductions in 10% of adults. The median time to first onset of rashes was 9 days in adult patients. The median time to resolution was 115 days. In these adult patients, 33 (64%) reported resolution of their rashes, 3 (6%) reported resolution with sequelae, and 8 (15%) reported that their rashes were resolving.

In the ReNeu study, dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 70% of paediatric patients. Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 1.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Rashes resulted in discontinuations in 4% of paediatric patients, and dose reductions in 4% of paediatric patients. Dermatitis acneiform occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 12 to 17 years, while other rashes occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 2 to 11 years. The median time to first onset of rashes in paediatric patients was 15 days. The median time to resolution was 155 days. In these paediatric patients, 27 (69%) reported resolution of their rashes and 3 (8%) reported that their rashes were resolving (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Musculoskeletal pain

In the ReNeu study, musculoskeletal pain (including musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain in extremity, back pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain, non -cardiac chest pain, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported by 41% of adult and 41% of paediatric patients. Concomitant medications used to treat musculoskeletal pain included non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medicinal products, non -opioid analgesics and glucocorticoids. Treat musculoskeletal pain as clinically indicated.

## AST and ALT increased

In the ReNeu study, laboratory shifts of ALT increased were observed in 9% of adult and 21% of paediatric patients. Laboratory shifts of AST increased were observed in 18% of adult and 9% of paediatric patients. All events were mild to moderate severity with no Grade 3 events reported. ALT and AST increased did not result in any discontinuations, dose reductions or interruptions. Monitor and manage increases in ALT and AST as clinically indicated.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions and treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. Dialysis is ineffective in the treatment of overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; Mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, ATC Code: L01EE05

## Mechanism of action

Mirdametinib is a selective, non -competitive inhibitor of mitogen -activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). Mirdametinib blocks MEK activity and the rat sarcoma (RAS) -rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) -MEK pathway. Therefore, MEK inhibition blocks proliferation and survival of tumour cells in which the RAF -MEK -extracellular related kinase (ERK) pathway is activated.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of mirdametinib was evaluated in 114 patients in ReNeu, a multi -centre, open -label, single -arm, Phase 2 study in patient s ≥ 2 years of age with symptomatic inoperable NF1 -PN causing significant morbidity. An inoperable PN was defined as a PN that cannot be completely surgically removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. Patients received Ezmekly 2 mg/m 2 orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

A total of 58 adult patients received Ezmekly. The median age was 34.5 years (range 18 to 69 years); 85% were Caucasian, 64% were female and 3.4% were greater than 65 years of age. Approximately half of the patients (53%) had a progressing PN at study entry, 48% had their tumour in the head and neck, and 69% had prior surgery. All patients had significant morbidities. The most commonly reported morbidities were pain (90%) disfigurement or major deformity (52%), and motor dysfunction (40%).

A total of 56 paediatric patients received Ezmekly; 57% were aged 2 to 11 years and 43% were aged 12 to 17 years. The median age was 10.0 years (range 2 to 17 years); 66% were Caucasian and 54% were female. Half of participants (50%) had their tumour in head and neck, most participants had a progressing PN at study entry (63%) and 36% had prior surgery. The majority of patients (96%) had significant morbidities. The most commonly reported morbidities were pain (70%), disfigurement or major deformity (50%) and motor dysfunction (27%).

The primary efficacy endpoint measure was confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (disappearance of the target PN) or confirmed partial response (≥ 20% reduction in PN volume confirmed at consecutive tumour assessments approximately every four cycles within 2 -6 months during the 24 -cycle treatment phase). Tumour response status was assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) approximately every four cycles using

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Objective response rate was evaluated per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) criteria with two consecutive assessments of partial response or complete response by a BICR within 2 -6 months during the 24 -cycle treatment phase.

A secondary efficacy objective was to determine the duration of response for patients who achieved a confirmed objective response.

Efficacy results are provided in Table 5. The median time to onset of response was 7.8 months (range: 4.0 months to 19.0 months) for the adult cohort and 7.9 months (range: 4.1 months to 18.8 months) for the paediatric cohort. The median duration of response was not reached for either cohort.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib was studied in healthy subjects, NF1 -PN patients and advanced cancer patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

Following multiple oral doses at 2 mg/m 2 twice daily, the geomean [geometric % coefficient of variation (CV)] Cmax and AUClast in adult participants with NF1 -PN were 188 (52%) ng/mL and 431 (43%) ng × h/mL, respectively. Following oral dosing, mirdametinib produced peak steady state plasma concentrations (Tmax) approximately one hour post -dose.

## Effect of food

In healthy adult subjects at a single dose of 20 mg, co -administration of mirdametinib with a high -fat, high -calorie meal resulted in 43% lower Cmax, while the area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) was not significantly changed (AUCinf decreased by 7%). The time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) was delayed by approximately 3 hours. The effect on Cmax is not considered clinically relevant due to the absence of effect on overall exposure.

## Distribution

Following a single oral dose of 4 mg [ 14 C]mirdametinib in healthy subjects, the mean apparent volume of distribution of mirdametinib was 255 L. Human plasma protein binding is &gt;99%. Mirdametinib is mainly bound to human serum albumin (&gt;99%). Binding to α1acid glycoprotein (AAG) ranged from 17.2% to 54.3%. The blood/plasma ratio for mirdametinib is 0.61.

## Biotransformation

Mirdametinib is highly metabolised via glucuronidation and oxidation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and carboxyl esterase (CES) enzymes, resulting in M22 (a secondary O -glucuronide metabolite) and M15 (a carboxylic acid metabolite), respectively. Less than 10% is excreted unchanged.

## Interactions

## Effect of mirdametinib on CYP450 enzymes

In vitro , mirdametinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. Mirdametinib is an inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro , however there is a low potential for CYP3A4 induction at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Effect of mirdametinib on UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)

In vitro , mirdametinib is not an inhibitor of the isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Effect of mirdametinib on drug transporters

In vitro studies suggest that mirdametinib and its major metabolite do not inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P -glycoprotein (P -gp), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K transporters.

Based on in vitro studies, mirdametinib is a substrate for BCRP and P-gp transporters and its major metabolite is a substrate for BCRP, but they are unlikely to be clinically relevant.

## Elimination

In healthy adult subjects, following a single dose of 4 mg of radiolabelled mirdametinib, 68% of the dose was recovered in urine (0.7% unchanged) while 27% was recovered in faeces (8.7% unchanged in urine and faeces). The mean terminal half life is 28 hours. The apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) is 6.34 L/h.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Linearity

Mirdametinib exposures, as measured by Cmax and AUCtau, generally increased dose proportionally from 1 mg QD/BID to 30 mg BID. A linear relationship between dose and exposure was verified by population pharmacokinetic analyses over the dose range of 1 mg to 20 mg mirdametinib BID . The mean accumulation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 across dose levels from 1 to 30 mg.

Steady -state concentrations in patients with NF1 -PN are achieved on average approximately 6 days following repeat administration.

## Special populations

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (2 to 86 years), sex and race (72% white, 11% black or African American, and 12% Asian) do not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib.

## Renal impairment

No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD).

Patients with creatinine clearance indicative of mild or moderate renal impairment participated in mirdametinib clinical studies. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that mild or moderate renal impairment (as estimated by creatinine clearance) do not impact mirdametinib exposure.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment indicate no meaningful effects on exposure.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetic profile in children is similar to that of adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non -clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Mirdametinib was not genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay but was equivocal in the in vivo micronucleus study and in vivo chromosomal aberrations study in rats. A genotoxicity risk in human could not be excluded at the clinical exposure range.

Mirdametinib was not carcinogenic in transgenic mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day (3 times the human exposure). Since a genotoxicity risk in humans could not be excluded at clinical exposure and the 2 -year rat carcinogenicity study is performed at exposures below the clinical exposure, a carcinogenicity risk could not be excluded.

## Repeat -dose toxicity

In oral, repeat dose toxicity studies conducted for up to 3 months in rats and dogs, the primary toxicities due to MEK inhibition were in the skin and GI tract at doses below human exposure. In the 3 -month rat study with mirdametinib, at doses approximately equivalent to the human exposure, rats showed dysplasia in femoral epiphyseal growth plate, metaphyseal hypocellularity of the bone marrow of long bones, and metaphyseal thickening of bone trabeculae of long bones. Male rats were more sensitive to these effects. These bone effects were not seen in other species (dogs, monkeys or mice).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reversibility of dysplasia in epiphyseal growth plate was not evaluated. In rats, systemic mineralization and ocular findings (corneal opacities and atrophy or thinning of the corneal epithelium) were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies at doses below human exposure. Increases in liver enzymes (rats) and hepatocellular necrosis (rats, mice, and dogs) were observed at exposures similar to clinical exposure. In a 2 -week study in cynomolgus monkeys, gallbladder toxicity was observed at exposures &gt;2.5 -fold the human exposure.

CNS effects were observed in dogs in the 3 -month study at exposures approximately 1.5 times the human exposure; these effects in dogs, including impaired balance and tremors, were reversible and there was no microscopic correlate.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

In a male and female rat fertility study, mirdametinib at a dose up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC) did not affect mating performance or fertility in both sexes. In a 3 -month repeat -dose toxicology study in rats, mirdametinib caused decreased ovarian organ weight and increased follicular cysts associated with decreases in the number of corpora lutea at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human exposure), as well as testicular hypocellularity and decreased weight of epididymides at 1 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the human exposure).

In preliminary embryo -foetal developmental toxicity studies in pregnant rats and rabbits, oral dosing of mirdametinib induced postimplantation loss (early and late resorptions) and decreased foetal body weights at exposures below the human exposures at the recommended dose. In the preliminary rat study, a single foetus had extremity malformations at doses 3.6 -fold higher than the recommended human dose. Definitive embryo -foetal development and pre -and post -natal development studies were not conducted with mirdametinib.

## Phototoxicity

Mirdametinib was equivocal in an in vitro mouse fibroblast phototoxicity assay at significantly higher concentrations than clinical exposures and was not retained in the skin or eyes of rats, indicating that there is low risk for phototoxicity in patients taking mirdametinib.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 or over. Clinical data in patients aged 65 or over is limited (see section 5.1).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Ezmekly has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min) or patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), and therefore, no dose recommendations can be made (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to 1.5x ULN or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN), based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Ezmekly has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and therefore, no dose recommendation can be made (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Ezmekly in children below 2 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Ezmekly is for oral use.

The dispersible tablets can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).

Ezmekly dispersible tablets can be swallowed whole, or if dosing of whole dispersible tablets is not possible, dispersible tablets can be dispersed in water prior to oral administration via dosing cup. Ezmekly oral suspension can also be administered via an enteral feeding tube. Please see section 6.6 for instructions on preparation and administration of the oral suspension.

Ezmekly is also available as a capsule formulation. It is recommended that the dispersible tablets be used in patients aged 2 to &lt; 6 and in adults who are unable to swallow capsules.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Ocular toxicity

Patients should be advised to report any new visual disturbances. RVO (retinal vein occlusion) and RPED (retinal pigment epithelial detachment) were commonly reported in adult patients receiving Ezmekly in clinical studies (see section 4.8).

A comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation prior to treatment initiation, at regular intervals during treatment, and at any time a patient reports new or worsening visual changes such as blurred vision is necessary in children, adolescents and adults. For ocular adverse reactions, mirdametinib therapy should be interrupted and then dose reduced or treatment permanently discontinued based on severity of the adverse reaction. If RVO is diagnosed, treatment with mirdametinib should be permanently discontinued. If symptomatic RPED is diagnosed, treatment with mirdametinib should be interrupted until resolution and the dose reduced when treatment is resumed. In patients diagnosed with RPED without reduced visual acuity, treatment can be continued but ophthalmic assessment should be conducted every 3 weeks until resolution (see section 4.2).

## Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

Asymptomatic decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline occurred in 17% of adult patients and 27% of paediatric patients in the ReNeu study. All cases of decreased LVEF in adult or paediatric patients in the clinical studies were asymptomatic (see section 4.8).

Patients with a history of impaired LVEF or a baseline ejection fraction that is below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN) have not been studied. LVEF should be evaluated by echocardiogram before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, every 3 months during the first year, then as clinically indicated thereafter. Prior to starting treatment, patients should have an ejection fraction above the institutional LLN.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Decreased LVEF can be managed using treatment interruption, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2).

## Skin toxicity

Skin adverse reactions, including rash (dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes), dry skin, pruritus, eczema, and hair changes have been reported in the ReNeu study (see section 4.8).

Patients should contact their doctor or nurse if they experience any skin reactions. Supportive care, e.g. the use of emollient creams, should be initiated at first signs of skin toxicity. Mirdametinib therapy should be interrupted, the dose reduced or permanently discontinued based on severity of the adverse reaction (see section 4.2).

## Carcinogenicity risk

A potential carcinogenicity risk in humans could not be excluded at the clinical exposure range (see section 5.3).

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males

Mirdametinib is not recommended in women of childbearing potential who are not using contraception (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). Both male and female patients (of reproductive potential) should be advised to use effective contraception.

## Excipients with known effect

Each dispersible tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose which means it is essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2).

## Effects of other medicinal products on mirdametinib pharmacokinetics

In vitro studies showed that mirdametinib is metabolised by multiple uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and carboxyl esterase (CES) enzymes. No clinical studies assessing the effect of a strong inducer and inhibitor of these enzymes have been performed.  Therefore, caution should be made when mirdametinib is concomitantly used with medicinal products known to either induce or inhibit these enzymes: probenecid, diclofenac (UGT inhibitors), rifampicin (UGT inducer) (see section 5.2).

## Effects of mirdametinib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

## Hormonal contraceptives

The effect of mirdametinib on the exposure of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives has not been evaluated. Therefore, use of an additional barrier method should be recommended to women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6).

## Effects of gastric acid reducing agents on mirdametinib

The combination of mirdametinib with proton -pump inhibitors, antacids, or H2 -receptor antagonists is not expected to be clinically meaningful as mirdametinib does not exhibit pH dependent dissolution. Ezmekly can be used concomitantly with gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., H2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) without restrictions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males

Women of childbearing potential should be advised that Ezmekly may cause foetal harm and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Ezmekly. It is recommended that a pregnancy test should be performed on women of childbearing potential prior to initiating treatment. Both female and male patients (of reproductive potential) should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months and 3 months, respectively, after the last dose. The effect of mirdametinib on the exposure of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives has not been evaluated, therefore women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be recommended to add a barrier method.

## Pregnancy

There are limited data on the use of mirdametinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ezmekly should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If a female patient or a female partner of a male patient receiving Ezmekly becomes pregnant, she should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast -feeding

It is not known whether mirdametinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast -fed child cannot be excluded, therefore breast -feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ezmekly and should not be resumed for 1 week after the last dose.

## Fertility

Based on findings in animals, Ezmekly may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential. The reversibility of the effects on male and female reproductive organs in animals is unknown (see section 5.3). There are no data on the effect of mirdametinib on human fertility. The potential risk for humans is unknown.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Ezmekly may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue and blurred vision have been reported during treatment with mirdametinib (see section 4.8). Patients who experience these symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In the adult pool of NF1 patients, the most common adverse reactions of any grade were dermatitis acneiform (83%), diarrhoea (55%), nausea (55%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (47%), musculoskeletal pain (41%), vomiting (37%), and fatigue (36%). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in &gt;1 adult patient were dermatitis acneiform, diarrhoea, nausea, rash, and vomiting. The following serious adverse reactions were reported: abdominal pain (3%), musculoskeletal pain (1.3%) and retinal vein occlusion (1.3%).

In the paediatric pool of NF1 patients, the most common adverse reaction of any grade were blood creatine phosphokinase increased (59%), diarrhoea (53%) dermatitis acneiform (43%), musculoskeletal pain (41%), abdominal pain (40%), vomiting (40%), and headache (36%). The following serious adverse reaction was reported: musculoskeletal pain (1.7%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile of mirdametinib has been determined following evaluation of a combined safety population of 75 adult and 58 paediatric patients dosed at 2 mg/m 2 twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle. This pool of patients comprised 114 patients (58 adult, 56 paediatric) in ReNeu (the pivotal dataset), and 19 patients (17 adult, 2 paediatric) in NF -106.

In the adult pool (N = 75), the median total duration of mirdametinib treatment was 18.7 months (range: 0.4 to 45.6 months).

In the paediatric pool (N = 58, including 32 patients aged ≥ 2 to 11 years), the median total duration of mirdametinib treatment was 21.9 months (range: 1.6 to 40.1 months).

Table 4 presents the adverse reactions identified in the safety population.

Adverse reactions are classified by MedDRA system organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, preferred terms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Ocular toxicity

In the ReNeu study, retinal vein occlustion (RVO) was observed in 3% of adult patients, including Grade 3 RVO in 1.7% of patients which resulted in permanent discontinuation. Asymptomatic Grade 1 retinal pigment epithelium detachment (RPED) occurred in 1.7% of patients and was managed without dose modification. Vision blurred was reported by 12% of adult patients. The median time to first onset of ocular toxicity in adults was 147 days. The median time to resolution was 267 days. In these adults, 38% of patients reported resolution of their ocular toxicity, while 25% reported resolution of events with sequelae.

Vision blurred was reported by 7% of paediatric patients. The median time to first onset of vision blurred was 161 days in paediatric patients. The median time to resolution was 29 days. All paediatric patients reported resolution of events of vision blurred (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

In the ReNeu study, asymptomatic decreased LVEF was reported in 16% of adults. Of these patients, only one reported an LVEF to &lt; 50%, which led to discontinuation followed by return to normal values. Of the remaining adult patients with decreased LVEF, five had a dose interruption, and one patient had a dose reduction. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in adults was 70 days. Decreased LVEF resolved in 89% of adult patients.

In the ReNeu study, asymptomatic decreased LVEF was reported in 27% of paediatric patients. Of these patients, one reported an LVEF to &lt; 50%, which returned to normal values without dose modification. One patient had a Grade 3 decreased LVEF that resolved without dose modification and another patient with Grade 2 decreased LVEF had a dose interruption. The remaining 12 patients' events of decreased LVEF were Grade 2 and no action was taken with study treatment in response to any of these events. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in paediatric patients was 132 days. Decreased LVEF resolved in 67% of paediatric patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Skin toxicity

In the ReNeu study, dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 90% of adult patients. Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform and other rashes occurred in 9% and 1.7% of adult patients, respectively. Rashes resulted in discontinuations in 10% of adults and dose reductions in 10% of adults. The median time to first onset of rashes was 9 days in adult patients. The median time to resolution was 115 days. In these adult patients, 33 (64%) reported resolution of their rashes, 3 (6%) reported resolution with sequelae, and 8 (15%) reported that their rashes were resolving.

In the ReNeu study, dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 70% of paediatric patients. Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform and non -acneiform rashes occurred in 1.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Rashes resulted in discontinuations in 4% of paediatric patients and dose reductions in 4% of paediatric patients. Dermatitis acneiform occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 12 to 17 years, while other rashes occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 2 to 11 years. The median time to first onset of rashes in paediatric patients was 15 days. The median time to resolution was 155 days. In these paediatric patients, 27 (69%) reported resolution of their rashes and 3 (8%) reported that their rashes were resolving (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Musculoskeletal pain

In the ReNeu study, musculoskeletal pain (including musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain in extremity, back pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain, non -cardiac chest pain, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported by 41% of adult and 41% of paediatric patients. Concomitant medications used to treat musculoskeletal pain included non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medicinal products, non -opioid analgesics and glucocorticoids. Treat musculoskeletal pain as clinically indicated.

## AST and ALT increased

In the ReNeu study, laboratory shifts of ALT increased were observed in 9% of adult and 21% of paediatric patients. Laboratory shifts of AST increased were observed in 18% of adult and 9% of paediatric patients. All events were mild to moderate severity with no Grade 3 events reported. ALT and AST increased did not result in any discontinuations, dose reductions or interruptions. Monitor and manage increases in ALT and AST as clinically indicated.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions and treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. Dialysis is ineffective in the treatment of overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; Mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, ATC Code: L01EE05

## Mechanism of action

Mirdametinib is a selective, non -competitive inhibitor of mitogen -activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). Mirdametinib blocks MEK activity and the rat sarcoma (RAS) -rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) -MEK pathway. Therefore, MEK inhibition blocks proliferation and survival of tumour cells in which the RAF -MEK -extracellular related kinase (ERK) pathway is activated.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of mirdametinib was evaluated in 114 patients in ReNeu, a multi -centre, open -label, single -arm, Phase 2 study in patients ≥ 2 years of age with symptomatic inoperable NF1 -PN causing significant morbidity. An inoperable PN was defined as a PN that cannot be completely surgically removed without risk for substantial morbidity due: to encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. Patients received Ezmekly 2 mg/m 2 orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

A total of 58 adult patients received Ezmekly. The median age was 34.5 years (range 18 to 69 years); 85% were Caucasian, 64% were female and 3.4% were greater than 65 years of age. Approximately half of the patients (53%) had a progressing PN at study entry, 48% had their tumour in the head and neck, and 69% had prior surgery. All patients had significant morbidities. The most commonly reported morbidities were pain (90%), disfigurement or major deformity (52%), and motor dysfunction (40%).

A total of 56 paediatric patients received Ezmekly: 57% were aged 2 to 11 years and 43% were aged 12 to 17 years. The median age was 10.0 years (range 2 to 17 years); 66% were Caucasian and 54% were female. Half of participants (50%) had their tumour in head and neck, most participants had a progressing PN at study entry (63%) and 36% had prior surgery. The majority of patients (96%) had significant morbidities. The most commonly reported morbidities were pain (70%), disfigurement or major deformity (50%) and motor dysfunction (27%).

The primary efficacy endpoint measure was confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (disappearance of the target PN) or confirmed partial response (≥ 20% reduction in PN volume confirmed at consecutive tumour assessments approximately every four cycles within 2 -6 months during the 24 -cycle treatment phase). Tumour response status was assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) approximately every four cycles using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Objective response rate was evaluated per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) criteria with two consecutive assessments of partial response or complete response by a BICR within 2-6 months during the 24 -cycle treatment phase.

A secondary efficacy objective was to determine the duration of response for patients who achieved a confirmed objective response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy results are provided in Table 5. The median time to onset of response was 7.8 months (range: 4.0 months to 19.0 months) for the adult cohort and 7.9 months (range: 4.1 months to 18.8 months) for the paediatric cohort. The median duration of response was not reached for either cohort.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib was studied in healthy subjects, NF1 -PN patients and advanced cancer patients.

## Absorption

Following multiple oral doses at 2 mg/m 2 twice daily, the geomean [geometric % coefficient of variation (CV)] Cmax and AUClast in adult participants with NF1 -PN were 188 (52%) ng/mL and 431 (43%) ng × h/mL, respectively. Following oral dosing, mirdametinib produced peak steady state plasma concentrations (Tmax) approximately one hour post -dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of food

In healthy adult subjects at a single dose of 20 mg, co -administration of mirdametinib with a high -fat, high -calorie meal resulted in 43% lower Cmax, while the area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) was not significantly changed (AUCinf decreased by 7%). The time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) was delayed by approximately 3 hours. The effect on Cmax is not considered clinically relevant due to the absence of effect on overall exposure.

## Distribution

Following a single oral dose of 4 mg [ 14 C]mirdametinib in healthy subjects, the mean apparent volume of distribution of mirdametinib was 255 L. Human plasma protein binding is &gt;99%. Mirdametinib is mainly bound to human serum albumin (&gt;99%). Binding to α1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) ranged from 17.2% to 54.3%. The blood/plasma ratio for mirdametinib is 0.61.

## Biotransformation

Mirdametinib is highly metabolised via glucuronidation and oxidation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and carboxyl esterase (CES) enzymes, resulting in M22 (a secondary O -glucuronide metabolite) and M15 (a carboxylic acid metabolite), respectively. Less than 10% is excreted unchanged.

## Interactions

## Effect of mirdametinib on CYP450 enzymes

In vitro , mirdametinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. Mirdametinib is an inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro , however there is a low potential for CYP3A4 induction at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Effect of mirdametinib on UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)

In vitro , mirdametinib is not an inhibitor of the isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Effect of mirdametinib on drug transporters

In vitro studies suggest that mirdametinib and its major metabolite do not inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P -glycoprotein (P -gp), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K transporters.

Based on in vitro studies, mirdametinib is a substrate for BCRP and P -gp transporters and its major metabolite is a substrate for BCRP, but they are unlikely to be clinically relevant .

## Elimination

In healthy adult subjects, following a single dose of 4 mg of radiolabelled mirdametinib, 68% of the dose was recovered in urine (0.7% unchanged) while 27% was recovered in faeces (8.7% unchanged in urine and faeces). The mean terminal half life is 28 hours. The apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) is 6.34 L/h.

## Linearity

Mirdametinib exposures, as measured by Cmax and AUCtau, generally increased dose proportionally from 1 mg QD/BID to 30 mg BID. A linear relationship between dose and exposure was verified by population pharmacokinetic analyses over the dose range of 1 mg to 20 mg mirdametinib BID. The mean accumulation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 1.9 across dose levels from 1 to 30 mg.

Steady -state concentrations in patients with NF1 -PN are achieved on average approximately 6 days following repeat administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (2 to 86 years), sex and race (72% white, 11% black or African American, and 12% Asian) do not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of mirdametinib.

## Renal impairment

No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD).

Patients with creatinine clearance indicative of mild or moderate renal impairment participated in mirdametinib clinical studies. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that mild or moderate renal impairment (as estimated by creatinine clearance) do not impact mirdametinib exposure.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment indicate no meaningful effects on exposure.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetic profile in children is similar to that of adults.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non -clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology.

## Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity

Mirdametinib was not genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay but was equivocal in the in vivo micronucleus study and in vivo chromosomal aberrations study in rats. A genotoxicity risk in human could not be excluded at the clinical exposure range.

Mirdametinib was not carcinogenic in transgenic mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day (3 times the human exposure). Since a genotoxicity risk in humans could not be excluded at clinical exposure and the 2 -year rat carcinogenicity study is performed at exposures below the clinical exposure, a carcinogenicity risk could not be excluded.

## Repeat -dose toxicity

In oral, repeat dose toxicity studies conducted for up to 3 months in rats and dogs, the primary toxicities due to MEK inhibition were in the skin and GI tract at doses below human exposure. In the 3 -month rat study with mirdametinib, at doses approximately equivalent to the human exposure, rats showed dysplasia in femoral epiphyseal growth plate, metaphyseal hypocellularity of the bone marrow of long bones, and metaphyseal thickening of bone trabeculae of long bones. Male rats were more sensitive to these effects. These bone effects were not seen in other species (dogs, monkeys or mice). Reversibility of dysplasia in epiphyseal growth plate was not evaluated. In rats, systemic mineralization and ocular findings (corneal opacities and atrophy or thinning of the corneal epithelium) were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies at doses below human exposure.

Increases in liver enzymes (rats) and hepatocellular necrosis (rats, mice, and dogs) were observed at exposures similar to clinical exposure. In a 2 -week study in cynomolgus monkeys, gallbladder toxicity was observed at exposures &gt; 2.5 -fold the human exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CNS effects were observed in dogs in the 3 -month study at exposures approximately 1.5 times the human exposure; these effects in dogs, including impaired balance and tremors, were reversible and there was no microscopic correlate.

## Reproductive and developmental toxicity

In a male and female rat fertility study, mirdametinib at a dose up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC) did not affect mating performance or fertility in both sexes. In a 3 -month repeat -dose toxicology study in rats, mirdametinib caused decreased ovarian organ weight and increased follicular cysts associated with decreases in the number of corpora lutea at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human exposure) as well as testicular hypocellularity and decreased weight of epididymides at 1 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the human exposure).

In preliminary embryo -foetal developmental toxicity studies in pregnant rats and rabbits, oral dosing of mirdametinib induced postimplantation loss (early and late resorptions) and decreased foetal body weights at exposures below the human exposures at the recommended dose. In the preliminary rat study, a single foetus had extremity malformations at doses 3.6 -fold higher than the recommended human dose. Definitive embryo -foetal development and pre -and post -natal development studies were not conducted with mirdametinib.

## Phototoxicity

Mirdametinib was equivocal in an in vitro mouse fibroblast phototoxicity assay at significantly higher concentrations than clinical exposures and was not retained in the skin or the eyes of rats indicating that there is a low risk of phototoxicity in patients taking mirdametinib.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## Preparation of the oral suspension

Patients should be instructed to fully disperse the prescribed number of dispersible tablet(s) in a small amount of drinking water (about 5 to 10 mL) in a dosing cup, if dosing as an oral suspension. The liquid should be gently swirled until no lumps remain and administered orally. Alternatively, the liquid can be drawn into an oral syringe and administered.

## Administration of oral suspension via dosing cup

After the suspension from the dosing cup or oral syringe is swallowed, the dosing cup (or syringe) should be rinsed with an additional small amount of drinking water (about 5 to 10 mL) and administered to ensure the full dose is taken. The dose should only be prepared using water.

## Administration of oral suspension via enteral feeding tube

In case of administration using an enteral feeding tube, an appropriate commercially available gastric or nasogastric tube (8 French tube or larger) should be selected by the healthcare professional. Enteral feeding tubes made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PUR) have been shown to be compatible with the oral suspension. The oral suspension should be drawn into the syringe after dispersing in 5 -10 mL of water as described above and injected into an enteral feeding tube with the syringe positioned horizontally. Following administration of the oral suspension, draw another 5 -10 mL of water into the syringe and push that through the feeding tube to ensure any residual medication is administered to the patient.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Ezmekly 1 mg hard capsules Ezmekly 2 mg hard capsules

mirdametinib

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you (or your child) start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

7. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Ezmekly is and what it is used for

Ezmekly contains the active substance mirdametinib, and is a mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor.

Ezmekly is used to treat plexiform neurofibromas in adults, adolescents, and children 2 years of age and older with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

People with NF1 have a mutation (change) in the gene that encodes for the protein neurofibromin. This leads to a loss of this protein, which allows tumours to grow on the nerves in the body. Ezmekly works by blocking certain proteins involved in the growth of these tumour cells, which is expected to shrink them.

If you have any questions about how Ezmekly works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.

## 2. What you (or your child) need to know before you take Ezmekly

## Do not take Ezmekly

- If you (or your child) are allergic to mirdametinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Ezmekly, or if the following happen to you (or your child) while taking Ezmekly. Your doctor may decide to lower your dose, stop treatment temporarily or permanently:

## · Eye problems

Ezmekly can cause eye problems that can lead to blindness (see section 4 'Possible side effects'). A doctor (eye specialist) will have to check your vision (the vision of your child) before and regularly during treatment. Tell your doctor straight away if you get blurred vision, or any other changes to your vision during treatment.

## · Heart problems

Ezmekly can lower the amount of blood pumped by your heart (see section 4 'Possible side -effects'). In clinical studies of Ezmekly at the recommended dose, this did not cause any symptoms, however it can make you feel tired. Tell your doctor if you feel tired. Your doctor will check how well your heart works before and during your treatment with Ezmekly.

## · Skin rash

Skin rashes are very common with Ezmekly and can also become severe. Tell your doctor if you get a skin rash which may be bumpy or acne -like (see section 4 'Possible side effects'). Your doctor may provide guidance for managing your skin rash, including treatment (e.g., cream).

## · Pregnancy

Ezmekly is not recommended during pregnancy. Tell your doctor straight away if you or your partner becomes pregnant while taking this medicine. See 'Pregnancy, breast -feeding and fertility' section below.

## Children younger than 2 years of age

Do not give Ezmekly to children younger than 2 years old. It has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Ezmekly

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including herbal medicines while receiving Ezmekly.

## Pregnancy, breast -feeding and fertility

Ezmekly is not recommended during pregnancy. It may cause harm to your unborn baby.

If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment.

You or your partner should not become pregnant while taking this medicine. If you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective contraception (birth control). See 'Contraception -information for women and men' below.

If you or your partner become pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor straight away.

## Contraception - information for women and men

If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you should use effective contraception while you are taking this medicine and for 6 months after the last dose. If you are a man whose partner could become pregnant, you should use effective contraception while you are taking this medicine and for 3 months after the last dose. It is not known if Ezmekly reduces how well hormonal contraceptives work. Please tell your doctor if you or your partner are taking a hormonal contraceptive, as your doctor may recommend using a second form of birth control (e.g. condoms).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast -feeding

It is not known if Ezmekly passes into breast milk. A risk to the breast -fed child cannot be excluded. Do not breast -feed if you are taking Ezmekly and for one week after the last dose of Ezmekly.

## Fertility (ability to have children)

Ezmekly may reduce fertility in men and women. You should discuss this with your doctor before starting treatment.

## Driving and using machines

Ezmekly can cause side effects, including fatigue (feeling tired or weak) and blurred vision (see section 4 'Possible side -effects'), that may affect your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you feel tired or if you have problems with your vision (such as blurred vision).

## Ezmekly contains sodium

Each capsule contains less than 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt), that is to say it is essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How to take Ezmekly

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## How much to take

Your doctor will work out the correct dose for you (or your child) based on your height and weight. The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg a day (4 mg every 12 hours). The doctor will tell you how many capsules of Ezmekly to take.

## How to take

- Take Ezmekly by mouth twice a day, about 12 hours apart. You should take this medicine every day for 21 days, and then stop taking it for 7 days. Each 28 -day period is called a treatment cycle.
- Take Ezmekly with or without food.
- Swallow the capsules whole with water.
- Do not chew, break or open the capsules
- You can continue taking this medicine in treatment cycles until your disease gets worse or side effects become unacceptable. If you get side effects, your doctor may decide to lower your dose, stop treatment temporarily or permanently (see section 2 'Warnings and precautions').
- Ezmekly is also available as a dispersible tablet. Your doctor will determine the correct formulation for you.

## If you (or your child) are sick after taking Ezmekly

If you are sick (vomit) at any time after taking Ezmekly, do not take an extra dose. Take the next dose at the normal time.

## If you (or your child) take more Ezmekly than you should

If you have taken more Ezmekly than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

## If you (or your child) forget to take Ezmekly

If you forget to take a dose of Ezmekly, skip the missed dose and then take the next dose at the normal time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## If you (or your child) stop taking Ezmekly

Do not stop taking Ezmekly unless your doctor tells you as it may worsen your condition.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Contact your doctor if you experience any side effects. Your doctor may pause treatment with Ezmekly until your symptoms improve and/or they may reduce the dose you receive (see Section 3 'How to take').

## Serious side effects

## Eye problems (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

Ezmekly can cause eye problems in adults and children. Some of these eye problems may lead to a blockage of the vein draining to the eye (retinal vein occlusion or detachment of different layers of the eye (retinal pigment epithelial detachment)). Tell your doctor straight away if you get blurred vision or any other changes to your sight during treatment. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking this medicine or send you to a specialist, if you develop symptoms that include:

- blurred vision
