The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated in accordance. In addition the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct the timing of ovulation induction in section 3 of the PL, to delete the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the Product Information is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0.

The starting day of Cetrotide is depending on the ovarian response, i.e. the number and size of growing follicles and/or the amount of circulating oestradiol. The start of Cetrotide may be delayed in absence of follicular growth, although clinical experience is based on starting Cetrotide on day 5 or day 6 of stimulation. |
