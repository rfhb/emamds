## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Silgard is a quadrivalent (HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) recombinant HPV vaccine (qHPV) that was licensed  on  24  September  2006  for  the  prevention  of  high-grade  cervical  and  vulvar  dysplasia, cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  causally  related  to  the  vaccine  HPV  types.  The  dose schedule  includes  3  intramuscular  0.5  ml  doses  administered  at  0,  2,  6  months.  The  approval  was based on two pivotal phase III trials after a mean follow-up of two years. The approved indication in 2006 is as follows:

'Silgard  is  a  vaccine  for  the  prevention  of  high-grade  cervical  dysplasia  (CIN  2/3),  cervical carcinoma,  high-grade  vulvar  dysplastic  lesions  (VIN  2/3),  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Silgard in adult females 16 to 26 years of age  and  on  the  demonstration  of  immunogenicity  of  Silgard  in  9-  to  15-year  old  children  and adolescents. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1). The use of Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations.' The present type II variation application concerns an extension of the indication to include protection against: -vulvar and vaginal cancer; -low-grade vulvar (VIN 1) dysplasia; -high-grade and low-grade vaginal (VaIN 1/2/3) dysplasia; -low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1); based on updated efficacy and safety data (3-year data) from the pivotal phase III studies (FUTURE I and  II)  as  well  as  post-marketing  experience.  Compared  with  the  database  that  supported  the marketing authorisation application (MAA), this application includes ~ 1 more year of follow-up in the phase III program. The present application has the following objectives: · Update  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  with  respect  HPV6/11/16/18-related  cervical,  vulvar  and vaginal dysplasia · Update VE with respect HPV16/18-related VaIN 2/3 · Update the rationale for inclusion of CIN 1 in the therapeutic indication · Update VE with respect HPV16/18-related cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer (via surrogate markers) · Update the duration of VE with respect to HPV6/11/16/18-related cervical, vulvar and vaginal pre-cancerous lesions · Evaluate HPV type replacement Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Approximately 50% of sexually active adults become infected with HPV during their lifetime. HPV infection can cause precancerous dysplastic lesions and cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, and external genital skin, as well  as  benign  genital  and  respiratory  tumors  (condyloma  acuminata  and  Recurrent  Respiratory Papillomatosis  (RRP),  respectively).  An  overview  is  given  below  concerning  the  new  proposed indications by the MAH.

Vulvar  cancer  accounts  for  3  to  5%  of  all  gynecologic  cancer  cases.  Data  on  the  exact  burden  of vulvar cancer in Europe are not presently available, but in the US in 2005, it has been estimated that approximately 3870 women would be diagnosed with vulvar cancer and 870 women would die from the disease. Up to 90% of vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Vulvar cancer can be HPVRelated (typically occurs in women under the age of 65) and non-HPV-Related (typically occurs in women &gt;65 years).

Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide resulting in approximate 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths each year. HPVs are judged to be the primary cause of cancer, detected in over 99% of cervical cancers. In the year 2004 the International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that cervical cancer was diagnosed in approximately 34 300 women in the 27 member states of the European Union and about 16 300 women died from the disease. It is estimated  that  within  the  European  population  each  year  there  are  ~33,000  women  diagnosed  with cervical  cancer  and  15,000  deaths from this disease. Organised cervical cancer screening programs have reduced cancer rates by ~75% in the developed world. The success of Pap testing has shifted the burden associated with HPV disease from managing the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer to managing a large number of premalignant and other HPV-associated lesions (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) grades 1, 2, 3). Low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1) CIN 1 is the most frequent HPV-related dysplastic lesion of the cervix. The potential for CIN 1 to progress  to  CIN  2/3  or  cervical  cancer  is  low,  but  the  health  and  economic  consequences  of  these lesions are substantial. The lifetime risk of acquiring CIN 1 (17 %) is four times that of CIN 2/3 or AIS (4%) in places where cervical cancer screening programs are established. In all of Europe, it is estimated  that  817,000  women  are  newly  diagnosed  with  low  grade  cervical  lesions  (CIN  1)  each year. Most CIN 1 lesions regress to normal, but it is not possible to differentiate those lesions that will persist  and  progress  to  CIN  2/3  from  those  that  will  regress.  All  women  with  CIN  1  require  close follow-up, including repeated diagnostic biopsies. Other HPV related cancers Other  HPV-related  cancers  include  vulvar  and  vaginal  cancers  that  occur  predominantly  in  young women  and  result  in  ~1600  deaths  in  the  US  each  year.  They  are  preceded  by  dysplastic  lesions (vulvar  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN)  and  vaginal  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VaIN).  In  men,  anal cancer is the most common HPV-related cancer with 5000 cases reported annually in the US. Also penile  and  certain  oral  cancers  are  caused  by  the  virus.  Other  benign  HPV-associated  conditions include  condyloma  acuminata  (genital  warts)  located  in  the  genital  or  perianal  region  and  juvenile RRP primarily located in the larynx. RRP is thought to occur by transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her child. Vulvar cancer and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) Medicinal product no longer authorised

HPV-related vulvar cancer accounts for 15 to 50% of cases of vulvar cancer.

## Vaginal cancer and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN)

Vaginal  cancer  accounts  for  1  to  2%  of  all  gynecologic  cancer  cases.  In  the  US  in  2005,  ~2140 women  were  estimated  to  be  diagnosed  with  vaginal  cancer  and  800  women  would  die  from  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

disease. Data on the exact burden of vaginal cancer in Europe is not presently available. In 2005, in the UK there were 223 new diagnoses of vulvar cancer and 100 deaths from this disease.

## 1.2.1 Clinical efficacy

The clinical development program for Silgard was designed to measure the impact of the vaccine on the  cervical  cancer  risk  using  a  composite  endpoint  of  CIN  2/3,  adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS)  and cervical  cancer.  The  primary  goal  was  to  evaluate  vaccine  impact on the incidence of HPV 16/18related  CIN  2/3,  AIS  or  cervical  cancer.  A  secondary  goal  was  to  evaluate  vaccine  impact  on  the overall incidence of CIN 2/3, AIS or cervical cancer.

Main studies The  clinical  efficacy  program  for  Silgard  included  4  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled phase II and phase III clinical studies (for details about studies see table 1). Phase II studies included protocol  005  (evaluated  the  HPV  16  component  of  Silgard)  and  protocol  007.  Phase  III  studies, included  FUTURE  I  (Protocol  013)  and  FUTURE  II  (Protocol  015).  Altogether  these  4  studies randomised 20,887 16- to 26-year-old adolescent and young adult women, of whom 20,845 subjects received at least one dose of study vaccine (Silgard, HPV 16 L1 VLP vaccine component of Silgard, or placebo). Protocol 005 was complete at the time of the marketing authorisation.  Protocols 007-10, 013, and 015 were ongoing in the efficacy follow-up phase at the time of the marketing authorisation.

## Study populations

## Per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population:

- Received all 3 doses of study vaccine
- Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type at Day 1 and at Month 7
- Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1
- Did not deviate from the protocol
- Regardless of PCR status at Day 1

· Cases counted starting 30 days post-dose 3 (Month 7) The Per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary analysis population for efficacy and includes subjects naïve to relevant vaccine HPV types. MITT-populations (modified intention to treat populations): · MITT-2 population · Restricted MITT-2 (R-MITT2) · MITT-3 population: general population (ITT) Two MITT populations were used for the analysis of efficacy with respect to the population benefit endpoints (i.e., evaluation of the impact of Silgard on the incidence of disease caused by vaccine or non-vaccine HPV  types). Importantly, these populations differ from  those in the  marketing authorisation application with respect to the extent of HPV type testing. This updated report, include additional testing for 10 common non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) in all swabs and tissue specimens obtained during the phase III studies. MITT-2 population · Received at least one dose of study vaccine · Were seronegative and PCR-negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1 · Were PCR-negative at Day 1 to the appropriate non-vaccine HPV type (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, or 59) or had a negative Day 1 Pap test result · Had at least one follow-up visit after 1 month following the first injection · Cases were counted starting after Day 30 This population represents virginal HPV naïve young women but who could be infected with HPV before or after the completion of the vaccination period. Restricted MITT-2 (R-MITT2) · Received at least one dose of study vaccine · Were seronegative and PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1 · Were PCR negative to HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59 at Day 1 and had a negative Pap test result at Day 1 · Had at least one follow-up visit after 1 month following the first injection · Cases were counted starting after Day 30 The RMITT-2 was designed to approximate a population of adolescent and young adult women who were either sexually-naïve or sexually-experienced and had not yet been exposed to any HPV type but who could be infected with HPV before or after the completion of the vaccination period. MITT-3 population: general population (ITT) · Received at least one dose of study vaccine Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Cases counted starting 30 days after Day 1

Compared with the main analysis populations, the MITT-3 population also includes subjects who were already infected with a vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type at Day 1 and subjects who had evidence of CIN at Day 1 (e.g., an abnormal Pap test at Day 1). Such a population approximates the general population of sexually-active 16- to 26-year-old girls and provides a real world estimate of efficacy in the vaccinated population.

Efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  was  100%  in  the  PPE  population. Altogether,  there  were  17  CIN  3  cases  and  6  AIS  cases  in  the  placebo  group  versus  none  in  the vaccine group resulting in efficacy of 100% for both these high-grade lesion types and with the lower bound  of  the  95%  CIs  above  0%.  Efficacy  was  comparable  across  HPV  types.  The  results  in  the MITT-2 population supported the PPE analysis. The case of HPV 18-related CIN 1 in the vaccine group of the MITT-2 population was described in the MAA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The efficacy estimates in the MITT-3 population were substantially lower, which could be expected since this population included cases already infected at baseline. The variations in percent reductions for  disease  by  HPV 6, 11, 16 or HPV 18 were correlated with the baseline prevalence of infection with individual HPV type. The lowest effect was observed for HPV 16, which was most prevalent among the vaccine HPV types. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11//16/18-related CIN 2/3, AIS was increased compared to the MAA, 35% (95% CI: 7, 55) vs. 23% (95% CI: &lt;0, 48). However, by lesion type, statistical significance with respect to efficacy against CIN 2 or CIN 3 lesions was not reached (lower 95% CIs were &lt;0%).

In  the  secondary analysis of efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN lesions, high efficacy (100%) against  CIN  of  all  grades  was  demonstrated  in  the  PPE  population.  However,  in  the  MITT-3 population, the vaccine estimates were substantially lower; VE against CIN 2/3 was 33% (95% CI: 3.3, 53.7).  By lesion, for CIN 2, CIN 3 and AIS only numerical reductions were seen.

¾ Secondary efficacy analysis The efficacy of the vaccine against the combined incidence of HPV 16- or HPV 18-related CIN or AIS is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Analysis of efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN (of any grade) or AIS (P013) Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  vaccine  estimates  were  comparable  between  the  current  and  MAA  report  and  there  was  no evidence of waning immunity.

This longer term results showed sustained and high vaccine efficacy against EGL lesions caused by the vaccine HPV types and in all study populations. It is important to note that the majority of lesions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported were condyloma acuminata of vulvar origin. HPV 6 was the predominant HPV type. Since HPV 6 and 11 cause the majority of genital warts (&gt;95%) high vaccine efficacy was also observed in the  MITT-3  population.  There  were  few  VIN  and  VaIN  lesions  in  all  populations,  although  all endpoint cases occurred in the placebo group in the PPE population. In the MITT-3 population, VE was not significant for the combined endpoint of VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3.

Analysis of efficacy with respect to the composite endpoint of HPV 16- or HPV18-related VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 is presented in Table 5. Table 5: Analysis of efficacy against HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3 (P013) There were few cases of HPV 16/18-related high-grade vulvar and vaginal neoplasia and the majority were caused by HPV 16. Only in the combined analysis of HPV 16/18-related VIN/VaIN 2/3, vaccine estimates were statistically significant in the PPE and MITT 2 populations. No statistically significant efficacy was seen in the MITT-3 population. As for cervical lesions, the current results with respect to HPV6/11/16/18-related EGL, were similar to those in the MAAand there was no evidence of waning immunity. · Updated Exploratory efficacy analyses - evaluation of population impact Exploratory analyses to estimate the impact of vaccination on the overall burden of cervical, vaginal or  vulvar  disease  (caused  by  vaccine  or  non-vaccine  HPV  types)  were  conducted.  These  analyses were  performed  in  the  redefined  MITT-2  and  RMITT-2  population,  as  well  as  in  the  MITT-3 population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The comparison of current results with the MAA is only possible for the MITT-3 population since the definition of the RMITT-2 and MITT-2 populations have changed with the additional testing of 10 non-vaccine HPV types. The comparison MITT-3 shows that the rates of detection of CIN and EGL lesions over the additional follow-up period (5.1/100 person-years at risk (PYR) and 1.7/100 PYR) were lower than those observed in the MAA (6.1 and 2.3, respectively). In general, the magnitude of benefit was somewhat higher in the updated results.

Analyses in the RMITT-2 represent the best available population to examine overall vaccine impact on  the  rate  of  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS  due  to  incident  infection  (i.e.  infection  following  onset  of vaccination). In the general population (MITT-3), the effect of Silgard against CIN of any grade due to any HPV type was 20%, which was largely due to reductions in low-grade lesions CIN 1. For CIN 2/3 or AIS, no significant vaccine efficacy was demonstrated (VE: 7.8%) and was even negative (9.2%) against CIN 3. ¾ EGL due to any HPV type The reductions with respect to the incidence of EGLs were greater than those observed for cervical lesions. In the RMITT-2 and MITT-3 populations Silgard reduced the rate of any vulvar or vaginal lesion regardless of HPV type by 49.5% and 34.4%, respectively. With respect to VIN and VaIN, both low and high-grade lesions, only numerical reductions were seen (lower 95% CIs &lt;0%) in all study populations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 remained high in the PPE-population, with one single case of CIN 3 in the vaccine group. This lesion was possibly related to a non-vaccine HPV type since  HPV 16 was only detected once, whereas HPV 52 was detected on several occasions. In the MITT-3  population  VE  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  was  44%,  which  is  higher  than  that observed in the MAA (VE: 39%). It is of note that VE estimates against CIN 3, which is the most relevant marker, were significant in all study populations ranging from 97% to 45% in the PPE- and MITT-3  population,  respectively,  For  AIS  there  were  too  few  endpoint  cases  to  allow  any conclusions.

The  results  in  the  MITT-2  analysis  were  supportive  of  the  results  in  the  PPE-population.    In  the MITT-3 population vaccine efficacy was substantially lower, 44%. The majority of MITT-3 endpoint cases  occurred  in  subjects  who  were  seropositive  or  PCR  positive  at  Day  1.  Due  to  the  higher prevalence of HPV 16 at baseline, VE against HPV 16-related CIN 2/3 was lower than that against HPV 18-related CIN 2/3.

## ¾ Secondary efficacy analysis

In the PPE population, administration of Silgard reduced the combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18related CIN (any grade) or AIS by 93 % and that of HPV 16/18-related CIN by 91% (See Table 8).

Table 8: Analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN by study population (P015)

Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related low-grade CIN remained at the same high level as that  observed  in  the  MAA.  Against  CIN  1,  VE  ranged  from  92%  to  65%  in  the  different  study populations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## External genital lesions

The  efficacy  of  Silgard  against  EGLs  remained  high  across  all  efficacy  populations  (Table  9). Efficacy also remained high for the combined incidence of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3. No cases of vulvar or vaginal cancer were observed in the study.

1. AN 57819: This case was reported in the P015 CSR submitted as part of the MAA. This case of HPV 6related genital warts occurred in an 18-year-old Caucasian woman. She was negative at Day 1 by PCR to all 14  HPV  types  for  which  testing  was  conducted.  At  Month  8,  she  was  found  to  have  an  HPV  6-related condyloma. She had mounted a strong anti-HPV 6 response at Month 7.
2. AN 40727: This case of HPV 6-related genital warts occurred in a 16-year-old Caucasian woman. She was negative at Day 1 by PCR to all 14 HPV types for which testing was conducted. At Month 36, she was found to have genital warts. A biopsy obtained at that time confirmed this diagnosis. The lesion was positive for

HPV 6 and HPV 59 DNA. The subject did not participate in the Consistency Lot substudy and, thus, did not undergo serology testing after Day 1.

Table 10: Analysis of efficacy against HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3 (P015)

Efficacy  results  in  this  large  study  were  similar  to  those  obtained  in  study  013,  i.e.  with  a predominance of condyloma among disease categories and HPV 6 among vaccine types. Vulvar and vaginal lesions were rarely detected and all the HPV 16/18-related high-grade lesions were caused by HPV 16. A consistent pattern was that all VIN/VaIN cases regardless of grade in the PPE- and MITT2 analyses were reported in the placebo group. Significant efficacy against HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3 was seen in all study populations. The current results were similar to those in the MAA and there was no evidence of waning immunity over the 3 year follow up period. · Updated Exploratory efficacy analyses - evaluation of population impact ¾ CIN due to any HPV type In the RMITT-2 population Silgard reduced the combined rates of CIN (any grade) or AIS by 28.6%, of CIN 2/3 by 49.4% and CIN 3 by 55.3% (Table 11). In the MITT-2 population observed efficacy was lower (19.5%) although significant for all disease severities. In the MITT-3 population CIN was reduced by 14%, CIN 2/3 by 16.8% with the lower 95% CI barely above 0% (0.1%). For CIN 3 only a numerical reduction of 20.9% (95% CI &lt;0 to 37.8%) was noted. Compared  with  the  RMITT-2  population,  a  total  of  378  and  415  cases  of  the  composite  endpoint CIN/AIS  were  added  to  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups,  respectively  in  the  MITT-3  population. Among these, 349 (92%) and 375 (90%) of cases in the respective group, occurred among women who were PCR-positive to one of the 14 tested HPV types at Day 1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 11: Analysis of efficacy against CIN (of any grade) or AIS due to any HPV type (P015)

The overall benefit of Silgard with respect to CIN was low in the MITT-3 analysis, although higher than in the MAA. ¾ EGL due to any HPV type In the RMITT-2, MITT-2 and MITT-3 populations Silgard reduced the rates EGLs by 88.3%, 75.9% and 57.9% respectively. The higher efficacy noted for EGL compared to CIN/AIS can be explained by the inclusion criteria and by the fact that a large proportion of EGLs are due to vaccine HPV types.

## 1.2.1.3 Combined analysis of study protocols

As in the MAA the two pre-planned pooled analyses were performed and updated with the additional follow-up data at 3 years:

1) integrated summary of efficacy: includes P007, P013 and P015.

2) combined phase II/III efficacy analysis: includes P005 (16-related endpoints only), P007, P013 and P015.

The  vaccine  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  was  maintained  through  an additional  year  of  follow-up  with  comparable  efficacy  in  the  PPE-  and  MITT-2  populations.  It  is reassuring  that  VE  against  CIN  2/3,  and  in  particular  against  CIN  3,  which  is  the  most  relevant surrogate marker for cervical cancer, was significant in all study populations including the MITT-3. The single case of HPV 16-related CIN 3 that occurred in the vaccine group (PPE population) was most likely caused by HPV 52. Also for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) VE was demonstrated in the PPE-  and  MITT-2  analyses,  although  there  were  few  cases.  All  AIS  cases  were  detected  in  the placebo group.

The efficacy for HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005, 007, 013, and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. 1.2.1.3.1 Combined protocols 007, 013 and 015 Update of the integrated summary of efficacy Protocol  007,  013  and  015  were  included  in  the  updated  integrated  summary  of  vaccine  efficacy against  CIN,  EGL,  Pap  abnormality  endpoints  and  cervical  procedures  in  this  report.  Altogether 18,174 women aged 16 to 26 years were randomised across the 3 study protocols. ¾ Efficacy with respect to HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade), AIS or cervical cancer There was no case of cervical cancer in any of the studies. The estimates of efficacy within each of the  3  protocols  were  consistent  with the overall estimates of VE across the protocols. The vaccine efficacy in the MITT-2 population (VE: 94.5%) was similar to efficacy in the PPE population (VE: 96%),  whereas  lower  estimates  were  noted  in  the  MITT-3  population  (VE:  53.9%).  In  the  PPE population, there was 1 new case of HPV 18-related CIN 1 and a single case of HPV 16-related CIN 3 in the group that received Silgard reported since the MAA. Efficacy was observed for each vaccine HPV type of the composite HPV 6-, HPV 11-, HPV 16- or HPV  18-related  CIN  (any  grade)  or  AIS  endpoint  and  was  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  MAA. Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3 was 98.7%, 97.2% and 42.1% in the PPE-, MITT-2 and  MITT-3  population,  respectively.  Corresponding  efficacy  for  CIN  1  was  95.5%,  94.6%  and 64.5%. In  the  placebo  group  within  the  MITT-2  population,  the  cumulative  incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18related  CIN  (any  grade)  or AIS  through approximately 3 years of follow-up was 2.7%. The risk of developing an endpoint was reduced from 1 in 40 in the placebo group to 1 in 719 in the group that received Silgard. In the MITT-3 population, administration of Silgard resulted in a 54% reduction in the incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) or AIS, compared with placebo. In the MAA, a 46% (95% CI: 35 to 56%) reduction was observed. The hazard of becoming a case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN in the placebo group increased over time compared to the group vaccinated with Silgard. Hence, the  percent  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  in  the  vaccinated  group compared with placebo increased over time. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  efficacy  results  are  comparable  to  those  obtained  in  the  MAA.  The  difference  between  the vaccine and placebo group in the incidence of CIN lesions, increased during the additional year of follow-up. Almost all of the new cases in the Silgard group (MITT-3 population) were in subjects who  had  evidence  of  prior  HPV  exposure,  whereas  those  in  the  placebo  group  were  true  new infections.

## ¾ Efficacy with respect to HPV 6/11/16/18 18-related EGL

Efficacy results against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the combined analysis are presented in Table 12.  There  were  no  cases  of  vaginal/vulvar  cancer  observed  in  any  of  the  studies.  The  efficacy  of Silgard was 99% in the PPE population (2 vs. 189 cases). The MITT-2 analysis supported the primary analysis in the PPE population. In  the  MITT-3  population,  administration  of  Silgard  resulted  in  a  77.6%  (95%  CI:  71.0,  82.9%) reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV 6/11/16/18-related  EGL  compared  with  placebo.  The  hazard  of becoming a case of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the placebo group increased over time compared to  the  group  vaccinated  with  Silgard.  Hence,  the  percent  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the vaccinated group compared with placebo increased over time. The integrated analysis of vaccine efficacy against EGL by HPV vaccine type showed that estimates were similar across the different HPV type-related EGLs and significant for each type in all 3 study populations. There were 2 cases of HPV 6-related vulvar condyloma in the vaccine group of the PPEpopulation. The single case of VIN 2/3 in the MITT-2 population was HPV 16-related. In the MITTpopulation the estimates of efficacy were consistent across the different disease severities. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Condyloma: In the PPE population, efficacy was 98.7% for HPV 6- or 11-related condyloma.  When comparing  the  PPE  population  and  MITT-2  population,  an  additional  7  subjects  in  the  group  that received Silgard and 53 subjects in the placebo group were found to have an HPV 6- or HPV 11related  condyloma  in  the  MITT-2  population.  Thus,  there  is  evidence  that  the  vaccine  is  already efficacious  during  the  course  of  the  vaccination  regimen.  The  impact  of  Silgard  in  the  MITT-3 population was lower than the efficacy observed in the PPE population and MITT-2 population due to the presence of disease that was caused by infections that were already present at Day 1.

## ¾ Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related EGL

In  the  integrated efficacy analysis significant vaccine efficacy against both HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3  and  VaIN  2/3  was  demonstrated  in  all  study  populations,  supporting  the  claim  of  the  MAH  to include VaIN 2/3 in the indication. VE for VaIN 2/3 was 100% in the PPE population and 81.8% in the MITT-3 population. In the separate studies, no VE could be shown due to the sparseness of cases with high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions. However, the pattern was consistent across protocols with almost all endpoint cases in the placebo group. The majority of VIN/VaIN 2/3 lesions were caused by HPV 16 (64% in the placebo group). This finding and the higher incidence of VIN 2/3 compared with VaIN 2/3 are consistent with published data.

With  regard  to  low-grade  lesions,  vaccine  efficacy  was  demonstrated  against  VaIN  1  in  all  study populations, whereas for VIN 1 no significant efficacy was shown. The knowledge about these lowgrade lesions is limited and the terminology for vaginal/vulvar lesions is not as established as that for cervical  lesions.  The  ISSVD  society  has  recommended  the  abolition  of  VIN  1  due  to  low reproducibility. The proportion of these low-grade lesions caused by oncogenic HPV types need to be clarified. At this stage the MAH´s claim for VIN 1 and VaIN 1 in the indication cannot be considered justified. · Overall impact on invasive cervical procedures In the RMITT-2 population, the combined incidence of cervical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was reduced in the group that received Silgard compared with the placebo group with respect to the incidence  rates  of  colposcopy,  cervical  biopsy,  and  cervical  definitive  therapy  (Table  13).  Results observed in the MITT-3 population were lower but consistent with those in the RMITT-2 population. Table 13: Vaccine impact on invasive cervical procedures (P007, P013, P015 combined) The reductions observed with regard to definitive therapy (40% (RMITT-2) and 20% (MITT-3)) seen are considered clinically relevant. · Therapeutic efficacy An analysis was conducted to determine whether, among subjects who showed evidence of infection with a vaccine HPV type at Day 1, administration of Silgard reduced the proportion of subjects who were found to have progressed to clinical disease due to that type, compared with placebo. The  combined  data  do  not  provide  adequate  evidence  that  Silgard  has  therapeutic  efficacy  against HPV type-related CIN or EGL endpoints for the non-HPV-naïve populations. The analyses did not have sufficient power to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn with regard to therapeutic vaccine efficacy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  results  obtained  in  this  combined  efficacy  analyses  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the MAA, but now based on a larger number of CIN 2/3 cases (86 vs. 53, PPE population) increasing the precision of the vaccine estimates. The single case in the vaccine group was an HPV 16-related CIN 3 case in Month 25. The subject was positive to HPV 52 at baseline and in 5 histology specimens (both biopsy  and  LEEP).  HPV  16  was  detected  in  one  histology  sample.  The  efficacy  estimates  against HPV 16/18-related CIN 3 and AIS, the most relevant surrogate markers for cervical cancer, were both significant, with VE of 98% and 100%, respectively in the PPE-population and 97% and 100% in the MITT-2. There were only 7 cases AIS in the PPE- and 10 cases in the MITT-2 population, but all occurred in the placebo group.

The efficacy estimate in the MITT-3 population was increased to 44% compared to 39% in the MAA. With  respect  to  CIN  3,  VE  was  39%  (21,  53),  which  did  not  fulfil  the  statistical  criterion  of  the analysis (lower bound of 95% CI &gt;25%). 1.2.1.3.3 Protocols P013, P015 combined ¾ Combined efficacy results with respect to CIN 2/3 or AIS caused by vaccine and non-vaccine HPV types The  efficacy  results  with  respect  to  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  due  to  any  HPV  type  by  severity    are presented  in  the  table  15  below.  In  the  MITT-2  population  a  combined  efficacy  of  27.1%  was obtained. In the most restricted population RMITT-2, corresponding to a sexually naïve population, VE was  46.1%  against  CIN  2/3,  AIS  and  54.5%  against  CIN  3  which  is  clinically  relevant.  This estimate is,  however,  lower  than  the  expected  (70%), but might be explained by baseline high-risk HPV infections that were not detected by Pap test or the current HPV testing methods. The overall benefit of Silgard against any CIN 2/3 or AIS regardless of causal HPV type was limited in the general population (MITT-3). The observed efficacy was only 13.5% (18% (95% CI: 6 to 28) if P005  and  P007  was  included  in  the  analysis).  When  analysed  by  disease  severity,  no  significant efficacy against CIN 3 was documented (lower 95% CI &lt;0%) Table 15: Analysis of efficacy against CIN 2/3 or AIS due to any HPV type by severity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Over  time  the  benefit  of  the  vaccine  was  shown  to  increase  relative  to  placebo.  However,  the incidence  of  CIN  2/3  also  increased  substantially  in  the  vaccinated  population,  suggesting  an important role of non-vaccine HPV types.

¾ Combined efficacy results with respect to CIN 1 due to any HPV type Vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 due to any HPV type was 27.9% (95% CI: 12.0, 41.0) in the RMITT-2 population, 22.3% (95% CI: 11.2, 32.0) in the MITT-2 population and 19.0% (95% CI: 10.0, 27.0) in the MITT-3 population of the combined studies 013 and 015. ¾ Efficacy against VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 due to any HPV type This analysis was conducted in the pooled dataset of Protocols 013 and 015 (not including P007). The results are shown in table 16. Table 16: Analysis of efficacy against VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 due to any HPV type (P013, P015 combined) Vaccine efficacy against VIN/ 2/3 due to any HPV type was demonstrated in all study populations and  was  high  in  the  HPV  naïve  women,  87%  in  RMITT-2  population  and  72%  in  the  MITT-2 population  supporting  the  important  role  of  vaccine  HPV  types  in  this  condition.    In  the  MITT-3 population it was lower, 49.9%. For VaIN 2/3 only numerical reductions were observed in all study populations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## ¾ Efficacy with respect to external genital lesions due to any HPV type

The higher efficacy in the RMITT-2 population (VE: 74.1%) compared with the MITT-2 population (VE: 65.2%) is likely a reflection of the fact that only subjects who were negative to all 14 tested HPV types and who had a normal Pap test result at Day 1 were included in the RMITT-2 population, whereas the MITT-2 population included any subject who was negative to at least 1 tested HPV type (Table 17). The more stringent RMITT-2 inclusion criteria identify a population of women who are less likely to have been exposed to any vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type compared with the MITT-2 population. The reductions observed in the MITT-3 populations were more modest (VE: 49.0%).

Table  17:  Analysis  of  efficacy  against  EGL  due  to  any  HPV  type  by  severity  of  disease (P013, P015 combined) Medicinal product no longer authorised

*The case of vulvar cancer was described in the MAA. A 22-year-old woman reported a small lesion on her perineum 18 months after completion of a 3-dose regimen of Silgard. The perineal swabs for HPV testing were positive for HPV 16 and HPV 59. The biopsy revealed a well differentiated squamous carcinoma. PCR of the biopsy was negative including 10 non-vaccine HPV types. The lesion was not visible during follow-up and no treatment was provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1.2.1.4 Discussion on clinical efficacy

In  this  type  II  variation  application  for  Silgard  the  MAH  seeks  approval  for  an  extension  of  the indication to include protection against vulvar and vaginal cancer, low-grade vulvar dysplasia (VIN 1), high-grade and low-grade vaginal (VaIN 1/2/3) dysplasia and low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1) based on one more year of follow-up of vaccine efficacy in the phase III program (FUTURE I and II) as well as post-marketing experience. The follow-up period after the first vaccine dose is at present approximately 3 years. The expansion of the database with longer term data on vaccine efficacy, made possible a definitive analysis of the impact of the vaccine on the overall HPV disease burden.

The MAH´s claim for CIN 1 was retained and supported by a recent published European guideline for quality assurance in cervical screening. In the MAH´s view the need for clinical follow up, further diagnostic procedures and potentially therapy, as recommended in the guideline, is best addressed by having CIN 1 in the SPC section 4.1. In the EU guideline CIN 1 is recognised as a lesion that requires follow-up with repeat cytology, HPV testing, colposcopy and excision in selected cases. The CHMP agrees  that  the  accuracy  in  the  diagnosis  of  CIN  1  in  clinical  practice  can  be  variable.  The management of low-grade cervical lesions has to be balanced against the high chance of spontaneous regression (60-70%) and negative histology with the possible risk of not treating underreported and/or missed high-grade disease. Although CIN 1 is not a surrogate marker for cancer, the need to follow-up

In  the  primary assessment of this variation the CHMP identified major objections and a number of other concerns. The MAH´s claims for vaginal and vulvar cancers and for low-grade cervical, vaginal and vulvar dysplasia (CIN 1, VIN 1, VaIN 1) in the indication were not considered approvable. The updated results in the HPV-naïve populations (PPE and MITT-2) confirmed and strengthened the efficacy findings in the MAA. Vaccine efficacy against the primary endpoint, HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3  or  AIS,  remained  high  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  waning  immunity.  The  pooled  efficacy analysis  in  the  PPE-population  was  based  on  a  total  of  86  cases  of  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3 (compared to 53 cases in the MAA), whereof one case was detected in the vaccine group and 85 cases in the placebo group (VE: 99% (95% CI: 93.3, 100.0). The one case of CIN 2/3 in the vaccine group was likely causally related to a non-vaccine HPV type (HPV 52). With respect to the most relevant surrogate markers for cervical cancer, HPV 16/18-related CIN 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), efficacy estimates were significant for both endpoints (VE: 98% and 100%, respectively) in the HPV naïve populations. In the MITT-3 population, that included subjects, who were already infected with a vaccine/non-vaccine  HPV type at  baseline, vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS was 44% (compared with 39% in the MAA). With respect to HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 1, efficacy remained high in all study populations, with VE of 95.5% in the HPV naïve population and VE of 64.5% in the MITT-3 population. There was no evidence of therapeutic vaccine efficacy. Efficacy  against  HPV 6/11/16/18-related genital warts (condyloma acuminata) remained high, with efficacy estimates of 99%, 95% and 77% in the PPE, MITT-2 and MITT-3 populations, respectively. In the integrated summary analysis, significant vaccine efficacy against both HPV 16/18-related VIN 2/3  and  VaIN  2/3  was  demonstrated  in  all  study  populations,  supporting  the  claim  of  the  MAH  to include also VaIN 2/3 in the indication. VE for VaIN 2/3 was 100% in the PPE population and 81.8% in  the  MITT-3  population.  Hence,  the  supplementary  data  allowed  for  a  conclusion  that  Silgard  is efficacious against HPV 16/18-related VaIN 2/3, which support the inclusion of this condition in the indication. In the MAH´s response to the first RSI, the claims for the prevention of vulvar and vaginal cancer was withdrawn.  It  was  agreed  that  at  the  present  stage  neither  international  guidelines  nor  consensus statements of the scientific community are available to support high-grade vulvar/vaginal lesions as valid surrogate markers for cancer. The MAH also withdrew his claims for low-grade vulvar (VIN 1) and vaginal (VaIN 1) intraepithelial lesions in the indication. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

these lesions translates to a substantial public health burden, since CIN 1 is the most common HPVrelated cervical lesion. The vaccine HPV types are estimated to cause 30-50% of CIN 1 lesions, which in  Europe  corresponds  to  approximately  286 000  CIN  1  lesions  annually.  In  the  combined  study protocols (007, 013, 015) vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 related to vaccine HPV types was 95.5% in the PPE population; 94.6% in the MITT-2 population and 64.5% in the MITT-3 population. Vaccine efficacy  against  CIN  1  due  to  any  HPV  type  was  27.9%  (95%  CI:  12.0,  41.0)  in  the  RMITT-2 population, 22.3% (95% CI: 11.2, 32.0) in the MITT-2 population and 19.0% (95% CI: 10.0, 27.0) in the MITT-3 population of the combined studies 013 and 015. The reduction in the overall burden of CIN 1 disease of 30% in the HPV naïve population would result in significant public health benefit.

<!-- image -->

The analysis of the public health impact revealed a significant reduction in the overall burden of CIN 2/3 or AIS in the HPV-naïve population, whereas the reduction in the general population (MITT-3) was  limited.  The  vaccine  efficacy  against  CIN  2/3  or  AIS  due  to  any  HPV  type  in  the  RMITT-2 population was 46.1% (95% CI 23.6, 62.3). The observed efficacy in the MITT-3 population was only 13.5% (18% (95% CI: 6 to 28) (if studies 005 and 007 were included in the analysis). When analysed by disease severity, no significant efficacy against CIN 3 was documented (lower 95% CI &lt;0%) in the MITT-3 population.  With  regard  to  the  impact  on  invasive  cervical  procedures,  it  was  shown  that definitive  therapy  was  reduced  by  40%  and  colposcopy  by  20%  in  the  vaccinated  RMITT-2 population  and  20%  and  11%,  respectively,  in  the  MITT-3  population.  More  long-term  data  are needed  to  evaluate  the  real  public  health  impact  of  Silgard.  However,  these  results  are  clinically relevant from a public health perspective and justify a statement in the section 5.1 of the SPC. As regards the indication, SPC section 4.1, the MAH was requested to simplify the wording and use the more general term ´premalignant genital lesions´ instead of the list of study endpoints. Moreover, the SPC changes proposed by the MAH in section 5.1 required major revision. In  the  response  to  the  second  RSI,  the  MAH  accepted  the  requested  simplified  wording  of  the indication  provided  that  the  localisation  of  the  genital  lesions  was  defined  and  that  the  conditions covered in the indication were further specified in section 5.1. The proposed additions are considered reasonable except for the inclusion of CIN 1 in the introductory sentence in section 5.1, since lowgrade  cervical  intraepithelial  lesion  is  not  considered  a  premalignant  genital  lesion.  The  estimated vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 is described elsewhere in section 5.1. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1.2.2 Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

Overall, 21,480 subjects were vaccinated in protocols 007, 013, 015, 016 and 018. A total of 11,912 subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  qHPV.  This  includes  a  total  of  120  subjects  in  protocol  007 extension  who  received  a  3-dose  regimen  of  placebo  in  the  main  study  and  subsequently  received qHPV in  the  extension  phase  of  the  study.  A  total  of  9688  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of placebo.

Fourteen (14) subjects who were randomised to receive qHPV and 2 subjects randomised to receive placebo  received  protocol  non-compliant  vaccination  regimens  and  were  excluded  from  the  safety summary. Common Adverse Experiences Injection-Site Adverse Experiences As  noted  in  the  MAA  and  Safety  Update  Report  (SUR)  for  the  Detailed  Safety  Population,  the proportion  of  subjects  reporting  an  injection-site  adverse  experience  within  5  days  after  any vaccination  was  higher  in  subjects  who  received  qHPV  compared  with  subjects  who  received aluminum-containing placebo or non-aluminum-containing placebo. The most common injection-site adverse experiences reported were pain, swelling, and erythema. Systemic Clinical Adverse Experiences As  noted  in  the  MAA  and  SUR  for  the  Detailed  Safety  Population,  the  most  common  reported systemic  clinical  adverse  experiences  determined  by  the  investigator  to  be  vaccine  related  were headache, pyrexia, and nausea.  The proportions of subjects who reported a systemic clinical adverse experience, and the proportions of subjects who reported a vaccine-related systemic clinical adverse experience, were comparable between the two vaccination groups. Death Overall, a total of 18 subjects died at any time during the studies.  Of 11,464 subjects who received at least one dose of qHPV, 11 subjects (0.1%) died.  Of 9686 subjects who received placebo, 7 subjects (0.1%)  died.  None  of  the  deaths  was  considered  placebo  or  procedure  related.  Compared  with  the SUR  data  one  additional  subject  committed  suicide  1177  days  after  completion  of  the  primary vaccination series. No causal relationship between the fatal outcomes and administration of qHPV vaccine was identified. Safety in special populations Pregnancy Outcomes in the Integrated Databases of Phase III Clinical Studies of qHPV Overall,  2832  subjects  experienced  3225  pregnancies  (1396  recipients  of  qHPV  (13.4%)  and  1436 recipients  of  placebo  (15.7%).  The  lower  rate  in  the  qHPV  group  is  likely  due  to  the  higher proportions of 9- to 15-year-old subjects in this group as compared with the placebo group. Among the 3225 pregnancies, outcomes were known for 2652 fetuses/infants (1315 qHPV recipients and 1337 placebo recipients). Since the cut-off date for the original SUR (Safety Update Report) 709 pregnancies  have  been  reported.  The  majority  of  pregnancies  with  unknown  outcomes  were pregnancies that were ongoing at the time of cut-off date. Live births: Cumulatively the proportions of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth were comparable between the vaccination groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Methods of delivery: Cumulatively the proportions of deliveries that were vaginal or by Caesarean section were comparable between the vaccinations groups.

Live-  born  Infants:  The  great  majority  of  live-born  infants  in  both  vaccination  groups  were categorised as normal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Congenital anomalies:

The  proportion  of  live  births  that  resulted  in  congenital  anomalies  was  comparable  between  the vaccination  groups.  Congenital  anomalies  that  occurred  in  the  Phase  III  studies  are  cumulatively listed.  NEW  congenital  anomalies  were  reported  in  10  study  subjects  who  received  qHPV.  These anomalies included cardiac septal defect, congenital pulmonary valve atresia, heart disease congenital, persistent  fetal  circulation,  accessory  auricle,  choanal  atresia,  palpebral  ptosis,  thalassemia  alpha, polydactyly and renal aplasia. Congenital anomalies were reported in 6 children born to subjects who received  placebo.  These  anomalies  included  atrial  septal  defect,  tricuspid  valve  incompetence, ventricular septal defect and persistent fetal circulation, tetralogy of Fallot, anotia, cleft lip and palate and chondrodystrophy.

None of the New congenital anomalies reported were determined by the investigator to be related to study vaccine or placebo. The  CHMP  agrees  that  there  is  no  identified  causal  relationship  between  any  of  the  congenital anomalies and administration of qHPV. ¾ Postmarketing data qHPV was first licensed on 01-June-2006 in Mexico. Two 6-month Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) for qHPV for the periods of 01-June-2006 thru 30-Nov-2006 and for 01-Dec-2006 thru 31May-2007 are complete. Of  the  total  number  of  4586  AE  reports  received  during  this  time  period,  317  (7%)  reports  were considered serious. The majority (3947 or 86%) of reports originated in the United States. The EU SPC has been updated to include Syncope, Dizziness, Nausea, Vomiting, Hypersensitivity reactions  including  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid  reactions,  bronchospasm  and  urticaria    through  the Type II variation II/05 which received an EU Commission Decision on 26 July 2007. In the scope of the current variation, the MAH proposes to update section 4.8 of the EU SPC and section 4.0 of the PL,  with  the  following  adverse  events:  Lymphadenopathy,  Headache and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The decision to include the adverse events Lymphadenopathy, Headache and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) was  made subsequent to the review of the safety profile of the product. Lymphadenopathy A review of the NWARS database for the period 11 September 2006 to 11 April 2007 identified 18 reports of lymphadenopathy temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Three of these reports included positive rechallenges. There were 7 reports with specified unilateral lymphadenopathy.  Four  of  the  7  reports  included  the  time  to  onset  of  lymphadenopathy  post vaccination  3-11  days.  The  remaining  8  reports  involved  4  which  indicated  only  that  the  patients experienced  'swollen  glands'  and  2  reports  which  indicated  experience  of  swollen  lymphnodes  in more than one area. Time to onset was 1-5 days. The remaining reports were confounded by other factors. Headache A review of the NWARS database for the period 11September 2006 to 11 April 2007 identified 62 reports of headache temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Five of these events were assessed  as  serious  and  57  as  non-serious.  Headache  was  most  often  reported  with  nausea  (20) dizziness(20), pyrexia (12), vomiting (6) and myalgia/arthralgia (6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

A  review  of  the  NWARS  database  for  the  period  11  September  2006  to  11-Apr-2007  identified 14 reports of Guillain Barré syndrome temporally associated with the administration of qHPV. Five of the 14 reports included minimal detailed information. However, 2 of the reports included the time to onset of GBS post-vaccination Day 8 and Day 9. One case developed GBS on Day 15 after the second dose of qHPV.  Assessment of seven of the remaining 9 reports was confounded by other plausible factors.  Five  of  7  reports  involved  patients  who  received  concomitant  quadrivalent  meningococcal conjugate vaccine on the same date. Additionally one of these 7 patients has a working diagnosis of GBS, not yet confirmed. Another patient, who received concomitant meningococcal vaccine and had a LP  confirmed  GBS  also  had  MRI  results  showing  an  old  chronic,  subarachnoid  cyst.  Follow-up information on a third patient that received concomitant meningococcal vaccine with EMG strongly positive  for  GBS  revealed  that  the  patients  onset  of  symptoms  preceded  the  vaccination.  The  2 remaining reports including confounding factors involved one case with multiple medical conditions and  one  case  with  a  family  history  of  MS  who  experienced  an  URI  before  onset  of  GBS.  The remaining two reports of GBS included abnormal EMG. The time to onset of GBS post vaccination was provided in 12 of the 14 reports and ranged from 6 to 15 days with a median of 9 days. Half of the cases had confounders. Five of the cases without confounders included little information to make an assessment. Two cases provided sufficient information to assess them as likely cases of GBS. The onset was 9-14  days from vaccination. The cause of GBS remains unknown but may involve a nonspecific stimulus. As the experiences were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not possible to estimate the frequency or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy The MAH revised in section 4.8 the number of cases of non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy: 26 cases (19 in the Silgard group and 7 in the placebo group) reported as any new medical conditions during the follow up of up to four years. The  reports  of  the  19  cases  of  athralgia/arthropathy  in  temporal  relationship  to  administration  of Silgard occurred after 2 months (n=3), 6 months (n=4), 7 months (n=1), 12 months (n=1), 24 months (n=6), 30 months (n=2) and 36 months (n=2.)  The 7 placebo related reports occurred at month 12 (n=1),  month  18  (n=2),  month  24  (n=2)  and  month  36  (n=2).  Adjudication  of  relatedness  and/or causality  was  not  accounted  for  although  considering  that  some  of  these  reactions  might  be  of autoimmune  origin  a  possible relationship can not be excluded. These  reactions should  be continuously monitored and commented on in the future PSURs. Neurological reactions Furthermore, a recent follow-up measure concerned reports on transverse myelitis, leukoencephalitis, optic  neuritis,  diplopia,  vision  blurred,  papilloedema  and  demyelinating  disorders  in  relation  to vaccination  with  qHPV.  The  MAH  provided  updates  and  discussion  of  the  cases  of  these  events. Additional  information  was  received  regarding  16  cases  of  grand  mal  convulsion  and  64  cases  of convulsion.  These  reactions  were  evaluated  within  the  PSUR  3  and  no  changes  to  the  SPC  are required at the moment. Adenopathies Additional analysis on a safety review of cases of adenopathies reported as temporally associated with the administration of Silgard was requested by the CHMP and the results should be presented in the next PSUR.

## Discussion

Overall the post marketing experiences with qHPV has confirmed a favourable safety profile with a low frequency of reported serious adverse experiences. The data reviewed do not include any new or unexpected reports of adverse events.

The MAH proposes to change the term for the adverse reaction of 'bleeding at the injection site' into the MedDRA preferred term \"injection site bruising\" for accuracy.  At the time of the study coding,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bruising  at  the  injection  site  coded  up  to  \"Hemorrhage\"  in  the  MedDRA  system  which  then  was changed to the word \"bleeding\" for the product information. In fact the subjects experienced bruising at  the  injection  site.    The  MedDRA  code  has  now  been  changed  and  injection  site  bruising  is  a preferred term. The CHMP agrees with this change.

The reports above discussed on GBS and Headache support the inclusion of these adverse reactions in the SPC section of Post Marketing experience.

The requested supplementary information has been provided. Additional  safety  information  on  reports  on  lymphadenopathy  was  received  during  the  assessment period. The PSUR 3 (covering period 1/06/2007-30/11/2007) reports on 18 cases of lymphadenopathy temporally  associated  with  vaccination  identified  for  the  period  of  market  introduction  to  11-Apr2007. Three of these reports include positive re-challenge. Because at least 2 of 3 cases of positive rechallenge  were  positive  it  is  considered  biologically  plausible  that  vaccination  could  be  causally associated with lymphadenopathy. This supports the inclusion of lymphadenopathy in section 4.8 of the SPC. The 19 reported cases of arthritis/arthropathy occurred between 2 and 36 months after vaccination although adjudication of relatedness and/or causality was not accounted for. In consideration of that some of  these  reactions  may  be  of  autoimmune  origin  a  possible  relationship  cannot  be  excluded. These cases are also discussed in PSUR 3. The inclusion in the SPC is considered adequate. Regarding the adverse reactions of autoimmune diseases, i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS),  Chron´s  disease  and  autoimmune  thyroiditis  it  is  considered  that  the  occurrence  of  these adverse events will presently not deserve inclusion in the SPC. The majority of autoimmune diseases occurred  12  to  48  months  post  vaccination.  Only  one  case  of  autoimmune  thyroiditis  occurred  in temporal relatedness to vaccination at Month 2. Causality has not been clearly defined in any of these reports.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  continue  close  monitoring  of  all  autoimmune  diseases  and  to present such reports in the future PSURs in cumulative way. A  cumulative  analysis  of  neurologic  adverse  events  was  evaluated  in  PSUR  3.  The  MAH  should continue to monitor these adverse reactions. The safety of the product and the specific adverse events: -Autoimmune disorders -Rheumatological conditions -Non-specific inflammatory reactions -Immunological events -Skin and subcutaneous disorders will continue to be thoroughly monitored through PSURs.

## 1.3 Pharmacovigilance system

## 1.3.1 Risk Management Plan

The MAH has supplied a revised RMP updated with safety data.

The MAH as committed to provide a revised RMP by the next PSUR submission due on 30 July 2008.

1.4 Overall discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment The major objections were resolved as the claims for vulvar and vaginal cancers as well as for VIN 1 and  VaIN  1  were  withdrawn  by  the  MAH.  The  supplementary  data  allowed  for  a  conclusion  that Silgard  is  efficacious  against  HPV  16/18-related  VaIN  2/3,  which  support  the  inclusion  of  this condition in the indication. The recent EU guideline of the EU Commission/IARC on the management of  CIN  1  supported  that  this  low-grade  cervical  lesion  is  a  clinically  relevant  endpoint  requiring clinical  follow-up,  diagnostic  procedures,  and  in  selected  cases,  therapeutic  intervention.  Since  the MAH was requested to simplify the wording of the indication (according to the SPC guideline and to be better  understood by prescribers) to include premalignant genital lesions, the CHMP considered that there was no need to specifically mention CIN 1 in section 4.1. Because of the simplified wording for the therapeutic indication the MAH proposed the addition of an introductory sentence in section 5.1 specifying the type of lesions included in premalignant genital lesions. The CHMP, however, did not  consider  it  applicable  to  CIN  1.  Low-grade  cervical  intraepithelial  lesions  are  not  considered premalignant  and  CIN  1  should  not  be  included  in  the  paragraph  referred  on  section  5.1.  Vaccine efficacy against CIN 1 is already mentioned elsewhere in section 5.1. All other concerns were resolved. Overall the post marketing experiences with qHPV has confirmed a favourable  safety  profile  with  a  low  frequency  of  reported  serious  adverse  experiences.  The  data reviewed do not include any new or unexpected reports of adverse events. The MAH has committed to submit an updated RMP at the time point of the next PSUR addressing some specified safety and post-marketing surveillance issues. In conclusion, the Benefit/Risk ratio for Silgard in the indication for prevention of high-grade vaginal dysplastic lesions (VaIN 2/3) is considered positive. Therefore, the therapeutic indication for Silgard for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 was endorsed by the CHMP.

## 1.5 Changes to the product information

Further to the assessment of the different proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and  in  the  light  of  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data,  the  Product  Information  was  revised  as follows:

## SPC

## Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indication'

## Section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties'

The MAH's initially proposed to extend the approved indication to include protection against vulvar and vaginal cancer, VIN 1, VaIN 1/2/3 and CIN 1. There is sufficient evidence to allow an indication to include protection against VaIN 2/3. The claims for vulvar and VIN 1 and VaIN 1 were not accepted by the CHMP and were withdrawn by the MAH. The CHMP considered that the wording proposed by the MAH including the different endpoint was too complex and could be simplified to be better understood by the prescribers. The MAH´s claim for prevention of 'high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), highgrade  vulvar  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (VIN  2/3)  and  high-grade  vaginal  intraepithelial  neoplasia (VaIN 2/3)' is covered by the broader term of 'premalignant genital lesions' and a description on section 5.1. The  MAH  acknowledges  the  CHMP  position  and  submitted  a  revised  wording  which  was  agreed with, as follows: 'Silgard  is  a  vaccine  for  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and vaginal),  cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).' Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration' The  sentence  on  intravascular,  subcutaneous  and  intradermal  administration  was  reformulated  for clarity. A sentence was introduced to recommend that subjects who receive a first dose of Silgard complete the 3-dose vaccination course with Silgard . Section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' A paragraph was added to inform health care professionals that there no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data is available to support interchangeability of Silgard with other HPV vaccines. Section  4.6 'Pregnancy and lactation' The MAH proposed to update the numbers on pregnant women and cases of congenital anomalies observed. The CHMP agreed with this proposal. Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' For clarity bleeding was replaced by bruising. The numbers of subjects experiencing arthritis/arthropathy were updated. The post marketing experience section was revised to include lymphadenopathy, GBS and headache. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  second  paragraph  on  mechanism  of  action  was  updated  based  on  data  supported  by  literature concerning the percentages of the different diseases/endpoints resulting from HPV infections.

A  paragraph  was  introduced  to  clarify  the  term  \"premalignant  genital  lesions\"  in  section  4.1.  that corresponds to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3) and high-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  MAH  proposed  to  update  the  section  on  clinical  studies  based  on  the  results  of  the  analysis submitted. The CHMP proposed the revision of the text submitted.

Efficacy  results  are  presented  for  the  combined  analysis  of  study  protocols.  The  efficacy  for  HPV 16/18 related CIN 2/3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015. The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015. Results of individual studies support the results from the combined analysis.

Efficacy results are presented for 2- and 3-years results for the main endpoints and for the different relevant populations: subjects naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV type and subjects with and without prior infection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18.

Data  on  Table  3  concerning  Immunogenicity  bridging  between  9-  to  15-year-old  male  and  female subjects and 16- to 26-year-old adult women (per-protocol population) based on titres of antibodies directed against known neutralizing epitopes as measured by cLIA was updated as submitted by the MAH. Annex IIB Annex II was updated concerning the RMP. PL The PL was updated in accordance with the changes proposed to the SPC. The MAH has agreed with the changes as proposed by the CHMP. II. CONCLUSION On 24 April 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet subject to additional follow up measures undertaken.
