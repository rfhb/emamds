Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add administration by subcutaneous (s.c.) route in addition to the intravenous (i.v.) route in treatment of anaemia in patients with chronic renal failure based on clinical study HX575-308 (SENSE) to address MEA 024.1. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet for Abseamed and Binocrit and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.1. Moreover, the updated RMP version 15 has been submitted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 25/02/2016   | 31/03/2016   | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL   | In patients with chronic renal failure where intravenous access is routinely available (haemodialysis patients) administration of Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal by the intravenous route is preferable. Where intravenous access is not readily available (patients not yet undergoing dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients) Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal may be administered as a subcutaneous injection. During the maintenance phase, Abseamed/Binocrit/ Epoetin alfa Hexal can be administered either 3 times per week, and in the case of subcutaneous administration, once weekly or once every 2 weeks. The maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg, 3 times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 20,000 IU) once weekly, or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40,000 IU) once every 2 weeks. Chronic renal failure patients treated with epoetin alfa by the subcutaneous route should be monitored regularly for loss of efficacy, defined as absent or decreased response to epoetin alfa treatment in patients who previously responded to such therapy. This is characterised by a sustained decrease in haemoglobin despite an increase in   |

C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and | 20/01/2011 | 14/03/2011 | Annex II | The requirement of distributing cool boxes with epoetin alfa has been questioned with the main arguments that stability of the product is granted by the label for 3 days out of fridge and that no other MAH of an erythropoiesis- stimulating agent (ESA) bears a similar requirement. The current wording of the cool box requirement can also be misinterpreted as obligation to provide one cool box with each box of epoetin alfa. The requirement has been in place for Abseamed/Binocrit/Epoetin Alfa only as it was suggested by the applicants themselves at the time of marketing authorization. |

While investigations on the cause of PRCA in these cases are still ongoing, the CHMP and Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) considered it important that accurate medication histories are maintained for patients treated with epoetins, recording the trade name or the scientific name with the name of the manufacturer. It is recommended that the product information of all ESAs includes a request to maintain patient medication records. The scope of this variation is to implement the CHMP/PhVWP agreed wording for all erythropoiesis stimulating agents (class labelling) to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet of Abseamed/Binocrit/Epoetin Hexal, as requested by the CHMP.

In addition, severe anaemia caused by non-renal disease can be corrected or alleviated following treatment with epoetin alfa, e.g. in cancer patients on chemotherapy. Response to epoetin alfa in these patients is manifested by increased haematocrit, haemoglobin, reduced transfusion requirements and increase in quality of life. In patients with moderate anaemia undergoing major elective surgery accompanied by considerable blood loss, epoetin alfa can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood in a predonation program. Epoetin alfa treatment was shown to reduce the exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery. An application for a \"Similar Biological Medicinal Product\" via the centralised procedure under Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, also making reference to its Annex 1 was submitted to get marketing approval. The application was based on a comparability concept against the reference medicinal product Erypo® (Janssen- Cilag), as authorized in Germany which has been registered in Europe for more than 10 years.   |

As a result, CHMP requested to update section 4.4 of the SPC to include an additional ESA class warning in the epoetins with cancer indication. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |            | available data from studies that showed an increased risk of tumour progression, venous thromboembolism and shorter overall survival in cancer patients who received epoetins compared to patients who did not receive them. Following this review, the CHMP concluded, at its June 2008 meeting, that the benefits of epoetins continue to outweigh their risks in the approved indications. However, in cancer patients with a reasonably long life-expectancy, the benefit of using epoetins does not outweigh the risk of tumour progression and shorter overall survival and therefore the Committee concluded that in these patients anaemia should be corrected with blood transfusions. The decision to administer epoetin-containing medicines should be based on an informed assessment of the benefits against the risks on individual basis, taking into account the type and stage of tumour, the degree of anaemia, the patient's life- expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being treated and patient preference. As a result, Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet are being updated to reflect these conclusions by incorporating wording requested by CHMP for inclusion for all epoetins for which a cancer indication is   |

The safety review was initiated because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in |

| if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. In addition, minor details in the labelling and the PL have been updated.   |
