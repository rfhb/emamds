registered in the BADBIR register between 01 September 2007 and 31 July 2018. As of the 31st of July 2018, 1811 patients were registered with the etanercept cohort (n=1379, 76%) or have switched to etanercept from another biologic therapy (n=432, 24%), and 5346 patients were registered for the conventional cohort. Patients were recruited into the etanercept cohort from 123 centres across the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

The analyses indicated a significantly increased risk of serious infection (aHR 1.79; 95% CI 1.37,2.33), respiratory (aHR 2.42; 95% CI 1.18, 4.95), cardiac (aHR 1.63; 95% CI 1.04, 2.57), nervous system (aHR 2.18; 95% CI 1.32, 3.61), skin (non-cancer; aHR 1.55; 95% CI 1.07, 2.24) and malignant events (aHR 1.49; 95% CI 1.13, 1.95) for those psoriasis patients currently or previously receiving etanercept. Within these categories, psoriasis patients currently or previously receiving etanercept had a significantly increased risk of pneumonia (aHR 1.68; 95% CI 1.02, 2.77), septicaemia (aHR 2.78; 95% CI 1.21, 6.39), cellulitis (aHR 2.28; 95% CI 1.19, 4.37), other serious infection (aHR 1.93; 95% CI 1.33, 2.79), other cardiac (aHR 1.79; 95% CI 1.06, 3.04), other nervous system (aHR 1.92; 95% CI 1.12, 3.30), skin cancer (aHR 1.75; 95% CI 1.15, 2.66) and solid tumours (aHR 1.52; 95% CI 1.06, 2.19). A greater incidence of pregnancies was reported for female patients receiving etanercept during follow-up when compared to those receiving conventional therapy (aHR 1.93; 95% CI 1.14, 3.26). No other events differed significantly between those receiving conventional therapy and those receiving etanercept.

n/a infections, respiratory, cardiac, nervous system and skin (non-cancer) serious adverse events (SAEs), and malignancies as compared with those exposed to conventional treatment after adjusting for potential confounders. The generalisation and external validity of this study results are limited due to the presence of potential bias, notably confounding by indication.

Overall, these findings are consistent with the known safety profile of etanercept in the treatment of adult psoriasis. These reported risks have been well characterised through the risk management plan and are listed in the product information. No new safety concerns were identified. Overall, the results presented in this application are consistent with previous reported data and do not warrant amendment to the product information.

Out of the 72 patients enrolled in the PURPOSE study, 29 patients (40.4%) patients completed the 5-year follow up period. The main reasons for not completing the follow-up were early discontinuation due to the study ending prior to patient completing 5-year follow-up (27.8%, 20/72) and patients lost to follow-up (15.3%, 11/72).

No serious or opportunistic infections, or malignancies were reported. There were 25 treatment-emergent SAEs, including 7 considered possibly related to etanercept. The most frequent reported SAEs were under the SOC 'Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'. No deaths were reported. The safety data are in line with the known safety profile for etanercept.

Effectiveness of etanercept was evaluated in 32 patients, of whom (87.5%, 28/32) completed a 24-week course of therapy. The reasons for not completing a course of

After adjustment for available confounders, hazard ratios (HR) for stroke were significantly lower in patients treated with Enbrel compared to csDMARDs (on drug: HR=0.5 (95% CI 0.3; 0.9)). No effect of Enbrel on the outcomes of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and incident heart failure was observed. There was no significant association between patients currently exposed (on drug + 3 months risk window) or ever exposed to Enbrel and the risk for overall and first malignancies, lung cancer, lymphoma, malignant melanoma and NMSC. Thus, a reduced risk was seen for breast cancer in the group of Enbrel in the ever exposed analysis HR=0.5 (95% CI 0.2; 0.97)). Furthermore, a nonsignificantly elevated risk of leukaemia was revealed for Enbrel users relative to csDMARD treated patients (ever exposed: HR 1.9 (95% CI 0.7; 5.3)). Mortality risk was significantly reduced in patients currently receiving Enbrel (on-drug plus 3-months risk window: HR=0.6 (95%CI 0.4; 0.8)), but the result did not persist in the ever exposed approach. The spectrum of adverse pregnancy in patients receiving Enbrel did not differ from the other treatment groups. There were low numbers of tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, worsening of heart failure, glioblastoma, cervical cancer and central demyelination, and therefore no adjusted risks for these events were analysed. Results showed a reduced risk for stroke, breast cancer and mortality relative to csDMARD users. In this analysis no association with other safety events, including infections, cardiovascular outcomes and malignancy, were identified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

| WS/1270 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC in order to update the current safety information on pregnancy based on the final results from study B1801396, a non- interventional PASS listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a non-interventional, population- based, multi-country, observational cohort register study to evaluate the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and related inflammatory diseases, who were treated with etanercept compared to patients with the same diseases of interest who were treated with non- biologic systemic drugs, but without etanercept or other biologics during pregnancy, using merged data from Sweden, Denmark and Finland. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority Medicinal product | 17/01/2019 | 04/02/2020 no | SmPC and PL         | The final report for study B1801396, a non-interventional, population-based, multi-country, observational cohort register study using merged data from Sweden, Denmark and Finland, was submitted as part of this variation application. In this observational multi country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to non-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79- 1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for country, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. In total the effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been investigated in two observational cohort studies. Based on all available data, etanercept should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. Section 4.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL have been updated accordingly. longer |

| WS/1261 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Submission of the final report for the Anti-Rheumatic Treatment in Sweden Registry-Etanercept Cohort Study listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This non-interventional PASS aimed at providing an assessment of a number of pre-specified safety outcomes for Enbrel as used in the treatment of RA in Sweden, using data from the ARTIS system, in total and from 2006. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission product | 26/10/2017 no         | The final study report of the Anti-Rheumatic Treatment in Sweden Registry-Etanercept Cohort Study (ARTIS-ETN) Registry provides information on a number of measured outcomes (e.g. primary invasive cancers excluding non- melanoma skin cancers, melanoma, leukaemia, cervical cancer, stroke, fatal cardiovascular event, demyelinating event /MS and all-cause mortality). The results from the ARTIS registry are consistent with the current overall safety profile of etanercept in in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. No new safety concerns were identified. Overall, the results presented in this application are consistent with previous reported data and did not warrant amendment to the product information. |
