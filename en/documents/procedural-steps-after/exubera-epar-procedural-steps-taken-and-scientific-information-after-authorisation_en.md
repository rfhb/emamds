There has also been 1 post- marketing report of a primary lung malignancy in an Exubera-treated patient. All patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer had a prior history of cigarette smoking. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to Exubera. The CHMP requested the MAH to update section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to include the information above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| II/0011 | Update of the section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include a warning regarding pulmonary function in line with the Core Data Sheet (CDS). In addition information on improvement in blister design was added in the Package Leaflet (PL) following the submission of a follow-up measure. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) also took the opportunity to update the annexes in line with the current QRD template version (version 7.2) and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. | 19/07/2007          | product 29/08/2007                       | SPC, Annex II, Labelling, PL     | Across the clinical development program for Exubera, subjects with a baseline FEV1 < 70% predicted were excluded from participation within the studies. The rationale for this exclusion criteria was based on the MAH's initial goal of fully characterising the effect of Exubera therapy on the lung of patients with relatively normal lung function prior to studying Exubera in patients with lung processes such as asthma or COPD. This guidance has therefore been incorporated into the CDS. In line with the CDS the following warning has been included in Section 4.4 of the SPC under the sub heading \"Decline in pulmonary function\". All patients initiated on EXUBERA should have a baseline lung function examination (e.g. spirometry to measure FEV1). The efficacy and safety of inhaled human insulin in patients with baseline FEV1 < 70% predicted have not been established and the use of inhaled human insulin in this population is not recommended. A follow-up lung function measurement is recommended |
