## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1 NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Valdoxan 25 mg film-coated tablets

## 2 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 25 mg of agomelatine.

## Excipient with known effect

Each film-coated tablet contains 61.8 mg lactose (as monohydrate)

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet (tablet).

Orange-yellow, oblong, 9.5 mm long, 5.1 mm wide film-coated tablet.

## 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Valdoxan is indicated for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended dose is 25 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime.

After two weeks of treatment, if there is no improvement of symptoms, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, i.e. two 25 mg tablets, taken together at bedtime.

Decision of dose increase has to be balanced with a higher risk of transaminases elevation. Any dose increase to 50 mg should be made on an individual patient benefit/risk basis and with strict respect of Liver Function Test monitoring.

Liver function tests should be performed in all patients before starting treatment. Treatment should not be initiated if transaminases exceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

During treatment transaminases should be monitored  periodically after around three weeks, six weeks (end of acute phase), twelve weeks and twenty four weeks (end of maintenance phase) and thereafter when clinically  indicated  (see  also  section  4.4).  Treatment  should  be  discontinued  if  transaminases exceed 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

When increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same frequency as when initiating treatment.

## Treatment duration

Patients with depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that they are free of symptoms.

## Switching therapy from SSRI/SNRI antidepressant to agomelatine

Patients may experience discontinuation symptoms after cessation from an SSRI/ SNRI antidepressant. The SmPC of the actual SSRI/SNRI should be consulted on how to withdraw the treatment to avoid this. Agomelatine can be started immediately while tapering the dosage of a SSRI//SNRI (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment discontinuation

No dosage tapering is needed on treatment discontinuation.

## Special populations

## Elderly

The efficacy and safety of agomelatine (25 to 50mg/day) have been established in elderly depressed patients (&lt; 75years). No effect is documented in patients ≥75 years . Therefore, agomelatine should not be used by patients in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). No dose adjustment is required in relation to age (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No  relevant  modification  in  agomelatine  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  patients  with  severe  renal impairment  has  been  observed.  However,  only  limited  clinical  data  on  the  use  of  agomelatine  in depressed  patients  with  severe  or  moderate  renal  impairment  with  major  depressive  episodes  is available. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine to these patients.

## Hepatic impairment

Agomelatine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population Children from birth to &lt;7 years

There is  no  relevant  use  of  agomelatine  in  children  from  birth  to &lt;7 years  for  treatment  of  major depressive episodes. No data are available.

Children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years

The safety and efficacy of agomelatine in children and adolescents aged from 7 to 17 years for treatment of  major  depressive  episodes  have  not  been  established.  Currently  available  data  are  described  in sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

## For oral use.

Valdoxan film-coated tablets may be taken with or without food.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Hepatic impairment (i.e. cirrhosis or active liver disease) or transaminases exceeding 3 X upper limit of normal (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Concomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Monitoring of liver function

Cases of liver injury, including hepatic failure (few cases were exceptionally reported with fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors), elevations of liver enzymes exceeding 10 times  upper  limit  of  normal,  hepatitis  and  jaundice  have  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with agomelatine in  the post-marketing  setting  (see  section  4.8).  Most  of  them  occurred  during  the  first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage is predominantly hepatocellular with increased serum transaminases, which usually return to normal levels on cessation of agomelatine.

Caution should be exercised before starting treatment and close surveillance should be performed throughout  the  treatment  period  in  all  patients,  especially  if  hepatic  injury  risk  factors  or concomitant medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury are present .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Before starting treatment

Treatment with Valdoxan should only be prescribed after careful consideration of benefit and risk in patients with hepatic injury risk factors e.g.:

- -obesity/overweight/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes
- -alcohol use disorder and /or substantial alcohol intake

and in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury. Baseline liver function tests should be undertaken in all patients and treatment should not be initiated in patients with baseline values of ALT and/or AST &gt;3 X upper limit of normal (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised when Valdoxan is administered to patients with pretreatment elevated transaminases (&gt; the upper limit of the normal ranges and ≤ 3 times the upper limit of the normal range).

- Frequency of liver function tests
- before starting treatment
- and then:
- -after around 3 weeks,
- -after around 6 weeks (end of acute phase),
- -after around 12 and 24 weeks (end of maintenance phase),
- -and thereafter when clinically indicated.
- -When increasing the dosage, liver function tests should again be performed at the same frequency as when initiating treatment.

Any patient who develops increased serum transaminases should have his/her liver function tests repeated within 48 hours.

## During treatment period

Valdoxan treatment should be discontinued immediately if:

- -patient  develops  symptoms  or  signs  of  potential  liver  injury  (such  as  dark  urine,  light coloured stools, yellow skin/eyes, pain in the upper right belly, sustained new-onset and unexplained fatigue).
- -the increase in serum transaminases exceeds 3 X upper limit of normal.

Following  discontinuation  of  Valdoxan  therapy  liver  function  tests  should  be  repeated  until  serum transaminases return to normal.

## Paediatric population

Valdoxan is not recommended in the treatment of depression in patients under 18 years of age since safety  and  efficacy  of  agomelatine  have  not  been  established.  In  clinical  trials  among  children  and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts),  and  hostility  (predominantly  aggression,  oppositional  behaviour  and  anger)  were  more frequently observed compared to those treated with placebo.

For agomelatine reported suicidal events were too few to make any meaningful comparison between agomelatine and placebo. Pooled data from clinical trials with agomelatine 25 mg have shown that suicidal  events  occurred  at  a  higher  frequency  in  adolescents  (3.1%)  compared  to  adults  (1.2%), seesection on Suicide/suicidal thoughts below and section 4.8.

In pooled data from clinical trials hepatic adverse events were more frequently reported by adolescents (6.3%) compared to adults (1.7%).

Long-term safety data is limited. This includes long-term experience on growth, pubertal development (see section 5.1) and cognitive function.

## Elderly

No effect of agomelatine is documented in patients ≥75 years, therefore agomelatine should not be used by patients in this age group (see also sections 4.2 and 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Use in elderly with dementia

Valdoxan should not be used for the treatment of major depressive episodes in elderly patients with dementia since the safety and efficacy of Valdoxan have not been established in these patients.

## Bipolar disorder/ mania / hypomania

Valdoxan should be used with caution in patients with a history of bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania and should be discontinued if a patient develops manic symptoms (see section 4.8).

## Suicide/suicidal thoughts

Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suiciderelated events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during  the  first  few  weeks  or  more  of  treatment,  patients  should  be  closely  monitored  until  such improvement occurs. It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery.

Patients  with  a  history  of  suicide-related  events  or  those  exhibiting  a  significant  degree  of  suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of placebocontrolled  clinical  trials  of  antidepressants  in  adult  patients  with  psychiatric  disorders  showed  an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo, in patients less than 25 years old.

Close supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment especially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.

## Combination with CYP1A2 inhibitors (see sections 4.3 and 4.5)

Caution  should  be  exercised when  prescribing  Valdoxan  with moderate  CYP1A2  inhibitors  ( e.g. propranolol, enoxacin) which may result in increased exposure of agomelatine.

## Lactose intolerance

Valdoxan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

## Level of sodium

Valdoxan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Potential interactions affecting agomelatine

Agomelatine is metabolised mainly by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (90%) and by CYP2C9/19 (10%).  Medicinal  products  that  interact  with  these  isoenzymes  may  decrease  or  increase  the bioavailability of agomelatine.

Fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor markedly inhibits the metabolism of agomelatine resulting in a 60-fold (range 12-412) increase of agomelatine exposure.

Consequently,  co-administration  of  Valdoxan  with  potent  CYP1A2  inhibitors  (e.g.  fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated.

Combination of agomelatine with oestrogens (moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors) results in a several fold increased exposure of agomelatine. While there was no specific safety signal in the 800 patients treated in combination with oestrogens, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine with other

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. propranolol, enoxacin) until more experience has been gained (see section 4.4).

Rifampicin an inducer of all three cytochromes involved in the metabolism of agomelatine may decrease the bioavailability of agomelatine.

Smoking  induces  CYP1A2  and  has  been  shown  to  decrease  the  bioavailability  of  agomelatine, especially in heavy smokers (&gt; 15 cigarettes/day) (see section 5.2).

## Potential for agomelatine to affect other medicinal products

In vivo ,  agomelatine does not induce CYP450 isoenzymes. Agomelatine inhibits neither CYP1A2 in vivo nor  the  other  CYP450 in  vitro .  Therefore,  agomelatine  will  not  modify  exposure  to  medicinal products metabolised by CYP 450.

## Other medicinal products

No evidence of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with medicinal products which could be prescribed concomitantly with Valdoxan in the target population was found in phase I clinical trials: benzodiazepines, lithium, paroxetine, fluconazole and theophylline.

## Alcohol

The combination of agomelatine and alcohol is not advisable.

## Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

There is no experience of concurrent use of agomelatine with ECT. Animal studies have not shown proconvulsant  properties  (see  section  5.3).  Therefore,  clinical  consequences  of  ECT  performed concomitantly with agomelatine treatment, are considered to be unlikely.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of agomelatine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure , it is preferable to avoid the use of Valdoxan during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether agomelatine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of agomelatine/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether  to  discontinue  breast-feeding  or  to  discontinue/abstain  from  Valdoxan  therapy  taking  into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

Reproduction studies in the rat and the rabbit showed no effect of agomelatine on fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Agomelatine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.Considering that dizziness and somnolence are common adverse reactions, patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive or operate machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate and occurred within the first two weeks of treatment. The most common adverse reactions were headache, nausea and dizziness.

These adverse reactions were usually transient and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The below table gives the adverse reactions observed from adult placebo-controlled and adult activecontrolled clinical trials.

Adverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The frequencies have not been corrected for placebo.

* Frequency estimated from clinical trials for adverse reactions detected from spontaneous report (1) Few cases were exceptionally reported with fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients with hepatic risk factors.

## Paediatric population

A total of 80 children aged 7 to less than 12 years old and 319 adolescent patients aged between 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were treated with agomelatine in a doubleblind, active (fluoxetine) and placebo-controlled study.

In general, the safety profile of agomelatine 25 mg in adolescents in the pivotal study (double-blind controlled part) was similar to that seen in adults, except for nausea which occurred at a higher frequency in adolescents (13.3%) than in adults (6.3%).

Pooled data from clinical trials with agomelatine have shown that adverse events and serious adverse events (all-causality) were reported with higher frequency in the adolescents than in the adults (67.2% vs 60.4% of patients who reported at least one adverse event and 10.4% versus 3.5% of the patients  who reported at least one serious adverse event).

Hepatic adverse events were reported by 6.3% of adolescents compared to adults (1.7%). Suicidal events (for instance suicidal behavior, suicide thoughts, suicide attempt and self-injury) occurred at a higher frequency in adolescents (3.1%, 10 events reported in 6 patients) compared to adults (1.2%, 66 events reported in 65 patients) (see section 4.4.).

Long-term  safety  data  for  agomelatine  25  mg  in  adolescents  is  limited.  This  includes  long-term experience on growth, pubertal development (see section 5.1) and cognitive function.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

## Symptoms

There is limited experience with agomelatine overdose. Experience with agomelatine in overdose has indicated  that  epigastralgia,  somnolence,  fatigue,  agitation,  anxiety,  tension,  dizziness,  cyanosis  or malaise have been reported.

One person having ingested 2,450 mg agomelatine, recovered spontaneously without cardiovascular and biological abnormalities.

## Management

No specific antidotes for agomelatine are known. Management of overdose should consist of treatment of  clinical  symptoms  and  routine  monitoring.  Medical  follow-up  in  a  specialised  environment  is recommended.

## 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics, other antidepressants, ATC-code: N06AX22

## Mechanism of action

Agomelatine is a melatonergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 5-HT2C antagonist. Binding studies indicate  that  agomelatine  has  no  effect  on  monoamine  uptake  and  no  affinity  for α , β adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors.

Agomelatine  resynchronises  circadian  rhythms  in  animal  models  of  circadian  rhythm  disruption. Agomelatine increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex and has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Agomelatine  has  shown  an  antidepressant-like  effect  in  animal  models  of  depression  (learned helplessness  test,  despair  test,  chronic  mild  stress)  as  well  as  in  models  with  circadian  rhythm desynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety.

In humans, agomelatine has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline and melatonin onset.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in adults

The efficacy and safety of agomelatine in major depressive episodes have been studied in a clinical programme including 7,900 patients treated with agomelatine.

Ten placebo controlled trials have been performed to investigate the short term efficacy of agomelatine in major depressive disorder in adults, with fixed dose and/or dose up-titration. At the end of treatment (over 6 or 8 weeks), significant efficacy of agomelatine 25-50 mg was demonstrated in 6 out of the ten short-term double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Primary endpoint was change in HAMD-17 score from baseline. Agomelatine failed to differentiate from placebo in two trials where the active control, paroxetine  or  fluoxetine  showed  assay  sensitivity.  Agomelatine  was  not  compared  directly  with paroxetine and fluoxetine as these comparators where added in order to ensure assay sensitivity of the trials.  In  two  other  trials,  it  was  not  possible  to  draw  any  conclusions  because  the  active  controls,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paroxetine  or  fluoxetine,  failed  to  differentiate  from  placebo.  However,  in  these  studies  it  was  not allowed to increase the start dose of either agomelatine, paroxetine or fluoxetine even if the response was not adequate.

Efficacy was also observed in more severely depressed patients (baseline HAM-D ≥ 25) in all positive placebo-controlled trials.

Response rates were statistically significantly higher with agomelatine compared with placebo.

Superiority (2 trials) or non-inferiority (4 trials) has been shown in six out of seven efficacy trials in heterogeneous  populations  of  depressed  adult  patients  versus  SSRI/SNRI  (sertraline,  escitalopram, fluoxetine, venlafaxine or duloxetine) The anti-depressive effect was assessed with the HAMD-17 score either as primary or secondary endpoint.

The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse prevention trial. Patients responding to 8/10-weeks of acute treatment with open-label agomelatine 25-50 mg once daily were randomised to either agomelatine 25-50 mg once daily or placebo for further 6-months. Agomelatine 25-50 mg  once  daily  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  superiority  compared  to placebo (p=0.0001) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as measured by time to relapse. The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow up period was 22% and 47% for agomelatine and placebo, respectively.

Agomelatine does not alter daytime vigilance and memory in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment with agomelatine 25 mg increased slow wave sleep without modification of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine 25 mg also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.

In  a  specific  sexual  dysfunction  comparative  trial  with  remitted  depressed  patients,  there  was  a numerical trend (not statistically significant) towards less sexual emergent dysfunction than venlafaxine for Sex Effects Scale (SEXFX) drive arousal or orgasm scores on agomelatine. The pooled analysis of trials using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) showed that agomelatine was not associated with sexual dysfunction. In healthy volunteers agomelatine preserved sexual function in comparison with paroxetine.

## Agomelatine had neutral effect on heart rate and blood pressure in clinical trials.

In  a  trial  designed  to  assess  discontinuation  symptoms  by  the  Discontinuation  Emergent  Signs  and Symptoms  (DESS)  check-list  in  patients  with  remitted  depression,  agomelatine  did  not  induce discontinuation syndrome after abrupt treatment cessation.

Agomelatine  has  no  abuse  potential  as  measured  in  healthy  volunteer  studies  on  a  specific  visual analogue scale or the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) 49 check-list.

A placebo-controlled 8-week trial of agomelatine 2550mg/day in elderly depressed patients (≥ 65 years, N=222, of which 151 on agomelatine) demonstrated a statistically significant difference of 2.67 points on  HAM-D  total  score,  the  primary  outcome.  Responder  rate  analysis  favoured  agomelatine.  No improvement was observed in very elderly patients (≥75 years, N= 69, of which 48 on agomelatine) . Tolerability of agomelatine in elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults.

A specific  controlled,  3-week  trial  has  been  conducted  in  patients  suffering  from  major  depressive disorder and insufficiently improved with paroxetine (a SSRI) or venlafaxine (a SNRI). When treatment was switched from these antidepressants to agomelatine, discontinuation symptoms arose after cessation of  the  SSRI  or  SNRI  treatment,  either  after  abrupt  cessation  or  gradual  cessation  of  the  previous treatment.  These  discontinuation  symptoms  may  be  confounded  with  a  lack  of  early  benefit  of agomelatine.

The percentage of patients with at least one discontinuation symptom one week after the SSRI/SNRI treatment stop, was lower in the long tapering group (gradual cessation of the previous SSRI/SNRI within 2 weeks) than in the short tapering group (gradual cessation of the previous SSRI/SNRI within 1 week) and in the abrupt substitution group (abrupt cessation): 56.1%, 62.6 % and 79.8% respectively.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The efficacy and safety of two doses (10 mg and 25 mg) of agomelatine for the treatment of moderate to severe major depressive episodes, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy alone, were assessed in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, parallel groups, study (see section 4.2).  Fluoxetine (10 mg/day with potential adjustment to 20 mg/day) was added to ensure assay sensitivity.

Patients (N=400; whereof 80 children from 7 to less than 12 years and 320 adolescents from 12 to 17 years)  with  moderate  to  severe  depression  according  to  DSM  IV  were  randomised  to  receive agomelatine 10 mg (N=102 whereof 81 were adolescents), agomelatine 25 mg (N= 95 whereof 76 were adolescents), placebo (N= 103 whereof 82 were adolescents) and fluoxetine (N= 100 whereof 81 were adolescents).

The patients were to be non-responders to psychosocial therapy before inclusion. During the doubleblind period psychosocial counselling was given once a month (Week 4, 8 and 12).

The primary endpoint was the adjusted difference in baseline to Week 12 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R) raw total score, using a 3way ANCOVA. A raw score of ≥ 45 was a prerequisite for enrolment. The CDRS-R was performed at the selection visit, at inclusion (Week 0) and thereafter at each visit (i.e., in the double-blind period: Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12).

Main secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  Clinical  Global  Impression  -  Severity  of  Illness  (CGI-S), Improvement (CGI-I) scales and Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS) total score.

The majority of the patients in the overall population were female (62.5%) with a median age of 14.0 years (range: 7, 17). Most of the patients had their first episode of depression (71.5%). According to DSM-IV-TR criteria the episode was diagnosed as moderate for 61.8% and severe (without psychotic features) for 38.3%. The mean duration of current episode was 143.4 ± 153.2 days with a median of 96.0 days (range from 29 to 1463 days).

Regarding comorbidities, around 6% patients in the overall population had generalised anxiety disorder, 7% had social anxiety disorder and 2% separation anxiety disorder.

The results for the primary endpoint CDRS-R raw score expressed in terms of change from baseline to last  post-baseline  value  for  the  overall  population  showed  a  difference  between  agomelatine  25  mg compared to placebo of 4.22; 95%CI [0.63 ; 7.82] . For the adolescent subset the estimated betweengroup difference was 5.22 ; 95%CI [1.03; 9.40] for agomelatine 25 mg compared to placebo.

For the secondary endpoints Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales no statistically significant differences were observed between any of the groups. The mean difference between the agomelatine 25 mg group and the placebo group in ADRS-score was 4.07, 95% CI [0.68; 7.46].

After  the  12-week  double-blind  period,  patients  could  continue  in  an  optional  open-label  21-month extension period at a agomelatine dose of 10 or 25 mg. However, this period was not designed as a relapse-prevention study and all patients received flexible doses of agomelatine. Useful data on efficacy and safety beyond 12 weeks are therefore limited.

Pubertal status was assessed by Tanner stage. Although data are limited, they do not suggest an impact of agomelatine on Tanner stage development (see section 4.8).

For further information on safety, please refer to sections 4.4 and 4.8.

There is only limited data on safety and efficacy in the children subgroup (age range from 711 years; in total 80 patients) due to a very limited number of patients (see section 4.2). In the children, the change in the mean CDRS-R raw total score at the end of the short term phase was lower in absolute value in the agomelatine 25 mg group (-17.1 ± 13.3) than in the placebo group (-19.0 ± 18.3).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption and bioavailability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Agomelatine is rapidly and well ( ≥ 80%) absorbed after oral administration. Absolute bioavailability is low (&lt; 5% at the therapeutic oral dose) and the interindividual variability is substantial. The bioavailability is increased in women compared to men. The bioavailability is increased by intake of oral contraceptives and reduced by smoking. The peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 to 2 hours.

In the therapeutic dose-range, agomelatine systemic exposure increases proportionally with dose. At higher doses, a saturation of the first-pass effect occurs.

Food intake (standard meal or high fat meal) does not modify the bioavailability or the absorption rate. The variability is increased with high fat food.

## Distribution

Steady state volume of distribution is about 35 l and plasma protein binding is 95% irrespective of the concentration and is not modified with age and in patients with renal impairment but the free fraction is doubled in patients with hepatic impairment.

## Biotransformation

Following  oral  administration,  agomelatine  is  rapidly  metabolised  mainly  via  hepatic  CYP1A2; CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes are also involved but with a low contribution.

The  major  metabolites,  hydroxylated  and  demethylated  agomelatine,  are  not  active  and  are  rapidly conjugated and eliminated in the urine.

## Elimination

Elimination is rapid, the mean plasma half-life is between 1 and 2 hours and the clearance is high (about 1,100 ml/min) and essentially metabolic.

Excretion  is  mainly  (80%)  urinary  and  in  the  form  of  metabolites,  whereas  unchanged  compound recovery in urine is negligible.

Kinetics are not modified after repeated administration.

## Renal impairment

No relevant modification of pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has been observed (n=8, single dose of 25 mg), but caution should be exercised in patients with severe or moderate renal impairment as only limited clinical data are available in these patients (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

In  a  specific  study  involving  cirrhotic  patients  with  chronic  mild  (Child-Pugh  type  A)  or  moderate (Child-Pugh type B) liver impairment, exposure to agomelatine 25 mg was substantially increased (70times and 140-times, respectively), compared to matched volunteers (age, weight and smoking habit) with no liver failure (see section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).

## Elderly

In a pharmacokinetic study in elderly patients (≥ 65 years), it was showed that at a dose of 25 mg the mean AUC and mean Cmax were about 4-fold and 13-fold higher for patients ≥ 75 years old compared to  patients  &lt;  75  years  old.  The  total  number  of  patients  receiving  50  mg  was  too  low  to  draw  any conclusions. No dose adaptation is required in elderly patients.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of agomelatine was investigated in 60 children and 166 adolescents receiving daily doses ranging from 1 to 25 mg. Most data derive from saliva concentration measurements, and plasma exposure of agomelatine in the paediatric population is to a large extent uncharacterised. As in adults, the inter-individual variability in agomelatine PK is substantial. The available paediatric data suggest  a  considerable  overlap  with  the  observed  exposure  range  in  adults  following  a  25  mg agomelatine dose.

## Ethnic groups

There is no data on the influence of race on agomelatine pharmacokinetics.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

In mice, rats and monkeys sedative effects were observed after single and repeated administration at high doses.

In rodents, a marked induction of CYP2B and a moderate induction of CYP1A and CYP3A were seen from  125 mg/kg/day  whereas  in  monkeys  the  induction  was  slight  for  CYP2B  and  CYP3A  at 375 mg/kg/day. No hepatotoxicity was observed in rodents and monkeys in the repeat dose toxicity studies.

Agomelatine passes into the placenta and foetuses of pregnant rats.

Reproduction studies in the rat and the rabbit showed no effect of agomelatine on fertility, embryofoetal development and pre- and post natal development.

A battery of in vitro and in vivo standard genotoxicity assays concludes to no mutagenic or clastogenic potential of agomelatine.

In carcinogenicity studies agomelatine induced an increase in the incidence of liver tumours in the rat and the mouse , at a dose at least 110-fold higher than the therapeutic dose. Liver tumours are most likely related  to  enzyme  induction  specific  to  rodents.  The  frequency  of  benign  mammary  fibroadenomas observed in the rat was increased with high exposures (60-fold the exposure at the therapeutic dose) but remains in the range of that of controls.

Safety pharmacology studies showed no effect of agomelatine on hERG (human Ether à-go-go Related Gene)  current  or  on  dog  Purkinje  cells  action  potential.  Agomelatine  did  not  show  proconvulsive properties at ip doses up to 128 mg/kg in mice and rats.

No  effect  of  agomelatine  on  juvenile  animals  behavioural  performances,  visual  and  reproductive function were observed. There were mild non dose dependent decreases in body weight related to the pharmacological properties and some minor effects on male reproductive tract without any impairment on reproductive performances.

## 1. What Valdoxan is and what it is used for

Valdoxan  contains  the  active  ingredient  agomelatine.  It  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines  called antidepressants. You have been given Valdoxan to treat your depression. Valdoxan is used in adults.

Depression  is  a  continuing  disturbance  of  mood  that  interferes  with  everyday  life.  The  symptoms  of depression vary from one person to another, but often include deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, loss of interest in favourite activities, sleep disturbances, feeling of being slowed down, feelings of anxiety, changes in weight.

The  expected  benefits  of  Valdoxan  are  to  reduce  and  gradually  remove  the  symptoms  related  to  your depression.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Valdoxan

## Do not take Valdoxan

- -if you are allergic to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- -if your liver does not work properly (hepatic impairment).
- -if you are taking fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression) or ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).

## Warnings and precautions

There could be some reasons why Valdoxan may not be suitable for you:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -If you are taking medicines known to affect the liver. Ask your doctor for advice on which medicine that is.
- -If you are obese or overweight, ask your doctor for advice.
- -If you are diabetic, ask your doctor for advice.
- -If you have increased levels of liver enzymes before treatment, your doctor will decide if Valdoxan is right for you.
- -If you have bipolar disorder, have experienced or if you develop manic symptoms (a period of abnormally high excitability and emotions) talk to your doctor before you start taking this medicine or before you continue with this medicine (see also under ' Possible side effects ' in section 4).
- -If you are suffering from dementia, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is right for you to take Valdoxan.

## During your treatment with Valdoxan :

What to do to avoid potential serious liver problems

- -Your doctor should have checked that your liver is working properly before starting the treatment . Some patients may get increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment with Valdoxan.  Therefore follow-up tests should take place at the following time points:

|             | before initiation or dose increase   | around 3 weeks   | around 6 weeks   | around 12 weeks   | around 24 weeks   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Blood tests |                                     |                 |                 |                  |                  |

Based on the evaluation of these tests your doctor will decide whether you should receive or continue using Valdoxan (see also under ' How to take Valdoxan ' in section 3).

Be vigilant about signs and symptoms that your liver may not be working properly

- -If you observe any of these signs and symptoms of liver problems: unusual darkening of the urine, light coloured stools, yellow skin/eyes, pain in the upper right belly, unusual fatigue (especially associated with other symptoms listed above), seek urgent advice from a doctor who may advise you to stop taking Valdoxan.

Effect of Valdoxan is not documented in patients aged 75 years and older. Valdoxan should therefore not be used in these patients.

## Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression

If  you  are  depressed  you  can  sometimes  have  thoughts  of  harming  or  killing  yourself.  These  may  be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.

You may be more likely to think like this:

- if you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself.
- if you are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in  young  adults  (aged  less  than  25  years)  with  psychiatric  conditions  who  were  being  treated  with  an antidepressant.

If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour.

## Children and adolescents

Valdoxan is not recommended in children below 7 years due to lack of information. No data is available. Valdoxan should not be used in children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years because safety and efficacy have not been established.

## Other medicines and Valdoxan

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

You should not take Valdoxan together with certain medicines (see also under ' Do not take Valdoxan ' in section 2): fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression), ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) can modify the expected dose of agomelatine in your blood.

Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: propranolol (a beta-blocker used in the treatment of hypertension), enoxacin (antibiotic)

Make sure to tell your doctor if you are smoking more than 15 cigarettes/day.

## Valdoxan with alcohol

It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated with Valdoxan.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

Breastfeeding should be discontinued if you take Valdoxan.

## Driving and using machines

You might experience dizziness or sleepiness which could affect your ability to drive or operate machines. Make sure that your reactions are normal before driving or operating machines.

## Valdoxan contains lactose

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

## Valdoxan contains sodium

Valdoxan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to take Valdoxan

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

The recommended dose of Valdoxan is one tablet (25 mg) at bedtime. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose (50 mg), i.e. two tablets to be taken together at bedtime.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

Valdoxan is for oral use. You should swallow your tablet with a drink of water. Valdoxan can be taken with or without food.

## Duration of treatment

Valdoxan starts to act on symptoms of depression in most depressed people within two weeks of starting treatment.

Your depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that you are free of symptoms.

Your doctor may continue to give you Valdoxan when you are feeling better to prevent your depression from returning.

If you have trouble with your kidneys, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is safe for you to take Valdoxan.

## Surveillance of the liver function (see also section 2):

Your doctor will run laboratory tests to check that your liver is working properly before starting treatment and then periodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

If your doctor increase the dose to 50mg, laboratory tests should be performed at this initiation and then periodically during treatment, usually after 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Thereafter tests will be taken if the doctor finds it necessary.

You must not use Valdoxan if your liver does not work properly.

## How to switch from an antidepressant medicine (SSRI/SNRI) to Valdoxan?

If your doctor changes your previous antidepressant medicine from an SSRI or SNRI to Valdoxan, he/she will advise you on how you should discontinue your previous medicine when starting Valdoxan.

You may experience discontinuation symptoms related to stopping of your previous medicine for a few weeks, even if the dose of your previous antidepressant medicine is decreased gradually.

Discontinuation symptoms  include:  dizziness, numbness,  sleep disturbances, agitation or anxiety, headaches, feeling sick, being sick and shaking. These effects are usually mild to moderate and disappear spontaneously within a few days.

If  Valdoxan  is  initiated  while  tapering  the  dosage  of  the  previous  medicine,  possible  discontinuation symptoms should not be confounded with a lack of early effect of Valdoxan.

You should discuss with your doctor on the best way of stopping your previous antidepressant medicine when starting Valdoxan.

## If you take more Valdoxan than you should

If you have taken more Valdoxan than you should, or if for example a child has taken medicine by accident, contact your doctor immediately.

The experience of overdoses with Valdoxan is limited but reported symptoms include pain in the upper part of the stomach, somnolence, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, tension, dizziness, cyanosis or malaise.

## If you forget to take Valdoxan

Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Just carry on with the next dose at the usual time. The calendar printed on the blister containing the tablets should help you remembering when you last took a tablet of Valdoxan.

## If you stop taking Valdoxan

Do not stop taking your medicine without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better.

If you have any further questions on the use of this product, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.
