Focetria should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. 4.2 Posology and method of administration The dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies in healthy subjects. Posology Adults (18-60 years): Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Elderly (&gt;60 years):

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Children aged 6 months to 35 months:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

There is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three weeks.

## Children aged less than 6 months:

No data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Vaccination is not currently recommended in this age group.

It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination course with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). The use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. See section 4.4 for special warnings and special precautions for use. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to residues (eggs and chicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.

Focetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.

There are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

Cases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from epilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience convulsion. (See section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

In the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Focetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on co-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to Focetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory.

## Fertility

Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to administration of Focetria alone. The same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. Therefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). There are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Safety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third trimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large observational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. Further, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. Health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine to pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. Breast-feeding Focetria may be administered to lactating women. Medicinal product no longer authorised

An animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

##  Clinical trials

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: Very common (  1/10), Common (  1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon (  1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), Rare (  1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), Very rare (&lt;1/10,000).

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

Muscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Very common: myalgia Common: arthralgia

Adult and Elderly In a clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 µg Focetria. The safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions were mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. Very common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue In clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects were exposed to the mock-up vaccines. Most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first. Adverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. Nervous system disorders Very common: headache Rare: convulsions Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: sweating Uncommon: urticaria Rare: eye swelling Medicinal product no longer authorised

Gastrointestinal disorders Common: nausea

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Very common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site redness, fatigue, malaise and shivering Common: injection site ecchymosis and fever Uncommon: influenza like illness Rare: anaphylaxis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.

## Paediatric population

Children and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age

## Clinical trials with Focetria H1N1v

Safety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation.

Adverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children and adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows:

## Posology

## Adults (18-60 years):

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly (&gt;60 years):

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents aged 3-17 years:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

Children aged 6 months to 35 months: One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. There is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three weeks. Children aged less than 6 months: No data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Vaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination course with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). The use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. See section 4.4. for special warnings and special precautions for use. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues (eggs and chicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)).

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

Immunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Focetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.

There are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

Cases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. The majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in subjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from epilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience convulsion. (See section 4.8).

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). In the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Focetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on co-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to Focetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory. Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to administration of Focetria alone. The same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. Therefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). There are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1(HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1 have been observed. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Medicinal product no longer authorised

Safety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third trimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large observational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy. Further, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. Health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine to pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations.

## Breast-feeding

Focetria may be administered to lactacting women.

## Fertility

An animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

##  Clinical trials

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: Very common (  1/10),

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

Common: sweating

Uncommon: urticaria

Rare: eye swelling

Muscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Very common: myalgia Common: arthralgia

Gastrointestinal disorders Common: nausea

Common (  1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon (  1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), Rare (  1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), Very rare (&lt;1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: Adults and elderly In clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 µg Focetria. The safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions were mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. Very common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue In clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects were exposed to the candidate vaccine. Most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first. Adverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. Nervous system disorders Very common: headache Rare: convulsions Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## General disorders and administration site conditions

Very common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site redness, fatigue, malaise and shivering

Common: injection site ecchymosis and fever

Uncommon: influenza like illness

Rare: anaphylaxis

The common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.

## Paediatric population

Children and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age

Clinical trials with Focetria H1N1v Safety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety profile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation. Adverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children and adolescents 9-17 years old, receiving the 7.5 µg formulation were reported as follows: Data in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second dose, with no increase in rates of fever. Very common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: Pain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.

## Other medicines and Focetria

## 3. How FOCETRIA is given

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescriptionor have recently been given any other vaccine. Focetria can be given at the same time as non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, with injections made into separate limbs. There is no information on administration of the vaccine Focetria with any other vaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant. You should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive Focetria taking into consideration official recommendation based on post-marketing reported adverse events during second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. Driving and using machines Some effects mentioned under section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines. Focetria contains This vaccine in a multi-dose vial contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. This medicinal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per 0.5 ml dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium free. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Your doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. The vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).

## Adults

A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. Clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Elderly:

A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine and a second dose of 0.5 ml at least three weeks later.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Use in children and adolescents

## Children and adolescents 3-17 years of age:

You or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine.

Available clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Children 6 months to 35 months:

You or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

Children aged less than 6 months of age: Vaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. When Focetria is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Focetria (and not another vaccine against H1N1v) be given for the complete vaccination course. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, Focetria can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. In the clinical studies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. The side-effects are generally similar to those related to the seasonal flu vaccine. The side effects listed below have occurred with Focetria in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly: Very common (affects more than 1 user in 10): Pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, injection site swelling, pain at the site of injection, aching muscles, headache, sweating, fatigue, generally feeling unwell and shivering Common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): Bruising of the skin at the injection site, fever and nausea Uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000): Flu like symptoms Rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): Convulsion, eye swelling and anaphylaxis Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

These side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR.

## Side effects from clinical studies in children

A clinical study was conducted with the same vaccine in children. General side effects reported very commonly in the 6 months-35 months of age group per dose were irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. Among the adolescents the very common events were: sweating, nausea and chills. Very commonly reported reactions in both children and adolescents were pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, generally feeling unwell, muscle ache, headache and fatigue.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other side effects

The side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with Focetria.

Generalised skin reactions including itching, urticaria (hives), rash or swelling of the skin and mucous membranes.

Disorders of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting.

Neurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, tingling, fits, and neuritis (inflammation of nerves).

Swollen lymph nodes, palpitations, weakness, pain in the extremities and cough.

Allergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases.

Data in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second dose of the vaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. In addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. These side effects may occur with Focetria. Rare: Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising. Very rare: Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems), exudative erythema multiforme. Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), and a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 5.

ANNEX IV SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS RECOMMENDING THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Focetria, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

Based on the findings of an observational study conducted in &gt;2000 pregnant women, reflecting the use of Focetria in pregnant women, influenza A (H1N1) vaccination with Focetria does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Therefore, the relevant SmPC wording currently stating the limited availability of clinical data in pregnant women, is recommended to be changed to reflect the newly available information.

Therefore, in view of available data regarding the use of Focetria during pregnancy, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

<!-- image -->

Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Focetria, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance influenza vaccine h1n1v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. Medicinal product no longer authorised
