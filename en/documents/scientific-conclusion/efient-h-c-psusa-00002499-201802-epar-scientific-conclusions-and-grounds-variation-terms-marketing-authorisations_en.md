## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

Data from trials with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients and healthy individuals showed overall delayed and reduced effect of and/or decreased exposure of prasugrel in the first two hours following co-administration of morphine at the same time. The interaction disappeared within 1 day. Similar results have been seen with other P2Y12 inhibitors. The proposed mechanism of this interaction is that opioid delays gastric ventricular emptying and thus reduces absorption of prasugrel. This is a well-known effect of morphine, however this interaction is considered clinically relevant, as analgesic treatment with morphine and inhibition of platelet function with, for example, P2Y12 inhibitors may be used in acute myocardial infarction. Some of the above studies suggested that intravenous drugs may be necessary if morphine is administered and fast P2Y12 inhibition is considered crucial. Based on the data presented, update of section 4.5 in the SmPC for prasugrel is considered relevant.
