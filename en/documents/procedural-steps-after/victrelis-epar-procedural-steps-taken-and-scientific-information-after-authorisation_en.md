Within 3 years post-therapy, 73% (228/314) of subjects no longer had any RAVs detected by population sequencing (detection limit ~20-25% of the total virus population), with a median time for all RAVs to become undetectable of 1.11 years. However, no data are available regarding the efficacy of boceprevir among patients who previously failed treatment with a boceprevir-containing regimen, and the long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of boceprevir RAVs is unknown. The long-term follow-up data also confirmed the durability of viral suppression, with >99% of patients maintaining their SVR through the available follow-up period (median duration of 3.4 years). longer authorised |

| II/0019   | Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC with information on anaemia and neutropenia, resulting from a post hoc analysis of clinical trial data on anaemia and clinical observations on neutropenia and its monitoring by blood counts. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 19/09/2013 product | 17/02/2014 no | SmPC        | Based on a post hoc analysis of clinical trial data on anaemia and clinical observations on neutropenia the MAH proposed to revise the recommendations regarding monitoring of these two adverse reactions in section 4.4 of the SmPC. For anaemia, since the observed time-to-onset of anaemia from initiation of treatment ranged from of 15-337 days with a median of 71 days, the MAH proposed two additional complete blood counts, at treatment week 2 and 12. For neutropenia, in clinical trials a rapid decline in neutrophil count was observed as early as treatment week 2, with neutrophil counts stabilising after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy. The MAH thus proposed that neutropenia should be monitored at the same time as anaemia, i.e. pre- treatment, at treatment weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, and at other time points as clinically appropriate, by complete blood counts with white blood cell differential counts. These recommendations for reinforced monitoring were supported by the CHMP. longer |

Based on the results of these studies, the CHMP concluded that no dose adjustment was required when raltegravir or rilpivirine are co-administered with boceprevir. However, since the clinical relevance of the observed decrease in boceprevir C8hr during co-administration with raltegravir has not been established, increased clinical/laboratory monitoring are warranted when boceprevir and raltegravir are co-administered. For sirolimus, data showed a marked increase in sirolimus exposure following concomitant administration of multiple doses of boceprevir. Therefore co-administration of boceprevir with sirolimus requires significant dose reduction and prolongation of the dosing interval for sirolimus, with close monitoring of sirolimus blood concentrations and frequent assessments of renal function and sirolimus-related side effects.   |

As in HCV-monoinfected patients, addition of boceprevir to PR significantly increased the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. The SVR24 rate was 62.5%, confirming that with a more potent tritherapy regimen HCV/HIV-coinfected patients can achieve a comparable response rate to HCV- monoinfected patients.

Since boceprevir increases exposure to atorvastatin by >2-fold, the maximum daily dose of atorvastatin during co-administration was limited to 20 mg, to ensure the resulting exposure during co- administration does not exceed the exposure following the maximum recommended daily atorvastatin dose in the absence of boceprevir (80 mg). |

The CHMP therefore concluded that the decrease in EE exposure is not expected to be clinically relevant, and that coadministration with boceprevir is unlikely to alter the effectiveness of the tested COC. However, in view of the reduced exposure to EE the CHMP recommended clinical monitoring for signs of oestrogen deficiency in patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The MAH has performed six studies to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between boceprevir and methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, omeprazole, etravirine, raltegravir, digoxin and prednisone. All studies were adequately performed and the effect of boceprevir on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the respective compounds (and vice versa if investigated) was included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that no dose adjustment was required when any of the above-listed compounds are coadministered with Victrelis.

| II/0006 | In fulfilment of the obligation \"The MAH should provide results of study P06086 to further substantiate the impact of the management of anaemia on the efficacy and safety of therapy with Victrelis. The results of the Study P06086 will be submitted by April 2012\" sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated based on the results from this study. Annex II was updated accordingly and was also brought in line with the latest QRD template. Minor editorial changes to section 4.8 of the SmPC were also introduced. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data product | SmPC and Annex II Study P06086 was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ribavirin dose reduction versus erythropoietin (EPO) as primary anaemia management strategies in adult subjects with previously untreated chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection who become anaemic (serum haemoglobin ≤10 g/dl) during tritherapy with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Both anaemia management strategies resulted in comparable efficacy with sustained virologic response (SVR) 24 rates of 71.5% in Arm 1 (ribavirin dose reduction) and 70.9% in Arm 2 (EPO use). The safety profile was comparable between Arm 1 and 2 and was consistent with the known safety profile of tritherapy. However, the use of EPO was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. These data dispel the concerns towards a negative impact of ribavirin dose reduction on the treatment response. Given the safety issues associated with EPO use, the SmPC was amended to clarify that ribavirin dose reduction is the preferred strategy for managing treatment-emergent longer |

A correction was made in Section 5.2 of the SmPC. The PL was updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/11/2012 | 03/09/2013 | SmPC and PL | Study PROVIDE (P05514) is an on-going open-label, single- arm study of Victrelis in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 1 infection who did not achieve Sustained Virological Response (SVR). The interim SVR analysis is based on 85% of subjects enrolled. Most of the subjects who were null responders (50/52) are included in the interim analysis. The SVR rate was 38% (19/50) in subjects who were null responders and received at least one dose of any study medication. The CHMP concluded that the benefit of BOC in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in treating prior null responders has been demonstrated in study P05514 (PROVIDE) and agreed to the deletion of the warning in section 4.4 and the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with new information from this study. longer |

| II/0005 | Update of section 4.3 of the SmPC with a new contraindication with simvastatin and lovastatin and section 4.5 of the SmPC with information on interactions with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin. The PL is updated in accordance. Change to section 4.6 of the SmPC with new information on contraceptive measures and to section 5.1 of the SmPC with updated information on resistance were also introduced. Changes were also made to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL to bring it in line with the current QRD template. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands and Portugal. In addition, translation mistakes were corrected in the product information for all EU languages. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data product | 21/06/2012 | 31/07/2012 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Following the completion of a Drug-Drug Interaction study (P08124) characterizing the pharmacokinetic interactions between Victrelis and cyclosporine, tacrolimus, escitalopram, atorvastatin and pravastatin, section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated with new information on these interactions. Victrelis pharmcokinetics were not significantly altered by cyclosporine or tacrolimus. The concomitant administration of Victrelis and cyclosporine led to significant changes in cyclosporine pharmacokinetics (Cmax increased by 101% and AUC by 168%). Cyclosporine half-life was increased from 11 to 16h and tacrolimus half-life from 37 to 62h. The AUC and Cmax of tacrolimus increased in an even more substantial manner (Cmax increases by 890% and AUC by 1610%) when combined with Victrelis. The results obtained with these immunosuppressants were extrapolated to sirolimus. Therefore, similar recommendations for all compounds are made in the SmPC: dose adjustment with close monitoring of concentration, renal function and side effects to all immunosuppressants. Victrelis pharmcokinetics were not significantly altered by escitalopram. On the other hand, escitalopram exposure and Cmax were reduced by 21% and 19% respectively, when coadministered with Victrelis. No dose adjustment of escitalopram when given together with Victrelis is recommended; however, doses of escitalopram may need to be adjusted based on clinical effect. Victrelis significantly increased the exposure (AUC by 130% and Cmax by 166%) of atorvastatin. In line with these findings, dose reduction of atorvastatin should be longer authorised |

Additional clinical monitoring is recommended when daily doses of atorvastatin exceed 40 mg. The exposure of pravastatin is increased when co- administered with Victrelis (AUC by 63% and Cmax by 49%). Pravastatin did not affect the exposure of Victrelis. In line with these findings, treatment with pravastatin can be initiated at the recommended dose when co- administered with Victrelis. However, close clinical monitoring is warranted. Moreover, a new contraindication for co-administration of Victrelis with simvastatin and lovastatin has been introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| II/0004 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC with information on interaction with boosted protease inhibitors. Annex II.B and the PL were proposed to be updated in accordance. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 16/02/2012 21/03/2012 SmPC, Annex II and PL product no longer | A drug interaction study in healthy volunteers carried out by the marketing authorisation holder of Victrelis, found that blood levels of all three HIV medicines were markedly lower than expected when given with Victrelis. It also found that blood levels of Victrelis were markedly lower than expected when given with ritonavir-boosted darunavir or lopinavir, although this effect was not seen with ritonavir- boosted atazanavir. The Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the lower blood levels seen in the drug interaction study could mean that the medicines are less effective when given together to patients who are co-infected with HCV and HIV. However, the Committee acknowledged that data from ongoing clinical studies in co- infected patients are needed to assess the clinical impact of these drug-interaction findings on these patients. Studies on the efficacy and safety of Victrelis when used in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV are ongoing. |

Co-administration of Victrelis with ritonavir- boosted darunavir or lopinavir in HIV and HCV co-infected patients is not recommended. Co-administration of Victrelis with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir may be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients with suppressed HIV viral loads and with an HIV strain without any suspected resistance to the HIV regimen. Increased clinical and laboratory monitoring is warranted.   |
