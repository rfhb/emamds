## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Iclusig, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

The PRAC reviewed a new safety analysis submitted with the PSUR, which was based on additional data from the pivotal trials, providing updated incidences of adverse reactions reported with ponatinib, and showing that updated frequency categories for a number of adverse reactions already labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC and relevant section of the Package Leaflet needed revisions. Consequently, an increase in the frequency category was proposed for: upper respiratory tract infection, insomnia, dizziness, eyelid oedema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, dermatitis exfoliative, muscle spasms, pain.

Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Iclusig, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance PONATINIB is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
